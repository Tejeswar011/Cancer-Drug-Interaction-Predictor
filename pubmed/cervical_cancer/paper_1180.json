Introduction Lung cancer is the most diagnosed and deadliest cancer worldwide. According to GLOBOCAN (a cancer observatory maintained by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which compiles and standardizes international cancer incidence, prevalence, and mortality data) 2020, there were approximately 2.2 million new lung cancer cases (11.4%) and 1.8 million deaths (18%) reported worldwide [ 1 2 Figure 1 Traditional lung cancer treatments, such as surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted drug therapies, have improved over time [ 3 4 5 3 6 A noteworthy area of interest is the possible role of human papillomavirus (HPV) in lung cancer development, especially among non-smokers. HPV is mainly known for infecting mucosal tissues in the mouth, throat, and genital areas. HPV is primarily known for its causal role in cervical cancer, where the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 inactivate key tumor suppressors such as p53 and Rb. Similar mechanisms are well documented in the development of anogenital and head-and-neck cancers, and these parallels suggest that HPV-driven molecular pathways may also contribute to lung carcinogenesis. Researchers suggest it may play a role in lung cancer, although its exact contribution is still being studied [ 7 8 9 2. Epidemiology and Risk Factors of Lung Cancer Lung cancer is the one of the most diagnosed cancers worldwide and the leading cause of cancer-related death. It accounted for about 13% of all new cancer cases in 2020 [ 1 10 11 12 13 Tobacco smoking has long been known as the main risk factor, accounting for over 80% of lung cancer cases each year [ 14 15 12 16 17 18 19 20 Occupational and environmental exposures also significantly raise lung cancer risk. For example, exposure to asbestos alone increases the risk of developing lung cancer by about 3 to 10 times, a risk that rises dramatically when combined with cigarette smoking—over a 50-fold increase in some studies [ 21 22 23 8 9 7 24 Controversies and Limitations of Current Evidence Although multiple studies have reported a significant association between high-risk HPV infection and lung cancer, particularly in non-smokers, it remains unclear whether HPV plays a causative role. Detection of HPV DNA or proteins in tumor samples may reflect correlation rather than direct oncogenic involvement. Confounding factors, such as geographic differences, sample contamination, and methodological variability, complicate interpretation. Furthermore, the relatively low prevalence of HPV-positive lung cancers compared to cervical and head-and-neck cancers suggests that HPV may act as a co-factor rather than a primary driver. Future studies employing standardized assays and large, multicenter cohorts are required to clarify whether HPV is causally involved in lung carcinogenesis or merely associated with disease in certain populations. 3. Molecular Classification and Pathogenesis Lung cancer falls into two main categories: non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Each category has different molecular and clinical profiles. NSCLC makes up about 85% of lung cancers and has three main subtypes: lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lung squamous-cell carcinoma (LUSC), and large-cell carcinoma (LCC). SCLC accounts for the remaining 15%. It is known for rapid progression, high potential to spread, and neuroendocrine characteristics [ 25 26 27 High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types, particularly HPV-16 and HPV-18, have been implicated in lung carcinogenesis through the expression of oncoproteins E6 and E7. These proteins inactivate key tumor suppressors such as p53 and Rb, promoting uncontrolled cell proliferation and genomic instability. Figure 2 3.1. SCLC vs. NSCLC Subtypes (LUAD, LUSC, LCC) LUAD usually develops in the outer regions of the lung and is the most common type among non-smokers. It is often linked to mutations in EGFR, KRAS, ALK, BRAF, and MET. LUSC is found in the center of the lung and is strongly associated with smoking; it shows changes in TP53, PIK3CA, CDKN2A, and SOX2. LCC is a diagnosis made when other types are excluded; it represents undifferentiated tumors lacking glandular or squamous features. This type has a high mutation rate but few mutations that can be targeted [ 28 29 30 3.2. Genetic Mutations and Immune Evasion Mechanisms The mutation patterns in LUAD and LUSC greatly affect tumor biology and treatment options. Immune exclusion refers to a tumor immune evasion strategy where immune cells, particularly cytotoxic T lymphocytes, are physically prevented from infiltrating the tumor parenchyma, often due to stromal barriers, abnormal vasculature, or immunosuppressive cells within the tumor microenvironment. In LUAD, EGFR mutations are linked to immune exclusion and a lower tumor mutation burden (TMB), which leads to a reduced response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) [ 31 32 33 4. Immunotherapy in Lung Cancer Lung cancer treatment relies on a combination of traditional and emerging modalities, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and cancer vaccines. As shown in Figure 3 Immunotherapy has greatly changed the treatment options for lung cancer, especially non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It offers better survival rates and lasting responses in certain patient groups. Among the different immunotherapy approaches, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that target programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), its ligand PD-L1, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and the recently studied lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) have shown significant effectiveness [ 34 35 36 37 Figure 4 In addition to checkpoint blockers, other immunotherapy methods are gaining popularity. These include chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy, cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells, and combination therapies that use different immune-boosting agents together. CAR-T cell therapy, while previously studied mainly in blood cancers, is being explored for solid tumors like lung cancer. However, challenges such as suppression in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and differences in tumor antigens remain [ 38 39 40 41 42 Immunotherapy is a groundbreaking approach in treating lung cancer, with ICIs being a central part of current clinical practices. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors have transformed lung cancer treatment, they are associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including pneumonitis, colitis, dermatitis, and endocrinopathies. These off-target toxicities distinguish immunotherapy from chemotherapy and targeted therapies, highlighting the importance of biomarkers that can predict not only treatment response but also toxicity risk. Table 1 5. Cancer Vaccines in Lung Cancer 5.1. Traditional and Neoantigen-Based Vaccines Cancer vaccines have traditionally targeted infectious diseases. Recently, they were being adapted to stimulate immune responses against cancer. Early therapeutic cancer vaccines focused on tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), which are self-proteins overexpressed in tumors. However, these vaccines often failed to trigger effective new T cell responses because of immune tolerance mechanisms [ 47 48 49 49 50 In addition to TME challenges, several other factors limit vaccine performance. Tumor fibroblasts, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and a thick extracellular matrix hinder T cell infiltration [ 50 51 Table 2 5.2. Nucleic Acid Vaccines Nucleic acid vaccines use mRNA or DNA that encode tumor antigens, which host cells take up and translate in the body. mRNA vaccines allow for quick development and strong immune response, making them ideal for personalized neoantigen strategies or general use [ 60 61 40 62 63 64 65 66 5.3. Peptide-Based Cancer Vaccines Peptide vaccines generally consist of 20–30 amino acids that represent TAAs or TSAs, including neoantigens or cancer/testis antigens. These peptides are designed to trigger both CD8⁺ and CD4⁺ T cell responses via MHC class I and II presentation [ 67 68 69 5.4. Bacterial Ghost-Based Cancer Vaccine Bacterial ghosts (BGs) are empty bacterial cell envelopes generated by genetic engineering or chemical methods. They maintain the native surface antigens and structural integrity of bacteria but are devoid of cytoplasmic contents, making them a promising platform for safe and immunogenic antigen delivery. BGs can be engineered to carry tumor-associated antigens or adjuvants and have shown efficacy in preclinical models for inducing strong Th1-skewed immune responses, activating antigen-presenting cells, and promoting cytotoxic T cell activation. Given their intrinsic adjuvanticity and ability to mimic pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), BG-based vaccines are particularly promising for lung cancer immunotherapy. While research is still emerging, recent studies have explored their application in mucosal immunization and intratumoral delivery in lung and colorectal cancer models. Many probiotic bacteria are also used for bacteria-based cancer vaccines. Their use could complement existing cancer vaccine strategies by enhancing innate and adaptive immune activation with minimal systemic toxicity [ 53 70 Peptide vaccines, killed virus, and BGs primarily promote antigen-specific CD4⁺ T helper responses and CD8⁺ expansion with cytokine secretion. True cytotoxic activity requires endogenous antigen synthesis (e.g., live virus, mRNA, DNA vaccines). Therefore, BGs and peptide vaccines serve more as immune modulators than direct inducers of cytotoxic clearance. While bacterial ghosts and peptide vaccines can induce CD8⁺ T cell expansion and IFN-γ secretion, these responses may not translate into direct cytotoxic activity against tumor cells unless combined with antigen delivery strategies that support endogenous processing. 6. Vaccine Adjuvants for Enhancing Cancer Immunity The effectiveness of cancer vaccines relies not just on choosing tumor-specific antigens but also on having suitable adjuvants that can enhance and guide the immune response. Adjuvants improve the immunogenicity of vaccines by stimulating antigen-presenting cells (APCs), promoting antigen uptake, and initiating both innate and adaptive immunity. This section categorizes vaccine adjuvants into traditional and emerging classes, summarizing how they work and their clinical relevance in cancer immunotherapy. 6.1. Traditional Adjuvants: TLR Agonists, Aluminum Salts, Poly-ICLC Conventional adjuvants have formed the basis for many immunotherapies. Among the most used are toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, aluminum-based compounds, and synthetic double-stranded RNA analogs like polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid stabilized with polylysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly-ICLC). These substances mainly work by activating pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), signaling the immune system to respond to perceived threats [ 71 72 6.2. Emerging Adjuvants: STING Agonists, CD40, Cytokines, and Inorganic Nanoparticles Recent studies have discovered a new generation of adjuvants that could overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and enhance antigen presentation. These include STING agonists, CD40 agonists, immune-boosting cytokines (e.g., GM-CSF), and engineered inorganic nanoparticles. STING (stimulator of interferon genes) agonists are a promising group of adjuvants that activate strong type I interferon responses through cytosolic DNA sensing pathways. Natural cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) and synthetic derivatives such as cyclic GMP–AMP (cGAMP) have shown success in activating antitumor immunity through STING-mediated signaling [ 73 74 75 CD40 agonists stimulate DCs and B cells, improving antigen processing and cross-presentation. Although they were initially studied as standalone treatments, CD40 ligands have shown better results when combined with TLR agonists in preclinical vaccine models [ 67 76 77 78 79 Inorganic nanoparticles, such as titanium dioxide (TiO 2 2 80 81 82 83 84 85 6.3. Clinical and Preclinical Findings Many adjuvants have shown promise in preclinical models, but translating these results into human use remains difficult. Challenges include concerns about toxicity, differences in immune responses, and limited information on long-term safety. GM-CSF is still used in clinical trials, despite its mixed results [ 86 7. Imidazoquinolines (IMDs) as Cancer Immunomodulators 7.1. Mechanisms: TLR7/8 Activation Imidazoquinolines (IMDs) are a class of synthetic small-molecule agonists that activate toll-like receptors 7 and 8 (TLR7/8), which are localized in endosomal compartments of innate immune cells. Upon activation, these receptors trigger a MyD88-dependent signaling cascade involving IRAK1/4 and TRAF6, culminating in the activation of NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), as well as interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) [ 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 7.2. FDA-Approved Agents: Imiquimod and Resiquimod The first FDA-approved IMD was imiquimod (R837), licensed in 1997 for the topical treatment of genital and perianal warts, actinic keratosis, and later, superficial basal-cell carcinoma [ 94 95 96 95 7.3. Applications as Vaccine Adjuvants and Topical Immunotherapies IMDs such as imiquimod and resiquimod are increasingly used as vaccine adjuvants, particularly in therapeutic cancer vaccines. More than 100 clinical trials have explored their role as immune potentiators in vaccines for cancer (e.g., dendritic cell-based immunizations), infectious diseases (e.g., hepatitis B), and respiratory illnesses (e.g., influenza) [ 97 95 98 7.4. Future Directions and Clinical Integration Despite their promising effects on the immune system, the use of IMDs in the whole body is still limited due to the risk of cytokine storms and other inflammatory reactions. Future strategies focus on localized delivery systems, like nanoformulations or injections directly into tumors, to improve effectiveness while reducing side effects [ 96 Table 3 95 8. Future Perspectives and Research Directions 8.1. Personalized Neoantigen Vaccines and Immunotherapy Personalized cancer immunotherapy, especially through neoantigen-based vaccination strategies, has quickly moved from concept to early clinical practice. These methods, particularly when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors, are creating new possibilities for cancer treatment. As this area develops, future research will likely focus on refining and broadening four key areas: personalized vaccine strategies, combinations of different immunotherapies, integrating virology with oncology, and developing predictive biomarkers to guide treatment. Table 4 Personalized cancer vaccines are designed to take advantage of tumor diversity by targeting patient-specific neoantigens that arise from non-synonymous mutations [ 99 100 Clinical data show that neoantigen vaccines are feasible and can provoke immune responses across multiple tumor types. For example, the KEYNOTE-942 trial showed that the mRNA-4157 vaccine from Moderna and Merck, used alongside pembrolizumab, led to a 44% decrease in melanoma recurrence compared to checkpoint blockade used alone [ 101 4+ 8+ 102 Future work on vaccine strategies will involve improving neoantigen prediction algorithms by using multiomics data and machine learning. Additionally, researchers will optimize delivery methods, such as lipid nanoparticles and viral vectors, while working to lower the time and cost of making individualized vaccines. Progress in RNA technology, including self-amplifying mRNA and circular RNA platforms, could enhance antigen expression and reduce dosage needs, which may improve effectiveness and accessibility [ 103 8.2. Multi-Modal Immunotherapy Combinations A promising future direction is combining neoantigen vaccines with other immunotherapies. Checkpoint inhibitors, like anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, help T cell function by preventing exhaustion. When used alongside personalized vaccines, these agents show synergistic effects. Vaccines expand the antigen-specific T cell pool while checkpoint inhibitors sustain their activity [ 104 In addition to checkpoint inhibitors, combining neoantigen vaccines with adoptive T cell therapies, such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells or tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), is gaining interest. Vaccine priming might improve the efficacy of infused T cells by broadening the pool of relevant antigen-specific clones. Oncolytic viruses, which specifically target tumor cells, can increase local inflammation and antigen presentation, acting as additional vaccine boosters [ 105 Timing will be crucial for the success of these combinations. Research suggests that administering vaccines before or at the same time as checkpoint inhibitors may maximize effectiveness. A delayed administration of checkpoint inhibitors could reduce their synergistic effect due to early T cell exhaustion [ 106 8.3. Integrating Virology and Oncology Another emerging focus is to combine virology with personalized immunotherapy. Virus-related cancers, such as cervical cancer (HPV), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (EBV), and Merkel cell carcinoma (polyomavirus), provide additional targets through viral oncoproteins. These viral antigens make ideal immunologic targets, since they are foreign and highly conserved, allowing for both personalized and semi-universal vaccine designs [ 107 Moreover, researchers are considering viral vectors as delivery vehicles for neoantigen vaccines. Their strong ability to provoke immune responses and infect antigen-presenting cells is beneficial [ 105 100 8.4. Predictive Biomarkers and Precision Approaches A vital future focus is identifying and validating biomarkers that predict which patients will benefit the most from neoantigen vaccine therapies. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) has often served as a measure of neoantigen load, but it varies across different tumor types and individual patients [ 106 Other potential biomarkers include the clonality of neoantigens, MHC-binding affinity scores, CD 8+ 108 100 Advances in spatial transcriptomics and multiplexed immunohistochemistry allow researchers to map immune cells and neo-antigen expression within the tumor microenvironment. These technologies can help customize vaccine design by selecting antigens from regions rich in immune cells while steering clear of areas lacking immune activity [ 105 While cancer vaccines have focused largely on host-derived neoantigens and tumor-associated antigens, HPV represents a distinct viral target in a subset of lung cancers. HPV-targeted vaccines remain largely unexplored for lung cancer, but preclinical studies suggest that vaccines targeting HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins may enhance antitumor immunity in HPV-positive lung tumors. Translation to the clinic is limited by the relatively low prevalence of HPV-positive lung cancers and the lack of standardized diagnostic assays. Nevertheless, lessons from successful HPV-targeted vaccines in cervical and head-and-neck cancers provide a foundation for developing lung cancer vaccines aimed at viral causes. Future strategies may involve combination regimens that integrate HPV vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors or novel adjuvants to increase efficacy. Ultimately, the aim is to create integrated biomarker models combining genomic, proteomic, and immunologic data using machine learning algorithms. These models will assist in choosing patients, formulating vaccines, and planning combination strategies. They will enable real-time adjustments to immunotherapy regimens based on changes in tumors, creating a truly dynamic precision oncology environment. The future of cancer immunotherapy is in merging personalized neoantigen vaccines with multi-modal strategies, viral immunology, and precise biomarker frameworks. As clinical experiences increase and technology improves, we expect better access, enhanced outcomes, and adaptive treatment models to emerge. By focusing on refining antigen prediction, validating combination therapies, and expanding biomarker-guided strategies, the field is set to provide effective immunotherapy to more patients. 9. Conclusions Lung cancer continues to be one of the most challenging malignancies to treat, largely due to its late-stage diagnosis, molecular heterogeneity, and complex immune evasion mechanisms. The advent of immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, has revolutionized the therapeutic landscape and significantly improved outcomes for a subset of patients. However, treatment resistance, limited biomarker precision, and variability in response highlight the need for more refined and innovative approaches. Therapeutic cancer vaccines represent a promising adjunct to existing immunotherapies, aiming to generate durable and antigen-specific immune responses. Among these, platforms such as mRNA, DNA, dendritic cell, and bacterial ghost-based vaccines are under active investigation, each offering unique immunogenic and logistical advantages. Notably, emerging evidence implicates high-risk HPV in the pathogenesis of lung cancer, particularly among non-smoking individuals, suggesting a potential new avenue for HPV-targeted therapeutic strategies. Future research must focus on optimizing vaccine delivery, identifying reliable predictive biomarkers, and integrating immunotherapy with conventional and targeted treatments. Platforms like bacterial ghosts also present an exciting frontier, offering both antigen presentation and innate immune activation in a single system. While BGs represent a novel avenue for vaccine delivery and immunomodulation, their safety and efficacy should be validated in preclinical and clinical settings. Moreover, reliable biomarkers are essential for predicting response and toxicity to immunotherapies, enabling more precise patient selection in biomarker discovery. Overall, the integration of immunotherapy, vaccine science, and virology holds the key to more personalized, effective, and long-lasting treatments for lung cancer. Continued exploration and clinical translation of these strategies are essential to advancing the next generation of lung cancer therapeutics.

Lung cancer remains the primary burden in new cancer cases among all other cancers. Figure 2 Mechanism of HPV-mediated lung cancer. The figure outlines how high-risk HPV infects lung epithelial cells and expresses E6 and E7 oncoproteins, which disrupt p53 and Rb tumor suppressor pathways. This leads to genomic instability, uncontrolled proliferation, and progression through various stages of tumor development, ultimately resulting in metastasis. Figure 3 Comprehensive overview of treatment modalities for cancer. Figure 4 Mechanisms of immunotherapy in lung cancer. Checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, and anti-CTLA-4, reactivate exhausted T cells by blocking inhibitory immune checkpoints. This enhances cytotoxic T cell function and promotes tumor cell elimination within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. vaccines-13-00957-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Challenges in immunotherapy and solutions along with ongoing clinical trials.
