This case highlights the severity of disseminated coccidioidomycosis presentations and barriers to timely diagnosis in such cases, particularly in the absence of preceding respiratory symptoms. The patient’s favorable response to initial amphotericin B followed by oral azole therapy underscores the importance of early, aggressive antifungal treatment. Beyond this clinical presentation, the report provides a comprehensive review of the disease’s risk factors, diagnostic challenges, and current management strategies. Recognition of this infection’s potential severity, along with a nuanced understanding of its clinical and epidemiologic features, is essential for improving outcomes in affected populations. coccidioides coccidioidomycosis coccidioidomycosis abscesses coccidioidomycosis osteomyelitis coccidioidomycosis young adult male disseminated coccidioidomycosis skeletal coccidioidomycosis soft tissue infections coccidioidomycosis pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Coccidioidomycosis, also known as San Joaquin Valley fever, is caused by the asexual, dimorphic fungi Coccidioides immitis Coccidioides posadasii 1 Respiratory Coccidioides 2 3 3 4 The onset of symptoms may be delayed for up to 21 days following exposure to spores, which complicates timely diagnosis and early intervention [ 2 Case presentation A 27-year-old male presented to the emergency department following transfer from a local emergency department due to multiple painful bone lesions and abscesses. He was transferred to this hospital for workup of suspected metastatic disease with concurrent acute abscess management. The patient reported a remote hospitalization in his home country of Micronesia for an illness consistent with dengue fever. Otherwise, he had no significant past medical history. He denied any personal or family history of cancer. The patient denied tobacco, alcohol, or drug use, and he tested negative for sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Prior to arrival at the local emergency department, he received multiple courses of outpatient antibiotics, including doxycycline and metronidazole. Upon presentation to the local emergency department prior to transfer, he received intravenous vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ivermectin, fluids, and antipyretics. On physical examination, he was cachectic but alert and oriented to time, person, and place. The patient was afebrile and hemodynamically stable, though tachycardic with a heart rate of 122 beats per minute. Multiple abscesses were observed on physical exam in areas over the zygomatic arch, right occipital region, and cervical spine. CT imaging reports from the previous local emergency department showed lytic lesions involving the cervical spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which were concerning for metastatic disease. The neurologic examination was unremarkable, with no focal deficits, and there was no organomegaly. There was right supraclavicular lymphadenopathy on palpation. Relevant labs on admission are shown in Table 1 Table 1 Patient’s lab findings on presentation WBC: white blood cell Lab Value Reference range WBC (10^9/L) 12.0 4-11 Hemoglobin (g/dL) 8.3 13.4-17.4 Platelets (10^9/L) 653 150-440 Hematocrit (%) 29.0 40-54 Sodium (mEq/L) 137 134-146 Potassium (mEq/L) 3.1 3.5-5 Bicarbonate (mEq/L) 24 24-31 Creatine (mEq/L) 0.6 0.5-1.5 Glucose (mg/L) 109 60-100 Anti-nuclear antibodies Positive <1:40 Anti-Smith antibodies Positive <1:40 Abnormalities were observed diffusely throughout the body on imaging; as a result, the following figures demonstrate the best representations of notable pathological findings, but they do not encompass all abnormal findings, given the widespread dissemination of the disease.

Rheumatology was consulted, and a workup revealed positive antinuclear antibodies and anti-Smith antibodies, raising concern for systemic lupus erythematosus; however, this was ruled out, and these serology findings were attributed to infection-related immune activation. Given the imaging findings, disseminated infection or metastatic malignancy was initially suspected. A biopsy of a right pelvic bone lesion revealed mold-like fungal organisms. Serum testing specific to Coccidioides Coccidioides The patient was started on intravenous amphotericin B and oral fluconazole, after which they began showing marked clinical improvement. Surgical intervention for abscess drainage in various regions was considered but ultimately deferred, given the patient’s robust response to the antifungal medications and the risk of complications like sinus tracts or fistulas from draining a Coccidioides Discussion This case illustrates a severe case of coccidioidomycosis in a young adult male residing in an endemic region, whose disease course was complicated by widespread fungal dissemination, primarily to the skeletal system. Dissemination is a rare complication following initial respiratory coccidioidomycosis, occurring in approximately 0.5% to 2% of reported cases [ 3 4 The CNS and skeletal system are among the most common sites of dissemination, with a study of roughly 150 participants reporting CNS involvement in 34% and skeletal involvement in 32% of disseminated cases [ 5 4 Coccidioides 6 Although coccidioidomycosis has been well documented since the 1930s [ 7 Coccidioides 8 Coccidioides 9 10 9 Extrinsic risk factors for disseminated coccidioidomycosis, as with many fungal infections, are closely linked to impaired immune function. These immune-related risk factors include advanced age (>60 years), tobacco use, and immunocompromised states such as HIV infection, immunosuppressive therapy, diabetes, third-trimester pregnancy, and organ transplantation [ 5 11 Coccidioides 12 12 The pathophysiological mechanism of disseminated coccidioidomycosis depends on the transport of the fungus within macrophages through the bloodstream. Due to the small size of inhaled arthroconidia, they can reach the terminal bronchioles, where they replicate, swell, and rupture, leading to the formation of spherules that are too large for adequate neutrophil-mediated destruction or macrophage phagocytosis [ 9 13 Coccidioides 10 10 9 A collaborative approach is necessary to identify skeletally disseminated coccidioidomycosis in a clinical setting, especially considering this disease may present similarly to other infections or metastatic disease. Assessment of skeletal involvement using both CT and MRI most commonly shows the following: punched-out lytic lesions with circumscribed margins in long and flat bones, permeative bone destruction, soft tissue abscesses with associated osteomyelitis, and skull lesions (the latter of which are uncommon compared to other granulomatous diseases) [ 14 14 14 The diagnostic workup for disseminated coccidioidomycosis is best performed through serology. Initial serologic testing most frequently involves enzyme immunoassays (EIA), but other techniques, such as immunodiffusion (ID) or complement fixation (CF), can also be used to support the diagnosis [ 2 15 15 16 While treatment may not be necessary in mild pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, disseminated disease requires aggressive antifungal management. The patient in this report was managed according to current guidelines, utilizing amphotericin B acutely in combination with long-term oral azoles, as well as considering surgical intervention to alleviate clinical symptoms. Any patient with symptomatic vertebral involvement due to coccidioidomycosis should be placed on an extensive antifungal regimen for 12-18 months, or lifelong therapy in the case of coccidioidomycosis meningitis [ 16 16 17 18 Conclusions This case presents a severe, widespread coccidioidomycosis infection in a young adult male from an endemic region, characterized by extensive skeletal and soft tissue involvement. The diagnostic process is guided by a high index of suspicion, with intrinsic risk factors such as male sex, specific ethnicities, and genetic predispositions, as well as extrinsic factors like occupational exposure, playing a key role. Imaging findings, such as circumscribed lytic lesions and soft tissue abscesses, can provide important diagnostic clues, with definitive confirmation achieved through serologic testing and tissue biopsy. Effective management requires prolonged antifungal therapy, typically with oral azoles, and early recognition is essential to improving outcomes and mitigating the significant burden of the disease.
