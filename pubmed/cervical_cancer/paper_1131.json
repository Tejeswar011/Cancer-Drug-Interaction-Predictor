See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ BACKGROUND Multiple primary cancers refer to the presence of two or more distinct malignant tumors in a single individual, either simultaneously or sequentially. The synchronous occurrence of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is extremely rare. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges and significance of a multidisciplinary team in managing complex malignancies involving both the hepatobiliary and gynecologic systems. The 8 th CASE SUMMARY A 74-year-old postmenopausal woman (Karnofsky performance status = 80) presented with a one-day history of vaginal bleeding. Cross-sectional imaging (contrast-enhanced computed tomography, liver magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography) first demonstrated a single 3-cm lesion in liver segment V and a hypermetabolic cervical mass. Subsequent ultrasound-guided liver biopsy confirmed CCA, whereas cervical biopsy revealed SCC. After multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent laparoscopic liver resection. Pelvic external-beam radiotherapy was delivered at 45 grays in 25 fractions (6-megavolt photons) over 5 weeks, followed by high-dose-rate 192 CONCLUSION Multidisciplinary management offers a promising strategy for treating synchronous complex malignancies with individualized treatment plans.

History of present illness The patient, who had been menopausal since age 50, reported no prior episodes of abnormal vaginal bleeding. On the morning of admission, she experienced sudden, significant vaginal bleeding without associated abdominal pain, distension, urinary, or gastrointestinal symptoms. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a solid cervical mass, raising concerns for a primary cervical malignancy. History of past illness The patient had a two years history of hypertension, which was well controlled with oral irbesartan-hydrochlorothiazide and lacidipine. She had previously undergone excision and ligation for a benign breast tumor. There was no history of diabetes, coronary artery disease, hepatitis B, tuberculosis, or other significant infections. She denied tobacco and alcohol use. Personal and family history There was no family history of malignancy. Physical examination On examination, the patient was alert for stable vital signs. Cardiopulmonary findings were unremarkable. Karnofsky performance status = 80. Gynecological examination revealed a small number of blood clots in the vaginal canal. Inspection of the cervix revealed marked atrophy with a 1.5 cm × 1.5 cm erosive lesion; bimanual palpation revealed a firm mass measuring approximately 2 cm × 3 cm with involvement of the adjacent soft tissue. Laboratory examinations Initial laboratory tests - including complete blood count, liver and renal function panels, and coagulation studies - were within normal limits. The serum progesterone level was 4.39 nmol/L. Urinalysis was positive for occult blood and leukocytes. Hepatitis B serologies were negative. The tumor marker levels were unremarkable except for a mild increase in the level of SCC antigen (3.8 μg/L). Liquid-based cytology revealed a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (Figure 1 Figure 1  Evaluation of cervical lesions by histopathology. Imaging examinations Transvaginal ultrasound confirmed the presence of a solid cervical mass (Figure 2A 2B 2C vs 2D Figure 2  Imaging findings of the cervical and hepatic lesions. th FINAL DIAGNOSIS AJCC 8 th TREATMENT A multidisciplinary tumor board meeting was held to discuss the optimal management strategy. Owing to the aggressive nature of CCA, hepatic resection is prioritized. On March 29, 2024, the patient underwent laparoscopic liver resection. Intraoperative findings included a white, slightly elevated mass in segment V and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the hepatoduodenal ligament. Partial resection of the liver (involving segment V and the right posterior lobe) along with lymphadenectomy was performed. Postoperative histopathology demonstrated moderately differentiated intrahepatic CCA with perineural invasion (Figure 3 Streptococcus viridans Figure 3  Histopathological confirmation of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. After stabilization, the patient was transferred to the gynecology department. On May 2, 2024, she began pelvic radiotherapy consisting of external-beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy to 45 grays in 25 fractions (1.8 grays per fraction with 6-megavolt photons) followed by high-dose-rate 192 OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP The patient has maintained good functional status (Karnofsky performance status = 80) throughout therapy. At the latest follow-up on March 22, 2025 (12 months after diagnosis), contrast-enhanced abdominal CT imaging revealed no signs of recurrence or metastasis in the cervix or liver. The results of laboratory studies, including those for tumor markers, remain within normal limits.

DISCUSSION MPCs represent a rare and complex clinical phenomenon characterized by the occurrence of two or more primary malignant tumors in a single patient[ 3 1 5 The pathogenesis of synchronous primary malignancies is multifactorial and involves metabolic disorders, lifestyle and environmental exposures, previous cancer therapies, and genetic predispositions[ 6 7 8 9 10 11 For single primary intrahepatic CCA (AJCC 8 th 5 12 13 14 15 16 Bidirectional Mendelian randomization studies indicate that both the gut microbiota and discrete immune cell phenotypes are involved in biliary tract carcinogenesis[ 17 18 19 CONCLUSION This case highlights the clinical complexity and diagnostic challenges of synchronous CCA and cervical SCC, and underscores the value of a personalized, multidisciplinary approach. Successful disease control was achieved through hepatic resection, radiotherapy, and a systemic regimen incorporating lenvatinib, capecitabine, and camrelizumab, with no recurrence at one-year follow-up. This experience supports integrating surgical, radiotherapeutic, and immunotherapeutic modalities for managing rare dual malignancies, especially in elderly patients. Emerging tools such as ctDNA-based liquid biopsy may further refine post-treatment surveillance and risk assessment. Future research should investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms and long-term outcomes of multimodal therapies in larger cohorts.
