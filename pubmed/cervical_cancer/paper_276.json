System overview Figure 1 21 2 2 2 Supplementary Data A and B Fig. 1 Systematic overview of the study. The system consists of individual patient and database sheets. Patient information is registered on an individual patient sheet and automatically reflected in database sheet. In the individual patient sheet, the user can set the dose constraints for OARs and α/β ratio for targets and OARs. In addition, there are functions for EQD2 calculation, dose summations, overdose alerts, and ideal dose calculation OAR – organ at risk, EBRT – external beam radiation therapy, BT – brachytherapy, EQD 2 Supplementary Data A and B Total dose evaluation To assess the total dose received from both BT and EBRT, EQD 2 22 23 Total dose (EQD 2 2 2 E Q D 2 = N d 1 + d α / β 1 + 2 α / β  2 where d N At our institution, dose constraints for the total EQD 2 6 8 13 18 24 25 Table 1 Table 1 Dose constraints for total EQD 2 Dosimetry parameter Dose conversion Dose constraint level (Gy) Goal Tolerance Rectum D 2cc EQD 2 < 65 75 Bladder D 2cc EQD 2 < 80 85 HR-CTV D 90% EQD 2 > 85 70 OAR – organ at risk, EBRT – external beam radiation therapy, BT – brachytherapy, EQD 2 2cc 3 90% Patient and plan selection for evaluating dosimetric impact of the system To examine dosimetric impact of the system, doses received by cervical cancer patients who were treated using EBRT and BT in four fractions were compared before and after implementation of the system, and were divided into two groups, i.e., with system and without system. The method for treatment planning in BT differed between these two groups, although dose constraints were the same. In the group without system, the ideal fractionated dose in BTs was calculated by the dose after subtracting EBRT dose from the dose constraint, and considering the number of BTs, resulting in equaling it among BTs. In the group with system, the ideal dose was calculated by the number of remaining BTs and the dose after subtracting EBRT and completed BTs dose from the dose constraint, resulting in variations among BTs. From January 2015 to July 2023, 214 patients with cervical cancer underwent computed tomography (CT)-based image-guided adaptive BT, including 114 patients who underwent BT in four fractions. Thirty-two patients were excluded due to following reasons: insufficient information ( n n n n n n Supplementary Data A Table 2 Table 2 Patient characteristics Without system n With system n p Age (years), median (range) 63 (33-86) 62 (32-86) 0.462 Tumor category according to TNM classification, n 0.364 T1b 6 (14.6) 4 (9.8) T1b1 6 (14.6) 2 (4.9) T1b2 4 (9.8) 1 (2.4) T2 1 (2.4) 1 (2.4) T2a 2 (4.9) 4 (9.8) T2a1 2 (4.9) 1 (2.4) T2a2 0 (0) 1 (2.4) T2b 13 (31.7) 11 (26.9) T2b1 0 (0) 1 (2.4) T3a 2 (4.9) 2 (4.9) T3b 5 (12.2) 13 (31.7) EBRT technique, n < 0.001* 3D-CRT 39 (95.1) 18 (43.9) IMRT 2 (4.9) 23 (56.1) EBRT dose for whole pelvis, median (range) < 0.001* Physical dose (Gy) 30 (19.8-50.0) 45 (20.0-50.4) EQD 2 30 (19.8-50.0) 44.3 (20.0-50.0) EQD 2 30 (19.8-50.0) 43.2 (20.0-50.0) BT technique, n < 0.001* ICBT 32 (78.0) 11(26.8) HBT 9 (22.0) 30 (73.2) Use of spacer, n Rectal spacer 23 (56.1) 36 (87.8) 0.003* Bladder spacer 19 (46.3) 32 (78.0) 0.003* EBRT – external beam radiation therapy, 3D-CRT – 3D conformal radiation therapy, IMRT – intensity-modulated radiation therapy, BT – brachytherapy, EQD 2 EBRT and BT Definitive radiation therapy for patients with cervical cancer was performed using EBRT and BT. The details on EBRT and BT are shown in Supplementary Data A 24 29 28 30 Table 1 26 90% Various applicators can be employed in BT for cervical cancer; we analyzed them collectively due to limited data preventing reliable statistical analysis, treatment plans adhering to consistent DPs, and dose constraints regardless of the applicator. To minimize rectal and bladder doses during BT, a hyaluronic acid gel was injected into recto-vaginal and vesico-ureteral septa under transrectal ultrasound [ 31 33 Table 2 Comparison of DPs In this study, DPs were compared based on D 90% 2cc Per-patient mean DP values across four BT fractions.

DP ratio of OAR to CTV was used to evaluate the balance between HR-CTV D 90% Univariate analysis was performed to analyze patient characteristics ( Table 2 Sub-group analysis was performed to examine patients with HR-CTV D 90% Here, two ideal fractionated doses applied only to OARs, which were calculated using the goal dose constraint ( Table 1 The initial ideal dose can be calculated after subtracting an EBRT dose from a dose constraint in each OAR and dividing that dose equally among BTs. Thus, only the EBRT dose can determine the initial ideal fractionated dose, and it can be derived even if the system is not used. On the other hand, in the cumulative ideal fractionated dose, actual doses of completed BT are added to the EBRT dose, and the ideal fractionated dose for the remaining BT sessions is re-calculated for each session. Because this system always displays the cumulative ideal fractionated dose, it is the dose assumed when this system is in use. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were done using SPSS Statistics (version 25; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). For continuous variables, Shapiro-Wilk test was performed to determine whether samples showed a normal distribution, whereas F-test was performed to analyze variance.

Notably, EBRT and BT doses were summed using the EQD 2 6 24 37 7 13 18 The introduction of the system coincided with changes in both the EBRT technique (including the use of IMRT, which affected the WP dose) and BT technique (including the use of HBT and spacers), making a fully equal assessment difficult. However, it was confirmed that the introduction of the system facilitates optimal treatment planning to maximize the HR-CTV dose coverage, while adhering to OAR dose limits in each session. Studies with more homogeneous patient populations may further demonstrate the system’s usefulness. Moreover, our study’s focus on cervical cancer, limiting its applicability to other gynecological cancers. Nevertheless, the established DPs for HR-CTV and OARs, essential for tumor control and mitigating adverse events, may serve as a valuable reference for other institutions [ 4 7 Conclusions Our spreadsheet system (Microsoft Excel) calculates the total EQD 2 2 Funding This work was partially supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI (grant numbers JP19K17160 and JP19K17218).
