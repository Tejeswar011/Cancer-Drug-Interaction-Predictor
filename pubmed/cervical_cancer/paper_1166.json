DEPDC1-AS1 is a newly identified lncRNA, and its mechanism of action in EC remains to be explored. Methods 100 hyperplasia and 100 EC patients were included. The abundance of DEPDC1-AS1, miR-508-3p, and SQSTM1 was quantified by qRT-PCR. Kaplan–Meier survival curve and Cox regression predicted prognostic factors. Pearson correlation was used to assess the relationships among the molecular markers. Cell proliferation was assessed with the CCK-8 assay, and migration/invasion with Transwell assays. The regulatory interactions were predicted by bioinformatics and validated through dual-luciferase reporter assays and co-transfection experiments. Results DEPDC1-AS1 was enhanced in EC tissues and cell lines and identified as an independent prognostic factor. Its expression was associated with FIGO stage and cervical invasion, while lower DEPDC1-AS1 levels correlated with improved survival outcomes. Functional experiments showed that silencing DEPDC1-AS1 inhibited EC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, DEPDC1-AS1 sponges miR-508-3p, with a confirmed negative correlation between the two. DEPDC1-AS1 promoted EC cell aggressiveness by modulating miR-508-3p, which directly targets SQSTM1. SQSTM1 expression was negatively correlated with miR-508-3p and positively correlated with DEPDC1-AS1. Conclusion DEPDC1-AS1 may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker in EC. These findings suggest that DEPDC1-AS1 facilitates EC progression through the miR-508-3p, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.

These findings enhance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving EC pathogenesis and may aid in the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. Materials and methods Volunteers recruitment 100 patients with AH (hyperplasia group) and 100 patients with EC (Tumor group) who underwent treatment at Renhe Hospital, Baoshan District, Shanghai between January 2016 and December 2019 were retrospectively enrolled. All patients were diagnosed with AH or EC based on histopathological examination following total hysterectomy. The protocol was approved by the committee of Renhe Hospital, Baoshan District, Shanghai in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent. Patients were followed for a period of five years. Inclusion criteria: (1) first-time diagnosis of EC with primary surgical treatment; (2) absence of other primary malignancies; (3) no history of preoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, endocrine therapy, or other anti-tumor treatments; and (4) no evidence of fever, acute or chronic infections, hematological disorders, or autoimmune diseases. Cell cultured Six human EC cell lines—Ishikawa, KLE, AN3CA, RL95-2, HEC-1-A, and HEC-1-B—along with normal endometrial epithelial cells (EEC) were used. All cell lines were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in appropriate media according to ATCC recommendations: Ishikawa cells were maintained in Minimum Essential Medium; KLE and RL95-2 cells in DMEM/F12, HEC-1-A cells in McCoy’s 5 A medium, AN3CA and HEC-1-B cells in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium. Normal EEC were cultured in DMEM/F12. Complete medium was prepared by adding 10% FBS (Gibco, USA). Cell transfection For functional experiments, overexpression and silencing of lncRNA DEPDC1-AS1 were achieved by transfecting cells with pcDNA3.1-DEPDC1-AS1 (OE-DEPDC1-AS1) and short hairpin RNA targeting DEPDC1-AS1 (sh-DEPDC1-AS1), respectively. A scrambled shRNA and empty vector served as negative controls. In addition, miR-mimic and corresponding negative control (miR-NC) were utilized to assess the regulatory of miR-508-3p. All oligonucleotides and plasmid constructs were provided by GenePharma (Shanghai, China). Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, USA) was utilized to conduct transfection. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected at 70% confluency. qRT-PCR Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells and samples using TRIzol (Invitrogen, USA). For DEPDC1-AS1 and SQSTM1 detection, PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara, Japan) was used to prepare cDNA. For miR-508-3p detection, Mir-X miRNA First-Strand Synthesis Kit (Takara) was used to synthesize cDNA. qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (Takara). PCR amplification was performed under the following cycling conditions: an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 5 s and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 30 s. A dissociation (melting curve) step was conducted at 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 95 °C for 15 s to confirm the specificity of the amplification. Prior to gene expression analysis, a standard curve was generated using serial dilutions of cDNA to assess amplification efficiency. The PCR amplification efficiency was calculated and found to be 0.98, which falls within the acceptable range of 0.9 to 1.1. The relative abundance of DEPDC1-AS1 and SQSTM1 was quantified to GAPDH, while miR-508-3p expression was normalized to U6 small nuclear RNA, with 2 −ΔΔCt Subcellular fractionation assay The subcellular localization of DEPDC1-AS1 was assessed using a Subcellular Fractionation Assay. Total RNA was extracted from the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of EC tumor cells using the Cytoplasmic and Nuclear RNA Purification Kit (Norgen Biotek, Canada). The relative expression of DEPDC1-AS1 was determined by qRT-PCR. U6 and GAPDH served as internal controls for the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter assay The predicted binding sites were identified using bioinformatics tools StarBase. Wild-type (WT) and mutant (MUT) of DEPDC1-AS1 and SQSTM1 containing miR-508-3p sites were synthesized and cloned into the pmirGLO vector (Promega, WI, USA). Cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 5 × 10 4 CCK-8 assays Proliferation was evaluated using the CCK-8 assay (Dojindo, Japan). Cells were seeded into 96-well plates (3 × 10 3 Transwell assays Migration/invasion was determined using Transwell materials (Corning, USA). For the migration, AN3CA and Ishikawa cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, resuspended, and seeded into the upper chambers in 200 µL (5 × 10 4 For the invasion assay, the upper chambers were pre-coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences, USA) diluted 1:8 in serum-free DMEM and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and allowed to solidify. The subsequent procedure was the same as for the migration assay. Bioinformatic analysis Expression data and clinical information for EC samples were obtained from the UCSC Xena database ( https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/ Genes co-expressed with DEPDC1-AS1 were identified using the TCGA-UCEC tumor cohort, selecting those with a Pearson correlation coefficient > 0.4 or < −0.4. The resulting gene set was subjected to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using the “clusterProfiler” package in R to explore potential biological pathways associated with DEPDC1-AS1. Significantly enriched pathways were visualized using a dot plot. Statistical analysis GraphPad Prism 9.0 and R software (version 4.0.0) were used to analyze data and visualize the results. Experimental data are presented as the mean ± SD. Student’s t-test and one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test were applied to continuous variables. Chi-square/Fisher’s exact test was used for categorical variables. Kaplan–Meier survival and Univariate Cox regression were used to assess overall survival and prognostic factors. P Results Aberrant expression of DEPDC1-AS1 and its association with prognosis The abundance of DEPDC1-AS1 was elevated in the Tumor group, showing an approximately 40% increase compared to the Hyperplasia (Fig. 1 P S1 1 P 1 P P 1 P S1 1 P  Fig. 1 Expression of DEPDC1-AS1 and its association with prognosis in EC.

( A B n C n n D-E D E P P P Discussion The incidence and mortality of EC have been steadily rising, making it a significant threat to women’s health and survival [ 3 21 21 22 11 23 24 16 17 Tumor progression relies on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as they determine the tumor’s growth rate, metastatic potential, and invasiveness toward surrounding tissues. These behaviors are closely linked to disease severity and clinical outcomes [ 25 26 27 28 18 Recent studies have increasingly highlighted the modulatory function of the lncRNA/miRNA/mRNA in EC. lncRNAs can function as molecular “sponges,” competitively binding to miRNAs and attenuating their regulatory effects on downstream target mRNAs [ 29 30 31 32 20 33 34 35 36 37 39 Dysregulation of the cell cycle is a fundamental driver of EC [ 40 41 42 40 43 Conclusion This study is the first to report that DEPDC1-AS1 is significantly overexpressed in EC and is related to poor prognosis. DEPDC1-AS1 aggravates EC progression by regulating miR-508-3p. These findings suggested DEPDC1-AS1 as a potential therapeutic and prognostic target, offering valuable insights and a theoretical basis for future clinical research and drug development in EC.
