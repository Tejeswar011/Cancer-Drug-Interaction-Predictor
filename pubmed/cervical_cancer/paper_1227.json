Current screening programs primarily rely on cytology and HPV DNA testing; however, their positive predictive value (PPV) for detecting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN2+) remains limited. This study aimed to compare the clinical performance of the HPV mRNA test with that of the HPV DNA test, focusing on their PPV for detecting CIN1+ lesions in a cohort of Greek women. A total of 114 women undergoing routine cervical cancer screening were tested using an HPV DNA assay (detecting 41 HPV types), Pap smear, and were referred for colposcopy and biopsy when indicated. Among them, 29 women aged 18 to 65 years (mean age: 35.1 ± 10.8 years) who tested positive for one or more of the five high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 45) were further assessed using the PreTect HPV-Proofer ® cervical cancer screening HPV mRNA testing E6/E7 oncogenes PreTect HPV-proofer Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT) HFRI PhD Fellowship 186624/I2 The research work was supported by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI) and the General Secretariat for Research and Technology (GSRT), under the HFRI PhD Fellowship grant (GA. no. 186624/I2). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Cervical cancer remains a major global health concern, ranking as the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide, according to the Catalan Institute of Oncology and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (ICO/IARC) Information Centre on HPV and Cancer (2023). In Greece, it ranks as the 10th most frequent cancer among women overall, and as the 3rd most frequent cancer among women aged 15 to 44 years [ 1 Although cytology-based screening programs using the Papanicolaou test (Pap test) or Liquid-Based Cytology (LBC) have proven to be effective [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 To address this limitation, research has increasingly focused on alternative or complementary methods for risk stratification in HPV-positive women. Since the progression to cervical malignancy requires overexpression of the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 [ 9 10 8 Several studies have shown that the increased clinical specificity of the mRNA test makes it a valuable triage tool, capable of significantly reducing unnecessary colposcopies and biopsies [ 11 12 13 14 15 11 12 13 In this study, we compared the performance of the HPV mRNA test with that of the HPV DNA test in terms of positive clinical predictive value, focusing on their ability to detect CIN1+ lesions in a cohort of Greek women. The objective was to assess the potential added value of the HPV mRNA test in enhancing the effectiveness of cervical cancer screening practices. 2. Methods 2.1. Study Design In our study, 114 women aged 18 to 65 years were enrolled. All women were permanent residents of Greece and attended Areteion Hospital, Alexandra Hospital, and IASO Hospital for routine gynecological screening between May 2019 and February 2021. Exclusion criteria included the following: age below 18 or above 65 years, pregnancy, history of hysterectomy, invasive treatment for CIN2+ within the past seven years, prior vaccination with the bivalent or nine-valent HPV vaccine before HPV DNA testing, a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) on the most recent Pap test, HIV infection, immunosuppression, chemotherapy within the last five years, and a history of genital warts infection. Before the examination, each woman completed a demographic questionnaire, which included questions on age, place of residence in Greece, smoking habits, age at sexual initiation, number of children and age at childbirth, frequency of Pap testing, and HPV vaccination status. Data on educational level, economic status, number of sexual partners, and use of protection during sexual activity were not collected. All women underwent cervical cancer screening via co-testing (Pap test and HPV DNA test), in line with the 2019 ASCCP guidelines for cases in which the HPV DNA test used is not FDA-approved for primary screening. Cervical samples were collected using either the digene ® Each woman provided two samples: one was sent to the Virology Unit at the Medical School of Athens for HPV DNA genotyping (targeting 41 HPV genotypes), while the second was sent to a cytology laboratory for Pap testing, using either conventional cytology or liquid-based cytology (LBC). Women who tested positive for any high-risk (HR) HPV DNA type and/or had a Pap test result of ≥ASC-US were referred for colposcopy and/or biopsy. For women who tested positive for one or more of the high-risk HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, or 45, an HPV mRNA test was additionally performed to evaluate oncogenic activity by detecting E6/E7 mRNA transcripts. Since the PreTect HPV-Proofer ® All women were fully informed about the study procedures and provided written informed consent, agreeing to the anonymous use of their data. The study was approved by the Bioethics and Ethics Committee of the Medical School of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA) (Approval No: 1617023003/31 March 2017). 2.2. HPV DNA Genotyping HPV DNA genotyping was conducted using the VisionArray ® Initially, DNA was extracted using the Maxwell ® ® PCR amplification was performed using 5 µL of purified DNA combined with 15 µL of HPV PreCise Master Mix—a refined version of the GP5+/GP6+ general primer system. This reaction amplifies and biotin-labels specific sequences within the L1 region of the HPV genome, with a total reaction volume of 25 µL. The amplified PCR products were subsequently hybridized onto the VisionArray ® 16 17 High-risk types: 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 Probably high-risk types: 26, 34, 53, 66, 67, 68a, 68b, 69, 70, 73, 82IS39, 82MM4 Low-risk types: 6, 11, 40, 42, 43, 44, 54, 55, 57, 61, 62, 72, 81CP8304, 83MM7, 84MM8, 90, 91 Following hybridization, non-specific binding was eliminated through a series of stringent washing steps. The biotinylated target sequences that remained bound to the chip were then detected using a streptavidin–peroxidase conjugate. Visualization was achieved via tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) staining, which produced blue-colored spots at sites of specific hybridization. The results were analyzed and interpreted using the VisionArray ® 2.3. HPV mRNA Test The HPV mRNA test was conducted using the PreTect HPV-Proofer ® 2.4. Cytological Analysis Cytological evaluation of the samples was conducted using either the traditional Papanicolaou (Pap) smear or liquid-based cytology (LBC). For the conventional Pap smear, a healthcare provider collects cervical cells using a cytobrush and immediately smears them onto a glass slide. This slide is then fixed and forwarded to the laboratory for microscopic assessment to identify abnormal or potentially precancerous cellular alterations. In comparison, the LBC method involves collecting cervical cells into a vial containing a preservative solution, which maintains sample quality and reduces the risk of contamination. The sample is then processed in the laboratory, where the cells are either prepared on a slide or examined directly in their liquid state. 2.5. Colposcopy and Biopsy During a colposcopic examination, the physician employs a colposcope to closely inspect and illuminate the cervix, vagina, and vulva, facilitating the identification of abnormal tissue areas. To improve visualization of suspicious regions, a 3–5% acetic acid solution is applied to the cervix using cotton swabs. Areas that temporarily turn white—a reaction referred to as acetowhitening—are flagged for further evaluation and typically biopsied. In cases where no visible abnormalities are detected, Lugol’s iodine may be used as an additional diagnostic aid. After the colposcopic assessment, a punch biopsy is conducted, during which small tissue samples are extracted from the cervix with biopsy forceps. Multiple samples may be obtained from various sites if deemed necessary. These specimens are then analyzed microscopically by a pathologist to assess for the presence of precancerous changes or cervical malignancy. The physicians performing the colposcopies and biopsies were blinded to the specific HPV genotypes and detailed cytology results but were aware of each patient’s HPV positivity, as per standard clinical referral practice. 2.6. Statistical Analysis All participant data—including demographic information, HPV DNA and mRNA test outcomes, and biopsy results—were compiled and analyzed using SPSS Statistics software Version 27. To explore statistical relationships between categorical variables, the Pearson Chi-square (χ 2 3. Results 3.1. Study Population Characteristics Our study population consisted of 29 Greek women aged 18 to 65 years (mean age: 35.1 ± 10.8 years), all of whom met the previously defined inclusion criteria and tested positive for one or more of the five high-risk HPV types (16, 18, 31, 33, 45) included in the PreTect HPV-Proofer ® Figure 1 Pap test results for the 29 women revealed that 18 (62.1%) had normal cytology, 2 (6.9%) presented with ASC-US, 7 (24.1%) with LGSIL, and 2 (6.9%) with HGSIL ( Figure 2 Table 1 3.2. Comparison of Biopsy Results with HPV DNA Test Outcomes Histological examination revealed that, among the total 29 HPV DNA-positive women, 11 women (37.9%) had negative biopsy findings, 16 women (55.2%) were diagnosed with CIN1, and 2 women (6.9%) with CIN2. Based on these results, the positive predictive value (PPV) of the HPV DNA test was approximately 55.2% for CIN1 and 6.9% for CIN2, indicating that although the DNA test captured all CIN2 cases, it also included a significant number of false positives, particularly for higher-grade lesions. 3.3. Comparison of Biopsy Results with HPV mRNA Test Outcomes The distribution of HPV mRNA-positive and mRNA-negative women by colposcopy/biopsy outcome is presented in Figure 3 Of the 17 women who tested positive for HPV mRNA, 13 (76.5%) were also found to have CIN1 upon biopsy (cases 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 26). Importantly, the two women (100%) diagnosed with CIN2 (cases 2 and 28) were also mRNA-positive, suggesting a strong correlation between mRNA positivity and the presence of higher-grade lesions. This resulted in a PPV of 11.8% for CIN2, while both the clinical sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) for CIN2 were 100%. In contrast, among the 12 women who tested negative for HPV mRNA, 3 (25%) were found to have CIN1 (cases 4, 17, and 27). Therefore, the PPV of the mRNA test for CIN1 was 76.5%, the NPV was 75.0%, and the clinical sensitivity for CIN1 was approximately 81.3%. The Pearson Chi-square test result was χ 2 p Table 2 3.4. Distribution of HPV Genotypes Among Women with Histological Lesions HPV16 was the most frequently detected genotype, found in 10 women. Among these, seven had a single infection with HPV16, two had coinfections with HPV18, and one had a coinfection with HPV45. Within this group, two women were diagnosed with CIN2 (one with a single HPV16 infection and one with an HPV16/45 coinfection), four women had CIN1, three had normal biopsy results, and one woman had a negative biopsy. HPV18 was detected in two women, both in coinfection with HPV16. One of these women had CIN1, while the other had a negative biopsy. HPV31 was detected in six women; five had CIN1 and one had a negative biopsy. HPV33 was not detected in any of the HPV mRNA-positive women. HPV45 was found in two cases—one in coinfection with HPV16 and associated with a CIN2 diagnosis, and the other in a woman with CIN1. 3.5. Comparison Between HPV DNA and HPV mRNA Test Performance Table 3 Conversely, the mRNA test missed three cases of CIN1, resulting in a slightly lower sensitivity (81.3%) and NPV (75.0%) for low-grade lesions compared to its performance in high-grade lesion detection. 4. Discussion The sequential testing strategy used in this study was based on the validated scope of the PreTect HPV-Proofer ® Although HPV DNA tests demonstrate high clinical sensitivity (~90–95%) [ 18 19 12 20 In our study, 29 women who tested positive for one or more of the following HPV types—16, 18, 31, 33, and 45—via HPV DNA testing were subsequently tested using the PreTect HPV-Proofer ® 21 22 All 29 women also underwent colposcopy and biopsy, which revealed 2 cases with CIN2, 16 with CIN1, and 11 with negative results. From a clinical perspective, the distinction between CIN1, CIN2, and CIN3 is critical. CIN1 represents mild cervical dysplasia with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL), which are more likely of spontaneous regression and minor cancer risk. CIN2 represents a moderate-grade lesion with uncertain potential for progression, which is often considered a threshold for therapeutic intervention [ 23 As reported in the large study by Schiffman et al. [ 24 25 26 Among the 16 women diagnosed with CIN1, 13 tested positive for HPV mRNA, indicating active oncogenic transcription associated with histologically confirmed lesions. This supports the test’s high specificity in identifying clinically relevant infections. However, the mRNA test missed three CIN1 cases. There are several plausible reasons for these false-negative mRNA results. First, CIN1 lesions are frequently associated with transient HPV infections that may not involve active expression of the E6/E7 oncogenes. In such cases, although HPV DNA is present, the virus may not have initiated the oncogenic transformation process, resulting in undetectable or absent E6/E7 mRNA transcripts. Second, the viral genome in these lesions may exist in episomal form rather than integrated into the host genome, a scenario typically associated with lower oncogenic potential and reduced transcriptional activity. Additionally, mRNA levels in early-stage or regressing lesions may fall below the assay’s detection threshold. The Pearson Chi-square test revealed a statistically significant correlation between the biopsy results of the 29 women and their HPV mRNA test outcomes: χ 2 p p From a clinical perspective, the above findings do not support the use of the HPV mRNA assay as a stand-alone primary screening method for cervical cancer prevention. Instead, the test is better suited as a triage tool, potentially replacing the Pap test—particularly in cases where a high-risk HPV DNA test is positive for genotypes other than HPV16 or HPV18—to help reduce unnecessary colposcopies. Among the three CIN1 cases with negative mRNA results, two (Cases 17 and 27) were positive for HPV16. According to the 2019 ASCCP guidelines, women testing positive for HPV16 are referred directly for colposcopy and biopsy without triage. Therefore, in such cases, a negative mRNA result should not override the guideline-based recommendation for immediate colposcopic evaluation. Focusing on HPV16, the most frequently detected type in our cohort, it is notable that 9 out of 10 women with a positive HPV16 mRNA result had either CIN1 or CIN2 on biopsy. Additionally, among nine women with negative biopsy results and positive DNA test results for HPV16/18, only one tested positive on the mRNA test. This implies that if mRNA testing had been used as a triage tool, eight women could have avoided unnecessary colposcopy and biopsy. In contrast, among five women with CIN1 and positive HR-HPV DNA results for types other than HPV16/18, all tested positive for mRNA (four for HPV31 and one for HPV45). Cases 15, 19, 21, and 22 illustrate that the mRNA test often identifies a single transcriptionally active HPV type, even when multiple types are detected via DNA testing. The exact mechanism by which each HPV type contributes to lesion development in co-infections remains unclear [ 27 28 29 Pap test results among the 29 HR-HPV DNA women showed 18 with normal cytology, 2 with ASC-US, 7 with LGSIL, and 2 with HGSIL. Of the 18 women with normal Pap results, 9 had positive HPV mRNA results—and 6 of those had CIN1 on biopsy—indicating that normal cytology alone may miss early dysplasia. Among the two ASC-US cases, one tested mRNA-positive but had no histological lesion, warranting a shorter follow-up interval. Among seven women with LGSIL, five were mRNA-positive, all of whom had CIN1 on biopsy. Since LGSIL often requires further triage, HPV mRNA testing can clarify oncogenic activity and guide management. Although Pap testing detected both CIN2 (HGSIL) cases, mRNA testing confirmed the presence of oncogenic viral activity, reinforcing its complementary value. In total, out of the 29 women referred for colposcopy/biopsy due to HR-HPV DNA positivity, 8 women (27.5%) (Cases 1, 6, 9, 11, 12, 14, 18, 25) could have avoided these procedures based on negative mRNA results and corresponding negative biopsy findings. Conversely, mRNA testing failed to detect three CIN1 cases (10.3%) (Cases 4, 17, 27), highlighting its lower sensitivity. In these cases, it is possible that the HPV genome existed in episomal form rather than integrated into the host genome, thus escaping detection via mRNA testing while still exerting oncogenic effects [ 30 31 A notable limitation of our study is the small sample size, which was influenced by the strict exclusion criteria and the design of our screening protocol. Although we chose these exclusion criteria in order to minimize confounding factors that could affect HPV persistence, immune response, or cervical pathology so that we could have a more homogeneous and clinically interpretable cohort, we acknowledge that these strict criteria may introduce a selection bias and limit the generalizability of our findings. More specifically, our study could have failed to include groups of women that are at higher or lower risk of disease progression. The limited number of participants, particularly the very small number of CIN2 cases ( n Another limitation is the narrow detection spectrum of the mRNA kit, which targets only five high-risk HPV types. As a result, it might miss clinically relevant infections with other high-risk types, such as HPV52 or HPV58, potentially reducing the test’s sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV). Despite this, we selected the PreTect HPV-Proofer ® Lastly, an additional limitation arises from the lack of certain behavioral and sociodemographic data (educational level, economic status, number of sexual partners, condom use, and vaccination status). These factors are known to influence HPV infections, persistence, and progression risk, and their absence limits our ability to perform multivariate risk analysis and should be taken under consideration in future larger cohort studies. 5. Conclusions Our study confirms the high oncogenic potential of HPV16 and HPV31, while highlighting the potential value of mRNA testing in triaging women with a positive high-risk HPV DNA result by filtering out transient infections. Incorporating mRNA testing into cervical cancer screening protocols may enhance the detection of active HPV-driven oncogenesis, thereby identifying women who would benefit from closer monitoring or early intervention. Moreover, mRNA testing could play a valuable role in clinical studies focused on the development of therapeutic HPV vaccines, by determining HPV status before and after vaccination. Further research involving larger cohorts and the use of updated mRNA diagnostic kits—now capable of detecting and genotyping up to 14 high-risk HPV types—will help clarify whether HPV mRNA testing can serve as a complementary, triage, or even stand-alone method for cervical cancer screening.
