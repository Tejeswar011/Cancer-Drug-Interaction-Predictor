However, its role in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains poorly understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the function of SLC8A1-AS1 in OSCC and to explore its potential mechanisms of action. Methods The TCGA database was utilized to analyze the expression and prognostic significance of SLC8A1-AS1 in OSCC. QRT-PCR was employed to measure the gene expression levels of SLC8A1-AS1 and its target genes. CCK-8, EdU staining, wound healing, and Transwell assays were conducted to assess the effects of SLC8A1-AS1 on OSCC cells. Dual-luciferase reporter gene and RNA pull-down assays were performed to verify the interactions between SLC8A1-AS1 and its target genes. Student’s t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied for data analysis in this study. Results SLC8A1-AS1 was found to be downregulated in OSCC tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of SLC8A1-AS1 inhbited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OSCC cells. Bioinformatics analyses predicted that miR-1305 is a target of SLC8A1-AS1, while ESRRG is a target of miR-1305. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of SLC8A1-AS1 on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OSCC cells were reversed by the introduction of miR-1305 mimics. Conclusion SLC8A1-AS1 inhibits the progression of OSCC by modulating the miR-1305/ESRRG axis.

Our finding indicate that SLC8A1-AS1 suppresses the proliferation and migration of OSCC cells by inhibiting the miR-1305/ESRRG axis. Materials and methods Bioinformatics The OSCC-related lncRNAs were obtained from GeneCards ( www.genecards.org P Cell culture The primary normal human oral keratinocytes (NHOK) were purchased from Shanghai Zhong Qiao Xin Zhou Biotechnology Co., Ltd. The OSCC cell lines FADU (human pharyngeal squamous cells) and SCC25 (human tongue squamous cells) were obtained from Procell Life Science & Technology Co., Ltd. NHOK cells were cultured in complete culture medium specifically designed for human oral keratinocytes (Zhong Qiao Xin Zhou Biotechnology). FADU cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) containing non-essential amino acids (Procell), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Procell) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (P/S, Procell). SCC25 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12, Procell), supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% P/S, and 400 ng/mL hydrocortisone (Shanghai Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd). All the cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 Cell transfection SLC8A1-AS1 overexpressed plasmid pcDNA3.1-SLC8A1-AS1 (SLC8A1-AS1), ESRRG overexpressed plasmid pcDNA3.1-ESRRG (ESRRG), and their negative control (pc-NC), as well as miR-1305 mimics and its negative control (mimics NC), were purchased from Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. The OSCC cell lines (FADU and SCC25) were transfected with SLC8A1-AS1, miR-1305 mimics, and ESRRG using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). After 48 h of transfection, the cells were collected for further study. qRT-PCR Total RNA from OSCC cells was extracted using the TRIzol ® −ΔΔCt 1  Table 1 The primer sequences used for PCR Genes Primer sequences (5’---3’) SLC8A1-AS1 forward GCATATGTTGATGAGCAGGCA reverse AGACTCAGTGACAGGGCTCA-3 ESRRG forward TGTCGCAGTTTGAAAGGCTTC reverse GAACTGTAGCTCCCACTGGC ki67 forward ACCCTGATGAGAGTGAGGGA reverse TGGTTGAGGCTGTTCCTTGA MCM2 forward GGTACTGCTATGGCGGAATCA reverse TGGAGGTGAGGGCATCAGTA E-cadherin forward GCTGGACCGAGAGAGTTTCC reverse CAAAATCCAAGCCCGTGGTG N-cadherin forward ATGGGAAATGGAAACTTGATGGC reverse CAGTTGCTAAACTTCACTGAAAGG GAPDH forward CATGTTGCAACCGGGAAGGA reverse CGCCCAATACGACCAAATCAGAGA miR-1305 stem-loop GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGACCTCTCT forward GCGCGTTTTCAACTCTAATGG reverse AGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATT U6 forward GCTTCGGCAGCACATATACTAAAAT reverse CGCTTCACGAATTTGCGTGTCAT Western blot Total cellular proteins were isolated using RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China), and the protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime). Subsequently, 40 µg of the protein sample was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred onto PVDF membranes, followed by blocking with 5% milk for 1 h. The membranes were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and with a secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution, Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG H&L (HRP), Abcam, Shanghai, China) at room temperature for 2 h. The bands were visualized using an the ECL kit (Abcam) and analyzed with ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). The primary antibodies used were as follows: ESRRG polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Proteintech), Ki-67 recombinant antibody (1:1000, Proteintech), MCM2 polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Proteintech), E-cadherin (E-cad) polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Abcam), N-cadherin (N-cad) recombinant antibody (1:1000, Abcam), and GAPDH polyclonal antibody (1:2500, Abcam). All the reactions were performed in triplicate. Cell proliferation assessment The proliferation of OSCC cells were assessed using the CCK-8 and EdU staining assays. For the CCK-8 assay, OSCC cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 10 3 5 Wound healing assay OSCC cells were plated into 24-well plates at a density of 10 5 Transwell assay OSCC cells (3 × 10 4 Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay The potential binding sites of SLC8A1-AS1 and miR-1305 were predicted using LncRNASNP3, while binding sites of miR-1305 and ESRRG were identified through TargetScan 8.0. The psiCHECK TM RNA pull-down assay Biotinylated SLC8A1-AS1 (Bio-SLC8A1-AS1) and ESRRG (Bio-ESRRG) were synthesized using the Biotin RNA Labeling Kit (SP6/T7) (Beyotime) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The labeled RNAs were subsequently cloned into the pCMV6-AC plasmid (OriGene Technologies) utilizing the pCMV6-Entry plasmid system. Transfection of OSCC cells with the recombinant plasmids was performed using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the recommended procedures. For the pull-down assay, cell lysates were incubated with Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 25 °C for 30 min with gentle shaking. The beads were washed three times with PBS, and magnetic separation was employed to isolate the bead-RNA complexes. The supernatant was removed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Quantitative analysis of the pulled-down RNAs was conducted using RT-qPCR, as previously described. All the reactions were conducted in triplicate. Statistical analysis The results in this study are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 7.0. Differences between two groups or among multiple groups were assessed using Student’s t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results The differentially expressed LncRNAs in OSCC A total of 419 OSCC-related lncRNAs were identified from GeneCards, along with 865 differentially expressed lncRNAs derived from TCGA data (│log 2 P 1 1 1  Fig. 1 SLC8A1-AS1 is downregulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma.

The expression of ESRRG was decreased by miR-1305 and subsequently restored by ESRRG (Fig. 5 5 5 6 6  Fig. 5 SLC8A1-AS1 inhibits the proliferation and invasion of OSCC cells by regulating the expression of miR-1305 and ESRRG.

A B P P P Discussion OSCC is the mostprevalent form of oral cancer, characterized by a poor prognosis and a high mortality rate [ 30 31 An increasing number of research reports have demonstrated that lncRNAs play a crucial role in regulating the progression of OSCC. For instance, the targeted inhibition of CYTOR can suppress the invasion and metastasis of OSCC cells by modulating the HNRNPC/ZEB1 axis [ 32 33 14 15 The competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network is a well-established mechanism through which lncRNAs influence tumor development [ 34 25 26 27 In the ceRNA network, lncRNA protects downstream genes from mRNA degradation or translation inhibition induced by miRNA, thereby upregulating gene expression [ 35 36 38 29 39 40 42 Conclusion Mechanistic investigations reveal that SLC8A1-AS1 exerts its antitumor effects by downregulating the miR-1305/ESRRG regulatory axis in OSCC cells. However, the current study has inherent limitations: the regulatory mechanisms of SLC8A1-AS1 were exclusively explored in vitro. Therefore, validation through in vivo experiments is essential to corroborate these findings. Furthermore, future research should undertake a more comprehensive exploration of the underlying molecular pathways. Collectively, additional studies are imperative to fully elucidate the functional role of SLC8A1-AS1 in the pathogenesis and progression of OSCC.
