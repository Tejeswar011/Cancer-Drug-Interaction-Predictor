Background Integrated health services are advocated for primary health care to address non-communicable diseases (NCDs), especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, evidence of care delivery models and means of scaling up is limited. This study examines community-integrated NCD service models in China, providing evidence on the steps that China took to reorient health services towards primary health care to address the NCD epidemic. Methods A systematic review identified and included 20 studies (from 3959 records screened from five databases) conducted in various regions of China, published in English or Chinese. The evidence synthesis is narrative and thematic. Themes are built upon from the Chronic Care Model framework and issues identified in the World Health Organization package of essential noncommunicable (PEN) disease interventions. They cover priority diseases, interventions included in packages of care, delivery strategies at the community level, the roles of stakeholders, approaches to overcome health system challenges, outcomes, and gaps. Results Despite facing common challenges like other LMICs, such as inadequate infrastructure and insufficient human resources, various community-level integrated NCD service models have been trialled and scaled up through health reform and policy implementation. Key interventions include health promotion, screening, tiered diagnosis and treatment, patient education, self-management, and digital health models. Family physicians and nurses are the main providers, supported by local governments and hospitals. The review identified creative service delivery strategies at the community, highlighting changes in patient clinical pathways, improved access to services, and positive clinical outcomes. Conclusions China's experience with community-integrated NCD service models offers valuable insights for other LMICs. Key elements include prioritising universal health coverage, integrating public health and primary care, and optimising accessibility, efficiency, and patient-centredness. Future research should focus on long-term effects and sustainability, particularly in rural settings. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and chronic respiratory disease, account for 74% of all deaths worldwide [ 1 2 The WHO defines integrated health services as those that are managed and delivered so that people receive a continuum of health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, disease management, rehabilitation, and palliative care services. These services are coordinated across different levels and sites of care within and beyond the health sector, tailored to individuals’ needs throughout the life course [ 3 4 The People’s Republic of China, a developing country marked by rapid urbanisation and economic growth, has lifted more than 850 million people out of poverty. Life expectancy at birth increased from 69.3 years in 1990 to 77.4 years in 2019 [ 5 6 Recognising the burden of noncommunicable diseases in its aging society, which undermines its social and economic development, the country launched health reforms towards UHC in 2009 through the National Basic Public Health Services (BPHS) Programme. NCDs were gradually included and expanded, as reflected in the list of services and interventions, priority diseases, coverage of the population, and financial coverage [ 7 9 In 2017, the BPHS purchasing arrangement expanded from nine to 14 categories, including packages for screening, referrals, and following up on hypertension, type 2 diabetes, severe mental disorders, tuberculosis, and care for older people. Recently, the programme further expanded to include services for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Funding for the programme increased from 3.10 USD per capita in 2009 to 7.00 USD in 2017 and 13.00 USD in 2022 [ 7 Like other LMICs, reorienting primary health care to deliver integrated NCD services remains challenging. Implementation is constrained by inadequate infrastructure, insufficient human resources, medicine availability and affordability, improper health information systems, poor quality, and a lack of trust in first-level services [ 10 13 14 Various integrated NCD service models at the community level have been trialled and piloted. Many localities have scaled up these pilots through the ‘demonstrative districts’ of the National Demonstration Areas Program for Integrated NCD Prevention and Control [ 15 We hope that our analysis will provide valuable insights into integrated care and community-based health care models, offering lessons for other LMICs. METHODS We followed nine defining features of conducting a systematic review, including articulating objectives, defining inclusion and exclusion criteria, conducting a comprehensive search, following a screening and selection process, appraising the quality of studies, analysing extracted data, presenting a synthesis of the results/findings, interpreting the results, and reporting transparently [ 16 The synthesis is both narrative and thematic. Its structure is built upon themes of interventions and types of services provided through the NCD integrated service models identified in a previous scoping review [ 17 18 2 The WHO PEN [ 2 17 The review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO Database (CRD42023420692). We report our implementation of the PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols) guidelines (Table S1 in the Online Supplementary Document Criteria for considering studies in this review A predefined set of eligibility criteria was used to screen studies for inclusion in the review (Table S2 in the Online Supplementary Document Online Supplementary Document We searched the following electronic databases: Medline, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and the Chinese Index Medicus. The search details are available (Table S3 in the Online Supplementary Document Study screening and selection The data were downloaded and screened in NoteExpress. Studies were first screened by reviewing titles and abstracts by two authors. Where applicable, the full texts of relevant studies identified through a second screen of studies were obtained, and the data were extracted into a piloted Excel spreadsheet. The research was restricted to communities in China. Data extraction and quality appraisal The following data were extracted from the included studies: first author, year of publication, types of NCD, study design, sample size, population characteristics, location, health service setting, health service context, outcome measures, details of intervention, and summary of results. The extracted items are summarised in the results. Two authors extracted the data. One author conducted a quality assessment for the selected studies using the Cochrane ROBINS-I tool (to assess the risk of bias in the results of nonrandomised studies) and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. Data extraction forms were piloted on a sample of included studies (20%) to ensure all the relevant information was captured. The consistency of the extracted data was assessed to ensure >95% agreement. Data analysis and synthesis We conducted a narrative synthesis of studies, including the type of study, location, measurements and indicators, and characteristics of providers. We map and match our findings and draw our themes deductively based on established principles and themes, such as the WHO PEN framework and the Chronic Care Model. For services provided through a community integrated model, we mapped each study against a list of types of services provided through a previous scoping review [ 17 Our other syntheses are narrative, focusing on implementation aspects, including delivery strategies at the community level, the roles of stakeholders, approaches to overcome health system challenges, outcomes, and gaps. Revisions of the synthesis involved looking for relationships and common characteristics among the themes. We presented our results using summary tables, graph highlighting the change of patient clinical pathways, and narratives. RESULTS Our initial search included 3959 papers, which were reduced to 3856 after deduplication. After screening titles and abstracts, 276 studies remained. Of these, 155 studies were found to be irrelevant; 56 studies did not use primary data, including reviews and policy briefs; 10 studies were excluded due to repetition; and 35 studies were not integration related. This left 20 studies ( Figure 1 Figure 1 PRISMA flowchart detailing the results of the literature search and screening of primary research studies Of the 20 included studies, 16 were conducted in East China, two nationwide, one in West China, and one in the middle region. Among the studies specifying service delivery location, 10 were conducted in urban areas, two in rural settings, and eight in mixed regions. Of the 20 included studies, four have sample size less or equal than 100, eight between 100 and 1000, eight more than 1000 (of which three time series studies have sample size more than 8000). Eight time-series studies present more than two years long-term follow-up data ( Table 1 Table 1 Table 1 Summary of the literature on community-integrated NCD prevention and control in China No. First author year Study design Sample size Follow-up time NCD Types Details of model: workforce, interventions, delivery strategy Results measurement and impact Place 1 Li Sixuan 2023 [ 19 Cohort study 502 4 y Hypertension Community family doctors, follow-up visits, measure blood pressure, heart rate and weight, lifestyles intervention, medication, and health education to patients. 2015 to 2019.

BPHS – National Basic Public Health Services, NCD – Noncommunicable disease, COPD – Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, CHC – Community Health Centre Prioritised diseases Among the selected studies, seven targeted diabetes, six involved all types of chronic diseases, three targeted hypertension and diabetes, two targeted hypertension only, and a final two targeted COPD (including one targeting COPD and chronic heart diseases). Although multimorbidity and chronic heart diseases were included in some studies, most studies excluded patients with complications, acute phases, cancer, and terminal illness. Hypertension and diabetes were selected as entry points for primary care and disease management in several studies [ 34 24 25 Interventions and types of services The service types identified across the studies included health promotion, health education, screening, referral, initial diagnosis, adherence support, peer-group facilitation, acute care, home-based care, home-based visits, medication distribution, patient follow-up, traditional Chinese medicine treatment, monitoring, and medication management. Health education and health promotion were reported in all the studies. We grouped the services into five areas: 1. health promotion, health education, and developing a healthy environment; 2. screening, assessing health, and establishing records; 3. tiered disease diagnosis and treatment, patient management, follow-up, and referral; 4. patient education, lifestyle counselling, self-management, and peer support; 5. digital intelligence models including telemedicine, digital health, the internet and the Internet of Things. Two studies included rehabilitation support in models of COPD and chronic heart failure. In practice, traditional medicine was found to be a common service in the community model [ 34 23 Health promotion, health education, and developing a healthy environment This area includes health literature and knowledge dissemination through community health centres and other channels targeting the whole population. Packages include diet, such as nutrition and salt reduction; knowledge of common chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and COPD, and their risk factors; establishing exercise and a healthy environment; and health promotion at school and other entities, including households, workplaces, and restaurants [ 24 34 38 The demonstrative districts for NCD prevention and control in China [ 34 38 A study in Guangdong included interventions for indoor air pollution due to smoke (tobacco or cooking) and ventilation and outdoor air pollution. It included pulmonary rehabilitation exercise led by a community nurse, in addition to the treatment of COPD [ 24 Screening, assessing health, and establishing health records Screening is used as an approach for the early diagnosis of NCDs and entry into the community integrated care model to identify, plan, and stratify patients for differentiated management. Blood pressure and sugar levels are recommended to be checked when patients visit a health centre for the first time. Some community health centres provide equipment or tools for self-checking. Hypertension and diabetes patients are requested to have a cohort record established and maintained at health centres [ 33 34 38 7 34 Tiered disease diagnosis and treatment, patient management, follow-ups, referrals This area forms a key effort of the government’s health reform, aiming to build a primary health care system with gatekeeping functions, decentralise resources, and shift the management of common NCDs to the community. The review revealed that diabetes, hypertension, and COPD were the common types of diseases currently managed in the community, with diabetes and hypertension serving as entry points [ 24 27 30 31 33 34 36 38 26 Patient education, lifestyle counselling, self-management, and peer support Patient education [ 24 25 27 29 32 29 32 38 Several studies in this review explored managing patients and risk factors for NCDs through signing contracts [ 34 21 29 24 25 Intelligence models, including telemedicine, digital health, the internet and the Internet of Things The next generation of the community health care model in China is positioned as an intelligence model that incorporates information technology, telemedicine, digital health, the internet, and the Internet of Things [ 31 8 27 31 33 Organisation and coordination of providers The review revealed that family physicians (general practitioners/family doctors) and nurses in community health centres constitute the main category of the health workforce that provides the bulk of services [ 19 21 23 25 27 30 31 35 36 30 In addition to health centres as the main service provider, studies have identified two other stakeholders: local governments [ 23 24 26 34 38 26 30 36 26 21 25 32 Hospitals that previously provided the bulk of the diagnosis and treatment directly to chronic patients, such as those with hypertension and diabetes previously, were requested to reallocate resources and implement a tiered medical care system. The spectrum of hospital roles shifted to service outreach at community health centres, championing integrated care models [ 30 32 In some pilots on reciprocal referrals, when needed and referred by community health centres, patients with complications receive fast-track services at hospitals, and patients with stable diabetes and hypertension conditions are referred to community health centres for medication refills and follow-up [ 26 30 36 25 At the administrative level, the three types of stakeholders often form a consortium or collaborative body, through agreements or contracts [ 30 36 23 Management of services along the pathway of care and different levels of care Several studies in this review examined the efforts of health care reforms in pilot cities, such as Shanghai and Xiamen, which focused on triaging patients from hospitals to community health centres and promoting the utilisation of community services. We summarise the changes in patient clinical pathways, services provided at the community and hospital levels, and the initial impact in Figure 2 36 Figure 2 An illustration of a diabetes patient clinical pathway in Shanghai: before and after the implementation of community-integrated NCD service models As a result, several studies have identified encouraging changes in the health care-seeking behaviour of stable diabetes and hypertension patients and their preferences in pilot cities [ 30 31 36 26 36 Measurement and patient-centredness Among the 20 selected studies, 14 included clinical outcomes such as blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, and forced expiratory volume (FEV1) as measurements. Programme indicators, including service utilisation and preferences across the level of health care (community or hospital), referrals and patient visits, cost savings and waiting times, patient contracting rates with family doctors, and disease (hypertension and diabetes) standard management rates and control rates, were adopted as part of performance management and as accountability mechanisms. Notably, there was an interest in measuring the empowerment of patients and how patient-centred the model was. Various indicators, including composite indicators such as stress and neighbourhood support, self-efficacy, self-management, patient satisfaction, and quality of life, were adopted to present evidence of the impact of an integrated model ( Table 1 Table 2 Table 2 Summary of the outcome measurement on community-integrated NCD prevention and control in China Outcome or subgroup title Measurement No. of studies No. of long-term studies (1 y or more) 1.1 Improvement in NCD control Measured by fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, blood pressure, serum lipid, cholesterol, FEV1 14 10 (5 of them are ≥4 y time series) 1.2 Access to service Measured by PHC service utilisation, consultation, patient filing, health examination, workload 6 5 (2 of them are ≥4 y time series) 1.3 Efficiency of health system Measured by hospitalisation, complication reduction 3 2* 1.4 Patient satisfaction Measured by patient view of service, satisfaction, awareness of reform or health care policy, waiting time at hospital, satisfaction of referral, satisfaction of health care environment, clarity of explanation of illness, responsiveness and trust 6 5 (1 of them are ≥4 y time series) 1.5 Improvement in self-management, self-efficacy Measured by improved knowledge of disease and risk factors, blood pressure or blood glucose monitoring, medication and medication adherence 9 5 (2 of them are ≥4 y time series) 1.6 Improvement in health status, quality of life Measured by improved health, symptom improvement, quality of life (physical and mental health component) 6 2 (2 of them are ≥4 y time series) 1.7 Improvement in healthy behaviour Measured by physical activity, drinking, smoking cession, diet, BMI, waist circumference, household or occupational exposure to dust/gases/fumes. 5 2 (1 of them are ≥4 y time series) 1.8 Cost Measured by cost of treatment, cost benefit or saving 2 1 *Increased hospitalisation in one study in less-developed area Patient satisfaction, access to service, cost benefit, and efficiency in terms of reduction of hospital admissions for diabetes and hypertension, and reduction of complication were adopted as important outcomes for the models of integrated care in China [ 26 30 36 Table 2 DISCUSSION The studies in this review provided evidence on the steps that China took in its journey to reorient health services towards primary health care to address the NCD epidemic. We discuss the lessons learned from the experience of China thematically, covering priority diseases, interventions included in packages of care, delivery strategies at the community level, the roles of stakeholders, approaches to overcome health system challenges, outcomes, and gaps and limitations. We compare the experiences of other countries with similar or different contexts. Priority diseases, package of interventions With increasing coverage of NCD services in primary care, China has focused mainly on hypertension and diabetes patients, who had been inefficiently treated in hospitals until then. Once those services provide desirable outcomes, additional services, such as cervical cancer and breast cancer screening and COPD, are expanded to cover them. This approach of progressively increasing and delivering heterogeneous interventions and services at primary health centres has been found in many settings, not only in relation to NCDs but also in other areas, such as reproductive, maternal and child health programmes [ 17 39 40 When defining the spectrum of the service package at the primary health care level, this review identified a mix of public health and primary medical care interventions. This represents a change compared to the past, when only public health services for infectious diseases were provided at this level in China. Screening and health assessment were used as initial public health approaches to assess the catchment population and stratify specific populations for the early diagnosis of NCDs and follow-up for a continuum of care. Other countries, such as Brazil, have a similar mix of public and primary medical care interventions in their primary health care reform, with a similar approach to delivering services [ 41 42 43 Another approach utilised in China to reduce the high undiagnosed rate for diabetes and hypertension is to provide free blood pressure and glucose checking for the population in community health centres in some localities. Additionally, free health assessment is provided annually to 65 years and older. These practices align WHO member states in a better position to achieve targets by 2030: 80% of people with diabetes are diagnosed; 80% of people with diagnosed diabetes have good control of glycaemia; 100% of people with type 1 diabetes have access to affordable insulin and blood glucose self-monitoring. Delivery strategy To deliver services more effectively, this review identified patient peer group support as a good delivery strategy to enhance lifestyle counselling and patient management [ 21 22 27 29 32 Countries implementing the WHO PEN for NCDs reported challenges related to lifestyle habits and adherence to medicine, including a lack of cooperation by patients and a lack of resources, training, and motivation and time among health workers to implement interventions [ 44 32 Similarly, an evidence synthesis in the UK suggested that those ‘lifestyle advisors’, involved in paid or voluntary work with an individual or group of peers, were cost-effective in chronic care and smoking cessation [ 45 The role of hospitals in the pathway of care and primary health care system reform After defining a service package, China focused on strengthening the health system and structure through reform and investment. This review highlights the important role of hospitals and how their resources are harnessed to improve the provision and quality of primary health care. Practices included abolishing general outpatient services for patients with hypertension or diabetes and incentivising patients to receive medicines at community health centres; redesigning district hospitals as regional health centres; promoting close cooperation and communication between hospitals and community health centres; and increasing awareness among specialists, community physicians, community members, and patients about those reforms [ 26 30 36 Indeed, a review in the Western Pacific region supported the role of hospitals in strengthening primary health care, also calling for further empirical inquiry into the impact of incentives for engaging hospitals in improving primary health care [ 13 Health system inputs: health information At the operational level, the review revealed that health information and health workforce were key health system inputs for implementing community-integrated noncommunicable disease service models. Studies in the review [ 27 29 33 34 46 47 China moves fast in digital technology. Patients are benefiting from the integration of digital technology and health care services, the era of digital health. Procedures such as appointments and follow-ups, consultations are conducted manually and digitally, which has enhanced access and efficiency. However, certain groups, such as elderly, less-educated, people live in deprived area with less internet connection or poor areas, also face ‘digital divide’ [ 48 Since 2014, the Chinese government has introduced policies to guide the development of digital health and its utilisation. Other approaches to address inequalities include infrastructure investment, the new service development considering digital exclusion, peer support or intergenerational mentoring or localised digital champion addressing essential digital skills among vulnerable groups, incentivise partnership and multisectoral cooperation [ 48 52 Health system input: Health workforce and infrastructure The paper revealed that family physicians (general practitioners/family doctors) and nurses are the main PHC workforces. Like other LMICs, China also faces shortages of trained health care providers, and uneven distribution. Workforce capacity and infrastructure are better distributed in cities with better economic development and in the eastern region [ 53 Table 1 53 55 Table 1 Notably, this review identified some creativeness, such as enlisting non-health professional lay leaders to support self-management and healthy lifestyle among patient groups [ 56 – general practitioner (family doctor): diagnosis, prescription of medicines and tests, medication titration; – nurses: follow-up and patient management; health assessment and record establishment; implementation of some rehabilitation exercise, possibly with lay leaders; – public health workers: health promotion and preventive activities; – pharmacist: medication management for NCD patients with multimorbidity; – physiotherapist: design of rehabilitation programmes for patients. These findings largely align with the WHO recommendations for team-based care [ 57 26 30 36 – champion integrated care delivery; – mentor mid-level professionals at community health centres; – receiving referrals and providing medical care for highly complex patients; – triaging patients to divert stable patients to community health centres; – providing outreach services to patients at community health centres. Other reviews have argued that NCD care is too frequently provided by a specialist focused on treatment, and that there is an urgent need to scale up public sector reform to ensure a sufficient number health workforce cadres and adequate distribution at the primary health care level [ 14 58 Outcomes and gaps Our results revealed promising examples of essential NCD interventions targeting both the population and individuals, effectively implemented at primary health facilities. Positive outcomes include increasing access to NCD services, control of NCDs, and reducing the prevalence of risk factors, such as smoking and alcohol consumption, although more longer-term effects and sustainability are yet to be seen. Programme data indicate a positive trend since the implementation of reform and the National Basic Public Health Services Programme, with approximately 70% of diabetes patients receiving standardised management through the programme [ 7 59 60 15 Continuing the journey to address the NCD epidemic through primary health care is essential to tackle the remaining challenges and gaps. For example, the 2018 national population-based survey revealed that only 11.0% of patients with hypertension had controlled blood pressure, 31.5% of patients with diabetes had controlled blood glucose levels at any level of care, with even poorer results reported for patients in rural areas. Gaps in access to care, quality challenges, and constraints in primary health care in rural areas remain severe [ 7 61 53 54 55 Disparities in access to health services due to social determinants are one of the major remaining challenges globally. Previous research has shown that socioeconomic status is the main determinant of chronic disease prevention and control in populations [ 62 20 29 20 22 23 63 Limitations of the study This review noted a lack of studies focused specifically on rural settings [ 23 Nevertheless, we summarise various findings of included studies in rural setting to response NCDs: training health workers, policy to improve access to services, allocate resources for infrastructure and equipment, and additional financing. For instance, one earlier study [ 38 23 28 Our literature screen and selection may have missed literatures. We also noticed that some good practices in provinces are not formally published. Although time series data from national NCD surveillance and population surveys are used in some evaluation studies, some outcomes are programme data or reported data with quality issues. Overall, studies were conducted on a small to medium scale. The long-term contribution and effects of these actions are yet to be investigated, indicating future research directions. CONCLUSIONS This review conducted a thematic analysis of the community integrated model for NCDs in China. At the policy level, it emphasises universal health coverage through provision of prevention, health promotion, and essential NCD disease management interventions and enhancing access at primary health care level. In practice, significant efforts were made to integrate public health and primary care into the service package delivered at primary health care level. The review characterises how hospitals, community health centres, the community, and local government collaborate to provide health care services and perform public health functions at primary health care level in China. This review identifies the key elements of the model, which largely align with the WHO PEN and an integrated approach tailored to its own context. Optimising accessibility, efficiency, and patient-centredness were positioned as primary objectives in the initial phase of the implementation.
