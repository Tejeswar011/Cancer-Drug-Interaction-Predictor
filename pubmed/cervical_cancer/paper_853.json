After 1 h of\nincubation, LS-1 (5 μM) effectively labeled HT-29 cells without\nany external stimulation. In contrast, MCF7 cells showed minimal fluorescence\ndue to low levels of endogenous lysosomal H 2 2 Figure 2 in vivo Chen\nand his research group developed a new series of NIR xanthene\ndyes by substituting one end with a hydroxyl group, serving as an\non/off switch, and the other end with an amine group known for its\ntunable spectroscopic properties. These were further modified with\nvarious fused pyrrolidine or piperazine moieties. The photophysical\nproperties of the dyes (WR3–WR10) were systematically analyzed.\nAll dyes exhibited bathochromic shifts, fluorescence changes from\ngreen to red (500–600 nm), and varying quantum yields. Among\nthem, WR3–WR6 showed the most promising performance due to\ntheir high quantum yields (Ø = 0.19–0.2). As a proof of\nconcept, dye WR6 was used to develop two NIR probes, WSP-NIR and SeSP-NIR\nfor H 2 via 2 Scheme Figure 2 6 (A) Synthesis of different\nfluorophores to test their photophysical\nproperties to select the best fluorophore for in vivo 2 2 5 Sensing Mechanisms of WSP/SeP Probes Both probes, WSP-NIR and SeSP-NIR (2 μM),\ndemonstrated high\nselectivity toward H 2 2 Figure 2 N 2 in vivo 2 Yan and his research group constructed\na novel near-infrared fluorescent\nprobe (DCP-H 2 2 Figure 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 – 2 2 2 2 2 Figure 2 2 2 2 2 in vivo 2 2 2 2 in vivo in vitro 7 (A) Reaction mechanism\nof DCP-H 2 2 2 em ex Ou-Yang et al. designed\nand synthesized a naphthalimide-based\nprobe,\nLyso-Nap, to detect H 2 Scheme 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 6 Reaction of Lyso-Nap\nwith H 2 Cell viability remained\nhigh (>93%) after\nHeLa cells were treated\nwith various concentrations of Lyso-Nap (0–30 μM) for\n24 h. Colocalization imaging of Lyso-Nap (10 μM) with LysoTracker\nRed in HeLa cells showed substantial overlap, confirming that Lyso-Nap\nselectively stains lysosomes. This was further supported by a high\nPearson colocalization coefficient (PCC) of 0.95 in the intensity\nscatter plot. HeLa cells incubated with Lyso-Nap alone showed minimal\nfluorescence.

Moving forward,\nit is essential to adopt standardized protocols to assess photostability,\nabsorption/emission stability, plasma protein binding, metabolic half-life,\nbiodistribution, and excretion profiles. Incorporating these parameters\nearly in the probe development pipeline will not only enhance translational\npotential but also support regulatory approval pathways for clinical\nimaging applications. 5 Next Generation Imaging Modalities\nfor Endogenous\nH 2 Although this review primarily focuses\non traditional fluorescence\nplatforms (e.g., coumarins, rhodamines, cyanines), it is essential\nto acknowledge emerging imaging modalities that are being increasingly\nexplored for detecting endogenous H 2 5.1 Near-Infrared II (NIR-II) Fluorophores NIR-II fluorophores (emission range 1000–1700 nm) enable deeper\ntissue penetration, higher spatial resolution, and superior signal-to-background\nratios compared to conventional fluorophores. in vivo 3+ 2 2 in vitro in vivo 5.2 Chemiluminescent Probes Unlike fluorescence\nprobes, chemiluminescent probes emit light via a chemical reaction\nand do not require external excitation, thereby eliminating background\nautofluorescence and improving imaging sensitivity. 2 2 In vivo 2 5.3 Photoacoustic Imaging (PAI) Probes Photoacoustic imaging\nprobes absorb pulsed laser light and generate\nultrasound waves, enabling real-time, high-resolution, deep-tissue\nimaging.
