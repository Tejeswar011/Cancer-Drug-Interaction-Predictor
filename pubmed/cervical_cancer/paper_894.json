The use of LB using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has significantly expanded in recent years due to the demand for less intrusive methods for diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring of cancer. 1 2 3 As research develops, incorporation of LB into standard clinical practice could enhance patient outcome and result in more accurate and effective ocular health care. This narrative review aims to comprehensively discuss the different applications of LB in ophthalmology. M ETHODS We conducted a search of all English-language literature on LB published in electronic databases following the Preferred Reporting System for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. In addition, a review of past articles on the use of LB in medicine was carried out. We conducted a search in the PubMed database using the following keywords and MeSH terms: “liquid biopsy” and “eye neoplasms” and “ocular tumors” and “ophthalmology”. A reviewer (CC) selected studies published between January 2000 and March 2024. Following the removal of duplicate entries, an initial screening of titles and abstracts was conducted and full texts of articles deemed potentially relevant were subsequently reviewed for eligibility. Articles focusing on the application of LB in ophthalmology were selected. Types of articles included were randomized trials, cohort studies, case–control studies, cross-sectional studies, and case series. Case reports, conference abstracts, and letters to the editor were excluded from the review. A total of 47 articles were included in this narrative review [ Figure 1 Figure 1 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram of study selection R ESULTS Liquid biopsy in retinoblastoma Retinoblastoma (RB) is a type of pediatric cancer that develops in a child’s developing retina. It is the most frequent intraocular tumor in children, affecting between 1/15 and 20,000 live births every year. 4 5 6 7 There was an acceleration of advancements in conservative management of RB over the past 20 years with the introduction of systemic chemotherapy and intra-arterial injections. A new conservative approach is currently taking place with LB. 8 9 in vivo 10 In patients’ plasma, cfDNA from intraocular RB which comes directly from the tumor cells can be detected and quantified. The idea of a blood plasma LB could provide the patient with several benefits over an AH sample. 11 12 et al 13 These findings can be used for the diagnosis and management of RB; however, new studies are emerging on the detection of cfDNA from AH. 14 15 16 et al 17 AH extraction is a minimally invasive approach that can be conducted during intravitreal injection of chemotherapy. This technique comes with a negligible risk of bleeding, infection, cataract, or iris trauma. The preliminary work by Berry et al 12 et al 10 18 19 17 20 21 22 23 23 Research has also shown that long noncoding RNAs may serve as potential biomarkers for detecting RB at various stages by targeting multiple miRNAs and transcription factors that are crucial in either stimulating or suppressing RB. 24 Research on LB in RB may help understand the different mechanisms that lead to treatment resistance thus enabling the identification of potential therapeutic targets. 16 et al 25 11 26 26 Liquid biopsy in uveal melanoma Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular tumor in adults and the most common cause of death because of an intraocular disease. Even with appropriate treatment, almost 50% of patients develop metastasis. It is thus important to make an early diagnosis and accurately predict the metastatic risk of a patient. Currently, tumor biopsies are required to assess the metastatic risk of UM. However, this method is invasive and comes with a lot of potential complications. It is thus important to develop less invasive strategies that can accurately predict the metastatic risk of UM. In addition, biomarkers for the early detection and progression of this tumor, in particular molecular indicators, are currently lacking in clinical practice. 27  Blood Bustamante et al r P r P 28 29 Herrspiegel et al P P P P 30 Another study investigated the potential role of biomarkers in determining the stage of tumor extension in patients with ultraviolet (UV). Researchers conducted exome isolation from the blood of subjects. Findings indicated that hsa-miR-144-5p and hsa-miR-191-5p were promising biomarkers, enabling differentiation between patients with localized and advanced UV. 27  Aqueous humor Conventionally, tumor biopsy was conducted to assess the metastatic risk of UM. However, this technique is quite invasive and puts the patient at risk of retinal detachment and tumor dissemination. Peng et al 31  Vitreous humor Velez et al P P 32 Liquid biopsy in vitreoretinal lymphoma Vitreoretinal lymphoma (VRL) is a rare type of ocular tumor. Conventionally, the diagnosis of VRL has been challenging, mainly because its clinical manifestations are very similar to uveitis. The main diagnostic tool remains the cytopathological examination, but its detection rate for VRL remains poor. We hereby summarize the latest findings regarding the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of VRL. Gu et al P 33 In addition, Cani et al 34 Other ocular tumors Although the use of LB has been mostly reported in RB and UV, its application in other ocular malignancies including conjunctival melanoma, conjunctival lymphoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and sebaceous carcinoma is expanding. LB has yet to be specifically investigated in the context of conjunctival melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma. However, it is reasonable to suggest that methodologies developed for cutaneous melanoma might be applicable to conjunctival cases. 35 Choroidal metastases represent the most common intraocular malignancies in adults, despite being asymptomatic for most cases. They are most frequently associated with breast and lung cancers. The improvement in survival rates for these cancers has led to an increased incidence of detected choroidal metastases. Typically, these metastases are diagnosed at advanced stages, limiting the use of LB. Nevertheless, it may still be beneficial in specific scenarios, such as when the primary malignancy is unknown, when obtaining a biopsy from the primary tumor proves difficult. 36 D ISCUSSION Recent advancements in medical research have paved the way for innovative diagnostic approaches in health care. One such promising development is the integration of LB in ophthalmology, presenting a paradigm shift in standard clinical practice. The use of LB in hematologic and solid tumors has proven to be reliable and accurate, notably in the detection of tumor markers. LB may also reveal intratumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution in response to treatment or help predict tumor relapse. 1 1 2 LB plays a crucial role in molecular diagnosis by identifying various biomarkers. These include CTC, cfDNA, cRNA, miRNA, and TREs. 37 The literature suggests that miRNAs play a crucial role in cancer by upregulating various oncogenes. In the context of UM, miRNAs have emerged as valuable biomarkers for both diagnosis and prognosis, offering insights into the progression of the disease and potential therapeutic targets. 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 Research has shown that individuals with metastatic UM exhibit higher concentrations of total exosomes in their venous blood compared to healthy individuals. 40 45 46 47 48 49 This article provides a comprehensive exploration of the application of LB in three ocular malignancies – RB, UM, and VRL and the potential application in different ocular tumors. In RB, where traditional tumor biopsies pose risks of extraocular tumor spread, LB, particularly from AH, emerges as a promising alternative, offering a secure method for detecting cfDNA and insights into the methylation status. 12 25 29 These advancements offer valuable insights for personalized treatment strategies in ocular malignancies. LB allows for the noninvasive detection of genetic and molecular changes associated with different malignancies. The incorporation of LB into standard clinical practice in ophthalmology represents a transformative step toward more precise, patient-centered ocular health care. LB techniques offer a wealth of benefits that can revolutionize the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of ocular malignancies. Furthermore, evaluating the feasibility of integrating LB into routine screening protocols for high-risk populations and assessing its cost-effectiveness compared to traditional methods could potentially enable earlier detection of ocular tumors and improve prognosis. The studies reviewed demonstrate the potential of LB in ocular oncology; however, there are several limitations that must be considered. A primary limitation is the heterogeneity across studies, including variability in study design, sample types, and biomarker detection methods, which limits the generalizability of findings. In addition, translating biomarkers from research into clinical practice poses substantial challenges. The absence of standardized protocols, inconsistencies in sensitivity and specificity, and concerns regarding cost and accessibility must be addressed to enable wider clinical adoption. Future research should focus on large-scale, standardized studies to validate promising biomarkers in ocular oncology and explore strategies to integrate LB technologies into routine clinical practice effectively. Overall, this noninvasive approach not only enhances diagnostic accuracy but also holds promise for guiding biologically targeted therapies, emphasizing the ongoing progress of LB technology to redefine the field, but future research is necessary to further guide its use in clinical practice. In conclusion, LB has proven its efficacy in the management of diverse ocular tumors such as RB, UM, and VRL. Integrating noninvasive techniques such as LB into routine clinical practice has the potential to improve patient outcomes significantly, fostering a more precise and effective approach to ocular health care.
