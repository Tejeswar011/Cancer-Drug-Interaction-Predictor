Introduction Cervical cancer (CaCx) is a significant global health challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where it is the second leading cause of cancer mortality among women [ 1 2 3 4 5 2 3 4 5 The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for action to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health issue by achieving an incidence rate of less than 4 per 100,000 women-years [ 1 6 7 3 In South Africa, cervical cancer remains a major public health concern, with the Eastern Cape Province experiencing higher incidence and mortality rates [ 4 7 4 8 5 9 1 1 10 In rural communities, primary healthcare clinics staffed by nurses serve as the main point of care, providing early cancer diagnosis and improving survival outcomes [ 5 5 6 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design This was a cross-sectional study. 2.2. Setting The study was conducted at 12 selected facilities in OR Tambo and Alfred Nzo districts in the Eastern Cape Province, which are Mntwana Clinic, Mount Frere Gateway Clinic, Dr Malizimpehle Gateway Clinic, Mthatha Gateway Clinic, St Barnabas Gateway Clinic, Mhlakulo CHC, Qumbu CHC, Mqanduli CHC, Mbekweni CHC, Baziya CHC and Isilimela Hospital. 2.3. Population The study population comprised professional nurses and enrolled nurses working at specified health institutions in the OR Tambo and Alfred Nzo districts of the Eastern Cape province. These were selected due to their typical direct involvement in cervical cancer screening and management in the province. 2.4. Sampling Procedure and Sample Size Calculation Purposive sampling was used to select the study participants among consenting health professionals responsible for cancer screening in 12 health facilities in the OR Tambo and Alfred Nzo districts. The sample size was calculated using the following formula: n = Z ∝ 2 × P ( 100 − P ) e 2 n = ( 1.96 ) 2 × 50 ( 100 − 50 ) 10 2 = 3.84 × 2500 100 = 96 95% confidence level: (Z α Margin of error (e) = 10% A sample size of 96 healthcare workers directly involved in cervical cancer screening and management was required for the study, where 20% was added to account for non-response and confounding bias, giving a total sample size of 108 participants. 2.5. Data Collection A validated structured self-administered questionnaire [ 11 Table S1 Data was collected by the researcher alone to ensure consistency and was validated using structured and interviewer-administered questionnaires. The questionnaire collected information on respondents’ demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to cervical cancer and cervical cancer screening. The questionnaire consisted of 30 items, distributed evenly across three domains: knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Knowledge questions covered risk factors, symptoms, and screening guidelines. Attitude items explored beliefs and perceptions regarding cervical cancer and screening. Practice questions assessed self-reported screening-related behaviors. Eligible participants were approached during staff meetings and provided with detailed information about the study’s purpose, procedures, and confidentiality measures. Written informed consent was obtained prior to questionnaire administration. Participation was voluntary, with no financial compensation provided. 2.6. Data Analysis Data entry and management were conducted using Microsoft Excel, while data analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, version 29 (IBM SPSS Statistics). Results were presented according to demographics, knowledge, attitudes, and practices, and were displayed in tables as frequencies (n) and proportions (%). Logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between selected predictor variables and the level of knowledge (inadequate vs. adequate). Associations were tested using a 95% confidence interval, and a p 2.7. Validity and Reliability The study used validated questions from other studies to ensure accuracy and consistency. To ensure the reliability and relevance of the research instrument, a pilot study was conducted among ten participants who were subsequently excluded from the study. The data collection tool was revised according to pre-test findings prior to its implementation. 2.8. Variable Measurement Knowledge, attitudes, and practices were assessed using 30 questions: that is, 10 questions for each, corresponding to a maximum of 10 points (100%). Knowledge was rated as adequate or inadequate, attitudes as positive or negative, and practices as either good or bad, based on participant responses. The total score for each category of knowledge, attitudes, and practices was dichotomised using percentiles, where the 70th percentile was the cut-off value. Participants who scored above the 70th percentile (7 out of 10 or 70%) were coded “1”, representing adequate knowledge, positive attitudes, or good practices. Those participants scoring below the 70th percentile were coded “0”, representing inadequate knowledge, negative attitudes, or bad practices. 3. Results 3.1. Demographic Information A total of 108 nurses responsible for providing cervical cancer services participated in the study ( Table 1 Knowledge with regard to cervical cancer screening was assessed against nurses’ demographic characteristics, including their knowledge regarding cervical cancer screening ( Table 2 p Logistic regression on characteristics of nurses influencing their knowledge of cervical cancer screening and management consistently found that a higher academic qualification is significantly associated with adequate knowledge ( p Table 3 p 3.2. Participants’ Attitudes Toward Cervical Cancer Screening In logistic regression, professional nurses were more likely to have positive attitudes compared to enrolled nurses ( Table 4 p Regarding practices, none of the assessed sociodemographic and personal characteristic predictors were significantly associated with cervical cancer screening practices ( p 12 4. Discussion Findings from this study indicate that adequate knowledge of and positive attitudes toward cervical cancer screening among the participating nurses were both independently influenced by higher academic qualifications, despite the common specialized training background or prior universal exposure to specialized training on cervical cancer screening. Related practices were not influenced by any of the studied predictor variables, such as participant demographics, age group, or years of professional experience, as most participants reported good screening practices. In concurrence with findings from this study, existing evidence shows that advanced education can enhance positive understanding and foster positive attitudes toward cervical cancer screening [ 4 11 13 14 14 15 The inconsistency in study findings—where practices were not significantly influenced by any of the studied factors, yet concomitant differences in knowledge and attitudes were based on academic qualifications—may have been influenced by several factors. In light of the findings, it could have been scientifically plausible if inadequate knowledge and negative attitudes were associated with bad practices, and good practices were associated with adequate knowledge and positive attitudes [ 4 11 13 16 15 15 16 16 Future studies must consider more objective ways to determine attitudes and practices beyond self-reported data, such as through observational studies, chart reviews or audits, performance metrics or indicators, behavioral assessments or simulations, and peer review or supervisor evaluations, triangulating the approaches where possible [ 17 18 5. Conclusions In conclusion, the findings highlight the need for targeted training interventions to enhance cervical cancer screening competencies among nurses, particularly those with lower academic training, such as enrolled nurses. To inform effective training programs, policies, and strategies in rural settings, it is essential to tailor training content to address specific knowledge and skill gaps, incorporate felt needs and context-specific challenges, and prioritize capacity-building initiatives that support nurses in delivering high-quality cervical care, ultimately contributing to the reduction in disparities in rural areas.
