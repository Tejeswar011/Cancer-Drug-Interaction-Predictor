Prominent GRPs such as GRP78, GRP94/gp96, GRP75, and GRP170 play a great role in cancer cell survival and progression by promoting protein folding, immune evasion, and resistance to therapy. Within the tumor microenvironment, which is characterized by hypoxia, acidosis, and nutrient deprivation, GRPs can facilitate critical processes including proliferation, angiogenesis, metastasis, and apoptotic resistance. Moreover, beyond their intracellular roles, GRPs have been found to possess considerable immunogenic potential when expressed on the cell surface or secreted. As a result, these findings have led to the development of GRP-based cancer vaccines that can elicit robust adaptive immune responses by chaperoning tumor antigens to antigen-presenting cells. Current evidence suggests GRP75 (HSPA9/mortalin) is less immediately tractable than ER-resident GRPs (78/94/170) for vaccine design, primarily owing to its mitochondrial localization and poor antigen accessibility. However, nanoparticle-mediated delivery or CRISPR-engineered surface expression could reposition it as a future target, pending advances in intracellular antigen presentation pathways. Preclinical models have demonstrated that GRP-based immunotherapy can induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses and tumor regression. Additionally, repurposing GRP-targeted strategies from infectious, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disease contexts may offer promising translational avenues in the field of cancer. Despite encouraging results, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity, immune suppression, and delivery optimization have still remained. Therefore, future research should aim to increase antigen specificity, optimize vaccine formulations, and explore combinatory regimens to overcome resistance mechanisms in cancer cells. Overall, GRP-targeted vaccines represent a very compelling candidate in cancer immunotherapy with great potentials for clinical translation in the future.

Unlike conventionally secreted proteins, GRPs lack N-terminal signal sequences and therefore exit cells through non-classical, stress-associated mechanisms [ 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 GRPs as cancer vaccines GRPs are known as one of the tumor antigens which can potentially be targeted for therapeutic purposes in the field of cancer. Indeed, there is evidence that GRP94/gp96 and GRP78 can play crucial roles in tumor immunology. For example, GRP94/gp96 has been shown to chaperone tumor-specific antigens and can be utilized in cancer vaccines to stimulate an immune response against tumors. Administration of the antigen (e.g., GRP78) in mice triggers coordinated humoral and cellular immune responses. The humoral arm (up) induces antigen-specific B-cell differentiation and antibody production, while the cellular arm (down) activates cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) for targeted tumor cell elimination. This synergy exemplifies the mechanistic basis of GRP-directed cancer vaccines (Fig. 2 48 49 50 51 51  Fig. 2 Cancer vaccines GRPs elicit robust anti-tumor response; they can stimulate immune responses against tumors from both humoral and cellular immune pathways Moreover, tumor-derived GRP170 vaccination has effectively lowered lung metastatic disease and stimulated tumor-specific CD8 + 25 52 In this article, we have reviewed, as far as possible, all studies that have employed GRPs to induce immunity against various cancers in three major categories GRP78, GRP94/gp96, and GRP170. The studies related to these three categories are listed in the next sections. Methods Study design This study was planned to conduct a complete review of using GRPs as vaccines in cancer prevention and treatment. Although not registered in PROSPERO because this review integrates both preclinical and clinical datasets, which fall outside the registry’s primary scope, all methodological steps—including predefined eligibility criteria, comprehensive search strategy, independent dual screening, and transparent study selection—were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The most pertinent title-related discoveries have been covered here. Notably, our goal was to organize and classify the released data to make it easier to review. Eligibility criteria Studies were eligible if they investigated the structural, functional, or therapeutic aspects of GRP-based vaccines in cancer models or clinical settings. Inclusion was not restricted by study design and encompassed preclinical, mechanistic, and clinical studies. Articles in languages other than English, studies on non-antigenic GRPs (e.g., GRP75), and non-cancer studies were excluded. Sources of data and search strategy We systematically searched Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Crossref from inception to June 30, 2025, with no language or publication date restrictions. The search strategy combined controlled vocabulary and free-text terms related to GRPs and cancer vaccines, using Boolean operators “AND” and “OR”. Additional clinical trial data were retrieved from ClinicalTrials.gov and other trial registries. Study selection Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts for relevance, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. Full-text articles were then assessed against the eligibility criteria. A total of 282 records were initially identified; after removing 74 duplicates and 69 irrelevant records, 139 articles underwent full-text review. Of these, 50 were excluded due to unrelated antigens, non-antigenic GRPs such as GRP75, or non-cancer focus, and 61 were retained solely for background context. In parallel, 16 GRP-based cancer vaccine clinical trial records were identified through targeted registry searches. These are presented separately in the Results section to highlight translational relevance. The selection process is illustrated in the PRISMA flow diagram (Fig. 3  Fig. 3 Systematic review flow chart of the first literature search according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines Data extraction and risk of bias assessment Data were extracted independently by two reviewers using a standardized form, capturing study design, GRP target, vaccine formulation, model or patient population, immune outcomes, and clinical endpoints. Where available, statistical values (mean ± SD, p) were recorded. Results Studies were categorized into three distinct groups according to their primary experimental design: (i) Prophylactic Studies, defined as investigations wherein vaccination or immunomodulation preceded tumor challenge; (ii) Therapeutic Studies, encompassing interventions administered following tumor establishment to evaluate regression or disease control; and (iii) Mechanistic Studies, comprising in vitro, ex vivo, or biochemical assays designed to elucidate immune cell activation, antigen presentation pathways, or molecular interactions. Within each category, studies were further sub-grouped by GRP target (GRP78, GRP94/gp96, and GRP1700 and their findings are summarized narratively in the following subsections, with extracted data presented in Table 1 Prophylactic studies GRP78 Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in women globally and ranks as the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality among females [ 53 P P P P P P P P 54 Another study by this team was conducted using BALB/c mice (divided into test and control groups), which were immunized with the cGRP78 protein and then the response of antibodies against cGRP78 in the sera of immunized mice to different cancer cells was assayed by Cell-ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). After that, the cellular immunity response was determined by splenocyte proliferation assay with different cancer antigens. Also, the effect of vaccination on metastasis was investigated in vaccinated mice by injecting melanoma cancer cells into the tail of mice. The results suggested the cGRP78 vaccine’s ability to stimulate humoral immunity in mice, showing it effectively produced antibodies against various cancer cell lines, with Hela and HepG2 cells having the highest reaction. The vaccine also significantly increased the proliferation of immune cells, particularly against the B16F10 melanoma cell line. This suggests a strong cellular immune response, which is crucial for cancer immunotherapy. The results indicate that the cGRP78 vaccine could be a promising approach for preventing melanoma metastasis and potentially other cancers, though further in vivo testing is needed [ 55 Brentville et al. investigated the possibility of targeting citrullinated GRP78 for cancer immunotherapy. Post-translationally converting arginine to citrulline changes protease activity, resulting in the creation of unique peptides in stressed cells which can be recognized by CD4 + + + + 56 According to Brentville and associates, citrullinated GRP78 is a useful tumor antigen, and vaccination against it could offer a successful cancer treatment strategy. They utilized an antibody against this antigen to investigate its expression in both human and murine tumor cells. The citrullinated peptide was detected in B16 cell line and its vaccine was evaluated in a murine melanoma model for cancer therapy. It was found that the responses of the CD4 T cell to this peptide are limited to HLA-DR*0101 and HLA DP*0401 alleles. This epitope was found by Mass spectrometry (MS) in the B16 cell line, and effective treatment of melanoma in an animal model (transgenic mouse) is determined by CD4 responses that are specific to citrulline to two peptides that coverage of this epitope. Ultimately, the presence of a set of responses to this peptide was found in healthy subjects with 76% of subjects exhibiting a response to citrullinated GRP78 peptide [ 56 Overall, prophylactic vaccination based on GRP78 -most notably the C-terminal and citrullinated forms thereof- has exhibited considerable immunogenicity in preclinical models through eliciting stronger humoral and cellular immune responses. Indeed, such vaccines have been able to impede tumor proliferation and growth, inhibit metastasis, and eventually improve survival, particularly in melanoma and breast cancer models. Hence, targeting citrullinated GRP78 may suggest a novel HLA-restricted strategy for CD4⁺ T cell-mediated immunotherapy for cancer treatment. GRP94/gp96 It has been shown that immunizing mice against GRP94/gp96 extracted from a specific tumor can produce immunity against that specific tumor but not against others. Udono et al. found that GRP94/gp96 from methylcholanthrene (Meth A) sarcoma could stimulate specific tumor resistance, while GRP94/gp96 from normal tissues was not immunogenic against Meth A-induced sarcoma. After receiving 9 µg of Meth A GRP94/gp96 vaccination, which had provided protection against 80,000 Meth A cells in 100% of the inoculated mice, it was shown that 3 out of 5 mice were immune against tumor challenge. In contrast, no mouse was immune to a tumor challenge when inoculated with any of the three dosages of GRP94/gp96 derived from normal tissues. Upon receiving 9 µg of Meth A-derived GRP94/gp96 vaccination, all 4/4 animals in each group demonstrated protection against tumor challenge. The results of this study suggested that GRP94/gp96 might activate some auto-HSP-reactive T helper cells, which produce IL-2 and other lymphokines that support in growing of the number of anti-tumors CTLs precursors. In addition, GRP94/gp96 enhanced the transport of peptides to MHC class I in the ER by acting as a generic peptide-acceptor [ 57 In order to induce antitumor T-cell responses, Zheng et al. established a preliminary protocol for the administration of DC-based vaccines including GRP94/gp96 from the placenta. Placental GRP94/gp96 was efficaciously absorbed by CD11-positive dendritic cells, derived from the bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) and led to modest maturation in BMDC. Cytotoxic T-cells and splenocytes produced with murine BMDCs pulsed with placental GRP94/gp96 particularly lysed LLC lung cancer and B16 melanoma cells. In lung carcinoma and melanoma animal models, compared to mice treated with either placental GRP94/gp96 or liver GRP94/gp96-pulsed BMDCs, a significant reduction in mortality and tumor growth was observed upon immunization by BMDCs stimulated with placental GRP94/gp96. This vaccine elicited potent cross-reactive tumor-specific T-cell responses [ 58 Given the abovementioned findings, prophylactic vaccination with tumor-derived GRP94/gp96 may establish strong tumor-specific immunity, with no significant cross-protection against GRP94/gp96 of normal tissues. Besides, dendritic cell-based vaccines pulsed with placenta-derived GRP94/gp96 have elicited cross-reactive cytotoxic T-cell responses and, as a result, substantially reduced tumor growth and mortality in lung cancer and melanoma models, putting forward the eligibility of GRP94/gp96 as a promising tumor-specific immune activator. GRP170 Prostate cancer remains a leading malignancy among males globally, with incidence rates experiencing a marked rise over the past ten years [ 59 60 60 Yuan et al. demonstrated that the GRP170–Pokemon chaperone complex could be a promising strategy for immunotherapy against cancer. They created a natural chaperone complex by heat shock using the Pokemon and GRP170. In addition, its immunogenicity was evaluated by 51Cr-release assays and ELISPOT in vitro, as well as tumor-bearing animal models. The outcomes of this study showed that the GRP170 Pokemon chaperone complex was able to induce T cell responses as found by 51Cr-release assays and ELISPOT. Besides, immunized C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously injected with Lewis’s lung carcinoma cells to create primary tumors. The GRP170–Pokemon chaperone complex substantially reduced tumor growth and extended the survival of tumor-bearing subjects [ 61 Wang et al. investigated how molecular engineering to target extracellular GRP170 could impact tumor immunogenicity and its potential use as a cancer vaccine. When GRP170, deprived of its ER retention sequence “KNDEL,” was secreted by B16 tumor cells, it retained its chaperone function and outperformed other heat shock proteins like HSP70 and GRP94/gp96 in generating an immune response. In vivo studies showed that GRP170 secretion significantly reduced the tumorigenicity of B16F10 cells without affecting their growth rate or transformed phenotype. C57BL/6 mice that rejected B16F10 cells secreting GRP170 (B16F10-sGRP170) developed a strong CTL response against melanocyte differentiation antigen TRP2 and exhibited resistance to future tumor challenges. Additionally, B16F10-sGRP170 cells stimulated dendritic cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1β. The in vivo experiments also highlighted the role of natural killer (NK) cells in eliminating B16F10-sGRP170 cells, with both NK and CD8 + T cells required for long-term immunity. Although both secreted and endogenous GRP170 exhibited strong tumor-protective effects, the secreted form proved to be more effective. These findings suggested that engineering tumor cells to secrete GRP170 could activate both innate and adaptive immune responses, presenting an innovative approach to cancer immunotherapy. By modifying B16 melanoma cells to release GRP170 without the KNDEL signal, the immune system’s response to the tumor was significantly enhanced. This modified GRP170 aided in presenting tumor antigens, such as TRP2 peptides, to immune cells, contributing to tumor resistance. The study found that NK and CD8 + T cells were both critical for combating the tumor following vaccination with GRP170-secreting cells. While the use of GRP170-secreting tumor cells showed promise as a cancer vaccine, the complexity of genetically modified tumor cells might present challenges for clinical application. To address this, the authors suggested that delivering GRP170 directly to tumors using vectors like adenovirus could be a more feasible approach. Overall, extracellular targeting of GRP170 represents a promising strategy for enhancing anti-tumor immunity and advancing cancer therapy [ 62 Another study by wang et al. showed that vaccination with tumor-derived GRP170 significantly suppressed tumor growth, resulting in smaller tumors and fewer pulmonary tumor nodules (58.8 ± 17.6 colonies per mouse) compared to naive mice (132.4 ± 9.4 colonies per mouse), and prolonged survival, with 20% of mice surviving over 50 days. The adoptive transfer of B16F10-GRP170-primed splenocytes also significantly reduced tumor burden in mice with lung metastases, indicating greater antitumor immunity ( p 52 Arniouk and colleagues employed a tumor cell system that secretes GRP170 to explore whether tumor cells engineered for GRP170 secretion could provoke a specific immune response against the tumor. They also investigated GRP170’s capability to bind and transport a full-length tumor antigen from within the tumor cells. To facilitate this, murine sGRP170 (secreted GRP170) cDNA was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector, creating a recombinant plasmid that was then used to transfect Colon-26 murine adenocarcinoma cells. BALB/c mice were inoculated with three different variants as the following: wild-type Colon-26, mock-transfected Colon-26, and Colon-26 cells transfected with sGRP170-pcDNA. Mice receiving wild-type or mock-transfected Colon-26 developed rapidly growing tumors. In contrast, those inoculated with sGRP170-transfected Colon-26 initially exhibited tumor growth but subsequently experienced tumor regression and rejection. A depletion study was conducted on T lymphocyte subsets to investigate the underlying immunological mechanisms responsible for this tumor rejection. The in vivo depletion of both CD4 + and CD8 + T-lymphocyte populations, as well as CD8 + cells alone, inhibited the rejection of sGRP170-transfected Colon-26 tumors; however, depleting CD4 + cells alone did not have the same effect. To assess whether sGRP170 could aid in transporting full-length tumor antigens, the culture media from both transfected and mock-transfected Colon-26 cell cultures were purified. The protein gp70, known to be present in Colon 26 cells, was detected only in the supernatant of sGRP170-transfected Colon-26 cells. This indicated that sGRP170 bound to its substrate within the cell and facilitated its transport to the extracellular environment. To confirm this finding, monkey Cos-7 cells were transfected with sGRP170-pcDNA3.1 or mock-transfected with pcDNA3.1. The large and small T-antigens (tumor antigens in Cos-7 cells) were only found in the eluant from sGRP170-pcDNA3.1 transfected Cos-7 cells. The authors proposed that this strategy holds potential as a tumor-specific vaccine applicable to various histological types of tumors [ 63 Altogether, prophylactic vaccination using GRP170, both in tumor-derived and engineered forms, has shown robust antitumor efficacy in different types of cancer. Indeed, its capability to chaperone full-length tumor antigens and elicit CD8⁺ T-cell responses -while overcoming HLA restriction- underscores the distinctive advantage of GRP170 over other GRPs. GRP170 holds great promise as an eligible and versatile candidate for tumor-specific prophylactic vaccination. Therapeutic studies GRP94/gp96 Tamura et al. investigated the efficacy of GRP94/gp96 preparations from D122, a highly metastatic 3LL (Lewis’s lung carcinoma) clone, to remove an underlying tumor. When D122-GRP94/gp96 was administered to mice instead of PBS, the primary footpad tumor’s development rate was slowed down. The efficacy of the GRP94/gp96 vaccination was nullified if any CD4 + + + + 64 Talebi et al. demonstrated that co-delivery of Hp91 with E7 protein significantly increased IFN-γ levels and induced the highest levels of both IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies, showing a strong Th1-type immune response. Immunization with rE7 + Hp91 and rE7 + Montanide provided complete tumor regression and 100% survival over 60 days, while rE7 + rNT-GRP94/gp96 resulted in 75% tumor-free mice and a significant delay in tumor growth. The rE7 + rNT-GRP94/gp96 group showed lower efficacy compared to the other groups, with a 50% survival rate and a 25% reduction in therapeutic efficacy compared to preventive studies. Control groups showed no significant immune response or tumor protection. The study illustrates that combining rE7 with adjuvants such as Montanide, Hp91, and rNT-GRP94/gp96 significantly enhanced both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. Specifically, rE7 + Hp91 and rE7 + Montanide induced robust Th1-type immune responses, providing 100% tumor-free survival in preventive and therapeutic settings. In contrast, rE7 + rNT-GRP94/gp96 showed lower efficacy with 50–75% tumor-free survival. The results suggested that Hp91 was a potent adjuvant for enhancing Th1 responses and anti-tumor immunity, making it a promising candidate for future vaccine development against HPV infections. Further research is needed to explore larger animal models’ co-delivery mechanisms and clinical effects [ 65 Liu et al. reported that AdsGRP94/gp96-based immunotherapy in combination with radiation therapy might be a helpful method for cancer therapy. They investigated the therapeutic efficiency of radiation therapy combined with GRP94/gp96-based genetic immunotherapy in the 4T1 mouse mammary cancer model, which is highly metastatic and weakly immunogenic. An adenovirus that could encode the secretable form of the GRP94/gp96 gene was established and assessed in different anticancer assays (AdsGRP94/gp96). Adenoviral vectors were injected directly into tumors alongside radiation therapy. AdsGRP94/gp96-infected 4T1 cells were totally prohibited from tumor growth following injection of 107 cells/mouse. Moreover, vaccines alone had no effect on the formation of local and metastatic tumors in existing tumor models. Nevertheless, vaccination could significantly inhibit the development of localized tumors and lung metastases [ 66 In the other study, Li et al. proposed a vaccine immunotherapy approach for treating sarcoma. They prepared a GRP94/gp96/peptide vaccine and a multisubtype HSP (mHSP)/peptide vaccine for comparison. These peptides were extracted from tumors grown in C57BL/6 mice. The GRP94/gp96/peptide and mHSP/peptide vaccines showed no cytotoxicity in flow cytometry, indicating their suitability for in vivo injection. In murine antitumor experiments, the mHSP/peptide vaccine demonstrated better efficacy against sarcoma compared to the GRP94/gp96/peptide vaccine. Next, the mHSP/peptide vaccine was used with or without a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor. The findings indicated that concurrent use of immunotherapy with a PD-L1 inhibitor was more effective in preventing bone degeneration compared to individual treatments. Cytokine secretion studies revealed that while treatment with vaccines alone or with a PD-L1 inhibitor stimulated cytokine secretion, these effects gradually diminished over time. The vaccines by themselves triggered the activation of CD8 + + + + 67 Graner et al. investigated the peptidome of potential antigens extracted from CRCL derived from a murine tumor called 12B1. This study utilized the 12B1 murine leukemia cell line, which expresses the human BCR-ABL protein, to generate tumor-derived CRCL. In parallel, normal liver CRCL was produced using livers sourced from BALB/c mice. Both tumor and normal liver tissues underwent free solution isoelectric focusing. The researchers subsequently combined fractions containing chaperone proteins HSP70, HSP90, GRP94/gp96, and calreticulin to formulate vaccines. These vaccines were treated with acid to eliminate peptides, followed by isolation of the peptides from denatured proteins using reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The resulting fractions were analyzed through mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS), revealing that some identified peptides had previously been associated with tumor and autoimmune antigens. The analysis identified nearly 60 distinct proteins as the source of the CRCL peptides, originating from various cellular compartments. Gene ontology and Ingenuity pathway analyses of these parent proteins highlighted their significant roles in cancer signaling pathways. The RANKPEP predictive server identified several high-affinity binding sites for BALB/c MHC I (H2Kd) within multiple peptide sequences derived from the CRCL, with approximately half of these peptides also showing potential binding affinity to MHC II (IAd). Notably, some peptides exhibited consensus sequences with an affinity for the peptide-binding pocket of the HSP70 family member DnaK. Subsequently, the researchers explored whether introducing these peptides into normal murine Liver CRCL could facilitate tumor rejection. They pooled fractions of peptides stripped from 12B1 CRCL into groups of ten and mixed each pool with normal liver CRCL prepared from syngeneic BALB/c tissue. The resultant vaccines were administered to mice bearing 12B1 tumors. The findings demonstrated that mice receiving vaccines reconstituted with all 40 peptide fractions exhibited significantly reduced tumor growth compared to control groups immunized solely with liver CRCL. Interestingly, mice treated with liver CRCL combined with specific peptide fractions (1–10 or 21–30) displayed even more pronounced reductions in tumor growth rates. Based on these results, the authors asserted that peptides derived from CRCL might play a great role in enhancing adaptive immunity [ 68 Another study by Fromm et al. employed a combination vaccine incorporating GRP94/gp96-Ig and T-cell co-stimulator (OX40L, ICOSL, or 4-1BBL). Findings indicated that the ComPACT/OX40L vaccine significantly enhanced antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell priming, immune response, and memory formation, leading to superior tumor control in preclinical models of melanoma and colorectal carcinoma. In preclinical mouse models, combining the GRP94/gp96-Ig vaccine (ImPACT) with an OX40 agonist mAb doubled the antigen-specific CD8 + T cell response compared to the vaccine alone. ComPACT/4-1BBL produced minimal enhancement during the primary response and a moderate boost effect, but it lacked significant upregulation of IFNγ and did not increase Treg numbers. Moreover, ComPACT/ICOSL, while inducing some expansion of antigen-specific CD8⁺ T cells and upregulation of IL-2 and granzyme B, showed relatively modest effects compared to OX40L and failed to generate a robust memory or recall response after boosting. ComPACT/OX40L outperformed systemic OX40 agonist antibodies by avoiding off-target immune activation and cytokine release, focusing the immune response on antigen-specific cells, and achieving higher rates of tumor rejection and long-term survival (78% survival and 11% complete tumor rejection in B16.F10; 80% survival and 47% complete tumor rejection in CT26). ComPACT/OX40L significantly increased memory precursor (CD127 + KLRG1–) and mature memory T cells (CD127 + KLRG1+) without affecting short-lived effector cells, and enhanced T-cell activation markers (IFNG, IL2, GZMB) without increasing regulatory T cells. This approach led to superior tumor rejection and durable memory responses, suggesting that local T-cell co-stimulation with vaccination could improve cancer immunotherapy outcomes by enhancing specificity and reducing systemic adverse effects [ 69 Given the abovementioned findings, therapeutic application of GRP94/gp96 demonstrated significant tumor suppression, most notably when combined with adjuvants, checkpoint inhibitors, or co-stimulatory molecules such as OX40L. These strategies could enhance CD8⁺ T-cell responses, thwart metastasis, and improve survival in different models. Of note, modified delivery platforms and multi-peptide CRCL formulations were able to further increase tumor rejection, highlighting the great promise of GRP94/gp96-based personalized immunotherapies for treatment of cancer. GRP170 A study by Wang et al. investigated the efficacy of GRP170 and HSP110 vaccines; it was discovered that immunizing against methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma with pure HSP110 or GRP170 caused the tumor to completely disappear. GRP170 or HSP 110 isolated from Colon 26 tumors resulted in considerable growth suppression of this tumor in a second tumor model. Moreover, following tumor transplantation, GRP170 or HSP110 immunization considerably increased the longevity of the mice bearing Colon 26 tumor. Indeed, animals inoculated with tumor-derived GRP170 or HSP110 developed a tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cell response. Administering dendritic cells derived from bone-marrow, which pulsed with the aforementioned proteins, for mice also resulted in a robust antitumor response. They also found that moderate, fever-like hyperthermia could improve the vaccine efficacy of HSP110 and heat shock cognate 70, unlike GRP170. These findings suggested that GRP170 and HSP110 could be employed in HSP-based cancer immunotherapy. Furthermore, antigen-presenting dendritic cells could be applied to facilitate this healing strategy, and fever-like hyperthermia was able to considerably improve the vaccine efficacy of HSPs [ 25 Yu et al. developed a chimeric protein, Fla-GRP170, by combining the ATP-binding domain truncated GRP170 with the Flagellin NF-κB-activating domain, serving as a “danger” signal. The resulting construct was then incorporated into replication-defective recombinant adenoviruses (Ad. FlaGRP170 FlaGRP170 FlaGRP170 Ad. FlaGRP170 + Ad. FlaGRP170 Ad. FlaGRP170 Ad. FlaGRP170 70 Overall, GRP170-based therapeutic vaccines, including native and engineered forms such as Fla-GRP170, has exhibited significant tumor suppression, improved T-cell activation, and prolonged survival in melanoma, colon, and prostate cancer models. In addition, their capacity to promote cross-presentation and overcome immune tolerance highlights the applicability of GRP170 as a all-round immunotherapeutic platform for metastatic and refractory cancers. Mechanistic studies GRP94/gp96 A study by Izadpanah and colleagues explored the induction of immune responses against cancer stem cells (CSCs) to improve cancer vaccine efficacy, highlighting the significance of HSPs, particularly GRP94/gp96, in triggering anti-tumor immunity. The researchers successfully enriched CSCs from breast tumor tissue samples and cultured them to assess the expression of CSC markers and stemness-related genes. Their findings indicated that tumor-derived mammospheres were enriched with CSCs and exhibited higher expression levels of stemness genes compared to conventional breast cancer cell lines. Additionally, the study sought to determine the optimal temperature for enhancing GRP94/gp96 expression in grade 3 breast cancer spheres. Results demonstrated that incubating these mammospheres at temperatures between 42 and 43 °C for 60 min effectively upregulated GRP94/gp96 protein levels. The study suggested that this heat-induced GRP94/gp96 upregulation in CSC-enriched mammospheres could serve as a valuable strategy to create more immunogenic antigens for use in immunotherapy [ 71 Bleifuss and colleagues employed an in vivo human model of melanoma to evaluate the ability of chaperone-rich cell lysate (CRCL) to present endogenous tumor antigens. Their aim was to investigate whether CRCL was able to induce antigen-specific T cells through the dendritic cell (DC) cross-presentation pathway. The four main CRCL chaperones obtained from human melanoma lines were Hsp90, Hsp/Hsc70, calreticulin, and GRP94/gp96. Interestingly, chaperones in melanoma cell-derived CRCL were able to improve the cross-presentation of mixed exogenous peptides in CRCL production. Even in the presence of active chaperones, CRCL derived from melanoma cells was not able to deliver antigens related to melanoma to dendritic cells. As a result, these antigens were not employed for cross-presentation and recognition of cytotoxic T cells. The same results were also observed even after increasing the intracellular protein levels of tumor antigens and/or chaperones [ 72 Findings by Baker et al. were indicative of the immunological effects of GRP94/gp96, a member of the heat shock protein 90 family. The researchers found that GRP94/gp96 was able to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. In mice, the administration of GRP94/gp96 activated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and promoted the production of Th1 cytokines by CD4 + T cells. Notably, this immune activation occurred independently of GRP94/gp96’s role as a peptide chaperone, emphasizing its broader impact on the immune environment and CD4 + T cell functions. The study specifically investigated the in vivo immunological effects of GRP94/gp96 using non-tumor, haplotype-matched cells expressing secretory forms of GRP94/gp96, which served as antigen-negative sources. GRP94/gp96 activated CD11b + and CD11c + APCs and induced rapid production of Th1 cytokines by CD4 + T lymphocytes. Of note, such activation depended on the function of phagocytic cells. These results suggested that GRP94/gp96 could enhance APC function and drive bystander activation of CD4 + T cells, positioning it as an important immune response modulator. The study also discussed the challenges in differentiating immune responses to GRP94/gp96 alone from those to GRP94/gp96-antigen complexes, as well as the potential for GRP94/gp96 to act as a biological adjuvant. When extracellular, GRP94/gp96 could signal immunological danger, potentially triggering strong immune responses, including tumor rejection. These effects were influenced by the cytokine environment and the activation state of APCs, underlining GRP94/gp96’s role in shaping immune responses [ 73 Mechanistic findings demonstrated that GRP94/gp96 was able to improve antigen presentation through activating APCs and eliciting Th1 cytokine responses, even without chaperoned peptides. While heat-induced upregulation of GRP94/gp96 in CSC-enriched tumors might enhance vaccine immunogenicity, its capability to act as a danger signal also implicates the applicability of GRP94/gp96 as an endogenous immune modulator and adjuvant in immunotherapy against cancer. GRP170 Cross-presentation of antigens in DCs has a specific pathway in ER entry and retro translocation. In the case of some vaccines, this pathway is required to activate antigen-specific CTLs. Wang et al. showed ADC-targeted vaccine-induced T cell cross-priming indeed required antigen entry into the ER, which had been a previously unrecognized mechanism. By adding melanoma antigen gp100 and chaperone GRP170 to mouse-derived DCs, antigen penetration into the ER was significantly enhanced. Additionally, GRP170 weakened cytosolic translocation for proteasome-dependent destruction by increasing the contacts of internalized protein antigens with molecular components involved in ER-associated protein breakdown and/or dislocation. Dendritic cells derived from bone-marrow and CD8-positive dendritic cells of mouse spleen exclusively retained tumor antigen in their ER as a result of targeted disruption of protein retrotranslocation. These occurrences resulted in the suppression of antigen-specific CD8 positive T cell priming in vivo & in vitro, as well as antigen ubiquitination and processing. The facilitated ER entry of tumor antigen might act as a molecular method for a more efficient cross-presenting capability of GRP170-based vaccines [ 74 Park et al. conducted a study to determine if GRP170 and its domains could attach to the melanoma-associated antigen gp100 and represent it to the immune system. They developed various domain deletion mutants to assess if the GRP170 adjuvant activity depended on its chaperoning function. The mutants included those lacking the ATP-binding domain (BLH), lacking both the ATP-binding domain and the β-sheet domain (LH), containing only the H domain (H), lacking only the H domain (ABL), and having both the ATP-binding domain and the β-sheet domain (AB). The heat protection ability of various constructs was assessed by incubating recombinant gp100 at 50 °C, either on its own or in combination with GRP170 or its deletion mutants. It was found that GRP170 and the mutants BLH, LH, H, or ABL, but not AB, could effectively prevent gp100 aggregation. The researchers also examined the impact of immunizing with gp100 in combination with GRP170 or its mutant forms. They noted that the splenocytes from mice vaccinated with the gp100-GRP170 complex displayed a notable increase in IFN-γ production when exposed to gp100, in contrast to those from untreated mice or those immunized by gp100 or GRP170 individually. The findings were even more remarkable when gp100 was combined with GRP170 and subjected to heat shock treatment. Furthermore, when gp100 was matched with BLH, LH, H, and ABL mutants, it elicited a gp100-specific immune response nearly as potent as full-length GRP170. However, vaccination with the AB mutant, which lacks chaperoning ability, resulted in significantly reduced IFN-γ production and a less robust immune response. As the interaction between HSPs and APCs is essential for the presentation of HSP-chaperoned antigens and initiating an immune response against tumors, the researchers examined the binding capability of GRP170 and its mutants to RAW264.7 macrophages. The results showed that GRP170 and BLH, LH, H, and ABL demonstrated saturable binding to dendritic and macrophage cells with varying affinities, except for mutant AB. To investigate the correlation between the chaperone function and the binding to macrophages, the researcher assessed the ability of two distinct molecular chaperones (HSP110 and HSP70) and their H domains (which possess limited chaperone function) to bind to RAW264.7 macrophages. The results revealed that while full-length HSP110 and HSP70 successfully bound to these cells, their H-domain mutants did not exhibit the same attachment capability. The findings of this study showed that molecular chaperoning played a crucial role in facilitating stress protein interactions with APCs, binding to antigens, and initiating immune responses against tumors [ 75 Mechanistic findings have put forward the vital capacity of GRP170 in promoting ER-targeted cross-presentation and stabilizing tumor antigens such as gp100. Moreover, its chaperone role has been found necessary for facilitating antigen binding, dendritic cell interaction, and IFN-γ production. Overall, these findings highlight the distinctive structural and functional advantages of GRP170 as an immunological carrier and promising stimulator of CTL responses.

So far, several trials have been dedicated to evaluating GRP-based vaccines in cancer with a great focus on GRP94/gp96 (HSPPC-96) and HSP70 platforms, as summarized in Table 2 ® 79 ® NCT00033904 80 81 NCT00293423 82 83 84 NCT00121173 85 NCT00027144 86 NCT04943848  Table 2 Ongoing and completed clinical trials of GRP-Based cancer vaccines in oncology Type of cancer ClinicalTrials.gov ID HSPs Population Primary endpoint Phase Status (as of 30-Jul-2025) DOI/outcome reference Pediatric high-grade gliomas/ependymomas NCT02722512 GRP94/gp96 Newly-diagnosed high-grade gliomas or recurrent, Resectable high-grade gliomas, and Ependymomas in pediatric patients • Feasibility of vaccine creation • Toxicity and safety • Recommend MTD/RP2D • Progression-free survival Phase I Terminated ClinicalTrials.gov record NCT02722512 https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02722512 87 Indolent lymphoma NCT00081809 GRP94/gp96 Adults with indolent B-cell lymphoma (autologous HSPPC-96) • Rate of complete and partial responses • Safety and tolerability • Feasibility of autologous HSPPC-96 preparation Phase II Completed ClinicalTrials.gov record NCT00081809 88 Recurrent high-grade glioma (GBM) NCT00293423 GRP94/gp96 Patients with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma undergoing resection for vaccine manufacture • Overall survival at 6 months • Dose limited toxicity • Immunologic response • Median OS (overall survival) Phase I/II Completed Published outcomes; e.g., Clinical article (Neuro-Oncology) and PMC article (PMCID: PMC3895386) [ 89 Liver cancer NCT04206254 GRP94/gp96 Patients with liver cancer (HCC or primary liver cancers as per registry) • 2-year recurrence-free survival rate • 5-year disease-free survival • Changes in antigen-specific T cells • Number of participants with adverse events related to GRP94/gp96 immunotherapy Phase II/III Unknown (as listed on ClinicalTrials.gov) ClinicalTrials.gov record NCT04206254 https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04206254 90 Resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Stage I/II) NCT00003025 GRP94/gp96 Patients with resected stage I or II pancreatic adenocarcinoma (adults) • Study objective (as registered): Study the safety of autologous tumor derived gp96 heat shock protein peptide complex (HSPPC-96) in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma • Examine the immune response to HSPPC-96 in this group of patients.

As GRP proteins, such as GRP78 and GRP94, are ubiquitously expressed in both stressed and normal tissues, there is a rare and hypothetical chance of some unwanted immune responses that may undesirably damage normal cells as well [ 103 56 104 105 Clinically, GRP-based vaccines could be most effective when administered to patients with minimal residual disease (MRD), where the immune system is less suppressed and therefore prone to mount a targeted response. GRP-based vaccines may also act sufficiently alongside immune checkpoint inhibitors, e.g., anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 therapies. Mechanistically, GRP vaccines increase antigen presentation and prime T cells, while checkpoint inhibitors circumvent immune hurdles, which altogether may offer a synergistic impact. Moreover, to identify which patients are most likely to respond to these vaccines and evaluate the treatment safety and efficacy, some biomarkers such as GRP expression in tumors, CD91 levels on antigen-presenting cells, rate of CD8⁺ T cell infiltration, and balanced cytokine profiles, for example, IFN-γ and IL-6, may be screened [ 54 106 Other HSPs as a cancer vaccine HSP110 targets carbonic anhydrase IX (CA9), a tumor protein unique to renal cell carcinoma (RCC). HSP110 chaperoning capacity could be employed to produce a compound with CA9, which could be injected as a tumor vaccine. Kim et al. showed that in BALB/c mice bearing tumor, HSP110 + CA9 inhibited RENCA tumor growth and elicited IFN-γ response and an antibody response evaluated by means of ELISPOT and ELISA, respectively. To investigate another vaccine approach, a complex of CA9 peptide and HSP110 could inhibit the growth of the tumor. A plasmid vector encompassing GRP170 linked to CA9 could not elicit an antitumor, antibodies, and interferon-gamma response. Besides, in an animal RCC metastatic model, before vaccination, RENCA cells were injected intradermally, and HSP110 together with CA9 reduced the growth of the tumor, in comparison to the control. Overall, they suggested that a complex of recombinant HSP110 and CA9 might be a promising candidate for the treatment of RCC [ 78 Photodynamic therapy (PDT) was used to treat MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells, leading to the identification of two immunogenic peptides from calreticulin and HSP90 proteins. These peptides showed potential as a peptide-based vaccine by activating macrophages and inducing cytokine release, suggesting their use in immunotherapy for triple-negative breast cancer. First, PDT reduced the viability of MDA-MB-231 triple-negative breast cancer cells by up to 98%, whereas independent treatments with irradiation or ALA did not significantly affect cell viability compared to untreated controls ( P P p 76 Another study by Graner et al. developed an efficient method to purify multiple immunologically active chaperone proteins (HSP70, HSP90, GRP94/gp96, and calreticulin) from a single tumor source, ensuring no cross-contamination and confirming that ConA contamination was not a factor. Immunization with these tumor-derived chaperones significantly improved survival in mice with A20 leukemia, with HSP70 being the most effective, providing protection equivalent to at least a 2-log reduction in tumor burden. The immunity was tumor-specific, as A20-derived chaperones did not protect against antigenically unrelated BDL-2 leukemia. However, localized GM-CSF production at the vaccination site unexpectedly reduced the immune response and survival benefits, likely due to dysregulated APC maturation and inhibited T-cell responses. The findings suggest that using multiple chaperones from a single tumor source could generate a broad and effective antitumor response, with ongoing studies examining the benefits of such combinations for anticancer treatments [ 77 Conclusion and future directions Overall, GRPs represent interesting immunological properties that can be harnessed in the development of anticancer vaccines. Not only are GRPs involved in protein folding and cellular stress responses but they also act as potent antigen carriers and immune modulators.
