This study aimed to examine the associations between insufficient sleep and health outcomes, specifically depressive symptoms and obesity, using data from the 2020 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) with a cross-sectional study design. A total of 5912 participants (2648 men and 3264 women) were included. Among them, 823 individuals (13.9 %) experienced difficulty with weekday sleep deprivation, and 442 individuals (7.5 %) exhibited weekday-weekend sleep mismatch. The mean sleep duration varied according to age group, underlying disease, and physical activity level. Individuals with sleep deprivation were more likely to have depressive symptoms (OR 3.21, 95 % CI 2.65–3.90) and obesity (OR 1.29, 95 % CI 1.07–1.754). On the basis of these findings, both the duration and regularity of sleep are associated with depressive symptoms and obesity, suggesting that sleep patterns may play important roles in these health outcomes. Highlights • Sleep deprivation results from insufficient sleep duration or significant fluctuations in sleep patterns over several days. • Sleep quality can be improved by maintaining better mental and physical health. • Improving both the quality and quantity of sleep can help prevent depression and obesity. • Public health policies should emphasize the importance of sufficient sleep duration.

A systematic review revealed that both shorter and longer sleep durations than the recommended 7–8 h per day are linked to increased risks of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and depression [ 1 2 3 4 In addition to sleep duration, there is growing evidence regarding the effects of sleep deficiency and irregularity. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) defines sleep deficiency as a broader concept than sleep deprivation, including insufficient sleep, inappropriate timing, non-restorative sleep, or difficulty maintaining sleep [ 2 5 Previous research has suggested that both insufficient sleep duration and irregular sleep patterns are closely associated with physical and emotional health outcomes [ 6 7 8 [9] [10] [11] [12] 13 14 15 In this context, obesity and depression represent important health concerns due to their global prevalence and multifaceted interactions with lifestyle and biological factors. Adequate sleep is a modifiable behavioural factor that may influence both conditions, yet large-scale population-based evidence remains limited. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the associations between sleep duration and weekday-weekend sleep mismatch with obesity and depressive symptoms using data from a nationally representative population survey. By addressing both outcomes simultaneously, the study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of how sleep duration and mismatch impacts both physical and mental health, and provides evidence that may inform public health strategies targeting sleep as a modifiable factor. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Study design and participants We analysed data from the 8th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES, 2020), an annual nationwide survey that monitors the health and nutritional status of the general population in South Korea. The data were obtained using complex, stratified, multistage probability sampling to ensure the representativeness of the population. All KNHANES participants provided written informed consent, and the Institutional Review Board of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention initially approved the use of the KNHANES data. Additionally, the Institutional Review Board of the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine approved this specific study topic (IRB No. I-2309/009-001). The KNHANES is an annual population-based survey conducted with a cross-sectional study design. In 2020, a total of 5912 participants (2648 men and 3264 women), aged 19 years or older, took part in the survey. To examine the associations between sleep-related variables and health conditions, sociodemographic and health-related variables were selected on the basis of the previous literature, and the relationships were presented using a diagram of the acyclic graph (DAG) [ Fig. 1 1) In this figure, sleep quality is conceptualized as encompassing both optimal sleep duration (used to define sleep deprivation) and weekday-weekend sleep mismatch (used to reflect sleep irregularity). 2) Underlying disease refers to any other disease or condition that an individual has in addition to the primary condition of interest in the study. Fig. 1 Relationships among sleep quality, sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, and health outcomes. Fig. 1 2.2 Variable definitions To ensure consistency and clarity in the analysis, key variables were operationally defined as follows. Sleep deprivation refers to adults sleeping less than 7–9 h per night, whereas children and adolescents generally require more sleep than adults do [ 16 Explanatory variables were defined using operational criteria. Individuals who engaged in mild physical activity at least three days per week were defined as physically active. Participants were classified as having an underlying disease if they reported being diagnosed with at least one of the following conditions: hypertension, dyslipidaemia, or diabetes. Depression diagnosis was based on self-reported lifetime experience of medical diagnosis by a physician. The response variables—depressive symptoms and obesity—were defined on the basis of the survey outcomes. Depressive symptoms were measured by summing 9 items of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a widely used self-report tool for assessing depressive symptoms. Each of the nine items is scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day), yielding a total score ranging from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater severity. A total score of 5 or more was used to classify participants as experiencing depressive symptoms. According to the PHQ-9 thresholds, scores of 5–9 indicate mild symptoms, scores of 10–14 indicate moderate symptoms, and scores of 15 or higher indicate severe symptoms. Obesity was assessed using body mass index (BMI), which was calculated from measured weight and height. Participants were classified as obese if they met the criteria for obesity levels 1 through 3, based on the national health guidelines established by the Korean Society for the Study of Obesity (2022) [ 17 2.3 Statistical analysis To examine the general characteristics of the study participants, frequency analyses were performed to assess the differences in variables according to health conditions. Additionally, distribution and correlation analyses were conducted for sleep duration and weekday-weekend sleep mismatch in relation to demographic and health-related variables. Specifically, ANOVA was applied to examine differences in mean values across categorical variables. Pearson correlation analyses were conducted to assess relationships between continuous variables, such as age and sleep duration. Furthermore, multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the associations of demographic characteristics, health-related factors, and sleep duration with weekday-weekend sleep mismatch. Explanatory variables, including demographic factors (sex and age) and health-related variables such as underlying diseases, physical activity, smoking, drinking behaviour, and subjective obstructive sleep apnoea symptoms, were adjusted for in the final model. The relationships among health behaviours, depressive symptoms, and obesity were estimated using odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). To assess population-based associations, sample-weighted analyses were performed in the final stage. The sample-weighted analyses adjust for unequal selection probabilities, ensuring that the sample more accurately represents the population by applying weights to each observation on the basis of its probability of inclusion. In regression model fitting, simple random sampling assumes that each individual in the population has an equal chance of being selected, whereas complex random sampling, which includes stratified cluster sampling, adjusts for sample weights to account for stratification and clustering. All the statistical analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. 3 Results 3.1 Demographic characteristics and descriptive statistics A total of 5912 participants (2648 men and 3264 women), aged 19 years or older, participated in the KNHANES.

The percentages presented in Table 1 3 Sleep deprivation is defined as sleeping less than 7 h a day. 4 Sleep irregularity is defined as having more than 2 h of mismatched sleep between weekdays and weekends. 5 The obese group was defined as those with obesity levels 1 to 3. 6 ‘Yes’ to any underlying disease means having at least one of the following conditions: hypertension, dyslipidaemia, or diabetes. 7 Mild physical activity is defined as engaging in physical activity at least three days per week. A total of 972 individuals reported current smoking behaviour, while 329 individuals were classified as heavy drinkers and consumed alcohol more than four times per week. Furthermore, 299 individuals were diagnosed with depression, and 1687 individuals self-reported having sleep apnoea syndrome. As shown in Table 1 The mean sleep duration for the age-specific groups ranged from 6.6 to 7.0 h, with sleep duration varying significantly by age group, underlying disease, and physical activity ( Table 2 Table 2 Distribution and correlation of sleep duration with demographic characteristics.

According to the complex sampling model, women were more likely to have depressive symptoms (OR 2.23, 95 % CI 1.81–2.74) and less likely to have obesity (OR 0.47, 95 % CI 0.40–0.55) than men were. The presence of underlying diseases was associated with an increased likelihood of both depressive symptoms (OR 1.57, 95 % CI 1.20–2.06) and obesity (OR 2.32, 95 % CI 1.96–2.75). Specifically, subjective obstructive sleep apnoea was strongly associated with depressive symptoms (OR 3.84, 95 % CI 2.98–4.95) and obesity (OR 1.51, 95 % CI 1.30–1.74). In terms of sleep-related variables, individuals with sleep deprivation were more likely to experience depressive symptoms (OR 3.21, 95 % CI 2.65–3.90) and obesity (OR 1.29, 95 % CI 1.07–1.754). However, no clear relationship was found between sleep irregularity and these health outcomes in this analysis. 4 Discussion 4.1 Principal findings In this study, we found that sleep deprivation, defined as insufficient sleep hours on a daily basis, is more strongly associated with depression and obesity than sleep irregularity, which is characterized by a sleep hour mismatch of more than 2 h between weekdays and weekends. These findings underscore the importance of both sleep duration and regularity as key factors influencing mental and physical health outcomes. Additionally, smoking was positively associated with depression but negatively associated with obesity, highlighting complex lifestyle interactions that may influence these outcomes. 4.2 Integration with previous studies Several studies have reported significant associations between sleep quality, irregular sleep patterns, obesity, and depression. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews suggested that a sleep duration of 7–8 h per day was most favourable for adult health outcomes, with no significant variation across age groups [ 1 18 19 A systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 studies with over 340,000 participants revealed that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was greater among average sleepers than among short and long sleepers, with notable regional variations observed across continents [ 20 20 21 Beyond its impact on metabolic health, sleep disturbances are strongly implicated in mental health, particularly in the development and progression of depression. Depression frequently involves sleep problems, which can both contribute to and result from depressive episodes, underscoring their bidirectional relationship [ 22 ≤ 23 24 A study on health behaviour patterns, mental health, and self-rated health revealed that poor sleep is strongly associated with mental health issues, partly independent of daytime behaviours and demographic factors [ 6 ≥ 12 Beyond mental health, poor sleep also has implications for physical health. For example, in women at risk for cervical cancer, subjective sleep quality was not significantly related to depression but independently predicted variance in immunity [ 10 This study found that smoking is positively associated with depression but negatively associated with obesity. This seemingly paradoxical relationship may be partly attributable to nicotine's appetite-suppressing effects and lifestyle factors, such as differences in diet and physical activity among smokers [ 25 25 26 Poor sleep quality has also been closely linked to obesity. Ogilvie et al. (2017) reported that short sleep duration, along with other dimensions of poor sleep, was consistently associated with obesity in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, suggesting a potential causal relationship between insufficient sleep and weight gain [ 8 7 4.3 Study limitations A key limitation of this study is the use of self-reported sleep durations. These data are subject to recall and reporting biases, which may result in inaccurate estimates of actual sleep time. They also fail to capture daily variability and objective aspects of sleep quality. Consequently, self-reported measures may underestimate variability and attenuate associations with health outcomes. In this study, both the deprivation and irregularity of sleep were quantitatively assessed on the basis of sleep duration. However, the calculation of sleep time is likely based on the difference between the time the individual goes to bed and the time they wake, without considering the actual time spent in NREM sleep. Accurately capturing sleep time on the basis of this definition is challenging because the time between going to bed and actually falling asleep can vary greatly from person to person. Furthermore, since sleep time was measured via survey, there is a possibility that recall bias from respondents could have negatively influenced the accuracy of the data. Additionally, various factors, such as age, sleep patterns, circadian rhythms, indoor and outdoor temperatures, medications, sleep disorders, and physical conditions, can affect sleep stages. However, owing to the nature of the survey data, this study did not account for some of these variables, such as sleep patterns, circadian rhythms, and environmental factors. 5 Conclusions A significant amount of experimental research has been conducted to understand sleep, as it accounts for nearly one-third of human life. While this study explores the relationship between sleep duration and health outcomes using survey data, its value lies in its population-based approach, which contributes to a broader understanding of health conditions and their promotion. The findings of this study suggest that improving both the quality and quantity of sleep can play a crucial role in preventing depression and obesity. Therefore, public health policies should emphasize the importance of adequate sleep duration and promote better behavioural health practices in personal settings.
