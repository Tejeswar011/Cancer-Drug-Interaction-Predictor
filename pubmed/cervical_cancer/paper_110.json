Background Cervical cancer poses a significant health threat, especially for women living with HIV, who are at increased risk of developing premalignant cervical lesions. Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone (LLETZ) is a standard treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to prevent progression to malignancy. This study explores the experiences of HIV-positive women who underwent LLETZ in Vhembe District, South Africa, where access to such specialized treatments remains limited. Methods Using a qualitative, phenomenological approach, this study engaged seven HIV-positive women who underwent LLETZ, capturing their lived experiences through in-depth, unstructured interviews. Thematic analysis identified key themes and subthemes to elucidate their psychological, physical, and social encounters related to the procedure. Results Analysis revealed eight central themes: psychological and physical experiences, psychosocial and financial support, misconceptions, education, recommendations, and time-related factors. Participants reported anxiety, fear, and initial stress about the procedure, coupled with resilience and acceptance over time. Physical effects such as pain and bleeding were common, though recovery experiences varied. Social support from family and community played a critical role in coping, while financial constraints impacted access to and continuity of care. Misunderstandings about the LLETZ procedure underscored the need for enhanced patient education. Participants emphasized timely screening and support systems to improve treatment outcomes and reduce psychological distress. Conclusions The study highlights the multifaceted impact of LLETZ on HIV-positive women, including the psychological and financial burdens and the importance of clear communication and patient education. Improved support structures, timely result communication, and access to follow-up care are essential to enhance patient outcomes. Recommendations advocate for health system improvements, partner involvement, and proactive counselling to address the specific needs of HIV-positive women undergoing cervical cancer prevention treatments.

This adjustment improves the logical flow and aligns with conventional manuscript structure. The statement of the study objective, which previously appeared in the opening paragraph, has been relocated to the final paragraph of the Introduction. Additionally, a non-scholarly citation (Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, 2020) has been replaced with a peer-reviewed reference (Debeaudrap et al., 2019), ensuring more robust support for the discussion of LLETZ efficacy. The revised text also specifies that while cure rates exceed 90% in HIV-negative women, they are substantially lower (~78.6%) in HIV-positive cohorts. Minor corrections were made to address a typographical error (“78.6 %” corrected from “78,6 %”), and ambiguous phrasing was clarified regarding the lack of tailored recommendations for follow-up and recurrence management in HIV-positive women. In the Methods section, routine details about equipment checks during the pre-test were removed for conciseness. Throughout the Results, capitalization of participant identifiers was standardized to lowercase, and the uncommon term “benignancy” was replaced with “benign outcome.” Collectively, these revisions enhance clarity, precision, and adherence to scholarly conventions. Introduction Globally, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women, with an estimated 311,365 deaths reported annually ( Zou et al., 2020 Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone (LLETZ) is the preferred treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia due to its effectiveness and ability to be performed in an outpatient setting under local anaesthesia (LA) ( Yap et al., 2020 Debeaudrap et al. (2019) WHO, 2014 In the sub-Saharan region ( Chambuso et al., 2017 Debeaudrap et al. (2019) Cervical cancer is an identified national priority in South Africa and other sub-Saharan countries and the second most common cancer among women in South Africa after breast cancer. It ranks as the leading cause of female cancer deaths in South Africa, particularly affecting women in the reproductive age group between 15 and 44 years ( Marañón et al., 2017 Marañón et al., 2017 Vhembe District Municipality, 2020 Vhembe District Municipality, 2020 There are gaps in our understanding of this phenomenon, e.g. although there is evidence indicating that HIV-positive women of reproductive age are often diagnosed with premalignant lesions and undergo LLETZ treatment, specific recommendations for their care are lacking. Global research has highlighted some expressed and observed experiences, advocating for a dedicated treatment protocol for this group. Despite facing these challenges, they are often heads of families. The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to explore and describe the experiences of women of reproductive age living with HIV who had undergone LLETZ within the district by capturing their voices through the employment of in-depth, unstructured interviews. The outcome has the potential to fill the identified gap in the literature, adding to the understanding of the phenomenon and providing more insight, thus improving practice as unheard voices are considered. The study was conducted in the year 2024. Women living with HIV, compared to those living without HIV, are considered a high-risk group for the development of pre-malignant lesions. Furthermore, LLETZ-related services are scarce in Vhembe, necessitating affected women to wait on a list, during which time CIN2-3 may progress into malignancy. Due to the scientific evidence that women lead more than 50% of households, this can contribute to a generally burdened and unhealthy society. Thus, to achieve the goal of health for all by 2030, it is essential to promote women’s health by, amongst others, mitigating such potential challenges. Against this background, the purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to explore and describe the experiences of women of reproductive age living with HIV who had undergone LLETZ within the district. Through capturing their voices through in-depth, unstructured interviews, the study aims to fill this gap in the literature and generate insights to inform more patient-centred care. Methods Study design This qualitative study employed a phenomenological approach (PA) as its conceptual framework to explore the personal experiences of women living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) who have undergone Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone (LLETZ). The phenomenological approach is particularly effective in capturing the nuances of these women's experiences, as it seeks to understand the essence of their situations by asking, “What is this or that kind of experience like?” Unlike other qualitative methods, phenomenology aims for a descriptive understanding of pre-reflective experiences without imposing categories, classifications, explanations, or meanings ( Van Manen, 2017 The study specifically focused on women of reproductive age living with HIV, going beyond typical qualitative inquiries to provide a rich, detailed account of their experiences with LLETZ. The roots of phenomenology trace back to the early 20th century, with significant contributions from philosophers such as Heidegger and Gadamer, while also being grounded in the foundational work of Edmund Husserl ( Neubauer et al., 2019 Neubauer et al., 2019 Bynum and Varpio (2018) Tuffour (2017) The study design was exploratory-descriptive, focusing specifically on LLETZ interventions. In-depth, one-on-one, unstructured interviews were conducted to collect comprehensive and insightful accounts of the women's experiences. These interviews yielded rich descriptions that illuminate the realities faced by this population, aligning with the standards set by the SRQR (Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research) guidelines, which emphasize the importance of transparency, rigor, and the context of qualitative research. Research paradigm This study was conducted within an interpretive framework, which acknowledges the inherently subjective nature of individual experiences. It emphasizes that understanding these experiences is influenced by the perspectives and interpretations of the researchers involved in the study. By recognizing the researchers' role in the interpretative process, the study aims to provide a deeper insight into the complexities of the participants' experiences rather than merely presenting objective facts. This approach highlights the importance of context and personal interpretation in understanding the explored phenomena. Study setting The study was conducted in Vhembe District, Limpopo Province, South Africa. Vhembe is situated in the Northern part of Limpopo Province, sharing borders with Capricorn and Mopani districts in the eastern and western directions, Mozambique through the Kruger National Park in the south-east, Zimbabwe in the north and Botswana in the northwest. The district comprises four local municipalities: Thulamela, Makhado, Musina and the recently established Collins Chabane local municipality. Of 387 089 households, 51% are female-headed, totalling 194,980 ( Vhembe District Municipality, 2020 Study population, sampling and recruitment The study focused on a specific group of women living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) who underwent LLETZ in selected hospitals within the Vhembe District of Limpopo Province, South Africa.   Sampling technique This study employed a purposive sampling technique, allowing researchers to select participants based on specific characteristics relevant to the phenomenon under study. According to Brink et al. (2014)   Recruitment process The recruitment process occurred in selected hospitals' outpatient departments (OPD) during gynaecology clinic days. To identify potential participants, the researcher collaborated with the nurse assisting the gynaecologist, who was requested to refer eligible women to the researcher. This ensured that only those meeting the inclusion criteria were approached. Once referred, the researcher invited each potential participant to a private consultation room to ensure confidentiality and comfort. The researcher introduced herself, explained the purpose of the study, and provided details about the in-depth, unstructured interviews. Participants were given ample time to ask questions, and informed consent was obtained before proceeding. To initiate the interview, participants were first asked about their understanding of the LLETZ procedure, followed by the central research question.   Sample size determination The sample size was determined by data saturation, the point at which no new information emerged from additional interviews. Although the initial plan was to interview seven participants, including two for a pretest, the study was concluded when saturation was reached with the seventh participant. The two pretest participants were included in the final analysis, as their contributions were relevant and aligned with the study's objectives.   Ethical considerations This study adhered to strict ethical guidelines to ensure participants' protection, rights, and well-being. The research received approval through a rigorous multi-step process. It was first reviewed by the Department of Public Health at the University of Venda, followed by the Faculty of Health Sciences Higher Degrees Committee and the University Higher Degrees Committee, before final approval from the University of Venda Human and Clinical Trial Research Ethics Committee, which granted an Ethical Clearance Certificate (Ethical Clearance no: FHS/23/PH/56/1801 LP_2024-02-013 Written Informed consent was obtained after participants were thoroughly informed about the study's purpose, procedures, and expectations. They were assured of their right to withdraw at any time without consequences, and confidentiality was emphasized, ensuring that their identities would not be disclosed. Participants voluntarily signed consent forms, confirming their willingness to participate. The principle of beneficence was upheld by ensuring emotional well-being through support from social workers and psychologists in the selected hospitals. The researcher remained observant for signs of distress during interviews and allowed participants to express concerns. Vulnerable individuals or those experiencing acute distress were excluded to prevent harm. Confidentiality was maintained through data coding (e.g., P1, P2, P3) to uphold the principle of justice, preventing linkage between responses and participants' identities. Names appeared only on consent forms, which were securely stored and discarded after the study. The consent form was also translated into Tshivenda, Xitsonga, and Sepedi to accommodate non-English-speaking participants. Data collection tool and method   In-Depth unstructured interviews This study employed a self-report technique, utilizing in-depth unstructured interviews to explore participants' experiences with LLETZ. Each interview took place in a private room within the selected hospitals, ensuring confidentiality. The researcher encouraged open-ended discussions, using probing and prompting techniques to allow participants to elaborate on their experiences. A central question guided the interviews:  \"What is it like to be an HIV-positive woman who has undergone LLETZ, a surgical procedure where a tissue sample is taken from the cervix to remove identified premalignant cells and tested to exclude cancer?\" To maintain consistency, the researcher followed a structured approach, using paraphrasing and clarification techniques to align the interaction across all participants. Audio recordings supported data collection to capture the conversations accurately. Additionally, field notes documented non-verbal cues, enhancing the depth of data interpretation. Bracketing techniques ensured the researcher remained objective, reducing potential biases and capturing an authentic account of participants’ experiences ( Alase, 2017   Pretest A pretest was conducted to evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of the interview questions and data collection tools. Two participants from the target population participated in this phase, and their responses were included in the final study as their insights were deemed relevant and valuable. The pretest phase also allowed refinement of probing techniques, ensuring that the interview questions elicited detailed narratives rather than simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ responses. Measures to ensure trustworthiness   Credibility Credibility was ensured through rigorous methodological adherence, with ethical considerations guiding all stages of the research. Institutional relationships were established before interviews commenced, ensuring smooth access to participants. Data collection combined in-depth interviews with observational field notes, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of LLETZ experiences. A purposive sampling technique was applied to ensure that participants were appropriately selected. The study adhered to the inclusion and exclusion criteria outlined in Section 3.4.3. Data robustness was reinforced through cross-checking findings with existing literature, ensuring alignment with broader research insights. Data saturation was confirmed as no new themes emerged by the seventh interview.   Transferability The study parameters were clearly defined to support transferability, allowing future researchers to determine applicability to other contexts. The study was conducted in two purposefully selected hospitals in Vhembe District, Limpopo Province, as they were the only facilities offering LLETZ services in the region. The research timeline covered one month in 2024, with seven interview sessions lasting 30 to 50 minutes. Though the findings may not be universally transferrable, they provide a valuable foundation for comparison in future related studies.   Dependability The research process was documented to ensure dependability, including detailed accounts of the research design, data collection, and analysis ( Brink et al., 2014   Confirmability The researcher ensured objectivity and neutrality by setting aside personal interpretations during data collection. Subjective reflections were only revisited during data analysis and interpretation, preventing undue influence on participants’ responses. Field notes captured non-verbal expressions cross-referenced with audio transcripts and reflexivity notes to ensure a comprehensive dataset. Triangulation was applied through multiple data sources, and findings were validated against established literature, strengthening the study’s credibility and reliability. The researcher’s background as an oncology nurse specialist in colposcopy clinics, alongside supervisory guidance, contributed to the study’s credibility and expertise-driven approach. Data collection Data were collected in outpatient departments of the selected hospitals in Vhembe District, Limpopo Province. To facilitate smooth research operations, permission letters were submitted directly to the Registry Departments of the selected hospitals rather than the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs), as per the institutions' administrative structures. Requests were also made for a private interview room and approval to engage hospital psychologists and social workers in case of participant distress. On gynaecology clinic days, the researcher worked with nurses assisting the gynaecologist in identifying eligible participants based on the study’s inclusion criteria. Once identified, women were referred to a private interview room, where in-depth, unstructured interviews were conducted. Each interview followed a structured approach, beginning with welcoming and greeting the participant, researcher self-introduction, study purpose explanation, and consent acquisition. Participants were asked to share their understanding of LLETZ to initiate discussion, followed by the central research question. Interviews were conducted in a language preferred by the participant, ensuring clarity and comfort. Probing, paraphrasing, and follow-up questions were applied based on participants’ responses and non-verbal cues. Each interview concluded with the researcher confirming the accuracy of the participant’s responses, reiterating confidentiality, and expressing gratitude for their contributions. All interviews were conducted on the same day to minimize logistical challenges and travel expenses. Each session lasted 30 to 50 minutes, and data saturation was confirmed after seven interviews. One additional participant was interviewed instead of the originally planned two to accommodate recruitment challenges, ensuring no new insights emerged beyond the seventh interview. To validate responses, member checking was conducted throughout the interviews. Field notes were taken in real-time, and audio recordings were transcribed and documented in reflexive journals after each session, away from participants ( Alase, 2017 Data organization and preparation for analysis The organization and preparation of data for analysis were done as follows: Items of information gathered included audio records (AR) and field notes (FN), which provided significant reflections of non-verbal cues demonstrated by each participant (P). Transcripts (T) were created from translated voice recordings. Reflexive notes (RN) of each participant represent the researcher`s reflections on collected data done away from the interview site. These were organized/grouped without using the real names of participants. Instead, they were arranged in the sequence of interviews, labeled as P1, P2, P3 etc. The first group, P1, consisted of (AR1, FN1, T1 and RN1), corresponding to the participant interviewed first. The data for subsequent participants followed the same pattern, with P2 (AR2, FN2, T2 and RN2) for the second participant and so on. This organized data will be kept in the University Library. The Tesch coding procedure was implemented in the thematic analysis ( Creswell & Creswell, 2017 Data analysis The data collected in this study was analyzed using Tesch’s thematic coding procedure, a structured approach that ensures a comprehensive and rigorous thematic analysis ( Creswell & Creswell, 2017, 2018 The analysis began with the repeated listening and transcription of audio recordings from each participant. The transcriptions were completed in English, and each participant's written text file (T) was generated in Microsoft Word. Each transcript was then carefully examined alongside field notes (FN), which captured non-verbal expressions, behavioral observations, and contextual details recorded during interviews. Additionally, reflexive notes (RN) were written for each participant on the day of the interview, away from the participant, to document the researcher’s reflections, interpretations, and observations. To extract meaningful insights, all transcripts, field notes, and reflexive notes were read and re-read multiple times to identify key patterns, emerging ideas, and recurring concepts. A color-coding technique was applied to organize these patterns into initial themes, ensuring that each emerging topic was systematically categorized (Annexure IX). The iterative reading process further refined the analysis, allowing for a deeper understanding of how each category interrelated and contributed to the overall dataset. This process also facilitated the identification of sub-themes, ensuring that nuanced aspects of participants’ experiences were adequately captured. Once the primary themes and sub-themes were established, all coded data material corresponding to each theme was gathered, reviewed, and analyzed in-depth. Throughout this process, the researcher maintained a critical awareness of personal preconceptions and biases, employing bracketing techniques to ensure that the findings authentically reflected participants' experiences rather than researcher assumptions. A final re-reading of the entire dataset was conducted to verify that all relevant data had been appropriately classified. No unclassified items remained, confirming the completeness and consistency of the thematic analysis. This structured and rigorous analytical process ensured that the study's findings were credible, transferable, and deeply rooted in participants’ lived realities. Results During data analysis, no new data emerged after Participant Seven, indicating that saturation was reached. This means that the experiences of women living with HIV who underwent LLETZ in selected hospitals of Vhembe District, Limpopo Province, South Africa, were adequately represented.   Demographic data This study comprised seven women of reproductive age who attended the gynaecology clinic in OPDs in hospitals in the Vhembe District. All participants were living with HIV, had pap smears resulting in premalignant lesions and underwent LLETZ as an intervention treatment.   Thematic analysis of experiences of women living with HIV undergoing LLETZ treatment Thematic analysis of the transcripts from women living with HIV who underwent LLETZ treatment revealed eight primary themes ( Table 1 Table 1. Themes and sub-themes. Theme Sub-Theme LLETZ Intervention Process and Outcomes Psychological Experiences Acceptance and Resilience Anxiety and Stress Uncertainty about Health Status and Future Physical Experiences Pain and Discomfort Recovery Process Psychosocial Support Family and Partner Support Community and Peer Influence Financial Support Misconceptions and Education Misunderstanding of Medical Procedures Recommendations and Reflections Importance of Early Diagnosis Positive Attitude and Coping Strategies Time Factor LLETZ: Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone Theme 1: LLETZ intervention process and outcomes Participants recounted their experiences leading up to their LLETZ biopsy results. They expressed these results differently; some referred to histology results as ‘not well’, indicating malignancy, ‘good’ or as ‘there is nothing that they (professionals) see’, implying benignancy. Some participants referred to it as cancer or the disease. Most participants experienced malignant outcomes, while others experienced benign outcomes.  “It was taken to wherever, after it came back, I was called to say come and see what we have sent. It was found that it was not well (meaning malignant). In reality there is cancer out there”  “After this sample was taken to be tested, I was told that I have cancer”  “When they return, they say there is nothing they see in the womb” Another participant, though cancer was diagnosed, expressed the prognosis experienced as:  “Results came back, and I found that I got cancer of the cervix. I went to Mankweng [hospital] where I found that the cancer I have has just started and is not too long so that my womb can be removed” One participant, when asked what the results were, replied:  “Good (meaning benign)” Theme 2: Physical experiences The physical experiences of the participants varied, with many reporting pain and discomfort associated with the procedure and recovery process. Participants described their experiences as follows: “I experienced some minor pains here (pointing at the lower abdomen). Sometimes I feel something in my tummy. I have been given some pain blocks “On the day of treatment, I felt a little bit of pain the whole day One participant provided the aggravating factors behind the discomfort experienced and the length of time it took:  “On the day when the sample is taken, you feel pain. Mhmm When you pass urine, you feel a bit of pain. Even when you bath. It took a week, but those muscles were pulling after two weeks. It was painful but unlike just after it was cut [sic]” . Some participants felt no pain:  “I accepted and did not have a problem. I am going to have a sample taken to hear what the problem is with me. It was done, and there was no pain ” Despite the initial pain, many participants found that their symptoms improved post-procedure. As one noted: “ The pains that I felt post-procedure just disappeared Recovery was another critical sub-theme, with several participants discussing their healing process regarding pain, bleeding and tissue integrity. For instance:  “The sample was taken; it was painful at that time, but it did not take long to heal”  “I even asked if I would be admitted, and they said no, just go home. I was so shocked and still remember that when I left, I might have stayed for more than three hours outside thinking about this thing – it meant it would bring a lot of pain. It is better that I stay and feel it while I am still here until it came to me that as I was walking normally, not feeling pain, stepping well” About bleeding, variance was also observed:  “Blood came out, but not to stress me” “ That day I was cut. The following day, there was no blood For other participants, it took longer:  “After I was done on Wednesday, Thursday, I was still bleeding. Thursday and Friday as well. Then I told myself that I would go on Monday if I bled on Sunday. On Sunday, I got up normally. Monday, it was finishing, and Tuesday was nothing. I did not go to the clinic” One participant, aware of the impact HIV could have on tissue integrity, expressed concern and took proactive measures to ensure speedy recovery: “… as I did not understand how the wound will heal as it is inside…as a sore of an HIV person does not heal easily. I kept bathing with water and salt” Theme 3: Psychological Experiences Participants reported a range of psychological responses to their diagnosis and treatment. Many displayed a notable level of acceptance and resilience, as illustrated by the following statements:  “I accepted that what happened has happened. However, I am HIV positive as well. I indeed took a sample (referring to a pap smear), and the result came back, and I heard what was happening with my womb. This was not a problem”  “It helped me as I was being admitted to the hospital monthly and was… I do not know if it is that I accepted; this helped me in spirit to heal. I no longer panic as the problem is being addressed. Since 6 th This acceptance often seemed linked to the support they received from their families and partners. However, anxiety and stress were also prevalent. One participant described her initial reaction to the diagnosis as follows:  “I was stressed a little bit … hmm, whether it is the end of the world or will I be able to live again?” [sic] Another participant, reacting to the introduction of surgical intervention, said:  “Very scared. When I was told that today I am going to have a sample cut, not understanding how it is going to be done [sic]” The uncertainty about the future and fear of a life-threatening illness were common themes:  “I was stressed as I did not know whether this was cancer. As they delay, will I not die? I am bleeding; on the other hand, they are delaying. I was stressed. No peace. I thought I would die. Why are they not telling me what the problem is? When I come for results, they say there are none; I am not being checked. I was stressed. I got the results. I was right as I saw nothing serious. I know where I stand”  “…the fear I had as…eee… I used to understand that if a sample taken inside… how will that be? how will I be? That means I will always be in pain? Not knowing what is happening  “I was scared as I did not understand how the wound will heal as it is inside” The effect of certainty about health status was also expressed:  “Yes, it helped a lot. Now I live knowing my situation” Theme 4: Psychosocial support Family and partner support played a significant role in participants' experiences. One participant shared:  “I was supported by my eldest daughter who said you should go to the hospital to know what disease you are suffering from and start with the treatment”  “… but I had supporters who strengthened me. I withstood it until I got the results that I got cancer of the cervix, and they comforted me that I come to the hospital. They support me a lot, including others close to me so that I be right” Other participants also emphasized the support received from their husbands:  “My husband accompanied me and agreed that I have a sample taken”. “Wherever we go, we are together, and he knows all ( that I am”  “I was not comfortable yes (nodding her head), but I accepted as he did accept and he supports me a lot” Community and peer influence also emerged as an essential factor. Discussions with peers provided a source of comfort and shared experiences, as reflected by the following statement:  “But you did not experience it. Yes, as we are sitting there (pointing to the side of the queue), we talk” The participant who had a supportive husband learned about others' negative experiences while waiting in the queue:  “Heee, my husband was always angry. Got a girlfriend, saying he cannot stay with me and bring another woman” Theme 5: Financial support In addition to other necessary support, financial assistance for transportation to subsequent hospital visits for LLETZ procedures is crucial. Travel costs, including public transportation, can create a significant burden, making targeted financial help essential for ensuring patients can consistently attend their appointments and receive proper care. “ We also helped each other with money for transport. When one does not have, the other assists “ Money… (rubbing thumb and pointing finger together) is what bothers a lot. If things are not complete, you got to come back again Theme 6: Misconceptions and education Participants demonstrated several misconceptions about the LLETZ procedure. These misconceptions were clarified through education. This highlights the importance of providing thorough pre-procedure counseling to alleviate unnecessary fears. For example, one participant initially feared the procedure, believing it to be more invasive than it actually was:  “And some of the things that I did not know, I was thinking it means when they are done, I will be sutured and have a bandage on, but when they finish, they just told me they are finished” Another misunderstanding was about the intervention site, affecting intervention outcome expectations. Participant attributes three miscarriages to HIV and vaginal bleeding. The participant hoped that the non-LLETZ-related bleeding would be addressed, mistakenly believing the procedure was done in the uterus: This is clear from the third participant’s experience:  \"When they returned, they said there was nothing visible in the womb [sic]. The bleeding should have stopped after they removed the sore, so we did not understand why it continued. This indicates that something is preventing my children from staying in the womb [sic], and I would like to learn more about this bleeding, as it is causing me issues\" Theme 7: Recommendations and reflections Participants provided several recommendations based on their experiences, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis and maintaining a positive attitude:  “If I do a pap smear and they see what the problem is when it is still early (emphasizing using hands). If the sore was cancerous, it means I would have left it to be worse and incurable” Another participant encouraged others to take proactive health measures:  “And other women test (saying it strongly and nodding her head while standing up at the same time.) go and do a pap smear to get womb results and know what is going on” Maintaining a positive attitude was also crucial, as one participant advised:  “Let us accept it as it is. It is not the end of the world. We will continue to live and go ahead”  “I would say if you got a problem, share it with someone. If you find it is not easy, speak to your children. Your children will not be like outside people. They will understand. They will support you” This perspective was often linked to the support they received and their coping strategies. Acceptance of LLETZ diagnostic outcomes and disclosure are identified as coping strategies:  “I can explain that women, even if we come across this situation (pointing within whatever they say- we got cancer or what? Let us accept it as it is. It is not the end of the world. We will continue to live and go ahead”  “… at home, they know I was not well. I told them that I accepted the situation and I would come out of this, and I did it. They were ready to join and support me.” Theme 8: Time factor Alongside their experiences, women also highlighted the significance of time. LLETZ biopsy histology results showed malignancy for one participant, who took decisive action that led to positive outcomes:  “…disease was detected when it was still early. took a step for treatment, went to Mankweng (Provincial Hospital), to Polokwane (Provincial Hospital) and was given treatment until I became a good and better person Subsequent participants agree that prompt action leads to positive outcomes:  “Let us get used to going to the clinic and not leave things to be worse”  “If I do a pap smear and they see what the problem is [sic] when it is still early (emphasizing using hands). If the sore was cancerous, it means I would have left it to be worse and incurable. …going to the clinic assisted in being diagnosed while in early stages and was assisted” Once again, the time factor was highlighted concerning the turnaround time for results:  “I was given a date for results and found that it takes long, (showing sadness facially and voice going low” “ I found like it takes time. When I come, they say there is none when I come, they say there is none until I get them – the results. I think is last month (referring to March 2024) The findings of the thematic analysis underscore the intricate and diverse experiences of women living with HIV and undergoing LLETZ treatment. Essential themes from the participants’ narratives encompass psychological resilience, physical discomfort and the significant role of social support. Misconceptions about the procedure highlight the necessity for comprehensive patient education. The recommendations put forward by the participants emphasize the importance of early detection and a positive outlook as essential components of managing their health and well-being. These insights can provide valuable guidance to healthcare professionals and policymakers in enhancing support systems and educational resources for women facing similar treatments. Discussion The study’s findings provide a comprehensive view of the multifaceted impact of LLETZ on women with HIV, capturing their physical, psychological, and social experiences. The primary goal of LLETZ is to excise premalignant lesions while allowing histological examination to determine malignancy status. This approach is particularly critical for women living with HIV, who face an elevated risk of rapid lesion progression compared to HIV-negative counterparts ( Van Bogaert, 2014 Bambury et al., 2013 Yap et al., 2020 Physical discomfort was widely reported among participants, emphasizing the importance of personalized care approaches. Pain levels varied significantly, which underscores the subjective nature of post-procedural recovery. Tailored care, including individualized pain management strategies and patient education on self-care, has positively influenced recovery and patient satisfaction ( Goldstein et al., 2024 Psychologically, the procedure profoundly impacted participants, with many experiencing anxiety and stress, particularly regarding their diagnosis and potential prognosis. While some participants displayed resilience, the emotional burden of awaiting uncertain outcomes suggests a need for enhanced counseling ( Sparić et al., 2019 Psychosocial support, especially from family and partners, was a significant factor in managing the treatment process for participants. This support reduced feelings of isolation and encouraged adherence to treatment recommendations. Partner engagement, in particular, reinforces the importance of a collaborative healthcare approach and underscores the need for inclusive counselling strategies that can positively affect reproductive health outcomes ( Finocchario-Kessler et al., 2016 Financial challenges were a persistent obstacle, with participants highlighting transport costs and other treatment expenses. Financial instability often restricts access to continuous care, underscoring the need for systemic support for low-income patients undergoing LLETZ. This finding aligns with studies that emphasize the critical role of financial stability in ensuring treatment adherence, particularly within underserved communities ( Van der Heijden et al., 2015 Owenga & Nyambedha, 2018 Van der Heijden et al., 2015 Misunderstandings about the procedure were common, underscoring the necessity of pre-procedure education. Many patients had misconceptions about the invasiveness and expected outcomes of LLETZ, which, if unaddressed, may lead to unnecessary fear or anxiety. Thorough education on the procedure, aided by anatomical diagrams, can clarify the procedure’s intent and expected effects, reducing patient apprehension ( Manga et al., 2024 Participants emphasized the importance of early detection and regular screenings, echoing policy initiatives that advocate for increased access to cervical cancer screening, particularly for high-risk populations like HIV-positive women. Early diagnosis improves outcomes and aligns with healthcare systems' growing emphasis on preventive care. Routine screening facilitates the timely identification of cervical abnormalities, preventing progression and enabling less invasive interventions ( Goldstein et al., 2024 The timing of result delivery emerged as a critical area of concern, with prolonged wait times for histology results contributing to heightened patient anxiety. Short-term diagnostic timelines could alleviate psychological distress and foster a more predictable care experience. A standardized turnaround time may also improve patient satisfaction, addressing a crucial gap in service delivery for high-risk and resource-limited populations ( Manga et al., 2024 This study emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to the LLETZ procedure for women living with HIV, addressing medical needs as well as emotional, social, and economic aspects of care. Integrating patient counseling, financial assistance, comprehensive education, and timely diagnostics into the LLETZ care pathway could significantly improve treatment outcomes, reduce procedural stress, and enhance the overall healthcare experience. The research examines the implications of the LLETZ procedure on women's health and quality of life, offering recommendations to enhance well-being and potentially increase life expectancy. To achieve these goals, the study underscores the necessity of open communication within families, encouraging patients to discuss their health conditions with their children for better support. Comprehensive pre-procedure counseling is deemed essential for minimizing patient uncertainty. It also calls for investigating the waiting period for histological examination following LLETZ at Vhembe District Hospital to identify factors impacting turnaround times. Involving partners in the healthcare journey and utilizing visual aids, such as diagrams of the female reproductive system, can clarify the procedure and foster understanding. Lastly, the importance of continuous education for healthcare professionals is highlighted to ensure that future workers are equipped to support women undergoing LLETZ. Overall, these recommendations aim to improve healthcare experiences and outcomes for women through collaboration among families, health professionals, and educational institutions. Conclusions This study emphasizes the critical need for comprehensive education and effective communication for women living with HIV who undergo LLETZ procedures, as significant gaps in understanding can negatively impact patient experiences and expectations. By identifying themes such as misconceptions and the psychological effects of uncertainty, the findings highlight the necessity for targeted interventions that address the unique psychosocial challenges faced by this population, particularly in reproductive health. Moving forward, healthcare providers, researchers, and educators must prioritize developing tailored educational programs and strategies that foster continuous patient engagement, clarify misconceptions and establish realistic expectations. Ultimately, the recommendations from this study provide a foundation for future research and practice aimed at minimizing uncertainty and improving the quality of care for women navigating the complexities of living with HIV and undergoing such medical interventions, thus advancing equitable health outcomes in the years to come.

Version 1 recommendation reject  Introduction Please restructure the Introduction to follow the standard “funnel” approach—beginning with a broad overview of the field, narrowing to the specific knowledge gap, and ending with a clear statement of the study objective. At present the objective is placed in the opening paragraph, which disrupts the logical flow and makes the section difficult to follow. See this reference on how to structure a scientific paper: (Mensh B & Kording K, 2017)- Ref 1. Please relocate the statement of the study objective to the final paragraph of the Introduction, in keeping with conventional manuscript structure. The link provided for “Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust (2020)” is inactive and the source does not appear to be a peer-reviewed reference. Please replace it with a scholarly citation that reports LLETZ efficacy, and specify whether the quoted success rate applies to HIV-negative or HIV-positive women. Published data indicate substantially lower cure rates in HIV-positive cohorts. Paragraph 3 of the Introduction contains a typographical error: “78,6 %” should read “78.6 %”. In the same paragraph, the phrase “the absence of specific recommendations for this high-risk group” is unclear, given your earlier statement that LLETZ is recommended for CIN 2/3 in HIV-positive women. Please clarify which recommendations are lacking. Methods Pre-test section: Omit routine details such as checking pens, notebooks, or recorder batteries; these are assumed and do not add value to the manuscript. Results Do not capitalise “participant seven” or similar descriptors within sentences; they are common nouns. Under Theme 1, the term “benignancy” is uncommon in cervical cancer literature. Consider defining it or substituting a more widely used term. This study offers valuable insights into women’s experiences with LEEP/LLETZ in high-burden regions—an issue central to achieving the WHO 90-70-90 cervical cancer elimination targets. While the results are noteworthy, the Introduction and Methods sections require substantial revision to meet publication standards.

Below, we respond point by point, indicating the revisions made.  Reviewer Comment 1 “Please restructure the Introduction to follow the standard ‘funnel’ approach—beginning with a broad overview of the field, narrowing to the specific knowledge gap, and ending with a clear statement of the study objective. At present, the objective is placed in the opening paragraph, which disrupts the logical flow and makes the section difficult to follow. See Mensh & Kording, 2017.”  Response We thank the reviewer for this important suggestion. We have restructured the Introduction to follow the funnel approach. It now begins with the global burden of cervical cancer, narrows to the specific issue of LLETZ treatment in HIV-positive women, highlights the lack of tailored recommendations and the absence of qualitative data on women’s lived experiences, and concludes with a clear statement of the study objective in the final paragraph. This aligns with the guidance of Mensh & Kording (2017).  Reviewer Comment 2 “Please relocate the statement of the study objective to the final paragraph of the Introduction, in keeping with conventional manuscript structure.”  Response We agree with this recommendation. The statement of the study objective has been moved from the opening paragraph to the concluding paragraph of the Introduction to ensure a conventional scientific structure and logical flow.  Reviewer Comment 3 “The link provided for ‘Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust (2020)’ is inactive, and the source does not appear to be a peer-reviewed reference. Please replace it with a scholarly citation that reports LLETZ efficacy, and specify whether the quoted success rate applies to HIV-negative or HIV-positive women. Published data indicate substantially lower cure rates in HIV-positive cohorts.”  Response We appreciate this observation. The non-peer-reviewed source has been replaced with a scholarly citation: Debeaudrap et al. (2019), which reports pooled cure rates of ~78.6% in HIV-positive women compared to >90% in HIV-negative women. The text has been revised to clearly specify these differences.  Reviewer Comment 4 “Paragraph 3 of the Introduction contains a typographical error: ‘78,6 %’ should read ‘78.6 %’.”  Response We thank the reviewer for identifying this typographical error. It has been corrected to “78.6 %.”  Reviewer Comment 5 “In the same paragraph, the phrase ‘the absence of specific recommendations for this high-risk group’ is unclear, given your earlier statement that LLETZ is recommended for CIN 2/3 in HIV-positive women. Please clarify which recommendations are lacking.”  Response We appreciate this request for clarification. The text has been revised to specify that while LLETZ is recommended for CIN2/3 in HIV-positive women, there is an absence of tailored recommendations for follow-up intervals, recurrence management, and long-term monitoring in this group.  Reviewer Comment 6 “Pre-test section: Omit routine details such as checking pens, notebooks, or recorder batteries; these are assumed and do not add value to the manuscript.”  Response We agree with this suggestion. The Pre-test section has been streamlined, and routine details about equipment checks have been removed. The section now focuses only on methodological relevance, such as the refinement of probing techniques.  Reviewer Comment 7 “Do not capitalise ‘participant seven’ or similar descriptors within sentences; they are common nouns.”  Response We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. All instances of “Participant [number]” have been changed to lowercase (e.g., “participant seven”) throughout the manuscript.  Reviewer Comment 8 “Under Theme 1, the term ‘benignancy’ is uncommon in cervical cancer literature. Consider defining it or substituting a more widely used term.”  Response We appreciate this observation. The term “benignancy” has been replaced with the more widely accepted phrase “benign outcome” to ensure clarity and alignment with standard terminology in cervical cancer literature.  Conclusion We are grateful to the reviewers for their careful reading and constructive feedback. The suggested revisions have improved the manuscript’s structure, clarity, and alignment with scholarly standards. We hope that the revised version satisfactorily addresses all concerns. Kindest regards  Lufuno. 10.5256/f1000research.174437.r375660 Reviewer response for version 1 Lowane Mygirl 1 Referee  1  Competing interests: 12 4 2025 Copyright: © 2025 Lowane M 2025 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ This is an open access peer review report distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Version 1 recommendation approve Thank for the opportunity to peer review this manuscript titled: Experiences of women living with HIV who underwent long loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) in selected hospitals of Vhembe district, Limpopo province, South Africa. I must commend that it is a well written manuscript in line with the journal scope. The abstract gave a satisfactory overview of all aspects and summarizes the entire paper. Page 3: paragraph 1, LLETZ – should be written in full before the abbreviation. I suggest that paragraph 1&2 to be merged as it addressing the same content. Furthermore, to my suggestion, the symbol “%” which is outside the brackets should be written in full word as “per cent”. From the background to discussion, the authors made a good attempt at providing a contextual platform, building the interest of the reader on paucity of integration of the need to explore Experiences of women living with HIV who underwent long loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) in selected hospitals of Vhembe district, Limpopo province, South Africa. The literature used in this paper gives the evidence of sufficient engagement with the relevant literature. The authors demonstrate adequate interpretation of relevant literature with depth in the arguments. The methodology: The use of qualitative method and phenomenological design by the authors is appropriate and this section is well done. The method, collection, and analysis of data is detailed enough to allow others to replicate them. The themes and the participants' quotes complement each other. Discussions also focused on the results of the study, including its implications and what the study adds to the knowledge. In summary, I found that objectives and research methods interact, that the results are clearly presented, that discussions are supported by literature, and that the conclusions justify the content of this document. I therefore Approved with very minor changes required. Is the work clearly and accurately presented and does it cite the current literature? Yes If applicable, is the statistical analysis and its interpretation appropriate? Not applicable Are all the source data underlying the results available to ensure full reproducibility? Yes Is the study design appropriate and is the work technically sound? Yes Are the conclusions drawn adequately supported by the results? Yes Are sufficient details of methods and analysis provided to allow replication by others?
