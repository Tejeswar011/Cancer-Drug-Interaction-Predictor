To overcome these limitations, this study proposed and validated an SPR biosensor utilizing MXene-functionalized PCF. By introducing a composite structure of MXene nanomaterials and Au, the detection performance of the sensor was significantly improved. The sensor adopts a circular air hole arrangement and double-groove morphology design and leverages MXene’s high conductivity and gold’s chemical stability to simultaneously enhance plasmonic coupling and biocompatibility. Through FEM-based structural optimization of the air hole diameter, Au layer thickness, and groove shape, the sensor exhibited outstanding refractive-index detection performance with a wavelength sensitivity of 11,072 nm/RIU, an impressive quality factor reaching 201.3 RIU −1 −6 MXene photonic crystal fiber (PCF) surface plasmon resonance (SPR) finite element method (FEM) biosensors Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region 2022GXNSFDA080006 National Natural Science Foundation of China 62265002 This research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, grant number 2022GXNSFDA080006; and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 62265002. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Cancer, a complex multi-organ disease, remains a critical challenge for global public health. Its pathogenesis involves the malignant proliferation and metastatic dissemination of abnormal cells that evade physiological regulation, ultimately leading to lethal outcomes. Carcinogenesis arises from the interplay between genetic mutations and environmental factors, including tobacco use, air pollution, ionizing radiation, pathogenic infections, and unhealthy lifestyles (e.g., alcohol abuse and physical inactivity), all of which are established risk factors. Early diagnosis substantially increases the 5-year survival rate to over 80%, whereas advanced-stage diagnoses are linked to rates below 20% [ 1 2 3 4 5 The PCF-SPR biosensor operates through evanescent field coupling to surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) at the metal–dielectric interface. As the guided light interacts with the interface beyond the fiber core, its oscillating electric field excites coherent electron density oscillations in the metal film, generating propagating SPP waves along the interface [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 10 12 13 14 14 PCF-SPR sensors have significant advantages for cancer-cell detection. Nagavel [ 15 −5 16 −6 17 18 19 2 −5 2 20 21 Despite these advancements, certain inherent limitations persist in current sensor designs. For example, while bilateral polishing techniques enable the creation of sensing platforms [ 15 17 In this study, we proposed a novel dual-slot PCF sensor based on the principle of SPR for detecting multiple cancer-cell types. The sensor uses a plasmonic Au-MXene composite coating to identify six cancer-cell types: basal cells, HeLa cells, Jurkat cells, PC-12 cells, MDA-MB-231 cells, and MCF-7 cells. The performance of the sensor was confirmed through finite element method (FEM) simulations, and its resolution was evaluated to characterize the sensitivity for detecting changes in the RI of the cell. The results show that the sensor has significant potential for the rapid and accurate identification of six cancer-cell types. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Sensor Model and Sensing Principle The two-dimensional cross-sectional geometry of the proposed dual-rectangular-groove PCF-SPR sensor is shown in Figure 1 The geometric parameters of the rectangular grooves are depth (H) = 3.7 μ m μ m μ m μ m μ m Λ  =  2  μ m 22 μ m The sensor substrate is composed of fused silica, with its wavelength-dependent RI governed by the Sellmeier dispersion relation [ 23 (1) n s i l i c a = 1 + A 1 λ 2 λ 2 − B 1 + A 2 λ 2 λ 2 − B 2 + A 3 λ 2 λ 2 − B 3 The coefficients of the Sellmeier equation are A 1 A 2 A 3 B 1 B 2 B 3 λ 24 (2) ε A u = ε ∞ − ω D 2 ω ω + j γ D − Δ ε  Ω L 2 ω ω − Ω L 2 + j Γ L ω ε A u ε ∞ = 5.9673 25  ω ω = 2 π c / λ c ω D γ D ω D = 2113.6 × 2 π γ D = 15.92 × 2 π Δ ε Ω L Γ L Ω L = 650.07 × 2 π  THz Γ L = 104.86 × 2 π  THz 26 2.2. Sensor Fabrication and Materials The sensor can be fabricated using the ‘stack-and-draw technique’ to prepare the PCF preforms. This method can perfectly reproduce the complex pore structure by accurately controlling the capillary arrangement and stretching temperature. A rectangular groove structure can be symmetrically etched at the top and bottom of the fiber using femtosecond-laser micromachining technology [ 27 MXenes represent a novel class of two-dimensional transition metal carbides/nitrides with the general chemical formula M n+1 n x x The Ti 3 2 x 3 2 28 13 3 2 x 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Sensor Performance The proposed plasmonic PCF biosensor achieved specific recognition of various cancer types by monitoring the dynamic changes in the single-cell horizontal RI. Different cancer types are closely associated with the RI characteristics of specific cell lines. Skin cancer is typically associated with basal cell characteristics, whereas breast cancer is frequently studied using cell lines such as MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and Jurkat cells. The sensor simulation demonstrates theoretical potential by detecting the difference in the RI between cancerous and healthy cells [ 29 Table 1 Figure 2 30 (3) L o s s ( d B c m ) ≅ 8.686 × 2 π λ × Im ( N e f f ) × 10 4 Following a comparative evaluation, the x-polarization mode was selected for cancer-cell detection. As illustrated in Figure 3 Figure 2 y y Loss Figure 2 μ m Figure 2 Figure 4 ∆ λ  =  40 − 155 Δ λ Δ n 19 (4) S λ nm / RIU = Δ λ p e a k Δ n a S λ Δ n a Figure 4 31 (5) R s = Δ n a Δ λ min Δ λ p e a k Δ λ m i n 32 (6) F O M = S λ F W H M A higher FOM value indicates that the sensor achieves high sensitivity while maintaining a narrow resonance peak width with notable detection precision and signal-to-noise ratio. Table 2 −1 Figure 5 The proposed sensor operates in the 1.75–2.10 µm range, which contains a strong water absorption band [ 33 34 35 3.2. Optimization of Geometric Parameters The structural parameters of the PCF-based sensor, including the pore dimensions, air hole pitch, Au film thickness, and depth of the square groove, critically governed its performance by mediating the incident light–plasmon coupling efficiency. To identify the optimal configurations of these parameters, we systematically analyzed the changes in the coupling loss (CL) and WS. Figure 6 ( d 3 = 0.40 , 0.45 , 0.50 μ m )  d 3 μ m μ m d 3 0.40  μ m 0.45  μ m 70  nm 80  nm This phenomenon is primarily caused by the expansion of the pore sizes, which promotes a stronger interaction between the evanescent field and the analyte, thereby enhancing the plasmonic energy coupling efficiency. However, when the d 3 0.50  μ m 95  nm d 3  =  0.45  μ m The groove depth is the core structural parameter, and its optimization has a regulatory effect on the efficiency of the sensor. Figure 7 ( H = 3.6 , 3.7 , 3.8 μ m 3.6 μ m 3.8 μ m 3.8 μ m H = 3.7 μ m The width of the square groove also affected the sensing efficiency of the biosensor. Figure 8 ( L = 3.2 , 3.6 , 4.0 μ m 4.0 μ m 3.2 μ m L = 3.2 μ m W S = 15,500  nm / RIU n = 1.40 L = 3.6  μ m L = 3.6  μ m Figure 9 The proposed design exhibits high tolerance to fabrication variances. FEM simulations show that within practical tolerances (±5 nm for Au, ±0.1 µm for groove), the sensor’s performance consistently remains in the high-sensitivity regime of 9000–12,000 nm/RIU. Notably, even in the worst-case scenario, the sensitivity remains quite competitive, ensuring reliable detection capability without requiring extreme fabrication precision. Based on simulation data, we calibrated the sensor across the 1.36–1.401 RIU range, which encompasses both physiological and cancerous cell refractive indices. The resulting linear relationship (R 2 Table 3 4. Conclusions In this study, a novel PCF-SPR biosensor was designed and evaluated through FEM simulations. The sensitivity and specificity of the sensor were significantly enhanced by introducing a symmetrical dual-rectangular groove structure. Using circularly arranged air holes, we constructed a composite structure with gold as the plasmonic excitation layer and MXene as the field-enhancing interlayer, which enhanced the coupling between the evanescent field and the analyte. Through FEM optimization of structural parameters (air hole diameter, Au layer thickness, and slot geometry), the sensor demonstrated exceptional performance in key metrics: exhibiting a sensitivity of 11,072 nm/RIU, with an FOM reaching 201.3 RIU −1 −6 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.L.; Methodology, M.L.; Software, M.L.; Validation, M.L.; Formal analysis, M.L.; Investigation, Y.H., S.X., P.Z., Y.Z. and H.T.; Resources, M.L.; Data curation, M.L.; Writing—original draft, M.L.; Writing—review & editing, J.T.; Visualization, M.L.; Supervision, Y.W., H.L. and J.H.; Project administration, J.T.; Funding acquisition, J.T.
