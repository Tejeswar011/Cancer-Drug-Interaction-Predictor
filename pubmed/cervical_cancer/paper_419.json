Design This secondary mediation analysis of a two-arm randomised controlled trial was conducted among female adolescents aged 15–18 years in Chengdu, China, from July 2022 to June 2023. Setting This study was conducted in four residential areas representing diverse economic backgrounds in Chengdu. Participants A total of 321 parents of girls aged 15–18 years who had not received the HPV vaccine participated in the study. Intervention Participants were randomly allocated into two arms. Pay-it-forward participants received a community-contributed subsidy (47.7 USD) to support the HPV vaccination, along with educational postcards and an opportunity to donate to support others. In the standard-of-care arm, participants paid for their vaccination. Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary outcome was the receipt of the first HPV vaccine dose within a 3-month period following an intervention. Based on previous literature, we hypothesised that vaccine confidence and vaccine delay intention were potential mediators. Vaccine confidence was measured using the vaccine confidence index. Vaccine delay intention refers to the caregiver’s preference to postpone HPV vaccination for their daughter until the preferred vaccine type becomes available, rather than accepting the immediately accessible HPV vaccine. Data on these mediators were collected via a self-administered online questionnaire conducted after the intervention but before vaccination. Results Among urban participants, when compared with the standard-of-care arm, about 39% of the effect of the pay-it-forward intervention on vaccine uptake was mediated by a reduction in vaccine delay intention. Notably, vaccine confidence did not appear to mediate the effect of the intervention on vaccine uptake. Among suburban participants, no mediation effects were observed. In the suburban setting, caregivers who vaccinated their daughters showed poorer prior awareness of the HPV vaccine before participating in the trial compared with those who did not vaccinate their daughters (41.5% vs 21.1%; p=0.011). Conclusion Our findings indicate that among urban participants, the pay-it-forward may have effectively reduced vaccine delay intention, which was associated with an increased uptake of the HPV vaccine. However, in suburban areas, enhanced awareness might be a potential contributing factor to improved vaccine uptake, but further research is necessary to affirm this.

Causal mediation analysis is usually preferred because it can accommodate more realistic settings, such as non-linear relations. The randomised controlled trial was not originally designed for mediation analysis, and the mediators were pre-identified and measured based on a limited range of potential factors. Introduction Cervical cancer poses a significant global health challenge, with China carrying a particularly heavy burden. In 2020, an estimated 110,000 new cases and 59,000 fatalities were attributed to cervical cancer in China. 1 2 3 4 5 Several factors contribute to the low vaccination rate. First, HPV vaccination is not included in China’s national immunisation programme, and the associated fees can prohibit many from vaccination. As of 2023, five types of HPV vaccines are available in the Chinese market: Cecolin (domestic 2v-HPV), Walrinvax (domestic 2v-HPV), Cervarix (imported 2v-HPV), Gardasil (4v-HPV) and Gardasil9 (9v-HPV). But there are frequent stockouts of 4v-HPV and 9v-HPV vaccines all over the country, and domestic 2v-HPV vaccines lack market demand. 6 7 8 9 10 The pay-it-forward intervention encourages healthy behaviours and community contributions. It gives one person a subsidised HPV vaccine along with a handwritten postcard as a gift, followed by voluntary donation and/or creation of a postcard message to support another person. Our previous two-arm randomised controlled trial (RCT) suggests that this model can improve earlier uptake of available HPV vaccines compared with standard-of-care self-paid vaccination arm. 11 12 14 Methods Study design This study adheres to the AGReMA (A Guideline for Reporting Mediation Analyses). 15 16 Population and inclusion criteria This randomised clinical trial was conducted among female adolescents aged 15–18 years in Chengdu, China, from 6 July 2022 to 9 June 2023. Four residential areas representing diverse economic backgrounds (high-income, middle-higher-income, middle-lower-income and low-income regions) in Chengdu were purposefully selected for the study. Eligibility criteria for participation included: (a) female adolescents aged 15–18 years; (b) residing in communities covered by the selected health centres; (c) no prior receipt of any HPV vaccine; (d) no known history of vaccine-related allergies; and (e) provision of caregiver consent to participate in the study. Randomisation and procedures Caregivers of eligible girls were invited by telephone calls following simple randomisation of the name lists recorded in the community administrative registration system until we reached the target sample size from each community. Participants with caregivers were invited to the vaccination clinics and randomly assigned to the two arms using the envelope concealment method. Intervention A total of 321 participants were recruited from the four sites, with 160 allocated to the standard-of-care group and 161 to the pay-it-forward group. Participants in the standard-of-care group received a health education leaflet about the HPV vaccine commonly used in clinics. They needed to self-pay the vaccine’s cost at the market price if they decided to vaccinate. Participants in the pay-it-forward group were informed that previous participants had donated 329 RMB (47.7 USD), equivalent to the cost of one dose of the domestic 2v-HPV vaccine, to support their vaccination. Additionally, they received postcard messages co-designed by college students tackling knowledge gaps ( online supplemental figure S1 Sample size The sample size calculation for the original trial was reported in a previous article. 16 Outcome measures The primary outcome was the receipt of the first dose of HPV vaccine following the intervention within 3 months. This was ascertained by clinical vaccination records obtained from the community health service centres. Putative mediators Data on mediator variables were collected through a self-administered online questionnaire after the intervention. During the study period, only the domestic 2v-HPV vaccine (Cecolin) was consistently available at the four community health service centres. Based on previous literature, we hypothesised that vaccine confidence 17 18 19 Vaccine confidence was measured using the vaccine confidence index (VCI), 20 21 22 17 23 Given the high willingness of Chinese parents to vaccinate and their widespread preference for the 9v-HPV vaccine—despite its limited supply—this study explored whether they would proceed with vaccination without delay if the preferred vaccine were easily accessible. To capture the specific Chinese context, a self-designed, scenario-based measure was used to assess intention of the participants to delay vaccination. Caregivers were asked what they would do if the 9v-HPV or 4v-HPV vaccines were not available at their community health service centre. Participants opting for the available 2v-HPV vaccine (whether domestic or imported) were considered as not intending to delay vaccination. Conversely, those who chose to postpone vaccination temporarily and wait until the 4v-HPV or 9v-HPV vaccines became available were considered as having vaccine delay intention. Confounders Because participants were randomly assigned, we assumed there were minimal confounding factors affecting both the intervention-mediator and intervention-outcome models. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) 24 online supplemental figures S2 and S3 Statistical analysis To explore how the pay-it-forward intervention might have worked in sub-populations with diverse sociodemographic backgrounds, we stratified participants into urban and suburban areas according to where the study took place geographically. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine the associations of interventions (standard-of-care and pay-it-forward groups) with vaccine uptake, vaccine confidence, and vaccine delay intention, adjusting for sex of guardian, annual household income, education level, marital status, daughter’s age, and awareness of 2v-HPV. For mediation analyses, we explored the multiple mediator models, including both vaccine confidence and vaccine delay intention. Given the potential correlation between the two, vaccine confidence (as an alternative mediator) could act as a post-randomisation confounder for the relationship between the primary mediator (vaccine delay intention) and the outcome (HPV uptake). 25 online supplemental table S1 figure 1 Figure 1 Directed acyclic graph of hypothesised mechanisms in single mediator model. Causal mediation analysis is usually preferred because it can accommodate more realistic settings, such as non-linear relations. 13 14 26 12 13 27 We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the ACME to bias from residual confounding. Because both the outcome and mediators were binary variables, the ‘medsens’ function in the ‘mediation’ package was not appropriate for sensitivity analysis. 27 28 28 29 The post hoc analysis was conducted to explore factors affecting HPV vaccine uptake. χ 2 Results A total of 321 participants were enrolled in the study. Baseline characteristics of participants were well balanced between the two groups, except in suburban areas where the pay-it-forward group had a slightly higher proportion of male caregivers compared with the standard-of-care group ( table 1 Table 1 Baseline characteristics of participants in urban and suburban areas Suburban areas Urban areas Standard-of-care (n=76) Pay-it-forward (n=79) P Standard-of-care (n=84) Pay-it-forward (n=82) P Age (girls)—years 16.6±1.0 16.7±0.9 0.423 16.7±0.9 16.5±1.1 0.150 Age (caregivers)—years 45.5±9.8 42.9±8.0 0.070 43.3±6.9 43.2±8.4 0.949 Sex of the caregiver  0.005 0.601 Male 9 (11.8) 24 (30.4) 17 (20.2) 14 (17.1) Female 67 (88.2) 55 (69.6) 67 (79.8) 68 (82.9) Marital status of the caregivers 0.909 0.132 Unmarried 10 (13.1) 12 (15.2) 4 (4.8) 11 (13.4) Married 62 (81.6) 62 (78.5) 72 (85.7) 62 (75.6) Divorced or widowed 4 (5.3) 5 (6.3) 8 (9.5) 9 (11.0) The education level of the caregiver 0.556 0.892 High school or less 66 (86.8) 71 (89.9) 48 (57.1) 46 (56.1) College or more 10 (13.2) 8 (10.1) 36 (42.9) 36 (43.9) Income * 0.219 0.323 ≤11,611 USD/year 62 (81.6) 70 (88.6) 48 (57.1) 53 (64.6) > 11,611 USD/year 14 (18.4) 9 (11.4) 36 (42.9) 29 (35.4) Have you ever heard of HPV? 0.590 >0.999 Yes 62 (81.6) 67 (84.8) 80 (95.2) 78 (95.1) No 14 (18.4) 12 (15.2) 4 (4.8) 4 (4.9) Have you heard of the HPV vaccine? 0.748 0.097 Yes 64 (84.2) 65 (82.3) 82 (97.6) 75 (91.5) No 12 (15.8) 14 (17.7) 2 (2.4) 7 (8.5) Do you know that the 2v-HPV vaccine has been marketed in China (including domestic and imported)? 0.744 0.758 Yes 55 (72.4) 59 (74.7) 76 (90.5) 73 (89.0) No 21 (27.6) 20 (25.3) 8 (9.5) 9 (11.0) Data are mean (SD) or n (%). 1USD=6.89 RMB.

In both total participants and those from urban areas, confidence in the safety, effectiveness and importance of the bivalent vaccine did not appear to clarify the impact of the pay-it-forward intervention on HPV vaccination behaviour. All intervention-mediator (ie, Path a) estimates were significant, whereas all mediator-outcome (ie, Path b) estimates were not significant. Sensitivity analysis indicated that these effects were likely robust against residual confounding. Specifically, the critical rho value at which the ACME would diminish to zero is 0.7 for urban participants and 0.6 for the total sample ( online supplemental figures S4 and S5 Since there were no significant differences in putative mediators between the pay-it-forward group and the standard-of-care group among suburban residents, additional analyses to assess causal mediation effects were not conducted. Post hoc analysis In suburban populations, the pay-it-forward intervention effectively increased HPV vaccination rates. However, there was no significant difference in vaccine delay intention and vaccine confidence between the pay-it-forward and the standard-of-care group. The findings revealed that, among suburban participants, caregivers whose daughters were vaccinated through the programme had lower baseline awareness of HPV and HPV vaccines than those who chose not to vaccinate ( table 3 Table 3 Comparison of pre-intervention vaccine awareness among guardians of vaccinated versus unvaccinated girls, stratified by urban and suburban areas Total (n=166) Urban Suburban Unvaccinated Vaccinated P Total Unvaccinated Vaccinated P Have you ever heard of HPV? 0.692  0.013 Yes 158 (95.2) 119 (96.0) 39 (92.9) 129 (83.2) 100 (87.7) 29 (70.7) No 8 (4.8) 5 (4.0) 3 (7.1) 26 (16.8) 14 (12.3) 12 (29.3) Have you heard of the HPV vaccine? 0.335  0.003 Yes 157 (94.6) 119 (96.0) 38 (90.5) 129 (83.2) 101 (88.6) 28 (68.3) No 9 (5.4) 5 (4.0) ４(9.5) 26 (16.8) 13 (11.4) 13 (31.71) Do you know that the 2v-HPV vaccine has been marketed in China (including domestic and imported)? 0.961  0.011 Yes 149 (89.8) 112 (90.3) 37 (88.1) 114 (73.5) 90 (78.9) 24 (58.5) No 17 (10.2) 12 (9.7) 5 (11.9) 41 (26.5) 24 (21.1) 17 (41.5) Boldface indicates statistical significance (p<0.05). HPV, human papillomavirus. Discussion This is a rare study that assessed potential mediators of a community-engaged pay-it-forward intervention on HPV vaccination, specifically focusing on changes in vaccine confidence and vaccine delay intention. Causal mediation analyses revealed that in urban areas, the effect of the pay-it-forward intervention on HPV vaccination was largely attributed (39%) to a decrease in vaccine delay intention. No significant mediating effect was observed for vaccine confidence. Among suburban participants, no significant mediation effects were found. Interestingly, among vaccinated individuals in suburban areas, a higher proportion lacked prior awareness about HPV vaccines compared with those who were unvaccinated. We found that vaccine delay intention may be an important mediator for the pay-it-forward behavioural intervention. Among urban populations, approximately 39% of the intervention’s effect on HPV vaccination behaviour was mediated through reduced vaccine delay intention. This suggests that addressing delay intentions—particularly the tendency to wait for the 9-valent vaccine—may be a key pathway through which behavioural interventions influence vaccination uptake. Interventions that enhance awareness of available vaccine options and encourage timely action within the optimal vaccination window may be especially effective in urban settings. Incorporating these elements into future health communication and service delivery strategies could help reduce vaccination delays and improve overall coverage. However, we focused on vaccine type preference as a key reason for vaccine delay, while acknowledging that other important factors also influence vaccination decisions. Previous research indicated that vaccine delay is related to costs, lack of vaccine confidence, poor awareness of available vaccine products and associated benefits. 30 32 33 6 10 34 35 36 16 Our data further found that among urban participants, the pay-it-forward intervention was significantly associated with enhanced vaccine confidence compared with standard-of-care practice. This is consistent with a previous analysis that identified pay-it-forward intervention’s association with increased vaccine confidence levels. 33 37 38 Another interesting finding in our study was that in suburban areas, the effectiveness of the pay-it-forward intervention fell short of expectations, but caregivers who vaccinated their daughters had lower pre-intervention awareness of the HPV vaccine compared with those who did not vaccinate their daughters. It appears that caregivers with limited initial knowledge may be motivated to vaccinate once they receive relevant information, whereas those with greater prior awareness might still decline vaccination due to other factors such as cost, vaccine accessibility, preference for certain vaccine types and prevailing social norms. 39 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 However, the study has several limitations. First, because the RCT was not specifically designed for mediation analysis, the identification and measurement of mediators were predetermined and focused on a limited set of potential factors. Future qualitative research with trial participants could be conducted to understand potential impact of different components of the pay-it-forward strategy. Second, the sample size was not determined based on the need for a causal mediation analysis, limiting the power of our analyses. But our analyses identified potential associations and provided a direction for future examination on potential mediation effects of vaccine confidence on uptake behaviours. We recommend that future vaccination behavioural trial designs could factor in vaccine confidence as a potential mediator to further validate its role through collecting more robust trial data. Third, there is a possibility of unmeasured confounders mixing with residual confounders. However, we conducted sensitivity analyses to ensure the reliability and robustness of these findings. Finally, while the measures of vaccine confidence and delay intention were brief and feasible, they were somewhat narrow. Vaccine confidence was assessed solely using the VCI, and delay intention was defined mainly by vaccine type preference, potentially overlooking key factors such as risk perception, trust in healthcare, financial constraints and social influences—limiting the ability to fully capture the complexity of vaccine decision-making. Conclusion Our study indicates that in affluent urban areas, vaccine delay intention potentially mediates the influence of pay-it-forward interventions on vaccination uptake. A pay-it-forward strategy could improve vaccine confidence effectively, but vaccine confidence did not show a significant mediating effect. In remote areas with limited access to information, disseminating vaccine-related information could be a promising strategy to boost vaccination rates. There is a necessity to investigate more effective intervention approaches suitable for remote areas and to refine the information provided through pay-it-forward initiatives tailored to this population.
