Although early-stage disease is effectively treated via hysterectomy, a dearth of molecularly targeted therapies means that prognoses are far poorer for those with disseminated or recurrent disease. Herein, we describe the exploration of 3 biomarkers—human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), mucin-16 (MUC16), and CD24—as potential radiotheranostic targets for endometrial cancer.

The incidence of endometrial cancer is rising 1%–2% every year, and it is one of the few cancers whose mortality rate is increasing ( 1 2 1 3 The diagnosis of endometrial cancer typically relies on pelvic ultrasound and dilation and curettage. As the former has a relatively low specificity for the disease, a biopsy via dilation and curettage is commonly required for patients showing symptoms, such as postmenopausal bleeding or pelvic pain ( 4 1 5 1 6 7 8 8 9 10 11 The past 2 decades have been witness to a remarkable surge in the use of radiopharmaceuticals for the imaging and therapy of cancer. The 2 standard bearers of this movement, [ 177 177 12 13 14 18 8 64 15 We report on the evaluation of 3 antigens—human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), mucin-16 (MUC16), and CD24—as potential radiotheranostic targets in endometrial cancer. HER2 is a transmembrane receptor most often associated with breast cancer but is overexpressed in a host of other malignancies; MUC16 is a type I transmembrane mucin most often associated with ovarian and pancreatic cancer; and CD24 is a small, membrane-bound glycoprotein that is overexpressed in several solid carcinomas, such as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer ( 16 17 18 19 89 MATERIALS AND METHODS All reagents were purchased from Fisher Scientific unless otherwise noted. Trastuzumab and AR9.6 were provided by the Radiochemistry and Molecular Imaging Probes Core of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and ATG-031 was purchased from MedChemExpress. Protein concentrations were determined via ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy using a molar absorptivity of 2.1 × 10 5 −1 −1 5 p 89 http://jnm.snmjournals.org 20 21 Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Imaging Human endometrial cancer (HEC-1-A) cells were seeded (5 × 10 4 Staining of Patient-Derived Tissue Samples Patient-derived endometrial adenocarcinoma tissue was obtained from the Anti-Tumor Assessment Core at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Healthy human endometrial and cervical tissue slides were obtained from Tissue Array. All tissue specimens received were formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded before arrival. Paraffin was removed from the tissue samples using xylenes followed by serial dilutions with ethanol and water. Antigen retrieval was performed using a trypsin antigen retrieval kit (AbCam) in accordance with the manufacturer-provided protocol. Immunofluorescent staining of the tissue samples was performed using the same procedure as described above. Confocal images were analyzed using ImageJ, and histograms were kept consistent between each sample, including a negative control that did not receive the primary antibody. Subcutaneous Xenografts All animal care was approved by the institutional animal care and use committees of Hunter College and Weill Cornell Medical College. Female athymic nude mice (5- to 8-wk old; The Jackson Laboratory) were allowed to acclimatize for 1 wk before inoculation. The animals were housed in ventilated cages and given food and water ad libitum. The mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 2% isoflurane–oxygen gas mixture (Baxter Healthcare), and the injection site was sanitized with an ethanol wipe. Tumors were induced in the right shoulder via the subcutaneous injection of 2 × 10 6 3 PET Imaging PET images were acquired using an Inveon PET/CT small-animal scanner (Siemens Medical Solutions). After the subcutaneous tumors reached an appropriate size for experimentation, the mice were placed under a heat lamp to facilitate vein dilation, and their skin was sterilized using an ethanol wipe. [ 89 89 89 n 89 Biodistribution Studies After the final imaging time point (120 h after injection), the animals were euthanized via asphyxiation with carbon dioxide gas followed by cervical dislocation. Blood, tumor tissue, and selected organs were harvested, rinsed in water, dried, and weighed, and the amount of activity in each was quantified on a 89 Patient-Derived Xenografts (PDXs) PDX samples were provided by the laboratory of Britta Weigelt at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The tumors were implanted into the right flank of NSG (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid) mice by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Antitumor Assessment Core in accordance with protocols approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. RESULTS Evaluating the Expression of HER2, MUC16, and CD24 in Endometrial Adenocarcinoma Immunocytochemical staining was used to evaluate the expression levels of HER2, MUC16, and CD24 in HEC-1-A cells. To this end, immobilized HEC-1-A cells were incubated with trastuzumab (αHER2), AR9.6 (αMUC16), or ATG-031 (αCD24) and subsequently stained with a fluorophore-modified antihuman secondary antibody. Immunofluorescence imaging clearly revealed that the cells expressed the 3 antigens to varying degrees, with the MUC16 cells exhibiting the least pronounced and the CD24 cells showing the most intense expression ( Fig. 1 FIGURE 1. Immunocytochemical staining of HEC-1-A (×20 and ×40 magnifications), 12Z, SHT290, and human uterine microvascular endothelial cells (HUtMEC) for HER2, MUC16, and CD24. Alexa Fluor 488–bearing secondary antibodies were used for antigen staining (green), and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was used to stain DNA (blue). We next characterized the expression of these antigens in patient-derived endometrial cancer tissue samples obtained from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Antitumor Assessment Core. To this end, 4 different tumor samples of various molecular subtypes of the disease—microsatellite instability (P1), copy-number low (P2), and polymerase epsilon (POLE) ultramutated (P3), and P4 (subtype unknown)—were incubated with trastuzumab, AR9.6, or ATG-031; stained with a fluorophore-labeled secondary mAb, and evaluated via confocal microscopy ( Fig. 2 22 23 FIGURE 2.

In this system, cases are classified as POLE ultramutated (7% of cases), microsatellite instability (28%), copy-number high (39%), and copy-number low (26%) ( 22 23 25 The clear potential of HER2 and CD24 as molecular targets in endometrial cancer raises the question of how these 2 targets could be exploited for clinical nuclear medicine. The data presented herein suggest that [ 89 89 It is more likely, however, that HER2- and CD24-targeted immuno-PET would be deployed as a companion imaging tool for molecularly targeted therapeutics. HER2 is a proven target for both immunotherapeutics (e.g., Herceptin; Genentech) and antibody–drug conjugates (e.g., Enhertu; Daiichi-Sankyo) ( 26 27 89 28 89 89 CD24 is, of course, a much more emergent therapeutic target than HER2. The antigen is overexpressed in a plethora of cancers and is believed to promote both cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, CD24 has been shown to have an important role in immune evasion, specifically through its interaction with the inhibitory receptor Siglec-10 on macrophages ( 16 29 30 14 89 Radiopharmaceutical therapy represents a third possibility for the application of HER2- and CD24-targeted radioimmunoconjugates in endometrial cancer. Admittedly, this is unlikely in the case of CD24, as the expression of the antigen by hematopoietic stem cells and lymphocytes raises the specter of significant hematotoxicity ( 16 131 177 225 212 211 31 32 CONCLUSION This investigation illustrated the potential of HER2 and CD24 as radiotheranostic targets in endometrial cancer. We have shown that both antigens are abundantly expressed in endometrial cancer cells as well as patient-derived tissue samples representing several molecular subtypes of the disease. Furthermore, immuno-PET probes targeting [ 89 89 89 89 DISCLOSURE Brian Zeglis reports funding from the National Institutes of Health (1R01CA281801, 1R01CA244327, and 1R01CA240963).
