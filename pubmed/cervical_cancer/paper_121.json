Inflammatory triggers, such as infections and autoimmunity, can breach immune privilege, induce anti-sperm antibody (ASA) production, and impair fertility. However, the mechanisms governing ASA production are poorly characterized. Here, using a murine model of epididymitis induced by regulatory T cell (Treg) depletion, we show that the disruption of immunotolerance leads to chronic autoimmunity characterized by the presence of ASA, and distinct testicular and epididymal immune landscapes. These inflammatory features impair sperm function, contribute to epididymal damage, and drive subfertility. Treg depletion induces the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) within the epididymis, as indicated by the presence of B and T cell clusters, fibroblasts, and high endothelial venules. Similar autoantibody responses were detected in the seminal plasma of infertile patients, suggesting conserved mechanisms. Thus, we provide an in-depth analysis of immune cell dynamics and TLS during epididymitis, offering insights for the development of precision-targeted therapies for fertility disorders, as well as the identification of new contraceptive strategies. Chronic inflammation affects the male reproductive system, contributing to infertility. Using a mouse model of epididymitis, here, the authors report on the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) under conditions of chronic inflammation, and show that TLSs sustain immune activation, contributing to anti-sperm autoantibody production and epididymal injury.

Male infertility accounts for roughly 50% of 17% of infertility cases worldwide 1 2 4 1 The recognition of sperm antigens as foreign by immune cells is linked to their delayed development, which occurs long after the process of establishing self-tolerance, during puberty 5 6 7 8 7 8 9 Regulatory T cells (Treg) prevent immune responses against sperm in the testis, where spermatozoa are produced, and the epididymis, where they mature and are stored 5 6 10 5 10 In this study, we enhance our understanding of chronic epididymitis by offering a region- and time-specific analysis of its immune environment, emphasizing its clinical importance. Unlike acute inflammation, mainly driven by myeloid cell responses, chronic epididymitis involves ongoing activation of T and B cells that impair epididymal function, leading to persistent male subfertility. A key finding is the discovery of TLSs in the distal epididymis. Absent in acute inflammation, these structures represent a mechanism that sustains immune activation, fuels chronic inflammation, and worsens fertility issues. We identify antigens targeted by ASAs, providing potential insights into their functional impacts. Similar autoantibody responses are found in the seminal plasma of infertile men, indicating shared underlying mechanisms in mice and humans. Understanding these immune regulation processes broadens our knowledge of the largely unexplored post-testicular environment and its vital role in ongoing infertility. These findings could inspire new therapeutic strategies for male fertility problems and help develop novel targets for male contraception. Results Treg depletion induced early epididymal epithelial changes Using transgenic mice that express the diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor (DTR) under the control of the Foxp3 promoter (Foxp3-DTR/EGFP mice), we disrupted immunotolerance by Treg ablation using a DT-based depletion protocol 5 10 1A 1B–F 1G + 11 1H 1H–K 1 Fig. 1 Regulatory T cell (Treg) depletion in the epididymis and testis, and epididymal epithelial damage of Foxp3-DTR mice 1 day after diphtheria toxin (DT) treatment.

Treg dysfunction leads to autoimmune subfertility, characterized by unique T and B cell infiltrating profiles and in-situ production of autoantibodies targeting sperm and reproductive tissues. In chronic epididymitis, TLSs form in distal regions, serving as hubs for local lymphocyte activation and autoantibody production. The discovery of these ectopic lymphoid structures in the epididymis offers a new perspective on how immune system dysregulation impacts reproductive health. We identified a dynamic communication network among epithelial cells, lymphocytes, and myeloid cells. We also found multiple sperm antigens recognized by serum and epididymal fluid ASAs, providing valuable insights into their potential functional effects on sperm. Our analysis of autoantibodies in the seminal plasma of infertile patients revealed shared mechanisms with murine models, shedding light on reproductive immune disorders. The epididymis is key for sperm maturation, and inflammation in this organ disrupts sperm function 12 36 10 37 38 36 13 36 39 40 7 9 31 33 41 Heterogeneity is a defining characteristic of epididymal segments, underscoring differences in immune responses across regions 10 12 13 28 39 42 8 9 31 33 35 43 Local players—such as epithelial and resident immune cells—might drive the recruitment and activation of specific immune populations 12 28 39 44 45 28 39 45 8 46 47 The TLS composition varies depending on the tissue type and the specific immune responses involved 8 31 8 31 + 7 9 31 33 8 9 33 8 9 33 8 31 While TLSs have been identified in testicular tumors 33 48 49 50 Tregs play a context-specific role in TLS formation 8 51 7 8 31 33 8 + 52 + 53 + 8 2 3 54 3 55 Sertoli cells in the testis are essential for maintaining the blood-testicular barrier 56 57 58 59 3 60 2 3 60 Identifying the targets of ASAs remains a critical area of research, as doing so could lead to better diagnosis and treatment of ASA-mediated immune infertility and the development of new contraceptive methods. An IgG1 anti-sperm monoclonal antibody is currently under development as a non-hormonal contraceptive 61 3 62 63 8 9 31 33 13 28 Icolg 13 28 13 64 Autoimmune diseases are associated with male infertility due to localized inflammation, as seen in rheumatoid arthritis and lupus 65 AIRE 66 67 68 68 Immunotolerance breakdown in the epididymis and testis triggers chronic inflammation and local autoimmune responses, marked by autoantibody deposition, region-specific lymphocyte signatures, and soluble mediator secretion. This immune disruption impairs sperm function and drives prolonged male subfertility. Epididymal TLSs may exacerbate inflammation by driving local autoantibody production. Our study identifies key molecular mediators involved in TLS formation and highlights that unexplained male fertility disorders may be linked to immune dysregulation, characterized by pro-inflammatory cell recruitment, autoantibodies, and elevated soluble mediators. Overall, we provide an in-depth understanding of B and T cell diversity dynamics and TLS formation during epididymitis to develop precision-targeted therapies for reproductive dysfunction and chronic inflammation. Methods Animal procedures adhered to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Subcommittee on Research Animal Care (National Academies Press, 2011; protocol 2003N000216). The human study adhered to the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki (1975, revised in 1983) and was approved by the Medicine Research Ethics Committee of the Basque Country, Spain (protocol: PI2019184). Mouse model Female C57BL/6-Tg(Foxp3-DTR/EGFP)23.2Spar/Mmjax (032050-JAX, Foxp3-DTR mice) and male C57BL/6 WT mice were acquired from Jackson Laboratory and bred at the MGH animal facility (specific pathogen-free) to produce Foxp3-DTR or WT male littermates 10 10 Corynebacterium diphtheriae Sex as a biological variable: Mouse in vivo staining The in vivo staining of circulating CD45 + 11 tm Mouse testis and epididymis collection Mice were anesthetized using a mixture of isoflurane (2%) and air and then perfused through the left cardiac ventricle with PBS until the organs were free of blood (for ELISA and mediator arrays). Subsequently, the epididymis and testes were dissected for further analysis. For tissues fixation, perfusion continued with a 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; 15714-S, Paraformaldehyde 32% Solution EM grade, Electron Microscopy Sciences) fixative for 7 min. Following harvesting, the organs were immersed in 4% PFA for 4 h. For in vivo CD45 staining, animals were not subjected to PBS perfusion. Instead, the organs were excised after euthanasia using a mixture of isoflurane (2%) and air. Mouse sperm collection Sperm samples were retrieved from the proximal (initial segments (IS) and caput) and distal (cauda) regions of the epididymis in Foxp3-DTR and WT littermates following DT injections. Sperm samples were obtained by excising the respective areas in modified Human Tubal Fluid (HTF) medium (#90126, FUJIFILM Irvine Scientific, Inc., Santa Ana, CA) enriched with 0.3% of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA; A0281, Sigma-Aldrich). After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, sperm were examined using CASA (computer analysis system assay) and/or fixed with 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature. Mouse serum collection Blood was drawn from the left ventricle of the heart into BD Microtainer blood collection tubes (365967, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). After allowing the samples to sit at room temperature for 30 min, they were centrifuged at 4000 × g Mouse tissue processing Cleaned, perfused, and frozen tissues were thawed in PBS supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (#04693159001, cOmplete Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Tissues were minced with scissors, homogenized with a pestle, and incubated on ice for 30 min. The supernatant was collected after centrifuging for 20 min at 10,000 × g For cytokine/chemokine kit measurements, the same procedure was followed. Tissues (4 proximal and 4 distal epididymides from DT-treated WT and Foxp3-DTR mice) were thawed and processed in PBS with Triton ×-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) as stated in the manufacturer’s protocol (ARY028, Proteome Profiler Mouse XL Cytokine Array R&D Systems). Luminescence measurement was performed using Syngene G:BOX Mini 9). Heat maps were generated using the web-based software Morpheus ( https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus Mouse epididymal fluid collection Epididymal fluids were retrieved from the proximal (IS and caput) and distal (cauda) of the epididymis in Foxp3-DTR and WT post-DT. Fluids were obtained by excising the respective areas in PBS. After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, tissues were discarded, and samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g Confocal microscopy Similar to previous studies 10 44 Primary antibodies utilized were rat anti-mouse-F4/80 10 10 10 M32407 M32707 69 Different antigen retrieval methods were employed based on the antibody used: a 4-min treatment with PBS containing 1% SDS (for V-ATPase, CD19, CD20, CD3, PNAD, PDPN, IgD, and AQP9 antibodies), or PBS containing 1% SDS and 0.1% Triton (for F4/80, IgG, and IgA antibodies). Slides were then blocked for 30 min at room temperature in PBS containing 1% BSA and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. All antibodies were diluted in DAKO medium (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Mounted slides were treated with SlowFade Diamond Antifade Mounting medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, S36963 25 H&E evaluation Sections were stained with Hematoxylin Solution, Harris Modified (HHS32, Sigma-Aldrich), and subsequently counterstained with Eosin Y Solution (HT110132, Sigma-Aldrich). The stained slides were digitally scanned using a NanoZoomer 2.0RS digital scanner (Hamamatsu, Japan). To assess spermatogenesis, we used the NDP.View2 software, which allows high-resolution zooming to single-cell detail. The quantification of spermatogenesis is based on the classification of germ cells according to their cellular and nuclear morphology, as well as their specific location within the seminiferous tubules. This includes distinguishing spermatogonia, primary and secondary spermatocytes, round and elongated spermatids, and spermatozoa 70 Flow cytometry analysis The proximal and distal segments of the epididymis and testis were mechanically minced and enzymatically digested for 30 min at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing collagenase type I (0.5 mg/mL) and collagenase type II (0.5 mg/mL), following established protocols 10 g g L23105 L34967 For intranuclear staining of the Foxp3 and intracellular staining of IgM and IgG, suspensions were incubated for 20 min with 1× Fixation/Permeabilization working solution and washed with 1× Permeabilization Buffer, following the manufacturer’s instructions (#00-5523-00, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Fixed cells were then incubated overnight with 1/100 dilution of anti-Foxp3-APC (0.2 mg/ml; Clone FJK-16s, 17-5773-82, ThermoFisher Scientific), IgM BV786 (0.2 mg/ml; Clone R6-60.2, 564028, BD Biosciences) IgG PE/Cyanine7 (0.2 mg/ml; Clone Poly4053, 405315, BioLegend) diluted in 1× Permeabilization Buffer (00-5523-00, Thermo Fisher Scientific) containing BD Horizon Brilliant Stain buffer (563794, BD Biosciences). After incubation, cells were washed with 2% FBS in PBS and filtered through a 40 μm cell strainer. Flow cytometry data were collected using the BD FACSAria II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), BD LSRFortessa ×-20 Cell Analyzer (BD Biosciences), or AURORA flow cytometer (Cytek Aurora System) and interpreted using FlowJo software version 10.8.1 (BD Biosciences). Negative (unstained cells from each organ) and fluorescence minus one controls were conducted to establish gating strategies, following established procedures. The gating strategies used are illustrated in the corresponding Figures and Supplementary Figs. 26 27 t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and FlowSOM analysis were applied to flow data, enabling detailed characterization of cell populations. t-SNE was used for dimensionality reduction to visualize high-dimensional flow cytometry data projected into a lower-dimensional space, and FlowSOM self-organizing mapping clusters cells based on their phenotypic similarities, for predicting distinct cell populations. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Proteins were extracted from the testis, epididymis, and sperm of WT mice and healthy human sperm donors, using a buffer consisting of RIPA buffer (R26200-125.0, RPI Research Products International, Mt. Prospect, IL) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (#04693159001, cOmpleteTM Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (#4906837001, PhosSTOP, Roche) for 20 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g M32407 M32707 2 4 Computer assisted sperm analysis (CASA) Sperm were harvested from the proximal/distal epididymis as described above. After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, proximal/distal sperm were collected and analyzed. Alternatively, distal sperm were obtained and then diluted (1:5 ratio) in HTF medium with 0.3% BSA, followed by a 60-min incubation at 37 °C to induce sperm capacitation. Sperm analysis was conducted using Hamilton Thorne’s CASA version 14 (Hamilton Thorne Inc., Beverly, MA). Each sample underwent a minimum of two analyses. Assessment of fertility Male littermates of both Foxp3-DTR and WT mice (8-week post-DT injections) were singly housed with a WT adult female for 5 days. The presence of a copulatory plug confirmed successful mating. Fertility assessment was determined based on litter size, representing the number of pups per litter. Immunoprecipitation using anti-sperm antibodies Serum and proximal and distal epididymal fluids were collected from WT and Foxp3-DTR mice 2 weeks following DT treatment. We pooled at least three samples per condition (3 serum, 6 proximal, and 6 distal epididymal fluids from WT and Foxp3-DTR) and performed two independent experiments. These samples were incubated with Dynabeads Protein G, washed, and then incubated with protein extracts (as previously described) derived from proximal or distal sperm cells of WT naïve mice, following the manufacturer’s protocol (Immunoprecipitation Kit—Dynabeads Protein G, 10006D, Invitrogen). Eluates were run on a 10% bis-acrylamide gel (NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris Gel, NP0302BOX, Invitrogen), then stained with Coomassie dye R-250 (Imperial Protein Stain, 24615, Thermo Scientific), bands were cut and submitted to the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility, Harvard Medical School, Building C, Room 523, 240 Longwood Ave. Boston, MA 02115, similar to previously reported 10 1 3 Proteomic data analysis Proteomic datasets from each experimental group were compared using the VENNY 2.1 Venn Diagram online tool ( https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/ 3 3 Human sample collection Human semen samples were obtained from patients undergoing routine semen analysis at the assisted reproduction unit of the Cruces and Galdakao University Hospital of Bizkaia (Spain). Ejaculates were collected by masturbation after 3–5 days of sexual abstinence. All patients provided signed informed consent to the Declaration of Helsinki. Semen parameters and the presence of round cells (RC) were evaluated using the Sperm Class Analyzer CASA System (Microptics). After semen analysis, all samples were classified as normozoospermic or asthenozoospermic according to the World Health Organization guidelines 1 1 2 Human sample processing Human semen samples were centrifuged at 300 × g Statistical analysis Data analysis was conducted using GraphPad Prism 10 version 10.3.1 (464) (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
