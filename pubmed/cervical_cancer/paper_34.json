Introduction: Pap smear is a universally accepted screening test for early diagnosis of premalignant and malignant cervical lesions. Most studies show inflammation as the most common finding in Pap screening. Cervical infections frequently lead to inflammation and pose significant clinical implications due to their potential to manifest as infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease, and pregnancy-related complications such as chorioamnionitis. Methods: A prospective analysis of 3230 cervical liquid-based cytology smears collected during January 2017 to June 2018 was undertaken to identify prevalent infection types in cervical smears in a North Indian population catered at tertiary care hospital. Results: A total of 2303 (71.3%) cases screened were in the age group of 21–40 years with a median age of 35.7 years. Totally 25.1% of cases had infection, of which the most common was bacterial vaginosis (BV) (58.07%), followed by Candida Trichomonas vaginalis P Conclusion: Cervical cancer screening program for early detection of cervical neoplasia has efficiently led to a significant reduction in the incidence of cervical cancer worldwide. Notably, early detection and treatment of infectious lesions in cervix have also helped in reducing complications related to various infections. BV is recognized as the most common vaginal infection, and its association with cervical preneoplasia, as shown by recent studies, is being viewed as a possible etiology behind cervical neoplasia and needs to be explored through further research.

It is also useful for the diagnosis of cervicovaginal infections. It is an easy, fast, and patient-friendly procedure. Screening is carried out primarily for early detection of dysplasia and cancer prevention; however, inflammation is the most common finding encountered.[ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Trichomonas vaginalis 9 Objectives of study The objective of the study was to analyze the spectrum, prevalence, and most common type of infection on LBC cervical smears in our region of women of all ages. M ETHODS A prospective analysis of cervical Pap smear study was done over a period of 18 months from January 2017 to June 2018 in the department of pathology in a tertiary care center of northern India. All the women undergoing Pap smear either as a part of routine cervical screening or due to medical reasons in the gynecology outpatient department were included in the study. Relevant history and clinical details were collected from the requisition form. Qualified gynecologists collected all cervical samples. All gynecologists selected to use the liquid-based technique were instructed on the manufacturer’s policies and procedures. LBC samples were collected directly into vial samples using a Cervex-Brush ® ® ® ™ 10 Statistical analysis For analysis, descriptive statistics such as frequency tables and mean was used, as well as odds ratio (OR) was applied to find the association. P R ESULTS A total of 3230 Pap smears fulfilling the adequacy criteria were examined. In this study patients were in the age range of 16–90 years. Maximum number of cases in this study were in the age group of 21–40 years accounting for 2303 (71.3%) cases, and minimum number of cases (08) was in the ninth decade. The mean age of the study population was 33.11 ± 10.8 years. Cases were interpreted in accordance with TBS for reporting cervical cytology 2014.

These patients present with curdy white discharge and pruritus. Adad et al Candida 13 Candida et al et al 5 13 Candida Candida The most common sexually transmitted disease in sexually active women in all age groups is TV.[ 22 23 24 25 21 et al 26 27 Trichomonas 27 HSV occurred in a single case and was one of the least prevalent infections encountered in the present study. The diagnosis of HSV was made by the presence of nuclei with “ground-glass” appearance due to accumulation of intranuclear viral particles and prominent nuclear membrane. Dense eosinophilic intranuclear (Cowdry) inclusions surrounded by a halo or clear zone and large multinucleated epithelial cells with molded nuclei were also seen. Common complications associated with HSV infection are ulcerative cervicitis and cervical dysplasia.[ 28 In our study, we found that HPV was the most common infection associated with epithelial cell abnormality seen in 45.3% (92 cases) of LSIL. HPV was diagnosed by the observation of squamous cell changes such as mild dysplasia and koilocytosis. Squamous cell size was large with abundant cytoplasm and nucleomegaly, i.e., more than three times of normal intermediate cell nuclei. These cases were reported as LSIL with associated HPV infection. However, further follow-up with HPV-DNA results was not done. BV infection with LSIL was seen in 24 cases. In another two cases of LSIL, BV infection co-occurred with Candida 29 30 29 31 32 33 34 35 Gardnerella 36 37 38 et al Candida 39 29 37 40 Trichomonas et al Trichomonas 41 Our study showed the prevalence of Actinomyces et al 42 Actinomyces In our study, rare cases such as microfilaria and TB were also seen in 0.24% and 0.12% of cases, respectively. Microfilaria diagnosis was made by the presence of sheathed microfilariae, 250–300 μm in length in the entire smear. These microfilariae had polymorphs, histiocytes, and endocervical cells sticking to their surface along their length. TB was diagnosed by the presence of few giant cells along with occasional epithelioid granuloma which was later confirmed by detection of acid-fast bacilli by Ziehl–Neelsen staining using 20% H 2 4 Limitation There was loss of follow-up of patients as patients didn’t came back. C ONCLUSION Cervical cancer screening program for early detection of cervical neoplasia has efficiently led to significant reduction in incidence of cervical cancer worldwide. Notably, early detection and treatment of infectious lesions in the cervix have also helped in reducing complications related to various infections. BV is recognized the most common vaginal infection, and its association with cervical preneoplasia, as shown by recent studies, is being viewed as possible etiology behind cervical neoplasia and needs to be explored through further research. LBC being a noninvasive technique is associated with less apprehension of patients and enables adequate sampling and early diagnosis.
