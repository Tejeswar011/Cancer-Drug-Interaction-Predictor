There is an unmet need to develop preclinical models of LMD to expedite and improve the development of new therapeutics. Here, we describe the development of multiple orthotopic immunocompetent murine models of melanoma LMD, including their use to assess the efficacy of systemic and/or intrathecal immunotherapy. LMD was established by direct intrathecal injection of murine cell lines (B16-F10, BP, D4M, D4M-UV2, MC38-gp100, RMS, YUMM3.1, and YUMMER1.7) into the cisterna magna of C57BL/6 mice. Tumor take rate, distribution, histology, peri-procedural mortality, and animal survival were assessed for each cell line. Intrathecal and systemic treatment with anti-PD1 were tested for safety, efficacy, and immune infiltration for LMD. Cisternal injection of murine melanoma cell lines successfully established LMD with low peri-procedural mortality, high tumor take rate, and varied survival duration across the panel of cell lines. Decreasing the total number of cells injected and increasing the volume of suspension of the injected cells increased the rate of distal spinal cord deposits, reflecting the common clinical distribution of LMD. Intrathecal administration of anti-PD1 in non-tumor bearing mice caused no morbidity or toxicity. Concurrent intrathecal and systemic anti-PD1 immunotherapy increased the survival of mice with murine melanoma LMD. We have established and characterized several immunocompetent murine models of LMD to facilitate the development and testing of new, more effective immunotherapy strategies for melanoma patients with LMD.

The spread of cancer cells into the CSF can lead to dissemination throughout the entire central nervous system (CNS) and may result in a variety of neurologic symptoms that can dramatically impact patient quality of life. The incidence of LMD is rising which is likely due to longer survival of cancer patients and improved imaging techniques have enhanced the ability to detect this increased incidence 1 2 5 6 Recent clinical trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with parenchymal brain metastases have demonstrated intracranial efficacy and overall survival benefit 7 9 10 11 12 Despite the importance of preclinical models in advancing our understanding of LMD and guiding the development of new therapeutic strategies, several challenges exist in their establishment and utilization. One significant challenge is the limited availability of human specimens for the development of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Obtaining suitable patient-derived samples, particularly from the CSF or leptomeningeal metastatic lesions, can be logistically difficult. Moreover, the successful engraftment and propagation of human tumor cells in immunodeficient mouse hosts require careful optimization and may not fully recapitulate the complex interactions between tumor cells and the host immune system seen in clinical LMD. Furthermore, the time and resources required to establish and characterize preclinical models, including murine models, can be substantial, limiting the scalability and accessibility of these approaches for widespread use in research and drug development. As such, we set out to overcome the challenges associated with establishing murine models by defining the cell preparation and injection conditions for this approach to modeling LMD. Developing effective strategies for LMD will be facilitated and accelerated by the establishment and characterization of additional clinically relevant preclinical models. Previous approaches for the study of LMD have included direct orthotopic implantation of tumor cell lines into the cisterna magna, orthotopic patient-derived xenografts, and iterative in vivo selection to generate LMD-tropic cell lines 13 16 Materials and methods Animals The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center approved all procedures and experiments involving animals. The study is reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines ( https://arriveguidelines.org Cell lines Luciferase-tagged B16-F10 (generously provided by Dr. Willem Overwijk), BP (generously provided by Dr. Weiyi Peng), D4M and D4M-UV2 (generously provided by Dr. David Fisher), and RMS (generously provided by Dr. Neta Erez) murine melanoma cell lines and luciferase-tagged MC38-gp100 murine colorectal carcinoma cell line (generously provided by Dr. Weiyi Peng) were grown in DMEM media supplemented with glutamine and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Corning). Luciferase-tagged YUMMER1.7 and YUMM 3.1 murine melanoma cell lines (generously provided by Dr. Marcus Bosenberg) were grown in DMEM/F12 (50:50) media supplemented with 1% non-essential amino acids and 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Corning). All cell lines were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO 2 Therapeutics Isotype rat IgG2a anti-trinitrophenol control antibody (Company: BioXCell, Clone: 2A3, #BE0089) and anti-mouse PD1 antibody (Company: BioXCell, Clone: RMP1-14, #BE0146) were purchased to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IT and systemic anti-PD1 administration and the combination of systemic and IT anti-PD1. All therapeutic antibodies were diluted in PBS under sterile conditions. Cisterna magna (intrathecal) injection technique for LMD modeling and treatment The entire dorsal surface of the mouse head and neck was shaved with an electric razor. Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of ketamine/xylazine cocktail (80 mg/kg ketamine and 12 mg/kg xylazine). Percutaneous IT injection was performed with a 30-gauge Hamilton needle with precision to 0.1 µL. To perform the injection, mice were placed in the prone position with the neck flexed over a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube. The head was immobilized with the thumb and index finger. The space between the occiput and the C1 vertebrae was palpated, and the entry point was marked on the skin. The needle was inserted to a marked depth of 4 mm at a 45° angle 13 4 3 Safety evaluation of IT anti-PD1 In our initial IT treatment efficacy studies, we injected 13 µg anti-PD1 or isotype control diluted in 6.5 µL PBS into non-tumor-bearing mice. As previously described, antibody drug solution of 6.5 µL is consistent with physiologic IT dosing in mice 11 In vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) At selected time points, D-luciferin sodium salt (BioVision #7902) was injected at 150 mg/kg into the peritoneum of each mouse. After 10 min, the animal was placed in an IVIS100 in vivo imager and scanned on default settings, with the exception that exposure time was automatically determined by the Living Image (v4.5.2) software. The bioluminescence image was overlaid onto a photographic image for anatomical location of the signal. Signal intensities were quantified using Living Image (v4.5.2) software. Regions of interest were automatically determined by the software. The minimum percentage of peak pixel intensity for inclusion was set to 20%. Values were normalized against a black surface in the image and a non-luminescent surface of an animal. Total flux values were exported into Microsoft Excel 2016 and Prism 8.0 (GraphPad) for downstream analysis. Tissue analyses Mice were euthanized via CO 2 For immune cell populations, slides were stained with antibodies targeting anti-mouse CD8 (Cell Signaling #98941; 1:400) using a modified version of the standard Leica Bond red “J” IHC protocols. The data were expressed as a density (total number of IHC-positive cells/mm 2 Anti-mouse Melan-A/MART-1 antibody (Novus Biologicals #A19-P, 1:600) or anti-mouse gp100 antibody (Cell Signaling #38815, 1:1000) was used to confirm the presence of melanoma in leptomeningeal deposits in animal specimens. An Aperio ScanScope was used to take pictures, which were then processed with Aperio ImageScope (Leica Biosystems). All slides were reviewed by three pathologists, including: a neuropathologist (J.H.); a dermatopathologist who specializes in the assessment of inflammatory markers and responses (M.T.); and a veterinary pathologist (F.C.). Cell enumeration by crystal violet staining Eight cell lines (D4M, D4M-UV2, B16, MC38gp100, RMS, BP, YUMMER1.7, YUMM3.1) used for our LMD models were cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% Non-essential Amino Acids. In vitro cell growth patterns between them were compared with crystal violet (Sigma-Aldrich) staining every 24 h post cell inoculation in 24-well plates. The experimental protocol described previously. 17 Efficacy experiments For our initial efficacy experiments, 1.5 × 10 4 Efficacy experiments were repeated using our diluted model conditions, in which 2.0 × 10 3 Statistical analysis Overall survival was defined as the interval from date of treatment initiation to date of death. Survival duration was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method. Survival curves were drawn in Prism 8.0 (GraphPad). Hazard ratios and significance were calculated via the Mantel-Haenszel test and log-rank test, respectively, in Prism 8.0 (GraphPad). Data analyses and representations were performed via Prism 8.0 (GraphPad). Comparison of continuous variables between two groups was performed by unpaired Student’s t Results Establishing a model of B16-F10 murine melanoma LMD via percutaneous IT injection in immunocompetent mice To establish a model of melanoma LMD in immunocompetent mice, we performed a percutaneous IT injection to access the cisterna magna (Figure S1 11 In initial experiments we injected 1.5 × 10 4 1 1 1  Fig. 1 IT injection of B16-F10 melanoma (1.5 × 10^4 in 10 µL suspension) produces LMD in C57BL/6 mice.

( A N N N B C D E p p t Intrathecal anti-PD1 to treat melanoma LMD in initial preclinical model We then used our murine LMD models to evaluate the efficacy of systemic intraperitoneal (IP) and IT anti-mouse PD1. For our pilot evaluation, we assessed the effects of IT anti-PD1 treatment in mice with B16-F10 LMD. Notably, we previously evaluated an IT dose of 13 µg anti-PD1 in 6.5 µL PBS, which is equivalent to a dose of 50 mg in patients based on differences in CSF volumes in mice versus humans, and which we established as the recommended IT dose of nivolumab in our phase I trial 11 11 4 Mice treated with IT and IP isotype control had a median overall survival of 9 days from the start of treatment; all mice in this group were euthanized by day 14 due to significant morbidity (Fig. 5 p p p  Fig. 5 Evaluation of IT anti-PD1 treatment of melanoma LMD in initial preclinical model.

Discussion LMD is a severe complication of metastatic melanoma and causes significant neurological morbidity and nearly uniform mortality. Despite the significant improvements in the treatments and outcomes of metastatic melanoma patients without CNS involvement and with parenchymal brain metastases only, outcomes in melanoma patients with LMD remain extremely poor 6 19 20 14 21 Here, we present our experience with an orthotopic model of melanoma leptomeningeal metastasis in immunocompetent mice via cisternal injection, which can be used to investigate experimental therapeutics pre-clinically. Representation of clinical LMD in preclinical models is complex and requires careful consideration of multiple factors 22 13 14 23 27 Others have demonstrated the value of representing LMD tumor cells derived from patient CSF samples and injecting them into immunodeficient NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice 21 28 29 30 31 32 14 32 For our initial LMD modeling experiments, we began with B16-F10. The aggressiveness of the B16-F10 made it a good cell line to initially identify conditions to establish gross and histological evidence of LMD. The B16-F10 LMD model offered several advantages including a high tumor take rate and reproducible survival curves. B16-F10 is pigmented so success of the model is straightforward to visualize. However, B16-F10 has some limitations. IT injection of this cell line results a short animal survival; this makes it difficult to evaluate treatment strategies as the therapeutic window is very short. B16-F10 is also poorly immunogenic, thus providing an additional challenge for assessing the benefit of IT immunotherapy 33 34 35 37 23 26 34 38 We evaluated IT therapy as our experimental platform as it has a known clinical application 10 12 39 40 By recapitulating features of clinical LMD, these preclinical models can provide valuable insights into the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutic approaches. The translational relevance of these models lies in their ability to assess safety and potentially predict treatment responses. Insights gained from preclinical studies using these LMD models can help refine clinical trial endpoints, dosage regimens, and combination therapies, ultimately accelerating the development and translation of innovative treatments for patients with LMD. We acknowledge that this model carries some limitations. Peri-procedural mortality presents cost-associated and logistical challenges (although we have observed reduced peri-procedural mortality with more experience with this model). Based on our experience, the peri-procedural mortality was minimal across all cell lines but for any peri-procedural mortality that was observed, we do not believe there is an inherent increase in lethality associated with any particular melanoma cell line. Rather, the observed differences may reflect variability in experimental handling during early phases of model development. Secondly, we acknowledge that luciferase tagging may increase the immunogenicity of implanted tumor cells. However, this feature was crucial to our model design, enabling longitudinal in vivo imaging; albeit a limitation of our methodology. Lastly, while these orthotopic murine models represent a useful tool for studying LMD via tumor growth in the leptomeningeal space, as this model involves directly injecting tumor cells into the intrathecal space, this process bypasses steps in the metastatic cascade. This limits the models’ ability to fully recapitulate the pathophysiology of melanoma seeding the leptomeninges. However, this model can be used as a starting point for hypothesis generation and initial safety and therapeutic evaluation, which then can be applied to other modeling systems such as in vivo selection or patient-derived models which are more expensive, complex and labor/resource intensive. Despite these limitations, we believe that these murine melanoma LMD models provide an important resource for research and therapeutic development in this area of unmet clinical and translational need. These models are advantageous in that they are readily reproducible and emulate the dissemination pattern and progression that is observed in clinical disease. Additionally, as they are created via direct cisternal delivery of malignant cells, this model provides a “pure” LMD model not confounded by concurrent intraparenchymal or systemic disease when evaluating efficacy of treatment strategies. The intact immune system also allows for characterization of the immune microenvironment in response to the presence of leptomeningeal tumor or treatment. Overall, this model is well suited specifically for evaluation of a variety of therapeutic platforms. Future studies will evaluate other IT immune therapies to further accelerate clinical development and translation. Conclusions Leptomeningeal disease (LMD) is a complication of melanoma with an extremely poor prognosis and very limited treatment options. A critical limitation in the development of more effective treatments for LMD is the relative lack of preclinical models. In this study, we used orthotopic injection model system to develop several immunocompetent preclinical orthotopic models of melanoma LMD to facilitate the research and therapeutic development in this area. We also report the safety, efficacy, and immunological effects of intrathecal administration of anti-PD1 immunotherapy using this LMD model.
