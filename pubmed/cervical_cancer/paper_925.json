Summary Prostate cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death among Canadian men. Despite advances in the last decade mitigating overdiagnosis and overtreatment, Canadian guidelines have recommended against routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening since 2014. This has resulted in opportunistic screening, marked by inequitable access, low-value testing, and missed opportunities for early detection. We review global policy developments, emerging trial data, and implementation strategies, which suggest that organised, risk-stratified screening may improve outcomes and equity. However, overdiagnosis and associated harms remain a concern within organised programs. To address this uncertainty and generate timely, policy-relevant evidence, we propose implementing population-wide, adaptive platform trials embedded in the healthcare system. This design would enable real-time integration of new technologies, standardised protocols, and equitable access—hallmarks of a learning healthcare system. Such a model could help Canada modernise prostate cancer screening while carefully weighing benefits, harms, and equity in a rapidly evolving landscape.

This simple blood test appeared to dramatically reduce cases of metastatic disease at presentation. 1 2 3 A decade later, emerging evidence and shifting global perspectives—including recent calls from the Lancet Commission on Prostate Cancer 4 Why is prostate cancer screening not recommended? The 2014 Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care and other guidelines groups from that era highlighted two primary concerns regarding prostate cancer screening: 1) overdiagnosis and overtreatment; and 2) conflicting evidence of a mortality benefit. As a result, the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care issued a weak recommendation against routine PSA screening for men aged 55 to 69, and a strong recommendation against screening for men younger than 55 or older than 70. Today, evolving practices and emerging data compel us to reexamine these issues, especially among individuals between 55 and 69. Concerns about overdiagnosis and overtreatment remain pivotal. Overdiagnosis refers to the detection of cancer that would not have caused symptoms or death during a person’s lifetime if it had not been found through screening or incidental testing. Overdiagnosis and its harms are exacerbated when low-value screening occurs in patients less likely to benefit, such as those over 70 or with less than 10 years of life expectancy. 5 , 6 7 8 The uncoupling of screening with invasive investigation and treatment has mitigated overdiagnosis and overtreatment and their related complications. Canada has been at the forefront of advances in the field, including integrating pre-biopsy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and microultrasonography to enhance detection and reduce unnecessary biopsies. 9 10 11 12 13 , 14 15 16 17 , 18 19 20 , 21 22 At the time of the 2014 recommendation, there was scepticism regarding the prostate cancer mortality benefit of PSA screening. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovary (PLCO) cancer screening trial in the United States showed no significant reduction in prostate-cancer-specific mortality associated with PSA screening. 23 24 However, the PLCO trial had important limitations which revealed themselves over time and with new data. While contamination in the control arm was acknowledged in 2014, its extent was not fully understood until it became clear that up to 90% of participants in the control group had undergone at least one PSA test during the study—remarkably, the control arm reported higher rates of PSA screening than the intervention arm. 25 26 27 , 28 27 29 , 30 Guideline authors also questioned whether prostate cancer screening reduces overall mortality as opposed to prostate-cancer-specific mortality. 3 31 32 33 Given these updated data and practices, it would be reasonable to revisit the current Canadian recommendations and explore novel approaches to organised screening. In 2018, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force revised its earlier statement against prostate cancer screening. It now supports shared decision-making for men aged 55 to 69—a position echoed by other North American organizations like the Canadian Urological Association, the American Urological Association, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and the American Cancer Society ( Table 1 37 34 36 38 35 Table 1 Prostate cancer screening recommendations from major North American public health and urologic organizations.

For men with a life expectancy less than 10 years, discontinue PSA screening Grade C PCa = Prostate cancer; PSA = Prostate-specific antigen; SDM = Shared decision-making. How is the status quo exacerbating disparities and low-value screening? In the current setting of countervailing guidelines and emphasis on shared decision-making, there is significant clinical variability in screening, resulting in health inequities and inefficiencies. 39 Opportunistic screening thus favours individuals with better access to healthcare, higher levels of health literacy and more disposable income, 40 , 41 42 43 40 Paradoxically, the global review by Vickers et al. also noted that current guidelines have increased low-value screening (screening in individuals unlikely to benefit; e.g., PSA tests after age 70 or in those with limited life expectancy). 40 44 45 46 How have current screening policies affected prostate cancer outcomes? Prostate cancer remains the most common cancer and the third-leading cause of cancer death among Canadian men. 47 48 49 50 Despite the possible increase in metastatic cases at diagnosis, mortality trends vary. For example, data from Ontario indicate that survival has declined for prostate cancer, yet has improved for screened cancers like colon cancer. 51 47 52 48 53 52 How can organised prostate cancer screening address these issues? Globally, there is growing interest in organised prostate cancer screening. Organised screening programs are designed and managed by health services to promote equitable access to screening and ensure standardized care for all individuals. These programs aim to guarantee timely and consistent follow-up for those with abnormal test results while minimising unnecessary screening or follow-up for those unlikely to benefit. 54 26 organised For instance, the Prostate Cancer Awareness and Initiative for Screening in the European Union (PRAISE-U), launched in response to the European Union’s recommendation to assess the feasibility of organised prostate cancer screening, 55 56 4 Organised prostate cancer screening can also mitigate inequities. In the Swedish arm of the ERSPC trial, a secondary analysis with 18 years of follow-up showed that organised prostate cancer screening eliminated disparities in mortality among individuals with lower education levels. 57 58 Organised prostate cancer screening could substantially reduce low-value testing by prioritising patients most likely to benefit. Implementing firm eligibility criteria rather than relying solely on shared decision-making ensures that screening targets patients who stand to gain the most. Countries that have implemented a national early detection program for prostate cancer report an almost 80% reduction in low-value PSA testing. 59 Beyond organised screening, another alternative to the current status quo of opportunistic screening is to eliminate screening altogether. 40 60 61 62 How should provinces design their organised screening program? While existing evidence suggests that organised prostate cancer screening has potential advantages, 26 , 57 24 Table 1 Given this equipoise and the active investigation into strategies that balance early detection with minimizing harm, we propose that provincial organised prostate cancer screening programs be designed as population-wide clinical trials integrated into the healthcare system. Such a framework would offer the essential infrastructure for systematic and ongoing assessment of adherence to standardized protocols and screening outcomes. It would also provide better access to easily scalable novel prostate cancer early detection pathways. Linked with population-based registries, such trials would enable precise tracking of patient outcomes, ensuring that screening and subsequent interventions are equitably applied to target populations. A potential control arm, whether no screening or opportunistic screening, would allow for evaluation of the true benefit of organised screening. However, the design of the treatment arms for this type of screening program and its trials must account for the near quarter-century required for prostate cancer screening trials to reach their primary endpoints and translate into policy. In that time, new protocols, technologies, and approaches may emerge yet remain unevaluated and unimplemented in a traditional trial. For example, the Cluster Randomized Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP) published its 15-year data in April 2024 and demonstrated a small reduction in prostate cancer deaths at a median follow-up of 15 years. 63 63 64 An adaptive platform trial design may address the limitations of conventional trials. 65 66 67 A major limitation of this proposal is cost. However, the startup costs of an adaptive trial may be lower than expected, given that Ontario already has established infrastructure for population-based cancer screening through programs for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer. These existing structures—such as centralized invitation systems, data collection platforms, and performance monitoring—can be leveraged to implement prostate cancer screening trials. Moreover, because cancer incidence and outcomes are routinely tracked through provincial registries, many of the key endpoints are already being measured, which further reduces the marginal cost of trial implementation. A comparable large adaptive platform trial for the early detection of prostate cancer, the TRANSFORM study, is currently underway in the UK, receiving substantial backing from the National Health Service and other funders. 68 69 , 70 We summarize the differences between our proposal and current opportunistic screening in Table 2 Table 3 Table 2 Comparison of opportunistic screening to an adaptive platform trial approach to prostate cancer screening in Canada. Opportunistic screening Organized screening program incorporating an adaptive platform trial Equity of access Access can be uneven, with disparities based on geographic, socioeconomic, and provider differences. Centralized and standardized criteria promote equitable access across patient populations and geographic locations. Value of screening Value varies and depends on providers’ and patients’ individualized decision-making. Screening is targeted to populations most likely to benefit based on centralized protocols and tools. Consistency in screening protocols Protocols vary widely based on provider preferences, locally available resources, and local guidelines, leading to inconsistencies. Screening follows a uniform protocol, ensuring consistency across all sites participating in the trial. Monitoring and quality control No centralized system for quality control; outcomes and complications may vary between sites. Centralized monitoring and data collection ensure quality control, with outcomes tracked and analysed across all trial sites. Adaptability to emerging evidence Adapting to new evidence can be slow, depending on guideline revision cycles and local practice changes. Rapid adaptation is embedded, with new evidence incorporated into the trial framework for real-time evaluation and adjustment of allocation to various management arms. Patient and provider burden Patients and providers bear the responsibility of initiating and sustaining screening discussions. Burden is reduced by structured invitations and follow-up protocols, minimizing variations in decision-making in screening initiation and follow-up. Data collection and outcomes tracking Limited standardized data collection across different providers and sites. Comprehensive data collection and tracking are embedded in the trial, enabling robust analysis of screening outcomes and pathway effectiveness. Research and policy integration Limited research opportunities; local practices may not contribute to broader evidence generation. Built-in mechanisms for evidence generation support ongoing research, informing local screening policies and future guidelines.

Multiple elements of this table are inspired by TRANSFORM-UK. Conclusion Canada’s current, opportunistic approach to prostate cancer screening warrants reconsideration. This strategy risks undermining the potential benefits of PSA testing while amplifying harms and deepening disparities, especially among populations that stand to gain the most from early detection. Since the Canadian Task Force's 2014 screening recommendations, advancements in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer have mitigated the harms of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. A risk-stratified approach is now achievable and could address issues of inequity and low-value screening. Key questions remain about the optimal methods for screening and risk stratification to continue to reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Canada can modernise its approach to prostate cancer screening by implementing programmatic, organised screening through large adaptive platform trials integrated into the healthcare system. This strategy would enable the ongoing integration of emerging evidence and technologies while ensuring equitable access to early detection and standardised management. In doing so, we can ensure that prostate cancer screening effectively serves all Canadians' health.
