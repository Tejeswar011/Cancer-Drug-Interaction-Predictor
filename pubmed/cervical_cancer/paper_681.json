High expression of TF has been reported to be correlated with poor prognosis in various cancers. In this study, we aimed to clarify the cytotoxicity of bi-specific T-cell engagers (BiTE) targeting TF on cervical cancer cell lines. We designed and characterized the novel humanized BiTE targeting TF using an anti-human CD3 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) linked to human TF scFv. TF-Bite replication and potency were assessed in cervical cancer cell lines. The expression of the TF-BiTE and the activation and proliferation of T cells induced along with the T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity were evaluated by flow cytometry in vitro. TF expression was confirmed in SiHa, ME-180, and HeLa cell lines. The TF-BiTE showed potent TF-specific cytotoxicity and induced T-cell activation, proliferation, degranulation, and cytokine release. These effects were not observed in TF-negative control cells. Our findings support TF-BiTE as a promising therapeutic candidate for cervical cancer immunotherapy. bispecific T-cell engager immunotherapy tissue factor cervical cancer targeted therapy Hallym University Research Fund HURF-2022-07 This research was supported by the Hallym University Research Fund (HURF-2022-07). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Cervical cancer remains a significant global health problem, representing the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. In 2025, an estimated 13,360 new cases and 4320 deaths were reported in the United States for 2025 [ 1 1 2 T-cell-based immunotherapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies and bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), represent a promising frontier in cancer treatment. CAR T-cell therapy has demonstrated remarkable success against hematological malignancies, particularly in refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ 3 4 5 While blinatumomab, a CD19-targeting BiTE, has received FDA approval for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and numerous BiTEs are currently in clinical trials for hematological malignancies [ 4 6 7 8 Tissue factor (TF), a 47 kDa transmembrane glycoprotein also known as CD142, emerges as a compelling target. Its high expression in various cancers, coupled with its established correlation with poor prognosis [ 9 10 Preclinical and clinical data have shown that blocking the TF:FVIIa pathway can effectively inhibit tumor growth, as evidenced by the significant cytotoxic effects and promising clinical trial results observed with tisotumab vedotin, a TF-targeting antibody-drug conjugate [ 11 12 This study focuses on the development and characterization of a novel TF-targeting BiTE for the treatment of cervical cancer. In vitro studies were conducted to evaluate its ability to induce cytokine production and exert cytotoxic effects against cervical cancer cell lines. 2. Results 2.1. TF Expression in Cervical Cancer and Normal Human Tissues from Cervix We transformed our TF scFv into a complete antibody, allowing us to evaluate TF expression in human tissue microarrays and resected tumors through immunohistochemistry. The same binding domain used in the TF BiTE was employed for this analysis. Our findings showed positive staining in cervical cancer specimens, indicating elevated TF expression, which was localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm. TF expression was observed in 86.3% (145/163) of cervical squamous cell carcinoma and 85.2% (58/68) of adenocarcinoma but was absent in normal cervical tissues. Representative IHC images are provided in Figure 1 Figure 1 2.2. Design and Production of TF BiTE 2.2.1. Schematic Diagram of TF-BiTE Structure We identified a cluster of anti-TF antibodies within a rat hybridoma library that binds to either the distal membrane immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain or the more proximal frizzled (Fr) domain of TF ( Figure 2 Figure 2 We successfully expressed the BiTEs in HEK-293T cells using lentiviral vectors. The supernatant obtained from these cells underwent purification via metal-affinity chromatography, revealing a peak at approximately 40 mM imidazole. The purified product was then analyzed through SDS/PAGE electrophoresis, which displayed a dominant band at 55 kDa, consistent with the expected molecular weight of the BiTEs, as confirmed by Western blot analysis ( Figure 2 2.2.2. TF-BiTE Directs T Cells to Kill TF-Expressing Cervical Cancer Cells In Vitro In this study, we assessed the ability of TF BiTE to induce antigen-specific cytotoxic responses against cervical cancer cell lines in vitro. The specificity of the TF BiTE was verified through flow cytometry staining tests performed on cervical cancer cell lines (SiHa, HeLa, and ME-180). Additionally, human T cells demonstrated specific binding to CD3 with both CD19 and TF BiTEs. In contrast, the murine colon carcinoma cell line (CT-26) showed no binding with either CD19 or TF BiTE ( Figure 3 We co-cultured T cells with TF BiTE in conjunction with cervical cancer cell lines. Our findings revealed that only the cervical cancer cell lines exhibited cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion, confirming that the presence of TF is essential for T-cell activation ( Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 3 Figure 4 2.3. Preliminary Mechanism Insights 2.3.1. Proliferation Assay and ELISA During the experiment, CD3 + + − Figure 4 Furthermore, cytokine release (TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-2), which is a hallmark of T-cell activation upon tumor cell lysis, was also induced by TF-BiTE in cervical cancer cell lines ( Figure 4 Figure 4 2.3.2. Activation Assay To compare the T-cell activation mediated by TF-BiTE with CD19-BiTE, PBMC were co-cultured with AsPC-1 cells and treated with either TF-TCB or CD19-BiTE for 16 h, followed by flow cytometry analysis. CD25 and CD69 are the most prominent markers for T-cell activation. The results showed that TF-BiTE induced T-cell activation more effectively than CD19-BiTE, as evidenced by a higher percentage of CD25 + + Figure 5 2.3.3. Degranulation Assay The cell membrane expression of CD107a is a marker of immune cell activation and cytotoxic degranulation. Our data shows that TF-BiTE results in a similar activation of CD4 + + + Figure 5 + Figure 5 3. Discussion In this study, we developed and characterized a novel bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) targeting tissue factor (TF) and CD3 and demonstrated its potent cytotoxic activity against cervical cancer cell lines. TF was highly expressed in both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the cervix, whereas it was absent or minimally detected in normal cervical tissues, supporting its potential as a selective therapeutic target. The TF-BiTE effectively redirected T cells toward cervical cancer cells, promoted proliferation, and induced cytotoxicity in vitro. These findings suggest that TF-BiTE may provide a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for cervical cancer, a disease with limited treatment options in advanced stages. Previous studies have reported the development of BiTEs against other tumor-associated antigens, including ROR1, EpCAM, and HER2, with encouraging efficacy across solid tumors [ 13 14 15 16 Our study extends these findings by focusing specifically on cervical cancer, which exhibits consistently high TF expression compared with normal epithelium. We further confirmed TF expression through immunohistochemistry using a large set of archived patient tissues and demonstrated activity in both squamous and adenocarcinoma cell lines, thereby highlighting the broad applicability of TF-BiTE in different cervical cancer subtypes. We acknowledge several limitations. Most importantly, in vivo efficacy and safety studies were not performed. Previous reports of ROR1- and TF-targeting BiTEs have demonstrated robust antitumor activity in xenograft models, underscoring the need to confirm our in vitro results in vivo. In addition, the current construct employs a rat-derived scFv, which may elicit immunogenicity in humans. Humanization and further optimization of the BiTE format will therefore be essential for clinical translation. Moreover, because the scFv sequences were generated against human TF, potential cross-reactivity with TF from preclinical species such as mouse or monkey remains uncertain. We did not directly test murine TF binding, which restricts immediate in vivo validation. Future studies will include cross-reactivity assays using mouse TF-expressing cells, xenograft models reconstituted with human PBMC, and syngeneic mouse models to evaluate full immune responses. Finally, while TF expression was validated in cervical cancer tissues, the possibility of off-tumor effects, particularly under inflammatory conditions where TF can be induced, warrants careful evaluation. Despite these limitations, our results provide strong preclinical evidence that TF-BiTE represents an effective and selective therapeutic candidate for cervical cancer. Given the poor prognosis of recurrent or metastatic disease and the limited efficacy of current systemic therapies, TF-BiTE may offer a novel option, either as monotherapy or in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. This proof-of-concept study thus provides a foundation for future translational and clinical development. Monoclonal antibodies targeting tumor-specific antigens have significantly improved outcomes in hematologic and solid tumors. Recent reviews underscore the rapid development and widespread clinical adoption of therapeutic antibodies in oncology [ 17 18 19 20 Targeting TF has already shown clinical relevance. Tisotumab vedotin, an antibody–drug conjugate directed against TF, demonstrated a 24% objective response rate (including 7% complete responses) in the innovaTV 204/GOG-3023/ENGOT-cx6 trial, leading to FDA approval in 2021 for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer after chemotherapy [ 21 Finally, a recent study investigated a TF-BiTE across diverse solid tumor cell lines, using an IgG-[L]-scFv design rather than the tandem scFv structure employed in our construct [ 16 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cells and Reagents To model TF-targeted immune redirection, we utilized the human cervical carcinoma cell lines SiHa, HeLa, and ME180, and the murine colorectal cell line CT26 (used as a TF-negative control). All lines were sourced from the Korean Cell Line Bank (KCLB, Seoul, Republic of Korea), except for HEK 293T, obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). SiHa and HeLa cells were Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Welgene, Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea), while ME180 was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Welgene, Gyeongsan, Republic of Korea). All media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 For surface marker analysis, tissue factor (TF) expression was evaluated using a PE-conjugated anti-human CD142 antibody (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) by flow cytometry. Cryopreserved human CD3 + In addition, the AsPC-1 cell line (a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma line, ATCC CRL-1682) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) for selected experiments. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy donors under institutional review board approval (IRB No. 2023-04-019, Hallym University Medical Center, Anyang, Republic of Korea), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. 4.2. Patient Samples Archived FFPE tissue blocks from 171 patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (103 patients) or adenocarcinoma (68 patients) were retrieved from Hallym University Medical Center pathology archive. The tissues had been collected previously with written informed consent at the time of clinical care. Subsequent use of these de-identified specimens for this research was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board Hallym University Medical Center (IRB No. 2023-04-019). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Cases with prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded. Tissue microarrays were constructed using duplicate 2 mm tumor cores. TF immunoreactivity was visualized using DAB staining following overnight incubation with anti-CD142 antibody. Quantification was performed via H-score method by two independent pathologists, as described in previous studies [ 16 22 4.3. Study Period All experiments were conducted between March 2023 and February 2024 at Hallym University Medical Center and associated research laboratories. 4.4. Immunohistochemical Analysis of TF Expression Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed by extracting two representative 2 mm cores from each tumor block using a precision trephine instrument (Superbiochips Laboratories, Seoul, Korea). TMA sections (4 µm) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to heat-induced epitope retrieval using citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Sections were incubated with a primary antibody against human tissue factor (CD142; 1:100 dilution, BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) overnight at 4 °C, followed by a biotin-free HRP detection system (EnVision™, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Staining was visualized using DAB chromogen and counterstained with hematoxylin. TF expression was semi-quantitatively assessed using the H-score method, which incorporates staining intensity (0–3) and the percentage of positively stained tumor cells. All slides were independently evaluated by two blind pathologists. Discordant cases were resolved by consensus. 4.5. Generation and Cloning of TF-BiTE Rats were immunized against the extracellular portion of TF by Aldevron GmBH. Oligoclonal clones from the subsequent hybridomas were single cell sorted, and immunoglobulin heavy and light chain sequences were isolated by 50 reverse amplifications of cDNA ends (50 RACE) using the standard laboratory protocols. Productive sequences, as identified by the International Immunogenetics Information System V-Quest tool, 41 were cloned in frame with heavy and light chain constant regions, and antibodies were generated by transient co-transfection. Specific binding for TF was demonstrated before the conversion of the variable domains to scFvs in a heavy chain-linker-light chain format [ 23 The scFvs against TF or the control CD19 (fmc63) were linked to the anti-human CD3 scFv (OKT3) using a short peptide linker. Constructs were generated by gBlocks synthesis (Integrated DNA Technologies) and assembled by overlapping extension PCR with Phusion polymerase (New England Biolabs). The resulting BiTE open reading frame (ORF) was inserted into the SFG retroviral vector upstream of a GFP reporter via NcoI/MluI sites, with the two ORFs separated by an IRES sequence. An N-terminal hexahistidine tag was included to enable detection and purification of the BiTE proteins. 4.6. Construction and Purification of TF-Targeted BiTE Single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) recognizing tissue factor (TF) or the control antigen CD19 (clone FMC63) were genetically fused to an anti-human CD3 scFv (clone OKT3) through a flexible (G 4 3 13 4.7. In Vitro Cytotoxicity Assay Cervical cancer target cells were labeled with CellTrace Violet (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) prior to co-culture to distinguish them from effector T cells. Peripheral blood T cells were used as unstimulated effectors, with anti-CD3/CD28 bead-activated T cells included in selected controls to confirm that TF-BiTE–mediated cytotoxicity was independent of pre-activation. Target cells were seeded in flat-bottom 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight, then co-cultured with labeled CD3 + 4.8. Flow Cytometry and Cytokine Quantification To assess T-cell activation, co-cultured cells were stained with antibodies against CD69, CD25, and CD107a. Fluorescence data were collected on a FACSCalibur™ cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and analyzed with FlowJo software 10 (TreeStar, Ashland, OR, USA). Culture supernatants were collected for cytokine analysis. Levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 were quantified using ELISA kits (R&D Systems, USA) by the manufacturer’s instructions. 4.9. Statistical Analysis All experiments were conducted in at least three independent replicates. Statistical comparisons were performed using two-tailed Student’s t p Error bars in all graphs and figures represent the mean value with the standard error of the mean from at least three independent experiments or assays.
