Background The current conventional therapy for oesophageal cancer is unable to effectively eliminate oesophageal cancer cells as a result of cancer stem cells (CSCs). These CSCs are the main factors responsible for treatment failure and tumour relapse associated with the present conventional oesophageal cancer therapy. A nano-immunoconjugate-based photodynamic therapy (PDT) proposes a potential approach to eliminate these CSCs efficiently. Method In this study, we examined the mode of cell death action induced by the nano-immunoconjugates (NIC) mediated PDT comprising aluminium phthalocyanine tetra sulfonic acid chloride (AlPcS 4 4 in vitro Results Findings from this study showed that NIC-mediated PDT significantly inhibited the cell growth of oesophageal CSCs, promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic cell death through the alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential Δψm, high efflux of cytochrome c protein, high activity of caspase 3/7 protease, and early apoptosis. Moreover, NIC-mediated PDT triggered cell cycle checkpoint activity in the G0/G1 phase, stimulated DNA damage response by increased DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) upregulation, and activated an autophagy action. Conclusion The outcomes from this study showed the anticancer efficiency of gold nano-immunoconjugate-based PDT against human oesophageal CSCs. Overall, this study provides a rationale for gold nano-immunoconjugate-based PDT for a promising therapeutic application in the clinical treatment of oesophageal cancer. target therapy oxidative stress nanoparticles-mediated cell death apoptosis DNA damage response cell cycle arrest autophagy The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

A recent report ranked oesophageal cancer as the eleventh cause of cancer-related disease and the seventh cause of cancer-promoted death globally ( 1 2 3 6 7 9 10 11 12 15 16 19 16 20 21 16 20 18 22 17 Photodynamic therapy is a less invasive light-activated therapeutic measure approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating different diseases, including cancer ( 23 23 24 25 28 29 30 31 4 32 34 4 4 35 37 To address this challenge, PDT has witnessed a paradigm shift in recent years through the advent of nanotechnology. This advancement has ushered in new ways to enhance PDT effects by enhancing the photochemical reaction with adequate reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, improving drug delivery/tumour selective targeting, and designing/modulating biomolecules/photosensitizers by incorporating nanoparticles ( 3 38 37 39 27 38 40 41 38 42 38 43 44 Several investigations have evaluated the use of AuNP for active targeted PDT on different tumour types, demonstrating the efficiency of this approach. For instance, AuNPs, C11Pc (photosensitizers), and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) peptide AEYLR were used to attack EGFR receptors in lung tumours in an in vitro 45 in vitro 46 32 20 in vitro 41 4 In this study, a multi-component gold nano-immuno-conjugate (NIC) comprising AlPcS 4 27 10 47 48 in vitro 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Cell culture and CSC isolation A commercial HKESC-1 (RRID: CVCL_D568) oesophageal cancer cell line (Cellonex, Johannesburg, South Africa) was utilised for this study. Prior to oesophageal CSCs isolation the HKESC-1 cells were cultured in DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium) (D5796, Sigma-Aldrich) and supplemented with 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.5% amphotericin B (A2411, Sigma), 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin (P078, Sigma) and 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (10082147, Gibco). The CSCs were isolated from the HKESC-1 cells utilising the CD44, CD90, and CD271 Microbeads Kits (130-095-194/130-096-253/130-099-023, Miltenyi Biotec) via a magnetic separation method. The isolated oesophageal CSCs were cultured and maintained in DMEM-F12 (D8062, Sigma-Aldrich) medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS, 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) (PHG0315, Gibco), 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (PHG0266, Gibco), 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin and 0.5% amphotericin B. The oesophageal CSCs were cultivated in T75 Corning ® 6 2 5 ® 2.2 Immunofluorescence characterisation of oesophageal CSCs The oesophageal CSCs were characterised using the indirect immunofluorescence technique, which utilises fluorescence imaging for identification. The CSCs were cultivated and kept in the incubator for 24 hours to permit adequate attachment. Following a 24-hour incubation period, the cells were rinsed two times using ice-cold buffer (PBS/BSA/azide) and fixed for 15 minutes with 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were rinsed with an ice-cold buffer, and the supernatant was removed. A 1 mL of blocking buffer (10% (w/v) BSA/PBS) was pipetted and placed on ice for half an hour. The cells were rinsed with PBS, and 100 µL of diluted (in 1x PBS 1:1000) primary mouse antibodies (Anti-CD44 ( MA515462 MA515574 2.3 Hoechst characterisation of oesophageal CSCs The stemness features of the isolated cells were analysed using the Hoechst 33342 dye efflux approach. This assay is based on the mechanism that CSCs have high expression of ABCG2 transporter molecules, which are known to expel certain dyes, such as Hoechst 33342 dye. Cells with stemness features efflux the Hoechst 33342 dye, displaying low fluorescence when viewed with flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy ( 49 2 2.4 Photosensitizer and nano-immune conjugates preparation The nano-immuno-conjugates (NIC) used in this study were synthesized using a chemical reaction and characterized as previously described ( 27 4 4 4 4 4 4 27 40 ® Thereafter, anti-CD271 antibody (NBP2-80874, NOVUSBIO)(100μL, 20 μg/ml) was added, appropriately mixed, and incubated at room temperature for 120 minutes. The solution was purified by centrifuging at 1,600 x g for 60 minutes. The supernatant was removed. Conjugate storage buffer (20 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% BSA (w/v))(500 μL) was added. Finally, AlPcS 4 4 27 2.5 Characterization of nano-immuno-conjugates 2.5.1 Transmission electron microscopy Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was conducted to determine the shape and size of AuNPs and NIC using the JEM-2100 Transmission Electron Microscope (JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The AuNPs and NIC solutions were added onto copper TEM grids (carbon-coated 200 Mesh) and allowed to dry. The grids were placed into the TEM sample carrier, examined, and micrographs captured. 2.5.2 Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy The UV-Vis spectroscopy analysis was conducted to determine the optical properties of AlPcS 4 4 2.6 Cellular uptake The oesophageal CSCs were cultured, and after overnight incubation, the cell culture medium was removed and incubated with fresh culture media containing 20 µM AlPcS 4 2.7  In vitro Cells were cultured and kept in a humidified incubator overnight for this experiment. Thereafter, the culture medium was discarded, washed with HBSS, and refreshed with a growth medium containing the IC 50 4 4 27 27 2 2 34 4 4 2.8 Cell viability The luminescence cell viability assay from Promega (G968) was employed to determine the effects of the AlPcS 4 4 ® 2.9 Reactive oxygen species production To determine the level of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced, ROS assay from Abcam (ab113851) using the fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA/H2DCFD) was utilised as previously described ( 33 4 2.10 Mitochondrial membrane assessment The rhodamine-123 efflux fluorimetry analysis using rhodamine-123 dye (ab275545) from Abcam was utilised to evaluate the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) in oesophageal CSCs as earlier reported ( 33 2.11 Cytochrome c measurement The efflux of cytochrome c protein in the cell lysate was measured as previously described ( 33 6 2.12 Cell death evaluation The Annexin V-FITC/PI assay (556570, BD Pharmingen™) was employed to evaluate the cell death induction. In summary, the CSCs were harvested, washed, and Annexin V-FITC binding buffer (500 μL) was added to form a cell suspension. Thereafter, the cells were stained with annexin V-FITC (5 μL) and propidium iodide (PI) (5 μL) and allowed to stand for 15 minutes at 25°C. The CSCs were analysed using flow cytometry (BD flow cytometer Accuri™ C6). 2.13 Caspase 3/7 quantification The Muse ® 5 6 ® ® 2.14 Cell cycle evaluation The cell cycle assay (MCH100106, Millipore) was utilised to examine the cell cycle distribution. After 24 hours of PDT application, the CSCs were detached, 1.0 x 10 6 ® ® 2.15 DNA damage assessment The DNA damage assay from Luminex (MCH200107) was utilised to analyse the DNA damage response. Briefly, 24-hour post-PDT exposure, oesophageal CSCs were harvested, and 1 x 10 5 ® 2.16 Measurement of autophagy The Autophagy LC3 antibody assay (MCH200109) from Luminex) was employed to measure the formation of autophagosome, which is an indication of autophagy. Prior to analysis, the CSCs were cultivated in a 96-well culture plate at a seeding concentration of 4.0 x 10 4 ® 2.17 Statistical evaluation Experimental values used in this study were displayed as mean ± standard error (SEM). Experiments were carried out at least twice and in triplicate (n=3). All statistical evaluations were done with GraphPad Prism version 5 (GraphPad Software Inc., CA, USA). ANOVA (One‐way analysis of variance) and the Tukey test were utilised to examine the statistical significance among the various sample groups. A P 3 Results 3.1 Immunofluorescence characterisation of oesophageal CSCs The surface antigen markers of the isolated CSCS were characterised using immunofluorescence microscopy. The CSCs were stained using the indirect immunofluorescence technique. The captured images showed positive expression for CD271, CD90, and CD44 surface antigen biomarkers in the CSCs (  Figure 1 Figure 1 Immunofluorescence characterisation of oesophageal CSCs indicating the expression of CD44, CD90, and CD271 oesophageal CSC surface markers.

Scale bars indicate 50 micrometers. 3.2 Side population Cancer stem cells are known to efflux certain dyes, such as the Hoechst 33342 efflux dye, while cancer cells retain the dye. The isolated CSCs were distinguished from the parental tumour cells using the Hoechst 33342 efflux method. The parental oesophageal cancer cells demonstrated heavy fluorescence intensity of the blue Hoechst dye (  Figures 2A, C  Figures 2B, C Figure 2 Side population characterisation using Hoechst 33342 efflux dye.

A double asterisk indicates statistical significance. 3.5 Evaluation of nano-immunoconjugates-mediated PDT and cell death mechanism on oesophageal CSCs Cell death is a crucial activity in eukaryotic organisms that controls tissue balance and clears unhealthy and toxic cells. There are three classic categories of cell death: apoptosis, autophagy, and necrosis ( 50 4 4 4 4 4 4 3.5.1 Effects of nano-immunoconjugates on oesophageal CSC viability Metabolically active and viable cells are identified by their high ATP levels and can be measured using the luminescence assay. Here, we examined the ATP levels of viable cells in the non-irradiated and irradiated groups.

The NIC is a multi-component formulation consisting of AlPcS 4 4 10 47 51 3 38 52 53 38 53 38 40 41 45 4 4 The PDT effects and cell death mechanisms of the NIC on isolated oesophageal CSCs were investigated via ATP cell viability, ROS production, mitochondrial membrane potential, leakage of cytochrome c protein, caspase 3/7 activation, annexin FITC/PI cell death mechanism, cell cycle analysis, DNA damage response pathway, and autophagy cell death detection. The effects of NIC-based PDT were compared to the control and the unconjugated AlPcS 4 4 4 2 4 4 4 4 2 4 4 40 41 54 In physiological states, the production of cellular ATP is the primary function of the mitochondria. In contrast, in pathological conditions, the mitochondria modulate the generation of oxygen radicals and ROS, inhibiting proper generation of ATP, blocking cell proliferation, promoting the release of pro-apoptotic proteins, and cell death. Increased cellular ROS generation is linked to oxidative cellular damage ( 55 56 4 4 4 4 57 in vitro 58 54 A high level of cellular ROS has been found to disrupt the potential of the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in the efflux of several proteins from the mitochondria. This study evaluated the integrity of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) of oesophageal CSCs treated with AlPcS 4 4 4 4 4 4 59 60 The mitochondria house various proteins, including cytochrome c. Cytochrome c plays a vital function in ATP production and oxidative phosphorylation. Injury to the mitochondria results in the leakage of the cytochrome c protein, which stimulates the action of several proteins in the apoptotic signalling pathway. To confirm the impairment of the mitochondrial membrane, we examine the leakage of cytochrome c protein from the mitochondria. Damage to the mitochondrial membrane facilitates the leakage of mitochondrial proteins, such as cytochrome c, which then collaborate with several proteins in the cytosol to activate the caspases and, in turn, apoptosis. The cytoplasmic cytochrome c levels of oesophageal CSCs treated with AlPcS 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 61 62 63 The leakage of cytochrome c protein from the damaged mitochondria is vital in the upstream signalling of apoptosis and caspase-dependent cell death. In this study, caspase 3/7 activity was examined using the caspase-3/7 activation assay. It was seen that AlPcS 4 4 64 61 Moreover, to identify the exact cell death pathways mediated by AlPcS 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 33 41 61 57 4 4 Furthermore, we examine the impact of AlPcS 4 4 4 4 4 4 65 66 4 4 The DDR performs a crucial function in maintaining the genomic stability of cells. Anticancer drugs that induce DNA damage evoke several signalling cascades that dictate the outcome of damaged cells. Depending on the degree of damage and the metabolic status of the cell, several signalling pathways are activated to promote damage tolerance, stop the cell cycle, repair damaged DNA, or induce cell death. Among the diverse forms of DNA damage that can be initiated by DNA-damaging substances, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are found to be the most frequently observed class of DNA damage triggered by anti-tumour drugs ( 67 68 4 4 69 70 33 Finally, we evaluated the effects of AlPcS 4 4 71 72 73 74 4 4 4 4 33 75 76 Figure 12 Figure 12 Possible molecular and cell death mechanisms of gold nano-immunoconjugate-based PDT for oesophageal CSCs.

Flowchart illustrating the effects of 673.2 nanometer laser irradiation on gold nano-immunoconjugates targeting cells. The process leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, DNA damage, and cell cycle arrest. This results in either autophagy through phagophore and autophagosome formation or apoptosis via mitochondrial cytochrome c release, apoptosome formation, and activation of caspases 3 and 7. 5 Conclusion Oesophageal cancer is ranked as the eleventh cause of cancer-associated sickness and the seventh cancer-related death globally ( 2 4 4 Furthermore, our investigation of the cell death mechanism showed that NIC-mediated PDT initiated two conventional cell death pathways: apoptosis and autophagy. Autophagy was probably triggered as a pro-survival action of the CSCs to escape apoptosis. The induction of autophagy was established through the elevated levels of LC3 protein, a potent indicator of autophagic cell death ( 77 78 in vitro in vivo in vivo Acknowledgments We acknowledge outcomes and data from this study are a part of the PhD thesis by OD (First author), supervised by RC and HA, submitted at the University of Johannesburg.
