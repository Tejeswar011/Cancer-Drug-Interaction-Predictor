However, its toxic effects during gestation are inadequately reported. This study assessed the maternal and fetal toxic effects of intranasally and orally administered HNC. Pregnant rats were divided into three groups: vehicle control, oral HNC (75 mg/kg), and intranasal HNC at the same dose from day 0 to day 19 of gestation (day after day). Dams showed weight loss, but HNC did not cause lethality in both groups. HNC reported route-dependent tissue toxicity. Orally administered HNC leads to more pronounced oxidative intestinal damage than intranasal treatment. Intranasal administration has a much greater impact on reducing thiol content in the lungs compared to oral administration. Histopathological analysis revealed that the fetal pancreas of dams treated with HNC intranasally showed marked necrotic acini and congested blood vessels, whereas the dams treated orally exhibited foamy macrophages and lung angiopathy more frequently than the intranasally treated ones. These results highlighted that HNC, at the tested dose, caused significant pathological and oxidative damage to maternal and fetal tissues.

Additionally, ingesting or coming into contact with consumer goods that contain HNTs can expose on self to them. Oral administration in mice has been linked to pulmonary fibrosis and liver oxidative damage 12 13 Because HNTs and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have comparable tubular structures, they may be equally harmful. This toxicity could involve malignant alterations in the human respiratory system, pulmonary inflammation, and an acute phase reaction post-pulmonary exposure 14 15 The placental barrier has been described as “a lipid membrane that permits bidirectional transfer of substances between maternal and fetal compartments.” The majority of pesticides, plant alkaloids, mycotoxins, metals, and other xenobiotics enter the placenta easily, as does any compound with a molecular weight (MW) less than 1,000 16 There is little evidence available regarding the toxicological effects of HNTs on human health 17 Results High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) The HRTEM image displayed HNT nanoparticles as tube- or rod-shaped structures with a length of 0.5 μm and a diameter of 35 nm (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 TEM micrograph of HNTs. The effect of halloysite administration on the weight of pregnant rats and litter size, as well as its clinical signs of toxicity The toxic effects and lethality of HNC administered to pregnant rats via oral and intranasal administration at a dose of 75 mg/kg produced loss of weight in both the oral-treated halloysite group (HO) and the intranasal-treated halloysite group (HI) treated females, while vaginal and urethral bleeding was observed in some females in the HI group at the end of the 1 st week of pregnancy, and some resorbed sites were observed in the HO group at the time of euthanasia (20 days). HNC did not cause lethality in both groups (Table 1  Table 1 Toxicity of Halloysite in pregnant rats (clinical signs). Halloysite-treated pregnant rats Number of pregnant rats Route of administration Exposure period Toxic effects Lethality %  HI  10  Intra nasal  19 days -Vaginal urethral bleeding  - Weight loss  -Abortion  0  HO  10  Oral  19 days  -Resorption of some fetuses  - Weight loss  0 HI: Intranasal-treated halloysite dams’ group.

The increase in body weight under the influence of HNC during pregnancy was remarkably ( P 2  Fig. 2 Effect of treatment with halloysite on dams’ body weight and weight gain during pregnancy.

Conversely, the HI group showed a decrease in insulin level than the control group, and the HO group had a slightly higher insulin level compared to the HI group. This suggests that oral treatment increased insulin levels relative to intranasal (Table 2  Table 2 Effects of Halloysite administration on insulin levels in pregnant rats.

Effects of halloysite on antioxidant markers (total thiols, glutathione) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the pregnant rats’ lung and intestinal tissues Concerning oxidative damage in the lungs, the HI group revealed a marked reduction in total thiol content in relation to both control and HO groups, and a marked increase in MDA content. In contrast, both the HI and HO groups exhibited a significant reduction in lung glutathione (GSH) content than the control group. In the intestinal tissue, both HO and HI groups showed a marked decrease in thiol levels compared to the control dams. However, the GSH level was markedly reduced in the HO dams compared to the control. A marked elevation in MDA content was observed in the HO group in relation to both the HO and control groups (Table 3  Table 3 Effects of Halloysite on antioxidant markers (nmol/100 mg tissue) and lipid peroxidation (nmol MDA/100 mg Tissue/Hour) in the lung and intestinal tissues of pregnant rats.

Gross anatomical and X-ray examination of fetuses Observation of the fetal skeletons was done for a quarter of the live fetuses, which were examined grossly by using a magnifying glass (Fig. 4 ) 5  Fig. 4 A B- C  Fig. 5 X-ray imaging: fetus from control group (A) (B (C The X-ray view of the control fetal skeleton (Fig. 5 The X-ray view of the HI fetal skeleton (Fig. 5 The X-ray view of the HO fetal skeleton (Fig. 5 Histopathological study Microscopic evaluation of rat and fetal lung tissues Figure (6), H and E-stained lung sections of normal control rats (Fig. 6 6 6  Fig. 6 Representative photomicrographs of rat lung sections stained with Hematoxylin–Eosin stain (magnifications 200x and 400X): ( A A B C D E D) E F G H The fetal lungs of control group fetuses showed normal histologic structure of alveolar walls and bronchi (Figure F), while lungs of both HI and HO groups of fetuses showed marked congestion, edema, hemorrhages, and bronchitis (Fig. 6 Microscopic evaluation of rat and fetal intestinal tissue The stained small intestine sections of normal pregnant rats (Fig. 7 7 7  Fig. 7 Representative photomicrographs of rat small intestinal sections stained with Hematoxylin–Eosin stain (magnifications 100x,200x, and 400X): ( A B C D E F The fetal intestinal segments of normal control rats showed the normal histological structure of mucosa, submucosa, and musculosa, while the intestine of both groups of HI and HO showed mild to moderate congestion and edema, respectively (Fig. 7 7 Microscopic evaluation of fetal pancreas The fetal pancreas of normal control rats showed normal histologic structure of islets of Langerhans, which are scattered throughout the pancreas. These islets are distinct from the surrounding tissue and appear lightly stained compared to the darker exocrine tissue. The acini are arranged in lobules, separated by thin layers of connective tissue that contain blood vessels. The fetal pancreas of HO rats showed marked congestion of the blood vessels. The tunica intima appears dilated with endothelium detachment. Surrounding the congested blood vessels, there is an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial spaces, seen as pale or clear areas around the vessels. Similar fluid accumulation is observed around the acinar cells. The cells within the islets appear necrotic, or destroyed, with a loss of normal cellular organization. Some secretory acini showed necrotic and atrophied changes. The HI group presented all the previously mentioned pancreatic pathology, but to a less severe degree in some cases (Fig. 8  Fig. 8 Representative photomicrographs of rat fetal pancreas sections stained with Hematoxylin–Eosin stain (magnifications 100x and 50X): (A (B) (C D) Discussion Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) hold great promise in biomedicine, including the creation of tissue engineering bone implantation, ultrasound contrast agents, tooth fillings, drug and gene transfer vesicles, tumor and stem cell isolation, and cosmetics 18 1 19 20 Nanomaterials have become increasingly prevalent in various sectors, from industry and medicine to everyday consumer products. While these materials offer numerous interactions with biological systems, along with potential consequences raise concerns about unpredictable risks to human health. Halloysite, a naturally occurring nanosized tubular clay mineral, stands out among nanomaterials due to its diverse applications. It finds utility in fields such as environmental science, biomedicine, wastewater treatment, cosmetics, nanoelectronics, dye removal, nanocomposite fabrication, and even forensic science. Despite its potential, halloysite, like other nanomaterials, necessitates careful consideration of its potential impact on human health and the environment 8 Nanoparticles have been shown to increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, which results in mitochondrial malfunction 21 22 23 12 24 25 Oral administration reduces both glutathione and thiol levels in the intestinal homogenate more sharply than intranasal administration by the same dose, suggesting local intestinal oxidative stress. HCN may disrupt gut barrier integrity and interact with intestinal epithelial cells, depleting antioxidants. The HO group elevated the insulin level compared to the control. But this elevation did not reach statistical significance, which may be due to the dosage of HNC used or the durations of exposure. The HO group has a slightly higher insulin level compared to the HI group, which may be due to the differences in absorption, bioavailability, and metabolism between the oral and intranasal routes. Further studies with different dosages of HNC and duration are needed. Also, toxicokinetic need to be studied to elucidate route-dependent toxic effects of HNC. X-ray imaging of halloysite treatment, either oral or intranasal, showed skeletal immaturity with reduced clarity of bone margins, incomplete vertebral column, hypoplastic skulls, and bilaterally distributed ribs. These effects suggested delayed ossification and developmental disruptions that may be due to the teratogenic effect of HNC. Nanomaterials like nano-TiO2 delay the fetal skeletal development by causing a reduction in calcium and zinc in the fetus and the maternal serum 26 27 The study’s histopathological examination of rat lungs showed marked congestion, edema, hemorrhages, and bronchitis following both intranasal and oral halloysite treatment. These findings are consistent with Wang et al. 12 12 Sawicka et al. 25 The data also indicate mild to moderate congestion and edema in the intestines of rats treated with halloysite, regardless of whether it was administered intranasally or orally. This observation is consistent with findings by Hu et al 24 Lysosomal inclusion is recognized as a foamy macrophage in alveoli in halloysite-treated rodents. There are about 50 xenobiotics known to cause phospholipidosis; antibiotics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, antimalarials, and antiarrhythmic medications are among them. A large number of these are cationic amphiphilic drugs (CADs), which share physical characteristics due to a hydrophilic cationic side chain in their chemical structure 28 29 30 31 The fetal pancreas of rats treated with halloysite intranasally showed more marked pathological changes than the orally treated one. The intranasal route allows halloysite to bypass the blood-brain barrier through the olfactory or trigeminal pathways and may enter systemic circulation more effectively, leading to higher fetal exposure. Drugs coated in halloysite clay nanotubes may be enabled to reach the brain effectively when administered intranasally as compared with orally 32 Unless there is a lack of study addressing placental transfer, the molecular weight of HNC (294.2 g/mol) suggests potential for interaction with the placenta, like other xenobiotics with a molecular weight (MW) less than 1,000. Fluorescent polystyrene nanomaterials (40 to 500 nm in diameter) crossed the placental barrier in trophoblast culture. Also, these particles, when injected into pregnant mice, were visualized in different organs of the fetus 33 Materials and methods Ethical approval Dedication to ethics: The experiment was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Beni-Suef University (BSU-IACUC; approval number: 025 − 017), all methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations of BSU-ICAUC, AVMA, and reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines in the study’s ethical application to BSU-IACUC. Chemicals Halloysite nanoclay was obtained from the Sigma-Aldrich company. The product number is 685,445, and the CAS number is 1332-58-7. The product powder is white to yellow to beige with a pH of 4.5-7.0, 30–70 nanometers in diameter, and 1–3 microns in length. The substance was prepared freshly by dissolving it in distilled water, followed by sonication before each use. Characterization High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM) The suspension of the compound powder was sonicated for 10 min using an ultrasonicator (Crest Ultrasonics Corp., New Jersey, USA). Then, a few drops were loaded on a coated copper grid and allowed to dry. Finally, the grid loaded with the sample was examined by HR-TEM (JEOL, JEM 2100, Tokyo, Japan). Animals A total of thirty primiparous female Wistar rats, weighing 140–170 g, and fifteen male Wistar rats, weighing 190–220 g, were used in this experiment (The source of rats is the National Research Center’s laboratory animal farm in Giza, Egypt). The rats were kept in plastic cages with controlled temperatures between 21 and 23 °C, relative humidity maintained at 45% to 55%, and a light-dark cycle of 12 h each. They were provided with tap water and food ad libitum during both the adaptation and experimental periods. Experimental design The female and male rats were randomly divided into three groups ( n 12 34 Pregnancy detection A polygamous breeding system was implemented by placing one male with two females in plastic cages, from which the males were removed after pregnancy was confirmed through the examination of a vaginal smear, abdominal palpation, and body weight. Examination of a vaginal smear Pregnancy detection was achieved by identifying the presence of sperm in the vaginal smear, a reliable indicator of copulation in rats. To rinse and aspirate the cells into the pipette, 200 µL of normal saline (0.9%) was aspirated using a sterilized disposable pipette. The posterior tip of the pipette was then placed close to the vaginal entry. A light microscope was employed to view the aspirated fluid at low power (10X) to observe sperm directly in the lavage cells (Fig. 9 ) 35  Fig. 9 Microscopic examination of vaginal smear for sperm detection (10X). Abdominal palpation Additionally, by holding the rat gently from the back with one hand, it is possible to palpate the embryos through the anterior abdominal wall with the thumb and three fingers and confirm pregnancy between days 10 and 14 36 Body weight Females’ body weight was recorded weekly as an indication of pregnancy 37 Euthanasia On the 20th day of gestation, rats were given xylazine (8–12 mg/kg) and ketamine (90–120 mg/kg) intraperitoneally, blood samples were collected from the retro-orbital venous plexus by using hematocrit micro-capillary tubes without anticoagulant to obtain serum, then rats were humanely euthanized by cervical dislocation according to the AVMA Guideline for the Euthanasia of Animals. A thorough internal and external inspection was carried out, and any anomalies were noted. Pregnant female uteri and ovaries were inspected. Embryo weights were recorded. Then, lung and intestinal samples were harvested and kept at −80 °C for biochemical measures. In addition, embryos, lungs, and intestinal samples were harvested and preserved in 10% formalin for X-ray and histopathological examination. Biochemical measures Total thiols The method of Koster et al 38 Glutathione (GSH) content Glutathione content was determined using the method of Beutler et al 39 Lipid peroxidation The MDA level was measured by centrifuging 250 µL of tissue homogenate for 10 min at 3000 rpm after precipitating it with 75 µL of 76% trichloroacetic acid. The obtained supernatant was combined with 175 µl of 1.07% thiobarbituric acid. Following a half-hour incubation period at 80 °C, 250 µL of 90% cold trichloroacetic acid was added. At 532 nanometers, the produced pink color was measured 40 Serum insulin levels Serum insulin levels were measured by using an ELISA kit (Cat. No. 10-1113-01, Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden) 41 Anatomical examination Skeleton examination: Fetuses were fixed in 90% ethanol solution for at least 2 weeks. After drying out, the fetuses were skinned completely. The internal organs were removed and skinned, and 0.5% potassium hydroxide (KOH) was then added. The KOH solution was drained out, the fetuses were rinsed using water, and the water was altered with a 1% solution of hydrogen peroxide once the purification was deemed to be complete. If the internal bones were white, the bleaching was excellent. Following a minimum of one week of immersion in 80% glycerol, the skeletal examination was carried out. The skull, spine, and ribs of the fetal skeleton were examined first, followed by the skeletons being turned over to view the anterior portions, which included the mouth cavity, the bones encircling the shoulders and hips, the forelimbs, and the rear limbs. Following the tests, the findings were documented, including the number of bones, position, morphology, and structure. Using X-ray imaging, the skeleton was inspected for additional assessment. Soft tissue evaluation: The fetuses were kept in Bouin solution for one to two weeks before being dried and sliced in a specific manner. The forepart was cut and removed, the abdominal skin was sliced with a knife, and the organs within the abdominal cavity were gently removed. Histopathological examination Embryos, dams’ lungs, and intestinal samples were collected and preserved in 10% formalin. Dehydrated in ethanol and cleared in xylol. Paraffin wax embedding, mounting onto a sliding/sledge microtome, sectioning in 4–6 μm thickness, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and examination under a light optical microscope (Leica, Model 2500) 42 Statistical analysis The statistical program SPSS version 22 was used to examine all the data using one-way analysis of variance (One-way ANOVA), which was followed by a post hoc Tukey test. Data presented as mean and SE of mean and considered significant at P-value P Conclusion The halloysite nanoclay needs special attention for its use as a drug carrier, as it possesses toxic effects on dams and their fetuses. Halloysite causes toxicity to the dams, such as abortion, resorbed fetuses, and reduced litter size. In addition, it induced an evident oxidative stress. Histopathological findings revealed toxicity to pulmonary and intestinal tissue. The fetal pancreas of rats treated with halloysite intranasally showed more marked pathological changes than the orally treated one. The application of HNC during pregnancy should be handled with caution, particularly via intranasal installation. Limitations and recommendations Limitations include the challenge of expecting long-term impacts and the possibility of interspecies diversity in transferring results to humans. Also, attention to developmental outcomes is among the recommendations. Future studies ought to concentrate on the translocation of HNC across the placental barrier in ex vivo and in vivo animal models to accurately visualize and quantify HNC in fetal organs by using transmission electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy.
