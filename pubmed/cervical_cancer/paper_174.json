In a breed-, age-, and sex-matched case-controlled study involving 45 ES-affected and 15 control horses, we assessed the diagnostic, prognostic, and theragnostic value of 3 miRNAs (eca-miR-127, eca-miR-379, eca-miR-432) in horses treated with European mistletoe ( Viscum album p r p biomarkers equine sarcoid horses miRNA mistletoe Viscum album Rudolf Steiner Fund for Scientific Research e.V., Nuremberg, Germany Stiftung Pro Pferd, Zurich, Switzerland The Veterinary Association of the Canton of Neuchâtel, Neuchâtel, Switzerland The Swiss Veterinary Association for Alternative and Complementary Medicine (camvet.ch), Bern, Switzerland Society of Cancer Research, Arlesheim, Switzerland Iscador AG, Arlesheim, Switzerland pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf yes pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes edited-state corrected-proof typesetter ts1 ",
