Low-resource countries in Sub-Saharan Africa struggle with health care disparities between urban and rural areas concerning access to educational resources. While e-learning can facilitate a wide distribution of educational content, it depends on learners’ engagement and infrastructure. Objective This study aims to assess knowledge, attitude, practice, and access to infrastructure related to e-learning among health care professionals in primary health care settings in Ethiopia. Methods In April 2023, we carried out a quantitative, questionnaire-based cross-sectional study guided by the knowledge, attitudes, and practice framework, including additional items on available infrastructure. The scores in each category are defined as “high” and “low” based on the median, followed by the application of logistic regression on selected sociodemographic factors. We included health care professionals working in general and primary hospitals, health centers, and health posts. Results Of 398 participants (response rate 94.5%), more than half (n=207, 52%) reported feeling confident about their understanding of e-learning and conducting online searches, both for general (n=247, 62.1%) and medical-related content (n=251, 63.1%). Higher levels of education were associated with better knowledge (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.32, 95% CI 1.45-3.68). Regardless of financial and personal efforts, we observed a generally positive attitude. Almost half of the participants (n=172, 43.2%) reported using the internet daily, compared to 16.8% (n=67) of participants who never used the internet. Higher education (AOR 2.56, 95% CI 1.57-4.16) and income levels (AOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.06-1.62) were associated with higher practice scores of e-learning-related activities. Women, however, exhibited lower practice scores (AOR 0.44, 95% CI 0.27-0.71). Regular access to an internet-enabled device was reported by 43.5% (n=173) of the participants. Smartphones were the primarily used device (268/393, 67.3%). Common barriers to internet access were limited internet availability (142/437, 32.5%) and costs (n=190, 43.5%). Higher education (AOR 1.56, 95% CI 0.98, 2.46) and income (AOR 1.50; 95% CI 1.21-1.85) were associated with increased access to infrastructure, while it was decreased for women (AOR 0.48, 95% CI 0.30-0.77). Conclusions Although Ethiopian health care professionals report mixed levels of knowledge, they have a positive attitude toward e-learning in medical education. While internet use is common, especially via smartphone, the access to devices and reliable internet is limited. To improve accessibility, investments in the digital infrastructure and individual digital education programs are necessary, especially targeting women and those with lower income. Due to their widespread availability, e-learning programs should be optimized for smartphones.

This offer leverages advanced multilingual technology and strategic partnerships to ensure accessible, culturally relevant, and impactful health education worldwide [ 6 7 online 8 Advantages of e-Learning The advantages of e-learning include improving the access to education [ 9 10 11 12 13-15 16 Barriers in LMICs and Africa Nevertheless, e-learning approaches are not universally suitable for all learners due to the diverse and individual nature of learning styles [ 17 18 18-20 6 21 22 23 24 11 25-28 undefined undefined undefined 21 22 29 Implementation Efforts in Africa Several studies report on piloting and partly adopting e-learning in medical education. In Uganda, despite relevant efforts, nationwide implementation remains limited, with progress largely dependent on the commitment of individual institutions and educators, leading to uneven advancement across the country [ 30 1 31 9 32 Rationale The knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) framework is a widely used approach to assess target groups in the context of public health [ 33 34 28 35 36 37 Objective Our study aims to assess knowledge, attitude, practice, and access to infrastructure (KAP-Infrastructure) related to e-learning courses among health care professionals working at the primary health care level in Central and Southern Ethiopia. Our study provides an opportunity to offer insights and address the existing gaps and missing information in this area and setting. Methods Overview We conducted a data collector–supported self-administered cross-sectional survey among health care professionals working as general practitioners, health officers, nurses, midwives, or health extension workers in 45 health facilities between April 3 and 28, 2023. The study was set in the Oromia region and the former Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples Region (SNNPR), which was reorganized in August 2023 after the data collection. The study regions are now part of the South Ethiopia Regional State and the Central Ethiopia Regional State. More than 85% of residents in Oromia and 89% of residents in the former SNNPR live in rural areas [ 38 39 Multimedia Appendix 1 23 40 Multimedia Appendix 1 Outcome Variables We investigated the 4 KAP-Infrastructure constructs, building items based on the following definitions (1) “Knowledge” assessed the health care professionals’ self-perceived practical abilities related to e-learning tasks. (2) “Attitude” represented participants’ motivation and expectations toward e-learning to support their professional education. (3) “Practice” concerned the conduct of activities related to e-learning. Finally, (4) “Access to infrastructure” covered individual and work-related infrastructural conditions of the health care professionals. Questionnaire The questionnaire contained questions on sociodemographic characteristics as well as the participants’ perspectives on e-learning based on the KAP model [ 33 41 Besides using the United Nations Online Learning Framework as an orientation, we covered relevant aspects of e-learning by using items described in a systematic review outlining enablers and barriers affecting e-learning in health sciences [ 11 42 35 37 35 The questionnaire contained 10 sociodemographic, 10 knowledge, 13 attitude, 8 practice, and 7 infrastructure items. It was initially developed in English and then translated into the Amharic and Afan Oromo languages. A blind back-translation into English ensured accuracy. Discrepancies were addressed and discussed. The main translation process involved 5 native speakers of Amharic and Afan Oromo, all of whom were proficient in English and had a medical background. Due to the lack of a topically fitting validated research instrument, the questionnaire was developed by an interprofessional team of health scientists from Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg and Addis Ababa University based on comprehensive initial literature research. We performed pretests according to the Concurrent Think Aloud Method and adapted the questionnaire accordingly, ensuring its comprehensibility, suitability, and validity. Two rounds of pretests were conducted in Addis Ababa in March 2023, including 38 health care professionals in 2 health centers. These participants represented approximately 9% of the overall sample, closely meeting the targeted 5% per health care center. The items were tested for understandability and clarity in the Amharic and Afan Oromo languages. The received feedback was then reviewed and discussed by interdisciplinary teams in both Germany and Ethiopia, resulting in the exclusion or rephrasing of certain questions and answer choices, as well as modifications to the consent section. The process was guided by “Surveys and Questionnaires in Health Research” by Schofield and colleagues [ 43 44 Sample Size and Sampling Technique Before collecting the data, the sample size was calculated using the single population proportion formula. The level of KAP of health care professionals on e-learning in Ethiopia has not been studied yet. Therefore, the sample size was calculated with the some assumptions, including 50% proportion of the outcome among health care professionals, 5% marginal error, and 95% CI. Under these circumstances, the sample size is 384, and after adding a 10 % nonresponse rate, the final sample size was 423. For comparison, we also calculated the sample size to estimate a 2-sided CI for one proportion for the target variable “internet access” as a representation for the objective “infrastructure.” With this frame we calculated a sample size of 395, including a 10% nonresponse rate. Since the calculated sample size of infrastructure was smaller than the sample size of KAP, we decided to achieve a larger sample size of 423. We selected participating health care professionals working in the affiliated health facilities using the convenience sample method and reached a final sample size of 398 participants (response rate 94.1%). All health care professionals, including general practitioners, health officers, nurses, midwives, and health extension workers present during data collection, were included in the study. However, those who were unavailable at that time and any professionals not listed above were excluded from the study. Ensuring a balanced participation between all occupations, we considered a proportional allocation for each health facility. Data Analysis First, we conducted basic descriptive statistics. After building sum scores for each KAP-Infrastructure category, the median was used to define “low” and “high” scores in each category, which were considered as binary response variables in downstream analyses ( Multimedia Appendix 2 45 Multimedia Appendix 3 46 47-49 50 51 52 Ethical Considerations We received approval from the Addis Ababa University Research Ethics Committee in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (Prev: 423), and the ethics committee of the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg-Medical Faculty (processing number 2023‐003). Participant information was collected anonymously, and written consent was obtained in the questionnaire. Participants did not receive any compensation. Results Overview We included a total of 398 participants (response rate, 94.1%). Overall, 25 health care professionals declined due to workload, unwillingness, or undisclosed reasons. Male (195/394, 49.5%) and female (199/394, 50.5%) participants were equally represented. The mean age was 31.0 (SD 7.0) years. Half of the health care professionals were nurses (200/398, 50.3%). In total, 86.7% (345/398) of the participants chose the Amharic version of the questionnaire. The mean income per month was US $138 (SD $57). Among the participants, 4 out of 5 worked in primary facilities (316/398, 79.4%; Table 1 Table 1. Sociodemographic information.

Knowledge About half of the health care professionals were completely (90/398, 22.6%) or fairly confident (117/398, 29.4%) in knowing what e-learning is. Almost two thirds of them described a self-perceived competence in doing general (247/398, 62.1%) and medical-related (251/398, 63.1%) online online Figure 1 Figure 1. Self-perceived knowledge (%). Attitude Health care professionals predominantly had a positive attitude toward e-learning, with 94.2% (375/398) willing to put effort into acquiring e-learning skills. More than half (224/398, 56.2%) believed that e-learning is possible in rural parts of Ethiopia. Almost all health care professionals were in favor of integrating e-learning in medical teaching institutions (368/398, 92.5%). Some participants expressed fear (102/398, 25.7%) or perceived e-learning as more problematic than helpful (113/398; 28.4%; Figure 2 Figure 2. Health care professionals’ attitude toward e-learning (%). CPD: continuous professional development. Practice Daily internet usage was reported by 172/398 (43.2%) participants and 67/398 (16.8%) participants never used it. More than half used the internet for general (255/398, 64.1%) and medical-related searches (209/398, 52.5%), social networking (262/398, 65.8%), and chatting (226/398, 56.8%). In total, 2 out of 3 health care professionals stated a regular usage (at least once a week) of an internet device (259/398, 65.1%) and pointed out smartphones as the most used device (268/393, 67.3%; Multimedia Appendix 4 Figure 3 Figure 3. Practice of e-learning (%). Access to Infrastructure Access to digital devices (154/398, 38.7%) and stable internet (80/398, 20.1%) at the participants’ workplace was less common than at home (access to private devices [173/398, 43.5%] and stable internet [99/398, 24.9%]). Common barriers included problems with internet availability (142/437, 32.5%) and internet costs (190/437; 43.5%; Multimedia Appendix 5 Figure 4 Figure 4. Health care professionals’ access to infrastructure (in %). Factors Associated With Knowledge, Attitude, Practice, and Infrastructure Higher levels of education were associated with increased knowledge (AOR 2.31, 95% CI 1.45-3.68), whereas higher age was associated with lower knowledge (AOR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91-0.97). Health care professionals with a higher education level (AOR 2.56, 95% CI 1.57-4.16) and income group (AOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.06-1.62) were more likely to have higher practice scores. Female (AOR 0.44, 95% CI 0.6-0.71) and older participants (AOR 0.91, 95 % CI 0.87-0.95) were likely to report lower practice scores. Participants from higher income groups (AOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.21-1.85) had increased odds of having higher access to infrastructure.

Discussion Principal Findings The majority of the participants knew about e-learning and viewed themselves as competent in different e-learning-related activities. Still, we found difficulties in relevant knowledge aspects like participating in online meetings or searching for medical information. Moreover, a high proportion of workers had a positive attitude toward the use of e-learning. Almost half of the participants stated using the internet daily, whereas 16.8% (67/398) never use the internet. Infrastructure, such as technical devices and stable internet, was more often available at home than at work. The availability of stable internet was reported at below 25% (at home: 24.9% and at work: 20.1%). Health care professionals with higher levels of education and income and those working in general hospitals had better KAP of e-learning and better access to infrastructure. Older health care professionals, women, and those working in health posts and primary hospitals reported reduced access to infrastructure. Strengths and Limitations First, the included health facilities show differences in terms of health service quality, with some having been rewarded international awards and not necessarily representing the typical peripheral hospital in Ethiopia. However, this diversity is part of the primary health care setting and should be represented in the study. Second, during the data collection, we observed that some participants were confused about the definition of a smartphone, occasionally mistaking it for a tablet. These cases were clarified by the data collectors. Despite verification and testing of the translated questionnaire, we cannot completely rule out cases of misinterpretation. However, it is not expected to significantly affect the results. Third, the health care facilities are exclusively located in Oromia and the former SNNPR region. Therefore, the results may not be generalizable for Ethiopia. While future research should investigate regional differences, it is reasonable to assume that our data from the context of primary health care settings are relevant and transferable to other parts of the country to a certain extent. Given the absence of studies in comparable settings, our data offer valuable insights for the development and implementation of effective e-learning courses. Comparison With Prior Work Participants report mixed levels of confidence regarding knowledge or e-learning–related tasks. More than 3 quarters of the health care professionals are at least somewhat confident in understanding the concept of e-learning (316/398, 79.4%), in performing basic digital tasks, such as general online searches ( 324/ 334/ 290/ 36 28 35 53 54 55 Moreover, the lack of digital knowledge remains a significant challenge, further widening the digital divide between rural and urban areas [ 56 57 56 58 Despite these mixed results, the overall attitude among Ethiopian health care professionals remains positive, and many even consider making financial and personal investments to support its implementation. In contrast, students from Uganda and Turkey showed an overall negative attitude toward e-learning. Participants’ income, internet quality, ownership of technical devices, and previous use of academic sites were associated with attitude scores [ 59 60 61 62 63 These positive attitudes can support the success of educative efforts [ 64 65 66 67 11 68 1 Regarding the practice of e-learning-related activities, almost half of the health care professionals (172/398, 43.2%) reported using the internet daily, which is less frequent than nursing students (68.1%) and comparable to patients from Gondar, Ethiopia (47%) [ 69 70 70 71 69 Notably, smartphones emerged as the most commonly used device for accessing infrastructure, which aligns with findings from other Ethiopian settings [ 70 70 72 73 25 19 26 74 75 76 71 53 9 77 78 79 80 Regarding possible gender differences, female health carecprofessionals had lower scores in knowledge, practice, and access to infrastructure while displaying a similar attitude. This is consistent with reports on the digital divide, both globally and in Ethiopia, which can in part be attributed to gender inequality [ 81 82 19 83 84 Conclusion Health care professionals report mixed levels of knowledge in e-learning-related task while generally having a positive attitude toward e-learning in medical education. More than half use the internet regularly, especially via smartphones, while the access to digital infrastructure and reliable internet remains limited. Efforts should be made to improve access to internet access and technological infrastructure, as well as the adaptation of e-learning courses to the local needs. This could include the provision of introductory trainings, particularly for women and health care professionals with lower income and educationl; provision of downloadable offline learning options; and the adaptability of the course to smartphone use.
