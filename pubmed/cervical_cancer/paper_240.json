Although individual RCD forms have been extensively studied, a comprehensive framework integrating multiple RCD processes has been lacking, limiting systematic biomarker discovery. To address this gap, we developed a multi-optosis model that incorporates 25 distinct RCD forms and integrates multi-omic and phenotypic data across 33 cancer types. This model enables the identification of candidate biomarkers with translational relevance through genome-wide significant associations. We analyzed 9,385 tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 7,429 non-tumor samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database, accessed via MAPK10 COL1A1 UMOD via CancerRCDShiny https://cancerrcdshiny.shinyapps.io/cancerrcdshiny/ cancer multi-omics multi-optosis regulated cell death (RCD) signature database The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

This figure provides detailed operational definitions for the 25 RCD forms in the multi-optosis model. Each cell death process is characterized by specific biochemical and morphological features based on the Nomenclature of Cell Death 2018 ( Galluzzi et al., 2018 A table listing various forms of regulated cell death (RCD) with operational definitions. Each RCD form, such as apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis, is associated with a specific mechanism, such as DNA fragmentation or mitochondrial dysfunction. The table includes 25 forms with diverse triggers and processes, described in brief definitions emphasizing the biological and physiological aspects involved. Most studies on RCD in cancer are confined to a death form ( Liang et al., 2020 Zhang Y. et al., 2022 Zhang Z. et al., 2022 Xu et al., 2023 Su et al., 2023 Sun X. et al., 2024 Zou et al., 2022 Wei Q. et al., 2023 Wang and Zhang, 2024 PANoptosis, a 3-optosis model, describes a unique inflammatory RCD pathway, characterized by a coordinated and often simultaneous convergence of features from pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis ( Sun X. et al., 2024 Samir et al., 2020 Wang and Kanneganti, 2021 Shi et al., 2023 Zha et al., 2023 Zhu et al., 2023 Han et al., 2024 Yu et al., 2024 Zhao et al., 2024 Zha et al., 2023 Liu et al., 2024 Liu et al., 2024 Gao et al., 2024 Sun F. et al., 2024 Tang et al., 2024 Xie et al., 2024 Zhong et al., 2023 Su et al., 2023 A 12-optosis model, encompassing apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, cuproptosis, entosis, NETosis, parthanatos, lysosome-dependent cell death, autophagy-dependent cell death, alkaliptosis, and oxeiptosis, was evaluated post-surgery in patients with triple-negative breast cancer ( Zou et al., 2022 Wei Q. et al., 2023 Wang and Zhang, 2024 SFRP1 CDO1 HGF SETD7 IRAK3 STEAP4 CD22 C4A VIM TUBB6 MFN2 FOXO3 YAP1 Notably, the 13 genes contribute uniquely to the signature, each with distinct biological functions and associations with immune, tumor microenvironment, and clinical features, rather than sharing correlations across all phenotypic or genomic aspects to provide an overall prognostic score related to cell death in bladder cancer. The discovery of molecular markers associated with RCD forms can serve as prognostic or predictive biomarkers, guiding treatment decisions and monitoring therapeutic responses ( Zhou Y. et al., 2024 Souers et al., 2013 Roberts et al., 2016 DiNardo et al., 2019 Despite the diverse RCD forms, cancer cells often evade these processes through various mechanisms, including those involving cancer stem cells, which are the foundation of the disease ( Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011 Castelli et al., 2021 TP53 BCL2 Aubrey et al., 2018 Su et al., 2022 CASP3 CASP9 Ghavami et al., 2009 Neophytou et al., 2021 Research on identifying potential markers and therapeutic targets based on RCD forms in cancer often faces shortcomings. Most studies are limited to a single form of RCD ( Liang et al., 2020 Zhang Y. et al., 2022 Zhang Z. et al., 2022 Xu et al., 2023 Zou et al., 2022 Yu et al., 2024 Wei Y. et al., 2023 Chen et al., 2022 versus Zhu et al., 2023 Han et al., 2024 Wang X. et al., 2022 Pan B. et al., 2022 Gadepalli et al., 2021 Ye et al., 2023 Liang et al., 2020 Pan S. et al., 2022 Wu et al., 2021 Unlike studies that assume uniform behavior of RCD-related genes across cancers, our approach acknowledges that each cancer type has its unique molecular and biological context. Thus, a gene that induces cell death in one cancer might help another cancer evade treatment. An example is TP53 Aubrey et al., 2018 Building upon the concept of multi-optosis, which describes the intricate crosstalk between distinct RCD pathways, our model integrates 25 forms of RCD into a comprehensive framework ( Figure 1 Supplementary Dataset S1A Cancer Genome Atlas Research et al., 2013  1 Goldman et al., 2020  2 Wang S. et al., 2022 Li S. et al., 2024 CancerRCDShiny https://cancerrcdshiny.shinyapps.io/cancerrcdshiny/ https://chatgpt.com/g/g-8etzMPrtt-cancer-programmed-cell-death-data-analyst To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically map and classify Pan-Cancer signatures linked to 25 RCD modalities across seven omic layers, integrated with tumor phenotypic traits and clinical endpoints. In addition to conceptual innovation, we provide an interactive Shiny web application that enables real-time exploration of >44,000 multi-omic RCD signatures stratified by cancer type, omic modality, phenotype association, and survival relevance. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Multi-optosis model specificities The multi-optosis model integrates 25 forms of RCD ( Figure 1 Supplementary Dataset S1A Galluzzi et al., 2018 Supplementary Material S1  3 A multi-optosis inventory of 5,913 genes was compiled by querying each RCD form term in the NCBI Gene database using a Boolean approach ( Brown et al., 2015 Supplementary Dataset S1B Entrez 2.2 Signature construction: mono-omic, multi-phenotypic framework Each signature in our study is designed as a mono-omic, multi-phenotypic construct. That is, a given signature is composed exclusively of one or more feature elements, derived from a single omic layer—either protein expression, somatic mutation, copy number variation (CNV), miRNA expression, transcript isoform expression, mRNA expression, or CpG methylation. We do not combine features from different omic layers within the same signature. This design is guided by both biological rationale and computational feasibility. From a biological standpoint, each omic layer captures mechanistically distinct processes. Protein expression reflects post-translational modification and proteostasis; somatic mutations represent irreversible genomic alterations; CNV capture structural genome variation; miRNAs regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally; transcript isoforms result from alternative splicing; mRNA reflects transcriptional output; and methylation encodes epigenetic regulation. Merging these heterogeneous molecular signals into a single signature would conflate mechanistic interpretations and hinder clinical or biological inference. Technically, the underlying data vary considerably in availability, granularity, and completeness across tumor types. RNA-Seq data (including mRNA, transcript isoforms, and miRNA) are nearly complete across TCGA cohorts. In contrast, RPPA protein expression covers only ∼258 targets with variable tumor representation, and DNA methylation profiles are probe-limited and sample-restricted. Mutation and CNV annotations also differ in resolution. A multi-omic integration would require imputation or sample filtering, introducing sparsity and reducing analytic robustness. By maintaining mono-omic integrity, each signature remains self-contained and biologically interpretable, while enabling systematic per-layer analysis across 33 cancer types. Importantly, although each signature is mono-omic in structure, its phenotypic annotations—e.g., tumor vs non-tumor expression contrast, hazard ratio contexture (HRC), survival metric contexture (SMC), tumor microenvironment contexture (TMC), and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte contexture (TIC)—may, when required, be inferred from mRNA-level or transcript isoform expression of the same gene locus. This bi-layer annotation strategy was specifically implemented for non-transcriptomic layers—protein, mutation, CNV, and methylation—when those layers lacked native support for phenotypic inference. For example, in methylation-specific signatures, TIC was assessed by the mRNA expression level of the gene bearing the CpG modification. This bi-layer annotation logic is consistent with the expression-centric architecture of the UCSC Xena data model and reflects a pragmatic design constraint: we did not develop programmatic functions to compute HRC, SMC, TMC, and TIC directly from non-expression-based data such as mutations, CNV, or methylation profiles. We did implement transcript-based correlates for RPPA protein data due to its continuous expression-like structure, but this was not feasible for the categorical or sparse mutation, CNV, or methylation datasets. This design choice is grounded in both biological plausibility and practical implementation considerations. Estimating phenotypic classifiers (e.g., immune infiltration, hazard ratios) reliably requires continuous, high-resolution, and biologically responsive signals—criteria met by RNA-based and protein-based datasets but not by mutation (sparse), CNV (categorical), or methylation (probe-limited) data. Furthermore, no established Pan-Cancer methodologies exist for computing immune or risk classifiers directly from these non-transcriptomic layers. Attempting such estimation would risk generating low-confidence or overfitted associations. Our approach thus prioritizes analytical rigor by applying a validated transcript-based phenotypic framework, while preserving the mono-omic identity of each signature and enhancing its biological interpretability. An omic feature is incorporated into a signature if it reaches genome-wide significance for correlation with one of three key tumor-intrinsic variables: tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), or tumor stemness metric (TSM). These variables were analyzed in high-throughput mode across the genome and adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Holm–Bonferroni method (adjusted p < 5 × 10 −8 In the case of multi-element signatures, each feature included must share the same correlation direction for the phenotypic feature contexture (PFC), identical tumor vs non-tumor polarity, and common classification codes for HRC, SMC, TMC, and TIC. Features with divergent phenotypic patterns were split into separate signatures, each contextualized by its tumor type and phenotypic profile. 2.3 Correlation analysis between multi-omic and phenotypic variables in 33 cancer types We conducted a comprehensive computational analysis correlating multi-omic variables with phenotypic outcomes from the TCGA Pan-Cancer analysis project ( Cancer Genome Atlas Research et al., 2013 Goldman et al., 2020 Cancer Genome Atlas Research et al., 2013 Wang S. et al., 2022 Li S. et al., 2024  4 Consortium et al., 2013 The multi-omic feature included RNA-Seq transcriptomics (mRNA expression, transcript isoform expression, and miRNA expression), CpG methylation (450K array), CNV (gistic2 thresholded), mutations (SNP and INDEL; MC3 public version), and reverse-phase protein expression array (TCGA RPPA microarray) ( Akbani et al., 2014 Sanjai et al., 2024 Supplementary Dataset S1C BioMart  5 Ren et al., 2024 Supplementary Dataset S1D miRBaseConverter”  6 Supplementary Dataset S1E BioMart R The phenotypic features included the patient’s indexes for TMB, MSI, TSM, hazard ratio, prognostic survival metrics, TMC and TIC. The term ‘HRC’ refers to the classification of omic signatures based on their prognostic association with survival outcomes in population-level Cox regression models. Each signature is assigned a categorical hazard classification code representing either an increased risk (risky), a decreased risk (protective), or no significant association across four survival endpoints. The signature’s HRC, derived from population-level Cox models, was integrated into the rank-based nomenclature system. The analysis was performed in R, using functions and customized source code based on the UCSC XenaShiny package ( Wang S. et al., 2022 Li S. et al., 2024 Supplementary Dataset S1F To identify statistically significant associations, Holm–Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied exclusively to correlation analyses involving TMB, MSI, and TSM, which were conducted on a genome-wide scale across all omic features. Genome-wide significance was defined as an adjusted p-value <5 × 10 −8 For the comparison of mRNA expression between tumor and non-tumor tissues, including primary-tissue-matched samples from the GTEx project (n = 7,429 samples, Supplementary Dataset S1F Consortium et al., 2013 For tumor versus Goldman et al., 2020 Wang S. et al., 2022 Li S. et al., 2024 Vivian et al., 2017 Wang S. et al., 2022 Li S. et al., 2024 TCGA versus padj padj We performed hazard ratio analysis using the Cox proportional hazards regression model to assess the prognostic significance of the association between omic variables and patient survival outcomes, providing hazard ratios that refer to the relative risk of events occurring at any given point in time. Univariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the association between each omic feature or signature and survival outcomes. Standard clinical covariates (e.g., age, sex, tumor stage) were not included at this discovery phase, as the objective was to enable large-scale, systematic signature discovery across omic layers and cancer types. Expanding the model to include covariate-adjusted effects would require redefinition of the signature elements to retain correlation within each subgroup, and the construction of stratified indices across clinical layers within the Xena-derived framework. We acknowledge this as a valid direction for future validation studies. Multi-omic features with consistent correlations, showing the same direction in tumor versus non-tumor expression, and Cox hazard ratio were used to create signatures. These signatures were then evaluated individually by summing the values of the constituent features (i.e., member 1 + member 2 + … + member n). The prognostic significance of the constructed signatures was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards analysis for four survival metrics: Disease-Specific Survival (DSS), Disease-Free Interval (DFI), Progression-Free Interval (PFI), and Overall Survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for each metric, and log-rank tests were applied to compare survival distributions across patient groups, determining the statistical significance of observed differences. Together, these survival analyses offer a comprehensive view of patient outcomes and provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of cancer treatments ( Royle et al., 2023 Korn and Crowley, 2013 2.4 Classification of signatures according to the tumor microenvironment profile We used CIBERSORT (Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts) ( Newman et al., 2015 Aran et al., 2017 Wang S. et al., 2022 Li S. et al., 2024 + + + + + + We categorized the signatures as anti-tumoral, pro-tumoral, or dual with respect to tumor progression. This classification was based on the Spearman correlation coefficients between mRNA, miRNA, isoform RNA-Seq or protein expression of the signature database and the RNA-Seq expression profiles of the 29 specific cell infiltrate types representative of the tumor microenvironment profile ( Supplementary Dataset S1G Supplementary Dataset S1G In this system, the signs and magnitudes of the correlation coefficients provide insights into different tumor microenvironment scenarios (See Supplementary Figure S1 We combined the correlation coefficients for all cell types to classify the signatures according to the tumor microenvironment, considering their signs. Signatures with the highest combined magnitude for anti-tumoral cell types were classified as anti-tumoral. Similarly, signatures with the highest combined correlations for pro-tumoral cell types were classified as pro-tumoral, and signatures with the highest combined correlations for dual microenvironment cell types were classified as dual. Detailed methodology is provided in Supplementary Material S1 2.5 Classification of signatures according to the tumor immune phenotype The tumor immune phenotype, classified as hot, cold, or variable based on immune cell infiltration, guides therapeutic interventions and identifies patients who are resistant to immunotherapies ( Galon and Bruni, 2019 Wang L. et al., 2020 + Supplementary Dataset S1H Galon and Bruni, 2019 Wang L. et al., 2020 Wang M. et al., 2020 We employed a classification method analogous to immunohistochemistry as a proxy to quantify tumor lymphocyte infiltration using RNA-Seq indexes ( Aran et al., 2017 Galon and Bruni, 2019 Wang M. et al., 2020 Supplementary Dataset S1H For classification, we used Spearman correlation coefficients and p-value significance to analyze the relationship between RNA-Seq-based expression profiles of signatures and immune cell profiles (T CD8 + Galon and Bruni, 2019 Wang L. et al., 2020 + Supplementary Material S1 2.6 Multi-optosis and multi-omic signature nomenclature The signature nomenclature system provides a structured alphanumeric identifier that categorizes signatures derived from multi-omic Pan-Cancer analysis. This system links the multi-omic features of target genes with phenotypic characteristics across 33 cancer types, ensuring high precision and clarity in data organization and retrieval. The signature identifier follows an eleven-component structure: CTAB-GSI. GFC.PFC.SCS.TNC.HRC.SMC.TMC.TIC.RCD Figure 2 FIGURE 2 Multi-omic Signature Nomenclature and Coding System. This figure details the nomenclature and coding system used for multi-omic signatures in the multi-optosis model. Each signature is uniquely identified by a series of codes that represent different attributes: the cancer type abbreviation is a three- or four-letter abbreviation denoting the TCGA cancer type (i.e., KIRP for kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma); the phenotypic feature code is a one-digit code showing the specific phenotypic feature associated with the signature; the genomic feature code is a one-digit code representing the multi-omic feature; the signature identifier is a unique three-digit number assigned to each signature within a specific cancer type; the correlation sign shows the type of association, with ‘P' for positive and ‘N' for negative; the TCGA versus Diagram illustrating the coding system for cancer-related data. It includes segments for Cancer Type Abbreviation (\"KIRP\"), Gene Signature Identifier (\"107\"), Genomic Feature Code (\"3\"), TCGA vs GTEx Expression Code (\"2\"), Phenotypic Feature Code (\"1.44\"), Tumor Infiltration Code (\"N\"), Survival Metrics Code (\"1\"), RCD Code (\"44\"), Microenvironment Code (\"1.2\"), and Association Sign (\"P\" or \"N\"). Each segment has a corresponding description. Each component is defined as:  CTAB Supplementary Dataset S1I  GSI  GFC  PFC  SCS  TNC versus  HRC  SMC The letter B varies according to the omic layer. For Protein, miRNA, Transcript, mRNA, and Methylation, it corresponds to the category “High”. For the Mutation feature, B represents “MT” (Mutant), while for the CNV feature, B refers to “Deleted.” Similarly, the letter C also differs by omic layer. For Protein, miRNA, Transcript, mRNA, and Methylation, C corresponds to the category “Low.” For the Mutation feature, it represents “WT” (Wild Type), and for CNV, it reflects the “Duplicated” status. The letter D is used explicitly for the CNV feature and represents the category “Deleted/Duplicated,” which encompasses both deletion and duplication events. There are 128 combinations of the 1N2N3N4N array for hazard values and survival metrics. Each array combination is reassigned to a specific numerical identifier ranging from 0 to 127 ( Supplementary Dataset S1J  TMC  TIC  RCD 2.7 Signature rank method We developed the Cancer Multi-optosis Multi-omic Signature Rank Calculator in R Liu et al., 2018 Galon and Bruni, 2019 Wang L. et al., 2020 Supplementary Material S1 2.8 Drug-gene interaction analysis To identify potential therapeutic targets, we conducted a comprehensive cross-referencing analysis of gene components from the top-ranked multi-modular and clinically meaningful signatures. The gene members of these signatures were queried against the Drug–Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb 5)  7 Cannon et al., 2024 To construct the drug-gene interaction network, we retrieved curated interaction data from DGIdb 5.0, excluding undefined or unknown interaction types to ensure the identification of meaningful associations. The dataset was processed in R using the “ tidyverse” “igraph “ggraph” 2.9 Validation using the independent PRECOG cancer database To validate the prognostic value of the selected mRNA-specific signatures associated with risk, protection, and poor prognosis, we used the PRECOG (PREdiction of Clinical Outcomes from Genomic Profiles) database  8 Gentles et al., 2015 Supplementary Dataset S1I Supplementary Dataset S1K 2.10 PDF-Ai-assisted evidence of involvement of signature members in the multi-optosis model A drawback of most multi-omic studies aimed at discovering biomarkers in cancer is the lack of cross-referencing with databases. Flat lists of genes with limited features are often reported ( Ravel et al., 2020 Gadepalli et al., 2021 Wang et al., 2018 Zhou and Bao, 2020 Supplementary Material S1 Cancer Regulated Cell Death Data Analyst https://chatgpt.com/g/g-8etzMPrtt-cancer-programmed-cell-death-data-analyst A detailed inventory of established immunotherapy targets and their presence within the multi-omic RCD signature repertoire is presented in Supplementary Dataset S1L Supplementary Material S1 The PDF corpora were compiled using the NCBI pubmed https://endnote.com/ 3 Results The construction and analysis of the multi-optosis model, depicted in the workflow ( Figure 3 Figure 1 Supplementary Dataset S1B FIGURE 3 Workflow of the Multi-Optosis Model Analysis. This workflow illustrates the detailed process for constructing and analyzing a multi-optosis model focusing on 25 RCD mechanisms. The process begins with identifying 5,913 RCD-related genes using the NCBI “ Entrez” “ CancerRCDShiny Cancer Regulated Cell Death Data Analyst Diagram illustrating a multi-step analysis process of regulated cell death genes across 33 cancer types. At the top, various cell death types are depicted as icons. The process involves multi-omic and phenotypic correlations, producing over 192,000 results. Data from primary tumor and normal tissue undergo RNA-Seq expression analysis, leading to Cox regression analyses and building signatures. These signatures undergo significance scoring, nomenclature, survival analysis, and tumor immune infiltration analysis. Key components include Xena Shiny, Cancer RCD Data analyst, and Cancer RCD Shiny web browser for cross-referencing and reanalysis. Approximately 40% (n = 2,403) of all genes in the inventory are involved in two or more forms of RCD ( Supplementary Dataset S1B Supplementary Dataset S1M Notably, 422 genes in the inventory are established Cancer Gene Census Tier 1 driver genes (n = 584, 72.3%) in COSMIC (Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer)  9 Sondka et al., 2018 Kinnersley et al., 2024 Supplementary Dataset S1B TP53 AKT1 MTOR CD274 PTEN STAT3 TP53 SIRT3 CXCL8 NFKB1 STING1 TNF Supplementary Dataset S1B The multi-optosis model integrates multi-omic and phenotypic reiterative correlations estimated from the TCGA Pan-Cancer secondary database ( Goldman et al., 2020 Wang S. et al., 2022 Li S. et al., 2024 Wang S. et al., 2022 Li S. et al., 2024 The multi-omic and phenotypic features associated with each gene member in the signatures are compiled into an extensive integrative database ( Supplementary Dataset S2 The number of elements per signature ranged from 1 to 2,052 (mean = 4.3; median = 1; Q1 = 1; Q3 = 2; P90 = 6, meaning that only 10% of signatures contain over six elements; Supplementary Dataset S2 Supplementary Figure S2 To investigate whether the number of multi-omic signatures identified per cancer type was influenced by cohort size, we assessed the association between the number of patients and the number of signatures across the 32 tumor types analyzed. A Spearman’s rank correlation analysis revealed a positive monotonic relationship (ρ = 0.794, p = 5.9 × 10 −8 However, several tumor types exhibited signature-to-patient ratios that markedly exceeded the overall trend. For instance, Thymoma (THYM) yielded 1,564 signatures from only 119 patients (ratio = 13.14), Skin Cutaneous Melanoma (SKCM) produced 1,210 signatures from 102 patients (ratio = 11.86), and Kidney Chromophobe (KICH) yielded 744 signatures from 66 patients (ratio = 11.27). Even Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PAAD), with 178 patients, showed an elevated ratio of 10.51. In contrast, other tumor types with substantially larger sample sizes—such as Breast Invasive Carcinoma (BRCA) with 1,092 patients—displayed a considerably lower ratio of 3.24, emphasizing that signature richness is not merely proportional to cohort size, but may reflect intrinsic biological or molecular heterogeneity across tumor types. These results suggest that while sample size contributes to statistical power, it does not solely account for the observed variation in signature yield. Instead, intrinsic biological factors—such as tumor heterogeneity, distinct molecular programs, and RCD pathway diversity—likely shape the landscape of detectable prognostic signals. The distribution of multi-omic signatures across omic features and cancer types is represented in Figure 4 FIGURE 4 Accumulated histogram illustrating the distribution of multi-omic signatures by multi-omic feature across various cancer types. Each bar represents a unique Cancer Type Abbreviation, with colors depicting the relative proportions of signatures across multi-omic feature. The height of each bar shows the absolute accumulated count of signatures for each multi-omic feature within each cancer type.

Features include CNV, miRNA, mutation, transcript, methylation, mRNA, and protein, each represented by different colors. The x-axis lists cancer type abbreviations, while the y-axis shows the absolute count. The top-ranked cancer types, based on the number of signatures for each omic feature, reveal specific molecular patterns ( Figure 4 Of the 5,913 target genes, 5,777 (97.7%) reached a significant correlation and are therefore included as elements in the signature database. Of the remaining genes, 101 did not achieve significance, and 35 lacked data in the Xena database. Most of the signatures include at least one apoptosis-related gene (34,500; 77.2%). This rate is expected, as 4,812 (81.4%) of the target genes are associated with apoptosis ( Supplementary Dataset S2 Among the transcript isoform signatures, the ten most frequently occurring genes were EFEMP2 ABI3BP TPM1 ELN FN1 COL1A1 DCN PDLIM7 TCF4 COL1A2 Supplementary Dataset S1N The identifier KIRP-107.3.2.N.1.44.44.1.1.2 exemplifies the nomenclature system used throughout, as shown in Figure 2 versus The commonalities of the signatures can be explored and analyzed purposefully or guided. Here, we exemplified the downstream analysis in two ways. The first is selecting signatures whose elements capture the highest impact rank in given omic-phenotype associations. The members of such signatures can pertain to different RCD forms (RCD Multi-Modular signatures). The second is selecting signatures that are RCD form-specific. 3.1 Exploring signatures with RCD multi-modular elements Signatures composed of genes co-associated with multiple RCD forms revealed prevalent negative correlations with phenotypic traits and frequent tumor overexpression, highlighting coordinated multi-death pathway regulation.

These signatures encompass 20 of 25 different RCD types. Because 81.4% of genes in the inventory are term-based associated with apoptosis, we identified a large number of apoptosis-specific signatures (n = 5,793; 42%) ( Supplementary Dataset S2 We applied a sequential ranking strategy to identify the most representative signatures that prioritized both performance and comprehensive representation. For each unique RCD form, the most informative signature was selected based on the highest rank value, reflecting the overall importance of the signature. Where multiple signatures shared the same ranking value, ties were resolved by considering the highest value in additional variables in the following order: the number of gene components in the signature, TIC, TMC, SMC, and HRC. This ensured that ties were broken systematically based on biological relevance. We verified that each omic feature was included in the final selection to represent all unique omic features comprehensively. If any were missing, the highest-ranked signature for the missing omic feature was added, following the same tie-breaking hierarchy. This method allowed us to generate a ranked list of signatures that reflected their importance and ensured balanced coverage of RCD forms and multi-omic features. The top-ranked signatures by comprehensive RCD type-specific and multi-omic feature representation are presented in Table 2 TABLE 2 Top-ranked RCD type-specific signatures with comprehensive multi-omic representation.

These signatures ( Supplementary Dataset S3 Among the mRNA-specific signatures, 3,864 (38.3%) were associated with anti-tumoral transcriptional profiles, 2,101 (20.8%) with pro-tumoral profiles, and 2,750 (27.2%) with dual microenvironment profiles, reflecting diverse roles in tumor progression. Based on their correlation with immune cell infiltration profiles, the mRNA-specific signatures were categorized as “hot” (n = 273; 2.7%), showing robust immune cell presence, “cold” (n = 781; 7.7%), reflecting minimal immune infiltration, and “variable” (n = 1,540; 15.2%), denoting an intermediate or mixed immune environment.

Given that many gene loci express multiple transcripts through alternative splicing and promoter usage, we hypothesize that specific transcripts retain the correlation observed in the mRNA analysis. This suggests that individual transcript expression offers more precise insights into cancer progression and therapy response. By analyzing these specific transcripts, we aim to identify transcript-specific signatures that could serve as accurate prognostic and diagnostic markers, enhancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and heterogeneity in cancer phenotypes. It is important to note that, for most genes, only a single transcript isoform was consistently detected at quantifiable levels across tumor samples, such that gene-level and transcript-level associations often reflect the same underlying isoform-specific signal. We identified 16,244 transcript-specific signatures, with each signature containing between 1 and 2,052 transcript elements (mean = 5.9; median = 1; Q3 = 3 and P90 = 8) ( Supplementary Dataset S4 Supplementary Dataset S4 Supplementary Figure S3A Supplementary Figure S3B Supplementary Figure S3C Supplementary Figure S3D Supplementary Figure S3E Supplementary Figure S3F Supplementary Figure S3G–J Figure 3K An interesting observation in multi-transcript genes is worth noting; first, the highest number of transcripts per gene that correlated with a phenotype in a cancer type was 19, and was limited to the CD36 ABI3BP TCF4 COL1A1 UMOD Figure 6 COL1A1-and UMOD- FIGURE 6 Sankey diagram depicting the negative correlations of COL1A1 UMOD COL1A1 UMOD COL1A1 UMOD COL1A1 UMOD Supplementary Material S1 Supplementary Figure S12 Sankey diagram illustrating relationships between two genes, COL1A1 and UMOD, and their associated transcripts with various cancer types and conditions. Each gene connects through multiple pathways, represented by colored bars, to different conditions labeled with abbreviations like BLCA, BRCA, and HNSC. The numbers in parentheses denote instances or connections for each condition, visualizing complex interrelations. In contrast, for most multi-transcript RCD genes, the correlations were transcript isoform-specific rather than involving the entire gene locus transcript repertoire. Isoform-specific signatures refer to the unique associations of transcript variants from a single gene locus with distinct clinical and phenotypic outcomes. These signatures enable the identification of specific transcript variants that contribute to cancer progression, prognosis, and therapeutic response.

The miRNA-specific signatures are composed of 1–58 elements (mean = 2.2; median = 1; Q3 = 2; P90 = 4). Of these, 954 (64.9%) contain a single miRNA element. Among the miRNA-specific signatures, 786 (53.5%) correlated with risk or protection in at least one survival metric. Of these, 41 (5.2%) correlated with risk and 16 (2%) with protection in all four metrics of survival ( Supplementary Dataset S5 MIR142 .

The tool can be accessed at URL: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-8etzMPrtt-cancer-regulated-cell-death-data-analyst 4 Discussion 4.1 Holistic approach and context-specific analysis Our multi-optosis model is integrative and holistic, querying 5,913 genes associated with RCD, encompassing 62,090 transcripts, 882 mature miRNAs and 239 cancer-associated proteins and protein modifications (for 193 genes) from 25 distinct RCD forms. The model assumes non-uniformity in the activity and effects of the RCD gene components across different cancer types. Each cancer type is analyzed separately, ensuring that the unique biological contexts and specific molecular mechanisms of each cancer type are thoroughly considered. When querying target genes, we treat the RCD gene inventory as a whole; however, each gene is conceptually tagged to one or more RCD forms. This approach enables us to account for the unique biological contexts and specific molecular mechanisms of each cancer type, thereby ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the associations between RCD gene partners in cancer progression and treatment resistance. By combining these elements, our model uncovers new biomarkers and therapeutic target candidates, opening avenues for more effective cancer treatments. The signature database developed in this study offers a valuable resource for advancing cancer research and treatment through multiple RCD signaling pathways. The signature identifiers are enriched with meaningful information encoded in the nomenclature system, unveiling hidden correlations between multi-omic and phenotypic features. Our rank-scoring system integrates multiple critical factors to assess the overall significance and correlation of each signature, providing preliminary evidence for their prognostic value. This method offers a comprehensive framework for evaluating signatures in cancer research. Our process ensures a balanced and accurate assessment of each signature’s relevance by considering multiple factors, including cancer type, survival metrics, and multi-omic and phenotypic features. The scoring of signatures can facilitate the prioritization of signatures for further investigation, ultimately accelerating the discovery of actionable insights and improving patient outcomes. Currently, no signature identifier system in the literature incorporates multi-omics features as comprehensively as our model does. Most studies on signatures related to RCD and cancer list signatures based on a single type of association ( Wang and Zhang, 2024 Bao et al., 2014 Cai et al., 2020 Chen et al., 2020 Chang et al., 2021 Modarres et al., 2021 Wan et al., 2021 Bian et al., 2022 Li et al., 2022 Yao et al., 2022 Chen L. et al., 2023 Li J. et al., 2024 Zhou X. et al., 2024 However, we recognize the necessity of thorough validation across independent datasets to confirm the reliability of these signatures in clinical settings. Therefore, validation in independent datasets is necessary to establish the clinical applicability of our findings fully. As a discovery-phase analysis encompassing over 44,000 mono-omic signatures, our model prioritized genome-scale screening using univariate Cox models. While this approach enables broad comparability across tumor types and omic layers, we recognize that downstream validation through multivariate modeling—including adjustment for clinical confounders such as age, sex, and stage—is essential to confirm independent prognostic utility. Importantly, implementation of covariate-adjusted survival modeling would entail redefinition of the signature construction logic to ensure that association signals are preserved across clinical strata, and would require computational infrastructure beyond the current framework. We plan to address this in future validation phases. The ability to stratify tumors or patients based on multiple layers of omic regulation (e.g., miRNA and methylation) is particularly valuable for building interpretable prognostic and mechanistic models. We recognize that resampling-based methods, such as bootstrapping or subsampling, are valuable tools for assessing the stability of candidate signatures. Given the exploratory and genome-wide scope of the present analysis—encompassing over 44,000 multi-omic signatures across 33 cancer types—bootstrap-based stability testing was not implemented at this stage due to computational limitations. In this discovery context, the presented top-ranked signatures are demonstrative in nature, selected to illustrate biologically and clinically meaningful associations across omic layers. They are not intended as definitive biomarkers. Systematic prioritization and validation of signature robustness will be the focus of future follow-up analyses. 4.2 Interpretation of multi-omic and phenotype correlations and their signs The signatures identified through specific multi-omic and phenotype correlations are candidate proxies for diagnosis, prognosis, or therapeutic response. Integrating positive and negative correlations into our analysis provides a more comprehensive understanding of the signatures associated with various cancer phenotypes. This thorough approach enables the identification of potential oncogenes and tumor suppressors, paving the way for the development of more tailored and effective cancer treatments. For instance, positive correlations between gene expression and TSM could indicate aggressive cancer phenotypes, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Examples include overexpression of the pluripotency- and apoptosis-related POU5F1 OCT4 SOX2 NANOG Clemente-Perivan et al., 2020 Chiou et al., 2010 Wu et al., 2012 Gutekunst et al., 2013 Upadhyay et al., 2020 Mehrzad et al., 2022 Fang et al., 2023 von Eyben et al., 2023 Zhu and Xu, 2024 Negative correlations provide equally critical insights. A negative correlation between gene CNV and a particular phenotype (i.e., stemness) could indicate genes that suppress aggressive traits or resistance mechanisms. For example, TP53 TP53 Blagih et al., 2020 The link between TP53 TP53 TP53 Identifying genes that are negatively correlated with aggressive tumor features can highlight potential tumor suppressors or biomarkers of less aggressive disease. For example, reduced levels of E-cadherin ( CDH1 Berx and Van Roy, 2001 CDH1 CDH1 Supplementary Dataset S3 CDH1 Supplementary Dataset S1T TP53 Supplementary Dataset S1U Supplementary Figure S9 This negative correlation suggests that higher CDH1 CDH1 CDH1 Berx and Van Roy, 2001 Liu et al., 2017 The presence of solo CDH1 CDH1 CDH1 the role of CDH1 in tumor stability and its potential as a biomarker across variou Thus, in contrast to models restricted to canonical forms of cell death, our 25-form RCD framework preserves the mechanistic and phenotypic diversity of RCD programs, offering greater resolution for identifying tumor-specific vulnerabilities and informing precision oncology strategies. 4.3 Prognostic and diagnostic potential of transcript-specific signatures The transcript-level correlations observed for MAPK10 MAPK10 The distinct roles of MAPK10 MAPK10 The heterogeneity within MAPK10 4.4 Application and translational potential in clinical settings Cancer therapies, including immunotherapy, aim to eliminate cancer cells, with their success often influenced by genes that regulate cell death. Most RCD-associated genes play either a pro-RCD or an anti-RCD role. However, depending on the cancer context, specific RCD-associated genes can promote or inhibit cell death, affecting their suitability as therapeutic targets. It is also known that some genes exhibit dual roles, acting as pro-RCD or anti-RCD agents based on the cancer type. For example, SLC7A11 Fang et al., 2023 Zhu and Xu, 2024 Liu et al., 2020 Supplementary Dataset S1V In cancer treatment, genes that promote RCD are often considered desirable targets because they facilitate the elimination of cancer cells. Conversely, genes that inhibit RCD can contribute to therapy resistance, making them challenging targets in specific cancers. Customizing therapeutic strategies based on the gene’s role in RCD within the specific cancer type can optimize treatment outcomes. Therapies should be aligned with whether a gene’s function is to promote or inhibit cell death, ensuring that the approach enhances the effectiveness of the treatment. The RCD signature database holds significant promise for practical application in preclinical settings, offering valuable tools for patient stratification, personalized treatment plans, prognostic applications, and therapeutic decision-making. These signatures may enable categorizing patients based on their molecular profiles, leading to more tailored and effective treatment strategies. We identified 148 gene signatures with somatic mutations positively correlated with TMB and with immunotherapeutic potential by their association with immune infiltrate profiles in fourteen cancer types ( Supplementary Dataset S1W Figure 9 Zhang et al., 2024 FIGURE 9 Accumulated histogram illustrating the distribution of mutation-specific signatures by meaningful immunotherapy potential across cancer types. The histogram shows the absolute counts of signatures associated with the combined Tumor Microenvironment Contexture (TMC) and Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte contexture (TIC) ranks. Each bar represents a specific cancer type abbreviation (CTAB), and segments within the bars show the distribution of combined ranks categorized as Anti-tumoral & Hot, Dual & Variable, and Pro-tumoral & Cold, among others. The colors correspond to the Combined TMC and TIC ranks, mapped using the Okabe-Ito color palette extended for color-blind friendliness. Data were processed and summarized from multi-omic analyses of mutation-associated signatures with the potential for immunotherapy ( Supplementary Dataset S1W Bar chart showing signature counts for various cancer types, categorized by combined TMC and TIC effects. Each bar is divided into colored sections: anti-tumoral (cold, hot, variable), dual (cold, hot, variable), and pro-tumoral (cold, hot, variable). BRCA has the highest count, with significant dual and pro-tumoral signatures. Different colors represent these categories, aiding visual differentiation. The practical application of our findings lies in stratifying patients by using the signatures as prognostic tools to guide therapeutic decisions based on the cancer’s molecular profile ( Wang D. R. et al., 2022 Wang D. R. et al., 2022 Supplementary Dataset S1L 4.5 Cases of clinically validated RCD multi-omic signatures We identified 879 multi-omic signatures ( Supplementary Dataset S10 Clinicaltrials.gov Dannenfelser et al., 2020 We exemplify the translational impact of the RCD multi-omic signature database with two cases in which members of the multi-optosis signatures have been clinically validated in independent studies. The first case is CD274 Topalian et al., 2012 CD274 Supplementary Dataset S1B The positive correlation between CD274 CD274 Supplementary Figure S10 Supplementary Dataset S1X CD274 Supplementary Dataset S1X TP53 Supplementary Dataset S1Y The identification of CD274 Supplementary Figure S9 Zeng et al., 2023 Chen et al., 2018 Fen et al., 2017 Understanding the diverse roles of CD274 Supplementary Dataset S1B The second case example is the AXL Goyette and Cote, 2022 Supplementary Dataset S1B AXL Supplementary Dataset S3 AXL AXL Supplementary Dataset S3 AXL Supplementary Dataset S1Z TP53 Supplementary Figure S9 Supplementary Dataset S1AA AXL Supplementary Dataset S3 Cross-referencing shows that anti-human monoclonal antibodies targeting the AXL receptor tyrosine kinase inhibit AXL activity effectively, limiting the proliferation and migration of pancreatic cancer cells in vitro in vivo Leconet et al., 2014 AXL Pidkovka et al., 2023 4.6 Validation in PRECOG cancer types While 73 of the 126 mRNA-specific signatures were successfully validated in PRECOG cancer types equivalent to TCGA (Lung adenocarcinoma, Breast cancer, Glioma, Astrocytoma, and Prostate cancer), the validation rate (58.4%) highlights important biological and technical considerations. Several factors may explain why not all signatures showed consistent prognostic value across the independent PRECOG dataset: (1) lack of equivalent TCGA versus Despite these challenges, the validation of 73 signatures in PRECOG underscores their robustness and clinical relevance across independent datasets. The validation rate highlights the complexity of translating gene expression signatures into universally applicable prognostic tools and emphasizes the need for further refinement and context-specific validation in future studies. 4.7 Advanced tools for RCD data analysis Although existing resources provide valuable insights, they have limitations that our model addresses. Four comprehensive and interactive online tools are currently available to support research on RCD in cancer: RCD map  10 Ravel et al., 2020  11 Zhou and Bao, 2020  12 Wang et al., 2018  13 Gadepalli et al., 2021  14 Wang et al., 2024 The RCDdb is the first comprehensive, manually curated database focused on annotating and analyzing the 15 known RCD forms. Despite their comprehensive scopes, FerrDb, HAMdb, XDeathDB and RCDdb do not index outputs by significance, making it challenging to prioritize critical associations, which can hinder effective data utilization and research prioritization. We developed the CancerRCDShiny Cancer Regulated Cell Death Data Analyst 5 Shortcomings and limitations This study has shortcomings and limitations that should be considered when selecting impactful signatures. First, the gene inventory is an ongoing effort, which means some genes reported in various studies may have been omitted since our catalog is primarily based on the NCBI Gene database. Despite our cross-referencing, relying on a single database means the catalog may not comprehensively include all genes associated with RCD forms reported in the literature. Second, using a stringent genome-wide significance threshold ( padj Third, the signatures identified in this study are related to primary tumor samples. Therefore, the impact values of these signatures in recurrent tumors, metastatic tumors, and primary blood-derived cancers were not addressed in this study. Future studies should expand the analysis to these other tumor types to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the signatures’ roles across different cancer stages and contexts. While our model currently includes seven multi-omic layers with broad Pan-Cancer coverage from TCGA, epitranscriptomic modifications such as N 6 6 6 6 Fourth, the corpora of PDFs comprise only free-access full-text files. This limitation may cause a biased dataset, as some relevant studies published in subscription-based journals were not included. Cross-referencing gene targets and gene components of signatures might miss critical information available in those restricted-access publications. Future research should incorporate a broader range of manually curated sources to ensure greater accuracy and depth in the findings. Lastly, although this study identifies biomarkers with potential immunotherapeutic applications, it does not incorporate AI-driven drug discovery or molecular docking methods to identify or validate therapeutic compounds. Such approaches could refine our ability to screen for specific inhibitors or activators targeting RCD-related pathways and enhance the translational relevance of our findings. Future research should aim to integrate AI and docking-based platforms into the CancerRCDShiny 6 Strengths This study offers a comprehensive analysis of 25 forms of RCD in cancer, integrating seven multi-omic layers to identify biologically grounded and clinically relevant signatures. A structured scoring system was implemented to assess signature significance, supported by a PDF-AI-based literature mining strategy for evidence-based validation. The Multi-Optosis framework was intentionally designed to preserve the biological and phenotypic heterogeneity inherent to multi-omic cancer data, rather than reducing the complexity of over 44,000 multi-layered signatures into meta-signatures. This approach enables context-specific interrogation across omic layers, phenotypic attributes, and tumor types. By systematically integrating RCD forms with phenotypic and survival traits across multiple cancers, the model establishes a structured and reproducible platform for biomarker discovery and therapeutic target prioritization. The adoption of a distinct signature nomenclature and the implementation of an interactive Shiny application ( CancerRCDShiny 7 Concluding remarks This study introduces the multi-optosis framework as a novel, integrative approach for investigating RCD mechanisms in cancer. By incorporating 25 distinct forms of RCD, the model transcends traditional, single-pathway analyses, offering a holistic view of the intricate crosstalk between RCD pathways. This framework advances our understanding of cancer progression and treatment resistance while providing a robust platform for identifying genome-wide biomarkers and actionable therapeutic targets. Notably, the multi-optosis model lays the foundation for clinical applications, such as stratifying patients based on RCD-related phenotypes and designing therapies that target multiple RCD pathways for enhanced efficacy. We developed a signature database enriched with a systematic nomenclature that reveals hidden correlations between multi-omic and phenotypic features. Our ranking method ensures a balanced and comprehensive assessment of signature relevance by integrating survival metrics and tumor immune infiltration profiles. This prioritization speeds up the discovery of actionable insights and supports the development of personalized therapeutic strategies to improve patient outcomes. Practical applications of our findings are facilitated by user-friendly tools such as CancerRCDShiny and the Cancer Regulated Cell Death Data Analyst. These tools enable researchers and clinicians to explore RCD multi-omic signatures efficiently, leveraging dynamic visualization and customizable reporting capabilities to enhance data interpretation. By addressing the complexity and heterogeneity of cancer biology, the multi-optosis framework provides a detailed understanding of RCD gene associations in cancer progression and resistance. This integrative approach paves the way for identifying candidate biomarkers and therapeutic targets, driving the development of more effective cancer treatments. Together, the multi-optosis model and its associated tools represent a significant advancement in cancer biomarker discovery and translational research, offering invaluable resources for personalized cancer therapies and improved clinical outcomes.
