With technological advancements, uniportal VATS is now widely employed. However, it still poses a significant risk of moderate to severe acute postoperative pain, potentially leading to chronic post-thoracotomy pain syndrome (PTPS). Therefore, effective postoperative analgesia is crucial. Regional block techniques have gradually gained wide attention. Specifically, paravertebral block (PVB) has been considered the ‘gold standard’ for thoracic analgesia, but its application involves risks due to the challenging anatomy. The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) and intertransverse process block (ITPB) have emerged as alternatives. ESPB showed non-inferiority to PVB in pain management and recovery quality. However, the mechanism of ESPB and its consistency in providing analgesia are not fully understood. ITPB, targeting the ‘posterior space of the superior costotransverse ligament’, offers theoretical advantages in drug diffusion due to its closer proximity to the paravertebral space than ESPB. Despite these advancements, there is a lack of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the comparative efficacy of continuous ESPB and ITPB. This study aims to address these gaps by comparing the analgesic effects and recovery quality of continuous ESPB and ITPB in patients undergoing single-port VATS. Methods and analysis A double-blind RCT will be conducted, enrolling 96 patients electively undergoing single-port thoracoscopic surgery, randomly assigned to either the experimental group (ITPB group) or the control group (ESPB group). After routine surgery, block intervention and continuous pump catheterisation will be performed. The primary assessment will be the numeric rating scale (NRS) scores at 24 hours. Secondary outcomes include NRS at other time points, block effectiveness, Quality of Recovery-15 scores and chronic pain-related scores. Evaluations will be conducted at 0, 2, 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours. Additional assessment indicators include time to first self-administration of pulse analgesia pump, number of self-administrations within 48 hours, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids postoperatively, Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) score, length of hospital stay, incidence of adverse events and complications, patient satisfaction score and assessment of PTPS incidence at 3 months postoperatively using the Brief Pain Inventory short form and the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire. Ethics and dissemination The study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University (No. K44-1, 2024). The results of the study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal with online accessibility. Trial registration number ChiCTR2400082856.

The study employs a parallel, prospective, randomised controlled trial design with both patient and assessor blinding. Limitations of the study include single-centre, lack of comparison against gold-standard techniques and absence of routine imaging confirmation for catheter positioning. Introduction Over the past few decades, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has become increasingly prevalent for the diagnosis and resection of lung cancer, with an adoption rate exceeding 80% in lung cancer surgery. 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 A variety of regional block techniques have emerged as a research hotspot in postoperative analgesia due to their minimal opioid consumption. Among these, paravertebral block (PVB) is recognised for its analgesic efficacy and, alongside epidural analgesia, is considered the ‘gold standard’ of thoracic regional analgesic techniques. 11 12 13 ESPB, introduced by Forero et al 14 15 18 19 14 20 21 25 ITPB targets the ‘SCTL posterior space’ – an anatomical compartment positoned between transverse processes, bounded laterally by the SCTL. The ‘SCTL posterior space’ is mainly occupied by fat and loose connective tissue and is directly connected to the thoracic paravertebral space through the intertransverse ligament structure’s slit pores and the costotransverse space. In addition, during the puncture to the SCTL posterior space, it is necessary to puncture the intertransverse ligament located on the posterior side of the ‘SCTL posterior space’, which is a narrow and thin tissue structure. Although it is not currently possible to confirm its function as a barrier to the SCTL posterior space to hinder the diffusion of the drug, its anatomical position still makes people look forward to its function. 26 27 28 29 ESPB and ITPB are typically employed as single-injection methods, which, while convenient, have the drawback of a limited analgesic duration—rarely exceeding 12 hours and often much less. 30 31 32 33 figure 1 Figure 1 Two patients’ CT results from the pilot study showing that the catheters are positioned between the transverse processes. The remaining CT slice images are displayed in online supplemental file 1 Additionally, there have been no clinical trials to date assessing catheter-based ESPB and ITPB analgesic techniques. Furthermore, the long-term effects of acute analgesia on the development of chronic PTPS at 3 months following uniportal VATS have not been explored in existing research. Study objectives Primary objective To clarify the differences in postoperative analgesic effects between continuous ITPB and continuous ESPB under ultrasound guidance in patients undergoing uniportal thoracoscopic surgery, providing a reference for perioperative pain management strategies in thoracic surgery patients. Secondary objectives To explore the feasibility of intertransverse catheterisation under ultrasound guidance, offering a new option for clinical nerve block techniques. To determine whether the two nerve block strategies influence the incidence and severity of chronic pain syndrome following thoracotomy in patients undergoing uniportal thoracoscopic surgery. Methods and analysis Study design and setting This study is a prospective, double-blinded, randomised, parallel-controlled, single-centre clinical trial. The experiment commenced on 15 April 2024, and it is anticipated to conclude by 30 June 2025, with recruitment taking place at the Department of Thoracic Surgery, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The target population consists of patients electively undergoing partial pulmonary resection via uniportal thoracoscopic surgery who meet our established inclusion criteria. The trial plans to enrol 96 participants, who will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to either continuous ESPB or continuous ITPB groups using block randomisation. Both groups will receive identical anaesthesia induction and maintenance protocols, followed by corresponding nerve blocks and catheterisation postoperatively, ensuring that the nerve block pumps are applied for at least 48 hours. The primary outcome will be the numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain at rest and with coughing 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes include the average number of blocked dermatomes along the anterior axillary line, midclavicular line and scapular line at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively; NRS pain scores at rest and with coughing at 0 (immediately after extubation and able to cooperate), 2, 6, 12 and 48 hours postoperatively; the time to first use of the patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump; the number of PCA uses within 48 hours; the amount of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioid use; Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) score and hospital stay; the incidence of adverse events such as itching and nausea/vomiting; the incidence of complications like pulmonary infection; Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) scores at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively; patient satisfaction scores; the incidence of PTPS at 3 months postoperatively; and pain assessment at 3 months using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-15). Pain outcomes (NRS) and recovery metrics (QoR-15) will also be reported separately for each resection type in supplementary materials to enhance clinical applicability.

Sample size This study is a RCT, with the experimental group receiving continuous ITPB and the control group receiving continuous ESPB. The primary outcome measure is the NRS score at rest and with coughing 24 hours postoperatively. Based on the results of a preliminary trial involving 41 subjects, the average NRS score at rest 24 hours postoperatively in the continuous ESPB group (n1=26) was 3.09±1.01, while in the continuous ITPB group (n2=15), it was 2.31±0.98. Assuming a Type I error rate (α) of 0.05 and a Type II error rate (β) of 0.1, sample size calculations using power analysis and sample size (PASS) 15 software indicated that 37 subjects are needed in each group (N1=37 for the experimental group and N2=37 for the control group). Accounting for dropouts due to loss to follow-up, refusal to participate and other reasons, and calculating a dropout rate of 20%, a minimum of 47 subjects per group is required, totalling 94 patients. To facilitate block randomisation, the study ultimately plans to recruit 96 patients. Randomisation and blinding A total of 96 cases will be randomised using statistical product and service solution (SPSS), employing a block randomisation method with a block length of 4. The 96 subjects will be divided into 24 blocks, and the two trial groups will be represented by A and B. In advance, each block will have different arrangements of A and B corresponding to a number (usually in the order of 1, 2, 3, etc). Subsequently, a set of random numbers will be generated in SPSS, and the arrangement of the blocks will be determined according to the order of these random numbers. Subjects will be assigned their corresponding blocks and group conditions based on the order of enrolment, with their final group assignment represented solely by A or B. The final group distribution will be 48 cases in the continuous ITPB and 48 cases in the continuous ESPB. All random number generation and subject enrolment will be managed by a nurse who will not participate in the subsequent trial processes. This nurse will be unaware of the specific groups represented by A and B. After generating the corresponding group assignments, the nurse will place the group information (A or B) into an opaque, sealed envelope, which will be labelled with the corresponding hospital admission number. All sealed envelopes will be stored in a locked cabinet and opened by the attending anaesthesiologist on the day of surgery, before the block procedure (the attending anaesthesiologist is informed and understands what A or B corresponds to in actual groups), who will then perform the corresponding operation. This anaesthesiologist will not be involved in the study’s group allocation or subsequent data analysis. All other personnel involved in the study, such as surgeons, outcome assessors and data analysts, will remain blinded to the subject’s allocation. Intervention No premedication was administered to the patients. Each enrolled patient underwent standard monitoring, bispectral index (BIS) monitoring and intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring. The anaesthesia induction process involves pre-oxygenation followed by intravenous administration of ciprofol (0.3–0.5 mg·kg −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 ITPB group Postoperatively, we placed participants with the operative side up. A linear high-frequency or convex low-frequency ultrasound probe (Mindray TE10T, Bio-Medical Electronics, Shenzhen, China) is set to a scanning depth of approximately 5 cm and adjusted to the cephalocaudal direction. The ultrasound probe is first used to identify the spinous process of the seventh cervical vertebra by surface marking and palpation and then swept downward to the transverse process of T1 and laterally to identify the first rib. The probe is then placed parallel to the spinous processes in a para-sagittal position at the intersection of the neck root and shoulder, and a dynamic cephalocaudal scan is performed to re-identify the first rib. After confirming the first rib, the probe is gradually swept from superior to inferior to count the ribs until the target segment is identified (the target segment is where the surgeon actually performs the chest wall incision). Once the target segment is confirmed, the probe is scanned from lateral to medial, slightly adjusting the direction of the probe to fully identify the bases of the superior and inferior transverse processes and to visualise the SCTL on the ultrasound image. Under full sterile precautions, an 18G epidural needle is inserted from cephalic to caudal under ultrasound guidance. The needle is observed in the ultrasound image as it penetrates the intertransverse ligament and reaches the posterior space of the SCTL ( figure 2 Figure 2 Ultrasound images of ITPB and ESPB. ES, erector spinae; ESPB, erector spinae plane block; ITPB, intertransverse process block; SCTL, superior costotransverse ligament; TP, transverse process; TPVS, thoracic paravertebral space. ESPB group Postoperatively, patients are positioned identically, and ultrasonography is used with the same method described above to localise the ribs of the target segment, followed by a medial sweep and slight adjustment of the probe to fully identify the superior and inferior transverse processes, as well as the muscle layers of the trapezius, rhomboid and erector spinae muscles above them. Under strict aseptic precautions, an 18G epidural needle is inserted from the head side to the tail side under ultrasound guidance, and the needle’s position deep to the erector spinae muscle is confirmed on the ultrasound image ( figure 2 online supplemental file 3 For both groups, the catheter insertion site is covered with a film dressing to conceal the approach used. The catheter is connected to a PCA pump (Renxian Medical), and the pump is filled with a solution made from 500 mg of 1.0% ropivacaine and 200 mL of 0.90% sodium chloride, totalling 250 mL. The parameters are set as follows: single dose: 12.0 mL, initial dose: 0 mL, maximum dose: 25 mL·h −1 Outcome measurement The physician specifically responsible for follow-up will assess all outcome measures at postoperative hours 0 (immediately after extubation and able to cooperate), 2, 6, 12, 24, 48 and during the follow-up period at 3 months post-surgery. The follow-up assessments within 48 hours will be conducted directly at the bedside, while the 3-month follow-up will be performed through questionnaires or telephone interviews. All data will be securely stored in statistical software and analysed collectively after the completion of the trial (refer to online supplemental file 5 Primary outcome NRS at rest and under cough at 24 hours postoperatively. Postoperative pain assessment 24 hours after surgery will be conducted using the NRS, which quantifies the level of pain on a continuous numerical scale ranging from 0 to 10. Patients will select a number from the 11 possible ratings (0–10) that corresponds to their perceived pain level: no pain (0), mild pain (1–3), moderate pain (4–6) and severe pain (7–10). Secondary outcome Number of anaesthetised dermatomes in the anterior axillary line, midclavicular line and midscapular line. Dermatomal mapping at 24 hours postoperatively was strategically chosen to align with four critical perioperative characteristics: the peak inflammatory phase following uniportal VATS, where surgical trauma potentiates nociceptive sensitisation via maximal cytokine release (eg, interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α) at 18–24 hours; 6 10 30 5 The measurement protocol is as follows: at 24 and 48 hours postoperatively, the number of dermatomes with anaesthesia-induced cold sensation block will be assessed using cotton swabs soaked in alcohol. Starting from the T4 dermatome along the midclavicular line, anterior axillary line and scapular line, the test will proceed cranially, assessing each dermatome individually, and then caudally to determine the extent of the block. If necessary, dermatomes of the cervical and high thoracic spine will be tested in the upper limbs and neck and lumbar dermatomes in the lower limbs. Skin segments where patients perceive less or no sensation to the cold stimulus compared with the contralateral side are recorded as anaesthetised skin segments. Data obtained from the anaesthetised skin segments will be documented in a specific form. NRS at rest and under cough at 0, 2, 6, 12 and 48 hours postoperatively. Measured in the same way as the primary outcome. Time to first pulse analgesic pump self-administration and number of analgesic pump self-administrations in 48 hours. On return to the ward after surgery, follow-up personnel will instruct the patient on how to operate the PCA pump and provide a detailed explanation to the patient and their family about the functioning of the PCA pump. The physician in charge of the follow-up visit logs into REHN Mobile ward-round App (Ai-PCA Analgesic Pump System, Rehn Medtech, Jiangsu, China) to access the patient’s analgesic pump usage. Postoperative non-steroidal drug and opioid use. Postoperatively, patients will have NRS scores assessed at multiple time points. If a patient has an NRS score of ≥4 at these time points or at any other time while at rest, the thoracic surgeon involved in the study will promptly administer additional NSAIDs such as flurbiprofen axetil, parecoxib sodium or diclofenac sodium lidocaine injection based on the patient’s condition. If the patient’s pain is not relieved after using the aforementioned NSAIDs, then opioid drugs such as morphine will be used for rescue analgesia. The number of patients requiring rescue analgesia will be tallied, and the amount of NSAIDs and opioid drugs used before discharge will be recorded (after conversion to morphine equivalents for comparison). Hospitalisation CCI score and length of stay. Dedicated follow-up personnel will assess postoperative complications using medical records and patient conditions during hospitalisation and will calculate the CCI R R 35 R https://www.assessurgery.com/about_cci-calculator/ Incidence of adverse events and complications. Postoperatively, patients were evaluated and counted for adverse symptoms and postoperative complications. These adverse events include itching, hypotension, nausea, vomiting, arrhythmias and fever. We set the following recording thresholds based on the CTCAE v.5.0 criteria: 36 Postoperative Quality of Recovery QoR-15 score. Postoperative recovery quality will be assessed by administering the QoR-15 questionnaire at 24 and 48 hours after surgery. 37 38 Patient Satisfaction Score. The patients’ recovery status and satisfaction with the overall postoperative pain management can be reflected through a satisfaction score, which is primarily divided into the following four levels: four points=satisfied, three points=basically satisfied, two points=slightly dissatisfied and one point=dissatisfied. Patients independently complete the scoring without interference from doctors, and the results are archived. Incidence of PTPS and the degree of pain at three months postoperatively. The follow-up with patients at 3 months postoperatively will primarily be conducted through WeChat questionnaires or telephone contact by dedicated follow-up staff. The main content of the follow-up will inquire about any recurrent pain or other discomforts at the wound site within 3 months following discharge and will assess the degree of pain and its impact on life using the BPI and SF-15. The BPI can quickly evaluate the intensity of pain (scored from 0 to 10) and the interference of pain (scored from 0 to 10) on the quality of life. 39 40 Patient and public involvement There will be no patient or public involvement in the conduct, reporting or dissemination of this research. Data management All patient data collected will be done so in strict accordance with ethical requirements for collection and storage. The data will initially be gathered manually and subsequently transcribed into Microsoft Excel by two data entry personnel who are blinded to the group assignments. Data collected from the clinical site, including all video footage of the block, will be securely stored in the anaesthesia department of the site hospital, on a password-protected desktop computer located in a locked office, accessible only to investigators assigned to data entry, processing and analysis. Data will be directly extracted from the original documents into de-identified paper case report forms (CRFs) and then entered into electronic CRFs. The original hard copies of the CRFs will be stored in a locked cabinet/office in accordance with local and national regulations, with access restricted to authorised personnel only. Statistical analysis All statistical tests will be conducted by the staff responsible for data collection. All results will use two-tailed tests, and a p value less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Descriptive statistics for quantitative variables will include mean, SD and median; for categorical variables, the count and percentage of each category will be described. Comparisons between the two groups for general conditions will be analysed using appropriate methods based on the type of indicator: continuous data will be compared using t-tests or Mann–Whitney U tests, categorical data using χ 2 Discussion The present single-centre RCT aims to investigate the efficacy of ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane catheter and intertransverse process catheter on postoperative pain relief and recovery quality in patients following single-port thoracoscopic surgery under general anaesthesia. Based on the current search findings, this experiment is the first article to compare these two continuous block techniques, which has a certain degree of innovation. Additionally, as an innovative blocking method, ITPB has only been applied in a limited number of foreign literature studies in recent years, mainly focusing on case reports and lacking high-quality RCT studies. The potential advantages of ITPB over ESPB lie in its closer proximity to the target paravertebral space and its direct connection through the intertransverse ligament. The posterior intertransverse ligament may serve as a barrier to reduce posterior diffusion, allowing for better anterior spread and potentially more effective analgesia. While the cadaver research has shown promise, the translation of these findings into clinical practice requires further investigation, as the current lack of clinical studies limits the applicability of these results. Current literature indicates that the integration of ERAS protocols in thoracic surgical procedures could result in significant improvements across various outcomes, including enhanced functional recovery, reduced hospital stay, decreased opioid consumption, fewer complications and lowered readmission rates. 41 In our study’s outcome measures, we have included both the blocked dermatome and the patients’ own NRS pain scores. On one hand, we hope to objectively verify whether patients have a significant anterior chest wall block and whether catheter techniques meet the sufficient perioperative analgesic requirements through the 24 and 48-hour block tests. On the other hand, we use the patients’ self-reported pain scores to evaluate the quality of postoperative analgesia from the patients’ subjective experience. Additionally, in studies concerning chronic pain syndrome after thoracotomy, poor control of acute pain is a significant cause of its occurrence. Therefore, we have designed a 3-month follow-up for chronic pain to explore the association between the quality of acute pain control and the development of long-term chronic pain. This experiment was designed with a double-blind approach, where neither the surgical team, follow-up personnel, nor the patients were actually aware of the group assignments, except for the physicians performing the anaesthesia and postoperative nerve blocks. This aspect enhances the credibility of the entire study. Our study has several limitations. First, this research was conducted solely at a single tertiary hospital. Consequently, our findings may be influenced by institution-specific practices (eg, standardised anaesthesia protocols and surgical expertise). This potentially limits the generalisability of the results to diverse healthcare settings. Second, the study exclusively compared ESPB and ITPB without including PVB—the established gold standard for thoracic analgesia. This omission precludes direct efficacy benchmarking against the most validated reference technique, thereby hindering comprehensive clinical interpretation of ITPB’s relative value. Third, catheter positions were not systematically confirmed via postoperative imaging (eg, CT or ultrasound) and relied instead on procedural ultrasound guidance and bolus test observations. Although preliminary CT data from two pilot cases showed appropriate catheter placement, the absence of routine imaging confirmation introduces uncertainty regarding potential catheter displacement or suboptimal drug dispersion in the study cohort. Additionally, strict exclusion criteria (eg, history of chronic pain and body mass index>30 kg/m²) may limit sample representativeness and reduce applicability to complex patient populations.
