The potential carcinogenic role of p48, a long isoform of ErbB3-binding protein 1 (Ebp1), is well established in other cancers, but its impact on NSCLC remains unconfirmed. Patients and Methods Several databases were utilized to compare Ebp1 expression in normal lung and NSCLC. Immunohistochemical staining was employed to identify Ebp1 expression in both types of tissue. The TCGA database assessed Ebp1 expression in NSCLC and its impact on overall survival. Ebp1 expression was knocked down in A549 and PC9 cells, and the impact of Ebp1 on the cell growth was tested by CCK-8, plate clone colony, soft agar colony generation assay, and cell cycle assays. Scratch, transwell, and in vivo were also used to confirm the effects of Ebp1 on Lung cancer cells migration, invasion. Western blot detection of EMT and signal pathway-related proteins. Results This study revealed that NSCLC had significantly higher levels of Ebp1 p48 expression. We discovered a correlation between Ebp1 p48 expression and pathological grade, lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, and overall survival (OS) using NSCLC tissue microarrays. In vitro and in vivo tumor cell growth, migration, invasion, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, and cell proliferation are all markedly suppressed when Ebp1 p48 is knocked down in NSCLC cells. Moreover, PI3K and Akt phosphorylation levels were decreased by Ebp1 p48 knockdown. Conclusion According to these findings, Ebp1 p48 stimulated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in NSCLC, which in turn facilitated invasion, migration, and proliferation. As a result, in NSCLC, Ebp1 p48 may be a prospective therapeutic target as well as a predictive biomarker.

It is a progressive disease and profound threat to human health and quality of life, 1 2 Ebp1, a multifaceted eukaryotic protein that is widely expressed and highly conserved, contains 394 amino acid residues, is the receptor-binding protein for ErbB3. Two isoforms of ebp1 were produced by alternative splicing: the full-length p48 form and the shortened p42 form. p48 is mainly distributed in cytoplasm and nucleus. It can inhibit cell apoptosis and is a tumor promoter. But as a tumor suppressor, p42 is mostly found in the cytoplasm and encourages cell differentiation. 3 4 5 6 7 This study uncovers the pro-tumor effect of Ebp1 p48 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its molecular mechanism. Clinical analysis showed upregulation of Ebp1 p48 in NSCLC tissues, linked to poor prognosis, suggesting its role in tumor progression. Gene knockdown experiments confirmed that inhibiting Ebp1 p48 reduced cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo, highlighting it as a key regulator of NSCLC malignancy. Mechanistically, Ebp1 p48 promotes tumor progression via activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, enhancing cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance. Additionally, Ebp1 p48 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), contributing to metastasis. These findings provide new insights into NSCLC metastasis and suggest Ebp1 p48 as a potential target for early diagnosis and therapy. Materials and Methods Tissue Acquisition NSCLC tissue chip (HLugA180Su06) was purchased from Shanghai Outdo Biotech Co., Itd. Among them were 86 matched neighboring non-tumor tissues and 94 NSCLC samples. Ages, genders, tumor site, tumor size, pathological grade, clinical stage, survival, and lymph node metastases are among the data contained in NSCLC tissue chips. Cell Culture The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) provided a range of cell lines, including A549, H522, PC9, H650, and 16HBE. Above cell lines in the experiments were validated and were negative for mycoplasma. The ATCC suggested that cells be grown in DMEM medium, kept at 37°C in a humidified environment with 5% CO2, and supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% streptomycin, and penicillin. Reagents and Antibodies DMEM medium and FBS were purchased from Gibco (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Marker: Thermo Fisher 26616; ECM kit: Boster ek1002. The Antibodies we use in Western blotting are as follows: Ebp1 (N-terminus): Millipore SAB1402863; E-cadherin: Cell Signaling #3195; N-cadherin: Cell Signaling #13116; Vimentin: Cell Signaling #5741; Snail: Cell Signaling #3879; Slug: Cell Signaling #9585; Akt: Santa Cruz sc-5298; p-Akt (Thr 308): Santa Cruz sc-271966; p-Akt (Ser 473): Santa Cruz sc-293125; PI3K: Abcam ab247253; p-PI3K: MCE HY-P81211; β-actin: Affinity Biosciences #AF7018; Cell Viability Assay Two cell lines, A549 and PC9, were injected into 96-well plates, with 5×10 3 Immunohistochemical Staining and Hematoxylin-Eosin Staining Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was implemented on tissue microarray samples and nude mouse tumors. As directed by the manufacturer (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), anti-Ebp1 p48 (1:100), anti-Ki67 (1:100), and anti-cyclinD1 (1:100) were examined using a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and a secondary biotinylated antibody. After that, haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) was used to stain the xenograft tumor. Western Blot Analyses The cells were lysed using RIPA, and the protein level was then determined using the BCA protein assay kit. The proteins were separated using 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the transfer buffer. After blocking the membranes with 5% skim milk for two hours at room temperature, they were vigorously shaken and incubated once more for the whole night at 4°C, using antibodies against Ebp1 p48, snail, slug, vitementin, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and β-actin. Following this, following three thorough membrane washes using 1×Tris-Buffered Saline and Tween 20 (TBST), for one hour at room temperature, they were treated with the goat anti-rabbit/mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:5000) coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The ECL kit procedure was followed when performing the detection. Lentivirus shRNA Transfection The Ebp1 short hairpin (sh) RNA lentivirus and the standard lentivirus were procured from Shanghai Jikai Gene Chem Co., Ltd. The information of the primers was as follows: PA2G4: uptream:5’-CAGGAGCAAACTATCGCTGAG-3’, downtream:5’-GGACCGAAGTACCCTGTTGG-3. Following the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma Aldrich), the A549 and PC9 cells were transfected using an Invitrogen Lipofectamine 3000 kit. The cells were arranged in a 6-well plate with 1.5×105 cells per well, incubated for 24 hours, and then exposed to infectious lentiviral supernatant and a medium containing 8 µg/mL of hexadimethrine bromide at a 1:1 ratio. Following a week of puromycin selection (at concentrations of 2µg/mL, after conducting a test that depended on the dosage of the substance, the cells were broken down and the technique of Western blotting was employed to show the inhibition of Ebp1. Wound Healing Assay In 24-well plates, cells were sown and left to adhere for the entire night. To eliminate the nonadherent cells, use a 200 μL pipette tip and scrape the area before washing it with PBS. Using an inverted microscope, cell migration to the wound area was seen at 0 and 48 hours. Transwell Assays The activity of cell invasion was assessed using the Transwell Invasion Assay. With free serum medium, cell lines were injected into the top chamber. After being added to the lower chamber, the medium (10% FBS, Invitrogen) served as a chemoattractant. For 48 hours, the cell lines were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 to induce invasion. Later, the cells that had successfully invaded the lower surface of the filter were temporarily immobilized for 30 minutes through exposure to 70% ethanol. After that, the cell lines were stained for ten minutes with crystal violet (0.1%). Five randomly selected visual regions were examined under an inverted microscope to count the cells that went to the bottom. There were three iterations of the experiment. Colony Formation Assay Six-well plates were loaded with 1×10 3 Cell Cycle Analysis Flow cytometry was used to examine the cell cycle of A549 and PC9 cell lines. Trypsin digestion was employed to prepare the cell suspension. The cells were washed twice with pre-chilled PBS, followed by centrifugation and removal of the supernatant. The cells were then resuspended by pipetting to achieve a fully suspended state. Subsequently, the A549 and PC9 cell suspensions were added to pre-chilled anhydrous ethanol and fixed at 4°C for 20 hours. After fixation, the cells were centrifuged to remove the ethanol, resuspended, and stained with PI solution. The mixture was gently vortexed with a pipette and incubated in the dark for 30 minutes. After completion, the samples were analyzed using a flow cytometer, and the data were saved for subsequent processing. In vivo Experiments Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) provided ten 4-week-old female nude mice. The institutional guidelines for the treatment and use of laboratory animals at Yanbian University School of Medicine were adhered to, and all animals were housed in designated pathogen-free housing with enough of food and water. The Yanbian University Ethics Committee gave its approval to the protocols for the use and care of animals. 100 microliters of a solution, comprising 5 million PC9 cells (shNC; shEbp1) in suspension with PBS and matrigel, was implanted on the sides of female nude mice. The tumors were implanted in paraffin after being treated with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the mice were euthanized on day 56. After being anesthetized with an intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital at a dosage of 70 mg/kg body weight, all mice were killed by cervical dislocation. The cessation of breathing and heartbeat for more than five minutes verified death. Every technique was used in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations. The ARRIVE criteria were followed in this investigation. The institutional review board gave its approval to the protocol and the informed consent statement. The Yanbian University Ethics Committee gave their approval to the trial. Statistical Analysis A correlation study was conducted using the Pearson chi-square test. The researchers utilized the Kaplan-Meier method to assess overall survival (OS) and employed the Log rank test to make comparisons. For the multivariate analysis, they utilized the Cox proportional hazards model. Analyze each factor’s HR and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The data is presented using the mean ± standard deviation format. Group differences were examined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). When P < 0.05, a difference was considered significant. To do the statistical analysis, SPSS 25.0 and GraphPad Prism 8.0 were utilized. Results Expression of Ebp1 p48 in NSCLC Data obtained from the Oncomine database (included 58 normal lung tissues and 58 lung adenocarcinoma of Selamat data sets; included 30 normal lung tissues and 527 lung adenocarcinoma of Su data sets) showed that Ebp1 mRNA is overexpressed in NSCLC ( Figure 1A B Figure 1C Figure 1D Figure 1 The expression of Ebp1 p48 is upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cells and closely related with patient prognoses. ( A B C D E F Ebp1 p48 Expression Is Related with Unfavorable Clinicopathological Features and Poor Prognosis in NSCLC In order to investigate Ebp1’s potential therapeutic use in non-small cell lung cancer, we conducted an analysis of Ebp1 expression via IHC labeling utilizing tissue microarray (TMA) in tissue samples obtained from 94 patients with primary human NSCLC. 64 samples from patients with non-small cell lung cancer tested positive for Ebp1 p48, as shown in Table 1 Table 2 Table 1 Immunohistochemistry Analysis of Ebp1 Expression in NSCLC Ebp1 Expression (%) Group N Low High P Normal 86 65(75.6%) 21(24.4%) P Cancer 94 30(31.9%) 64(68.1%) Table 2 Comparison of Clinicopathologic Characteristics According to the Ebp1 Expression in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Variable n Ebp1 (-) n(%) Ebp1 (+) n(%) X 2 P Age(years) 0.047 0.828 <65 61 19(31.1) 42(68.9) ≥65 33 11(33.3) 22(66.7) Sex 0.001 0.970 Male 53 17(32.1) 36(67.9) Female 41 13(31.7) 28(68.3) Tumor location 0.234 0.628 Left 41 12(29.3) 29(70.7) Right 53 18(34.0) 35(66.0) Tumor size 0.287 0.592 <3 35 10(28.6) 25(71.4) ≥3 59 20(33.9) 39(66.1) Grade 5.304 0.021 G1-2 63 25(39.7) 38(60.3) G3 31 5(16.1) 26(83.9) Clinical stage 5.776 0.016 I 31 15(48.4) 16(51.6) II~IV 63 15(23.8) 48(76.2) Lymph node metastasis 10,445 0.001 Negative 43 21(48.8) 22(51.2) Positive 51 9(17.6) 42(82.4) A worse prognosis for individuals with non-small cell lung cancer was associated with high expression of Ebp1 mRNA, according to an analysis of the survival curve in the TCGA database ( Figure 1E Figure 1F Table 3 Table 3 Table 3 Cox Proportional Risk Regression Model Was Used to Analyze the Influencing Factors of Survival of 94 Patients with NSCLS Variable HR 95% CI P Gender 1.080 0.668–1.768 0.748 Age, Years 0.920 0.593–1.428 0.705 Tumor location 0.948 0.592–1.516 0.826 Tumor size(cm) 0.925 0.579–1.475 0.747 Histological grade 0.392 0.240–0.658 0.002* TNM Clinical stage 0.541 0.330–0.894 0.018* LN metastasis 0.520 0.328–0.838 0.008** Ebp1 0.196 0.101–0.365 0.0004** Multivariate Histological grade 0.495 0.272–0.893 0.018* TNM Clinical stage 0.825 0.384–1.776 0.618 LN metastasis 0.913 0.405–2.052 0.825 Ebp1 0.335 0.142–0.785 0.010* Notes P P Abbreviation Ebp1 p48 Knockdown Suppresses Proliferation in NSCLC Cells Ebp1 p48 expression was elevated in A549 and PC9 cells, as seen in Figure 1D Figure 2A Figure 2B Figure 2C D Figure 2E F Figure 2 Knockdown of Ebp1 p48 suppresses the growth and proliferation of NSCLC cells. ( A B C D E F Knockout of Ebp1 p48 Can Inhibit the Migration and Invasion of NSCLC Cells and Change the Expression of EMT-Related Proteins Through scratch studies, we discovered that Ebp1 p48 knockdown may dramatically decrease cell migratory capacity, which allows us to better understand the biological roles of Ebp1 p48 in NSCLC cell migration and invasion ( Figure 3A B Figure 3C D Figure 3E F Figure 3 Knockdown of Ebp1 p48 suppresses the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. ( A B C D E F Ebp1 p48 Expression Activates the PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway in NSCLC We looked into the relationship between Ebp1 p48 expression and PI3K/Akt pathway activity in NSCLC to see if it is connected to the signaling pathway. We used shRNA to knock down p48-Ebp1 and perifosine (1.5μM) and LY294002 (2.5μM) to block the PI3K/Akt pathway in A549 and PC9 cells. Ebp1 p48 knockdown A549 and PC9 cells showed decreased levels of phosphorylated PI3K-p110 and Akt (Thr308 and Ser473). However, the results showed that, in comparison to the control group, there were no discernible differences in the expression of total PI3K and total Akt ( Figure 4A B Figure 4 Ebp1 p48 knockdown reduced the phosphorylation level of PI3K/Akt in NSCLC cells. ( A B Knockdown of Ebp1 p48 Attenuates Tumor Growth in Vivo To verify Ebp1 p48’s role in in vivo carcinogenesis, we injected PC9 sh-NC and PC9 sh-ebp1 p48 cells subcutaneously into the shoulders of nude mice. After 28 days, the sh-NC group’s tumors were noticeably bigger and more massive than those in the sh-EBP1 p48 group ( Figure 5A–C Figure 5D E Figure 5 Ebp1 p48 knockdown suppresses PC9 cell tumorigenesis in vivo. ( A B C D E Discussion The opposite effect of the two subtypes of Ebp1 in cancer has become an attractive subject of investigation in recent years. 8–10 11 12 13 7 14 15 Through the examination of NSCLC tissue microarrays, we observed a strong correlation between poor patient prognosis and high expression of Ebp1 p48, indicating its significant role in NSCLC development. Our research demonstrated that inhibiting Ebp1 p48 notably decreased NSCLC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. Further cell cycle analysis revealed that Ebp1 p48 enhances NSCLC cell proliferation by regulating the cell cycle. EMT has been implicated in tumor invasion and metastasis. 16 17 18 19 20 21 In summary, we discovered that Ebp1 p48 was necessary for the invasion, migration, and proliferation of NSCLC cells. Ebp1 p48 may stimulate EMT and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to aid NSCLC cells in invasion, migration, and multiplication. Given the central role of Ebp1 p48 in the progression of NSCLC, our findings suggest that it holds significant promise as both a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target. Clinically, measuring Ebp1 p48 expression could help identify high-risk patients with aggressive forms of NSCLC, providing an opportunity for earlier and more personalized interventions. Additionally, targeting Ebp1 p48 directly or through small molecules or RNA-based therapies could offer new avenues for treating NSCLC, particularly in patients with advanced disease or those resistant to conventional therapies. Furthermore, clinical trials assessing the therapeutic potential of Ebp1 p48 inhibitors or modulators will be essential to evaluate their efficacy in real-world scenarios. The development of diagnostic tools based on Ebp1 p48 expression could also play a key role in the early detection and prognosis of NSCLC, ultimately guiding more effective and individualized treatment plans. Therefore, Ebp1 p48 stands out not only as a critical factor in NSCLC biology but also as a promising target for future therapeutic advancements, potentially transforming the landscape of NSCLC treatment and improving patient survival rates. Conclusion Ebp1 p48 plays a key role in the proliferation, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells, likely through EMT and the PI3K/Akt pathway. It may serve as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for NSCLC. Future studies will focus on its interactions with other tumor-driving factors and explore small molecule inhibitors or RNA therapies targeting Ebp1 p48 to curb metastasis and improve prognosis. Additionally, we will examine its role in the tumor microenvironment and immune regulation. Clinically, Ebp1 p48 could be a dual tool for early NSCLC diagnosis and treatment, identifying high-risk patients for early intervention and personalized strategies.
