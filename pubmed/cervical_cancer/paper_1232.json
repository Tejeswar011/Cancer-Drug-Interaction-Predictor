Introduction The Magnolia genus has a longstanding role in traditional Asian medicine. Different Magnolia species, such as M. officinalis M. stellata M. grandiflora M. coco, 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Honokiol, magnolol, 4-O-methylhonokiol, and obovatol are considered major bioactive constituents of Magnolia stem bark, belonging to the phenylpropanoid group, specifically neolignanes, which are notable for their antimicrobial and anticancer properties. Different studies report that the antiproliferative activity of Magnolia extracts is also mainly due to the presence of other secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and polyphenols [ 10 11 12 13 M. officinalis 14 M. denudata 15 16 17 In Mexico, different species of Magnolia have been reported in recent years (2017) . M. alejandrae 18 19 M. alejandrae 20 M. alejandrae 21 The objective in this study was to determine the secondary metabolite profile in the fruit, leaves, and bark of M. alejandrae 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Collection and Identification of Plant Material M. alejandrae w v M. alejandrae 22 2.2. Extraction Procedure The secondary metabolites were extracted from pulverized plant parts using four methods (maceration, Soxhlet, reflux, and ultrasound) and three solvents dichloromethane, ethanol, and water (Sigma Aldrich, Toluca, Mexico) in triplicate. Two grams of plant material were used in all extraction methods. Maceration: 50 mL of solvent was added to the plant material and stored for 8 days at room temperature in the dark. Soxhlet: 100 mL of solvent was added and placed in the Soxhlet apparatus for 6 h. Reflux: 50 mL of solvent was added to the plant material and subjected to reflux for 5 h. Ultrasound: 12 mL of solvent was used and subjected to a Brasonic ® 2.3. Analysis by Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC-MS) The Sigma-Aldrich (Toluca, Mexico) standards (honokiol and magnolol) at concentrations of 0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 mg/mL in ethanol were vortexed for 1 min and then filtered through a 0.45 μm membrane and transferred to standard vials for analysis. Instrumentation and methods: UPLC-MS analysis was performed using liquid chromatography equipment with an ACQUITY UPLC system coupled to a Waters QDa mass detector (Milford, MA, USA) in positive ion mode. An ACQUITY UPLC CORTECS C18 column was used as a 1.6 μm, 3.0 mm × 100 mm column (Milford, MA, USA). Column and autosampler temperatures of 40 and 15 °C were used, respectively. Elution was achieved with 0.1% formic acid (Sigma Aldrich, Toluca, Mexico) in water (Phase A) and acetonitrile (Sigma Aldrich, Toluca, Mexico) (Phase B). The composition of solvents over time was as follows: initial A: 10%, B: 90%; at 5 min, reduced A: 25%, B: 75%; changing at 10 min, A: 10%, B: 90% with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min and a run time of 15 min. Sample preparation: 5 μL of each extract (1 mg of crude extract/mL) was injected. The identity assignment of the detected secondary metabolites in M. alejandre Magnolia 2.4. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions Cancer cell lines HeLa, U373, A549, and PC3 were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) high glucose (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biowest, Riverside, MO, USA), 100, 000 U/L penicillin, 100 mg/L streptomycin, 250 µg/L amphotericin (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA), 110 μg/L sodium pyruvate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 3.7 g/L sodium bicarbonate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), and 6 g/L HEPES (Sigma St. Louis, MO, USA), pH = 7.2. MCF-7 was cultured in a Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100,000 U/L penicillin, 100 mg/L streptomycin (Sigma), 10 µg/mL insulin (Sigma), and 3.7 g/L sodium bicarbonate, pH = 7.2. MCF-10A was cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 5% horse serum (Biowest, Riverside, MO, USA), 0.5 µg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 20 ng/mL EGF (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 100 ng/mL cholera toxin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), 10 µg/mL insulin, 100,000 U/L penicillin, and 100 mg/L streptomycin, pH = 7.2. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 Each cell line was seeded (5 × 10 5 6 2.5.

Extraction Efficiency Initially, thirty-six extracts of fruit, leaf, and bark from M. alejandre Figure 1 3.2. Chromatographic Parameters of Magnolol and Honokiol by UPLC-MS Initially, the honokiol and magnolol standards were analyzed individually and in proportion (1:1) by UPLC-MS to identify their molecular weight, fragmentation pattern, and retention time ( Table 1 Supplementary Material, Graphics S1 and S2 Table 1 3.3. Comparative Analysis of Secondary Metabolites from M. alejandre The analysis of the secondary metabolites in the thirty-six extracts from M. alejandre Supplementary Material, Table S1 Table 2 Figure 2 Table 2 Additionally, in the thirty-six extracts from M. alejandre Supplementary Material, Table S2 Magnolia Table 3 3.4. Antiproliferative Evaluation of M. alejandrae Extracts Against Cancer Cell Lines In the present study, the antiproliferative activity of nine extracts with high yields (Soxhlet method) from M. alejandrae Table 4 50 Table 4 Table 4 M. alejandrae 50 Finally, the selectivity index (SI) of the four extracts with antiproliferative activity and the positive controls was determined. The results are shown in Table 5 4. Discussion The isolation and identification of the secondary metabolites with biological activities is very important in the development of new drugs. However, the concentration of these secondary metabolites may vary depending on the part of the plant (bark, leaves, flowers, or roots), matrix, solvent, temperature, pressure, and time used. Additionally, the methods of extraction used, such as maceration, Soxhlet extraction, and ultrasound- or microwave-assisted, may influence the concentration of these secondary metabolites [ 22 23 16 24 25 In this study, extracts of M. alejandrae 26 27 28 Additionally, a solvent system of increasing polarity (dichloromethane, ethanol, and water) was also used to determine the kind of secondary metabolites extracted according to their polarity. In this study, the highest yield was obtained in the following order of solvent: water, ethanol, and dichloromethane. However, in some methods, ethanol and dichloromethane had similar yields. Commonly, the bark and flowers of the Magnolia genus have been reported with a high presence of secondary metabolites [ 12 13 14 According to previous reports, the genus Magnolia contains more than eight hundred secondary metabolites primarily comprising alkaloids, terpenes, and phenols with diverse biological activities [ 29 30 Analyzing the secondary metabolite profile of the extracts obtained, three hundred and twelve molecules were identified, as previously reported in the PubChem database. Magnone A, 2,3,5,8-tetramethyldecane, magnolialide, salicifoliol, pinoresinol, and yangambin were detected more frequently. Magnone A and pinoresinol are found in greater amounts in bark; 2,3,5,8-tetra-methyldecane, magnolialide, and salicifoliol are found more frequently in fruit; and yangambin is found in all three parts but in greater amounts in bark. Surprisingly, honokiol and magnolol were not detected in any extract. These results may be due to the LOD and LOQ obtained in the chromatographic method. Therefore, it will be necessary to analyze the extracts using a more sensitive analytical technique to confirm the absence or presence of both secondary metabolites in M. alejandrae M. officinalis M. obovata 31 Supplementary Material, Table S3 and Figures S3–S12 Supplementary Material, Figures S1 and S2 After, the nine extracts obtained with the highest yield using the Soxhlet conventional method were evaluated against five different cancer cell lines and one healthy cell line. M. alejandrae 50 The reference compounds magnolol and honokiol also caused antiproliferative activity against the five cancer cell lines with similar or equal values of IC 50 50 32 33 34 35 36 M. alejandre The biological evaluation of extracts, magnolol, honokiol, and doxorubicin against cancer and normal cell lines allowed determining the selectivity index (SI). The aqueous extracts FSW and BSW show an SI value higher than 2 against the five cancer cell lines, highlighting activity against lung cancer. However, the organic extracts LUE and LUD showed a lower selectivity (SI < 2). Interestingly, magnolol and honokiol showed SI values higher than 15, except against prostate cancer cells. On the contrary, doxorubicin showed lower selectivity with SI values < 0.5. These results suggest a favorable and broad therapeutic window for the extracts, magnolol, and honokiol. Despite promising results reported on various species of the Magnolia genus, the studies have significant limitations, such as the absence of clinical trials to validate their efficacy and safety in humans. These limitations highlight the need for more systematic and rigorous studies to support the therapeutic application of secondary metabolites from the Magnolia genus. 5.
