Screening remains one of the most effective strategies for reducing late-stage diagnoses. This study examined the prevalence and factors associated with breast cancer screening among young women in Tanzania. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from the 2022 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey, including women aged 15-35 years. The outcome was self-reported breast cancer screening, defined as preventive practices among asymptomatic women, including breast self-examination (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE), or mammography. Logistic regression models were applied to identify factors associated with screening. Results A total of 10 733 women (mean age 24 ± 5.9 years) were analyzed. The prevalence of breast cancer screening was 3.39% (95% CI: 3.07-3.75). Higher odds of screening were observed among women aged 25-35 years (aOR 2.30), those with primary or higher education (aORs ≈ 2.15), who were married/cohabiting (aOR 1.52), employed in professional or skilled manual occupations (aORs ≈ 1.70), aware of their HIV-positive status (aOR 2.59), covered by health insurance (aOR 2.59), and using modern contraceptives (aOR 1.40). In contrast, women residing in the Western zone had lower odds of screening (aOR 0.34). Conclusion Breast cancer screening among young Tanzanian women was uncommon. Screening was associated with sociodemographic, reproductive, and health system factors, with particularly low uptake in the Western zone. These findings suggest the need to consider integrating breast health education into family planning and HIV services, expanding health insurance coverage, and implementing targeted outreach in underserved regions to enhance early detection and reduce disparities. Plain Language Summary Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women worldwide and is a growing concern in Tanzania. While screening programs often focus on women aged 40 years and older, younger women are also affected. Using data from a national survey of more than 10 000 women aged 15 to 35 years, this study looked at how many had ever been screened for breast cancer and the factors linked to screening. Screening included self-checking the breasts, being examined by a health worker, or having a mammogram. The results showed that very few young women had been screened; only about 3 out of every 100 had undergone screening. Screening was more prevalent among women who were older within this age group, married, educated, in skilled employment, living with HIV, using modern contraceptives, or covered by health insurance. Fewer women reported screening in some regions, such as Tabora and Kigoma. These findings suggest that younger women are not being adequately reached by current screening programs. Expanding breast health education, including it in family planning and HIV services, improving access to health insurance, and offering outreach initiatives could help increase screening and support earlier detection, leading to better outcomes for women in Tanzania. breast cancer screening health insurance young women determinants of health Tanzania pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes typesetter ts10 cover-date January-December 2025 Introduction Breast cancer is a serious public health challenge and the most common malignancy among women.  1  2  2 3 4  5 6 10 Breast cancer screening is a key strategy for reducing late-stage diagnoses and improving survival in high-, middle-, and low-income settings. 11 12  13 14 16  17  18 Although breast cancer is more common among older or postmenopausal women, 19 20  21  22 22 24  2  25 26 27 10 26 From a public health perspective, women aged 15-35 years constitute a critical group for several reasons. First, they are not routinely targeted by mammography-based screening programs, making CBE and BSE important approaches for awareness and early detection.  28  27 Several individual, sociocultural, economic, and systemic factors have been shown to influence breast cancer screening., 15 16 29 33  29  33  30 15 16 33 Methods Study Design and Data Sources The present study was a cross-sectional analysis of data from the 2022 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey and Malaria Indicator Survey (2022 TDHS-MIS).  34  35 Study Population and Sample Design The sample design for the 2022 TDHS-MIS has been described elsewhere.  34 Study Variables Outcome Variable The outcome variable for this study was breast cancer screening, assessed as a self-reported measure by asking women whether they had ever undergone a breast examination to check for cancer. In this context, breast cancer screening was defined broadly as preventive examinations conducted in asymptomatic individuals, including BSE, CBE by a health provider, or mammography. Explanatory Variables We included several explanatory variables in our analyses, which were selected based on a literature search 15 16 33 Statistical Analyses We utilized STATA version 18 for data management and analysis. Before the analysis, all the data were weighted and adjusted for clustering and stratification to account for the complex TDHS-MIS survey design. Initially, we conducted a descriptive analysis to summarize the characteristics of the study participants. Subsequently, we performed weighted bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify factors associated with breast cancer screening. In the bivariate analysis, we examined the association of each explanatory variable with breast cancer screening. All variables with a P P Ethical Consideration Formal ethical approval was not required for this study because the dataset is publicly available. However, permission to use the data was obtained from the DHS Program. The 2022 TDHS-MIS itself was conducted with approval from national and international review boards, including the National Institute of Medical Research, the Zanzibar Medical Research Ethical Committee, the Institutional Review Board of ICF, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all participants before the commencement of the survey. All data collected through the survey were de-identified, and no participant could be identified from the information provided. Results Characteristics of the Study Participants In total, 10 733 young women aged 15-35 years were included in this analysis. The mean (±SD) age was 24.0 ± 5.9 years, and more than half (5818; 54.2%) were aged 15-24 years. Most participants were married or living with a partner (5747; 53.5%), resided in rural areas (6840; 63.7%), and had never used contraceptives (7860; 73.2%). Fewer than half had heard of breast cancer (4909; 45.7%) ( Table 1 Table 1.

In a multivariable analysis, older age, formal education attainment, being married/living with a partner, professional or skilled manual occupation, being aware of the HIV-positive condition, health insurance coverage, residing in the Western zone, and the use of modern contraceptives were independently associated with breast cancer screening. Women aged 25-35 years had more than two-fold greater odds of being screened for breast cancer than those aged 15-24 years (aOR 2.30, 95% CI 1.63-3.24). Similarly, the odds of being screened for breast cancer were two-fold greater among women with primary (aOR 2.16, 95% CI 1.17-3.98), secondary or higher (aOR 2.15, 95% CI 1.12-4.12) education than among those with no formal education. Compared with women who had never been in a marital union, married/cohabiting women had 52% greater odds of being screened for breast cancer (aOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.03-2.22). Women in professional (aOR 1.70, 95% CI 1.03-2.81) and skilled manual (aOR 1.71, 95% CI 1.10-2.64) occupations had 70% and 71% greater odds, respectively, of being screened for breast cancer than those in other occupations. The odds of being screened for breast cancer were more than two-fold greater for women who were aware of their HIV-positive status (aOR 2.59, 95% CI 1.33-5.06) than for those who were HIV-negative or unsure of their HIV status. Furthermore, women covered by health insurance had more than two-fold greater odds of being screened for breast cancer than those not covered (aOR 2.59, 95% CI 1.76-3.81). Women who used modern contraceptives had 40% greater odds of being screened for breast cancer than those who never used any of the contraceptive methods (aOR 1.40, 95% CI 1.04-1.87). Compared to women residing in other geographical zones, those in the Western zone had 66% lower odds of being screened for breast cancer (aOR 0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.73). Discussion This study examined the prevalence and factors associated with breast cancer screening among young women aged 15-35 years in Tanzania using data from the 2022 TDHS-MIS. This age group was the focus because they are rarely included in formal screening initiatives, despite evidence that breast cancer in young women often presents with aggressive characteristics and poorer outcomes. 23 24 36  32  37  13 14 38 15 16 27 In this study, women aged 25-35 years had higher odds of reporting breast cancer screening compared with those aged 15-24 years. This finding aligns with previous studies from some SSA countries, 29 33 39 22 24 Our study found that married or cohabiting women had higher odds of reporting breast cancer screening compared with women who had never been in a marital union. This association may reflect differences in social support or health-seeking behavior among women with partners, which could influence engagement with preventive healthcare services, including breast cancer screening. This finding differs from results reported in Namibia  16  40 33 41 Formal education attainment was another factor associated with breast cancer screening in this study. Women with primary, secondary, or higher educational levels had higher odds of reporting breast cancer screening compared with those without formal education. This finding is consistent with studies from Namibia  16  33  8 This study identified an association between occupation type and breast cancer screening. Specifically, women in professional and skilled manual occupations had higher odds of reporting breast cancer screening compared with those in other occupation categories. This association may reflect differences in awareness of preventive healthcare services, access to financial resources, and health insurance coverage among women in these occupations. Our results are consistent with a study from Iran, which found that employed women had higher odds of undergoing breast cancer screening compared with housekeepers,  42  30 Our findings also indicated that women who were aware of their HIV-positive status had higher odds of reporting breast cancer screening compared with those who were not aware of their status. This association may reflect that women living with HIV often have regular contact with healthcare providers for routine HIV care, which could provide opportunities to access preventive healthcare services, including breast cancer screening. However, this finding differs from reports in other settings: a study from France found a non-significant difference in breast cancer screening between HIV-positive individuals and the general population,  43  44 Furthermore, this study found that young women residing in the Western zone had decreased odds of reporting breast cancer screening compared with those in other geographical zones. The Western zone includes the Tabora and Kigoma regions, which are predominantly inhabited by farmers and livestock keepers with generally lower socioeconomic status. Geographical factors,  45 15 16 33 Consistent with previous studies in SSA 15 16 33 41 46  31  16 This study also found an association between ever using modern contraceptives and reporting breast cancer screening, with higher odds of screening observed among women who had used contraceptives compared to those who had not. This association may reflect that women accessing healthcare services for family planning also have a greater exposure to information about preventive healthcare services, including breast cancer screening. Awareness of potential breast cancer risks associated with certain hormonal contraceptives could also play a role in screening behavior.  47  41 Strengths and Limitations The main strength of this study is the use of a large sample size from a nationally representative survey with high-quality data. A second strength is the application of weighting and adjustment for clustering, which makes the results generalizable to the Tanzanian population of young women. However, several limitations should be considered. First, the outcome variable was self-reported, which may suffer from desirability bias. Second, the survey instruments did not specify the outcome variable “breast cancer screening”; hence, the reported screening could refer to BSE, CBE, or mammography. Third, the study’s cross-sectional nature made it impossible to establish causality. Finally, the analysis was limited to variables included in the 2022 TDHS-MIS dataset, so other potentially relevant factors could not be assessed. Conclusion This study revealed a low prevalence of breast cancer screening among young women in Tanzania. Screening uptake was positively associated with older age, marital or cohabiting status, formal education, skilled employment, awareness of HIV-positive status, health insurance coverage, and modern contraceptive use. However, substantial geographical disparities were observed, with particularly low rates in the Western zone, including Tabora and Kigoma regions. These findings indicate the importance of considering multi-sectoral approaches to improve access to and utilization of breast cancer screening. Integration of breast health education into existing platforms such as family planning and HIV care services may offer practical opportunities for reaching young women. Efforts to expand health insurance coverage and increase the availability of affordable or free screening services at lower-level health facilities could help address financial barriers. Moreover, targeted initiatives such as mobile outreach programs and context-specific awareness campaigns may be useful in addressing regional disparities and improving coverage among underserved populations. Strengthening these approaches may support earlier detection and reduce inequities in breast cancer screening among Tanzanian women.
