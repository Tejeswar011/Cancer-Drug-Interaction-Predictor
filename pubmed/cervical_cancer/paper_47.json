The development of resistance to paclitaxel (PTX), which is a vital anticancer drug treating breast and lung cancers, can cause treatment failure and limit further use of taxanes and similar drugs. As previously documented, PTX-induced irresponsiveness to chemotherapy involves the overexpression of ABCC3, ABCC5, and ABCC10 members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transmembrane proteins, which are enriched in the lysosomes of drug-resistant cells where anticancer drugs are actively trapped. In this paper, the role of HIF1A in a BRG1-p300-dependent overexpression of 3 ABCC bona fide Graphical abstract Robaszkiewicz and colleagues provide experimental evidence that BRG1 requires HIF1A to drive EP300-dependent overexpression of three ABCC genes, which are functionally involved in drug sequestration in lysosomes in paclitaxel-resistant cancer cells. Therefore, BRG1-EP300-HIF1A entity is responsible for cancer multidrug resistance in cells repeatedly exposed to paclitaxel.

For example, FOXM1 was shown to regulate transcription of ABCC5 14 24 ABCA2 25 ABCB1 ABCC1 ABCG2 26 ABCC1 27 ABCG2 28 ABC To gain more complete insight to the transcription control of ABCC3, ABCC5, and ABCC10, which share their overexpression dependence on BRG1 and p300, previously published NGS data from BRG1 chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments and bioinformatic analysis was used to identify the possible co-regulators of BRG1 and p300 at the well-defined gene promoters described in Gronkowska et al. 15 Results Two motifs emerge at the promoters of genes transcriptionally co-activated by BRG1 Motifs were identified in the search for the possible co-factors of BRG1 that direct the enzyme to certain promoters and enabled or enhanced the BRG1-dependent gene transcription in PTX-resistant MDA-MB-231. These were enriched among BRG1 peaks occurring at the gene promoters that were positively controlled by this enzyme. For this purpose, the use of the differential gene expression analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data was made, where mRNA profiles of cells proficient (siCTRL) and deficient (siBRG1) in BRG1 were compared and the ChIP-seq data indicated the BRG1 enrichment at the gene promoters ( Figure 1 Figure 1 ABCC3 ABCC5 ABCC10 inter alia Figure 1 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 HIF1A ISL1 MAF ZNF76 ABC Figures 1 S1 MAF ABCB1 ABCC2 ABCG2 ABCC1 ACC10 Figure S1 ABCB1 ABCC4 ABCG2 ABCC10 Figure S1 ABCB1 ABCC2 ABCC4 ABCG2 ABCC1 ABCC5 ABCC10 Figures 1 S2 Figure 1 MAF, ZNF76, HIF1A, and ISL1 emerge as possible transcription co-activators of BRG1-dependent ABC genes in human cancers (A) Venn diagram schematic representation of BRG1 peaks at the gene promoters, which were taken for the search of BRG1-specific motifs.

For this purpose, we first identified the HIF1A binding profile across all the genome based on the TF-binding matrix deposited in JASPAR database and then limited the set of derived coordinates to gene promoters assumed to be TSS ±2 kbp.

As shown in Figures 4 Figures 4 Figures 4 Figures 4 Figure S7 Figure 4 HIF1A-p300-BRG1 co-occur on the chromatin in PTX-resistant breast and lung cancers (A and D) BRG1-HIF1A and EP300-HIF1A colocalize on the chromatin in PTX-resistant A549 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines as evidenced by immunostaining and confocal microscopy.

To verify this idea, we tested the impact of HIF1A silencing on the occurrence of chromatin-bound EP300 and BRG1 ( Figure 4 Figures 4 Figures 4 S7 HIF1A co-operates with BRG1 and p300 to drive drug sequestration in lysosomes and multidrug resistance in PTX-treated cells Knowing that HIF1A, EP300, and BRG1 regulate expression of the ABCC transporters that are enriched in lysosomes of PTX-resistant cancer cell lines, we checked if these proteins work cooperatively or if their effect is independent of each other and synergistic. The double silencing of HIF1A and BRG1 or EP300 decline transcription of the three genes similarly to single silencing of HIF1A.

Many drug resistance mechanisms occur at the genomic level and start with modification of the signaling routes, which then modulate the activity of the subset of transcription factors and the epigenetic transformation of chromatin. Research has shown that some transcription factors and chromatin remodeling enzymes play a significant role in PTX resistance. Interestingly, some redox sensitive transcription factors have been shown to play a role in cancer drug resistance. In an example of this, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2-mediated antioxidant signaling molecules contributed to PTX resistance in breast cancer-derived CSCs. 42 30 31 43 ABCB1 34 16 ABCC3 ABCC5 ABCC3 ABCC5 ABCC5 ABCC10 ABCC3 ABCC The co-occurrence of HIF1A with BRG1 on the chromatin in tumors formed from PTX-resistant MDA-MB-231 is considerably higher in the deeper tumor layers. This observation suggests that a hypoxic condition inside the tumor favors DNA binding by HIF1A and the transcription-regulating role of this factor is supported by BRG1. Therefore, the number of transcriptionally activated or enhanced genes by HIF1A-BRG1 interaction may differ across tumor, with the HIF1A-dependent transcriptomes differing between inner and outer tumor regions. As documented previously, the role of HIF1, a helix-loop-helix transcription factor, was essential in regulating the transcription of various target genes in response to a limited oxygen supply. 44 ABCB1 44 , 45 , 46 , 47 ABCC These studies have described the functional association or at least a correlation between the expression of BRG1 ( SMARCA4 P300 40 HIF1A EP300 SMARCA4 In summary, PTX-induced drug resistance involves 3 key players, namely BRG1, p300, and HIF1A, which define the strong expression of ABCC3 ABCC5 ABCC10 Materials and methods Materials Non-small-cell lung cancer cell line A549 was purchased from ATCC.

Human xenografts and tumor sampling PTX-resistant MDA-MB-231 and A549 cells (100,000 cells) suspended in Geltrex LDEV-Free Reduced Growth Factor Basement Membrane Matrix were injected subcutaneously into 6-week-old female athymic, immunodeficient mice (Crl:NU(NCr)-Foxn1nu; Animalab, Poland). Six weeks after inoculation, the tumors that arose were isolated, transferred, and stored in PBS with 10% paraformaldehyde. The entire experiment with animals was performed in the Animal Facility of Faculty of Biochemistry, Biophysics and Biotechnology, Jagiellonian University, Poland, under permission no. 72/2023 issued on 06.04.2023 by the 2nd Local Ethical Committee in Krakow. Tumors were placed in water-soluble embedding medium (Frozen Section Media 22; Leica Biosystems Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL, USA), frozen in −20°C, and then sectioned on a cryostat (Leica CM1950, Leica Biosystems Inc.) in −10°C to 10-μm-thick slides. The slides were washed with distilled water to remove the sectioning media and the heat-induced epitope retrieval method was used. The slides were incubated with EDTA buffer (1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20 [pH 8.0]) and heated 20 min in 96°C. Next, samples were permeabilized and blocked with 1% FBS solution in PBS with 0.4% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 1 h. Primary antibodies (1:400) were added in 1% FBS solution in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4°C overnight. Next, a secondary antibody (1:400) was added in 1% FBS solution in PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 2 h. After washing, the slides were mounted with SlowFade glass soft-set antifade mountant (with DAPI). TCS SP8 (Leica Microsystems,) with a 63×/1.40 objective (HC PL APO CS2, Leica Microsystems) was used for sample visualization. The samples were imaged with the following wavelength values for excitation and emission: 485 and 500–550 nm for Alexa Fluor 488 and 550 and 570–580 nm for Alexa Fluor 546. Chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP was carried out according to the protocol previously described. 56 BRG1 binding motifs at the selected gene promoters were amplified using KAPA SYBR FAST Universal Master Mix, 0.1% DMSO and the following primer pairs: ABCC3 ABCC5 ABCC10 ABCC2 Protein co-immunoprecipitation A549 and MDA-MB-231 PTX-resistant cells were washed three times with PBS and lysed on ice in IP buffer composed of 20 mM HEPES—KOH, 50 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.1% NP-40 and protease inhibitors; sonicated with the ultrasonic homogenizer Bandelin Sonopuls (HD 2070; 10 impulses, 60%); and centrifuged (3,000 rpm, 4°C, 10 min). Supernatant was incubated with anti-HIF1a antibody and control IgG at 4°C for 2 h. For another 1 h, lysates were added with Dynabeads (10 μL); then, they were washed 5× with the IP buffer and suspended in RIPA buffer in RIPA buffer (supplemented with 1 mM PMSF and PIC) with 5% β-mercaptoethanol and gel loading buffer and heated at 70°C for 10 min. Beads were collected on a magnetic stand and supernatant was separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis followed by transfer of proteins on nitrocellulose membranes. BRG1, EP300, and HIF1a were detected on nitrocellulose membranes after overnight staining with corresponding primary antibodies (1:5,000) in Immobilon Signal Enhancer buffer. After subsequent staining with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5,000 for antirabbit and 1:2,500 for anti-mouse antibodies; room temperature; 2 h) in Immobilon Signal Enhancer, the signal was developed with the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate and pictures were acquired using ProXima 2750 (Isogen Life Science). Resazurin toxicity assay The day prior to transfection, cells were seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well on 96-well black plates. After transfection and incubation with drugs, cells were incubated with resazurin solution (5 μM) in the growth medium at 37°C for 2 h. The fluorescence that corresponds to the metabolic activity of living cells was measured with a fluorescence microplate reader (BioTek Synergy HTX, Biokom, Poland) at excitation 530 and emission 590 nm. The fluorescence value for control cells was assumed to be 100%. Caspase 3/7 activity assay The day prior to transfection, cells were seeded at a density of 2,000 cells per well on 384-well white plates. After transfection and incubation with inhibitor and PTX, cells were incubated with Caspase-Glo 3/7 Reagent (according to manufacturer protocol) or resazurin solution (5 μM) in the growth medium at 37°C for 1 h. The luminescence that corresponds to caspase 3/7 activity and fluorescence (excitation 530 and emission 590 nm) that corresponds to the metabolic activity of living cells was measured with microplate reader (BioTek Synergy HTX, Biokom). The luminescence values were normalized to cell fluorescence in order to estimate the ratio between caspase activity and relative number of viable cells. Statistical analysis Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Parametric or non-parametric test was conducted after testing Gaussian distribution of data with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Student’s t test or the Mann-Whitney test was used to calculate statistically significant differences between two samples, while one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis test followed by corresponding post hoc test was carried out to compare multiple samples. Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism 8.01 software. Statistically significant differences were marked with ∗ when p p p Data availability Original raw data files containing sequence reads and quality scores were submitted to the NCBI SRA database under the accession numbers: SRA: PRJNA1095909 and SRA: PRJNA1096152.
