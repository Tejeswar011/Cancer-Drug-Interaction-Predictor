Background Endometrial cancer (EC) is among the most prevalent gynecological malignancies worldwide. This study explores the use of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomics to develop a non-invasive liquid biopsy assay, aiming to improve early detection, subtyping, and prognostication of EC, thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes and reducing associated mortality. Materials and methods A cohort of 120 patients with diagnosed EC and 120 healthy volunteers was used to develop a novel non-invasive liquid biopsy assay for EC. Five distinct fragmentomic features were analyzed from preoperative plasma samples using low-pass whole-genome sequencing. Ensemble models were created by integrating base models that utilized four different machine learning algorithms for early cancer detection, clinicopathological subtyping, and prediction of recurrence-free survival. An independent test cohort of 62 EC patients and 62 healthy controls was used to assess the final ensemble model’s performance. Results The liquid biopsy assay demonstrated high efficacy in early EC detection, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96, with 75.8% sensitivity and 96.8% specificity in the independent test cohort. Consistent sensitivities were observed across EC stages I-IV at 74.4%, 85.7%, 75%, and 75%, respectively. The assay moderately predicted clinicopathological features including stage (AUC = 0.72), histological subtypes (AUC = 0.73), and microsatellite instability status (AUC = 0.77). The model also effectively predicted recurrence-free survival, identifying high-risk patients [hazard ratio (HR) 8.6, P P P Conclusions This DECIPHER-UCEC-2 study (Detecting Early Cancer by Inspecting ctDNA Features) demonstrates that by integrating cfDNA fragmentomics with machine learning, our liquid biopsy assay shows significant promise for EC’s early detection, subtyping, and prognosis, potentially paving the way for enhanced patient outcomes. Highlights • We developed a cfDNA fragmentomics-based liquid biopsy assay for accurately detecting ECs with AUC of 0.96. • De novo • This study demonstrated the potential of cfDNA fragmentomics liquid biopsy assay in the prognostication of EC.

In 2022, EC was responsible for ∼661 000 new instances and ∼348 000 cancer-related mortalities, representing an increase of ∼57 000 new instances and ∼6000 cancer-related mortalities compared with the year 2020. 1 , 2 Currently, there is no established screening test for EC detection and most ECs are clinically diagnosed among patients who had already developed symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding. 3 3 4 5 5 3 6 , 7 The recent advancements in liquid biopsy have shed light on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragmentomics in cancer research, particularly for its potential in early cancer detection. 8 9 10 11 12 13 13 14 15 8 9 16 However, despite these successes in early cancer detection, only a few studies have explored the potential of cfDNA fragmentomics for cancer subtyping and prognosis prediction. 8 , 17 , 18 8 18 In this study, namely DECIPHER-UCEC-2 (Detecting Early Cancer by Inspecting ctDNA Features), we aim to leverage cfDNA fragmentomics and machine learning algorithms to establish a non-invasive liquid biopsy assay for the early detection, clinicopathological subtyping, and prognosis prediction for EC. Our research strives to contribute to the growing evidence supporting the use of cfDNA fragmentomics in cancer diagnostics, potentially providing an approach for screening and early intervention in EC, which could facilitate timely and personalized treatment plans, leading to improved patient prognosis. Materials and methods Study design and participant enrollment The training cohort included a total of 251 participants, comprised of 127 EC patients and 124 healthy female volunteers. These individuals were retrospectively recruited for the training cohort between December 2018 and October 2019 at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital. Plasma samples were obtained from the untreated EC patients and the healthy volunteers and preserved at ˗80°C before being dispatched for low-depth whole-genome sequencing (WGS) at a clinical testing laboratory (Nanjing Geneseeq Technology Inc., China; Certified to CAP, CLIA and ISO15189) in December 2019. Supplementary Figure S1 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105770 Additionally, an independent test cohort was established, initially targeting 120 samples (60 EC patients and 60 healthy volunteers) at a 2 : 1 ratio between two cohorts. To compensate for the anticipated sample attrition due to quality control failures, as observed in the training cohort, 65 EC patients and 62 healthy volunteers were prospectively recruited at the same hospital from February 2020 to December 2020. Plasma samples from prospective EC patients were obtained before clinical diagnosis, as well as from healthy controls. Plasma samples from prospective EC patients were obtained upon their initial presentation to the Department of Gynecologic Oncology, prompted by symptoms suggestive of malignancy and before any radiological or pathological confirmation of cancer. Inclusion in the study cohort was limited to individuals with a verified diagnosis of EC. These plasma samples were also submitted to the same laboratory for low-depth WGS. The low-depth WGS for these plasma samples were finished by January 2021. After excluding those that did not meet the quality standards, the independent test cohort was finalized with 124 analyzable samples (62 EC and 62 healthy). An external cohort consisting of 81 EC patients and 81 healthy participants, collected at the Chongqing University Cancer Hospital from October 2022 to December 2023, is included to further validate the assay. Due to experimental and sequencing failures, 75 EC patients and 76 healthy individuals remained for analysis. These samples were stored and processed using the same procedures as those applied to the training and independent test cohorts. The study’s protocol received ethical approval from the ethics committee at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, and all participants provided written informed consent for their participation and the publication of the findings. Sample preparation and whole-genome sequencing Ten milliliter of peripheral blood was withdrawn from the participants into EDTA tubes, followed by centrifugation at 16 000× for 10 min for plasma extraction within 4 h of blood collection at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital. The plasma samples were stored at ˗80°C before being shipped with dry ice to the central laboratory of a clinical testing center (Nanjing Geneseeq Technology Inc., China). The plasma samples were received and stored at −20°C (∼1 to 3 days), as per sequencer availability. The cfDNA was then extracted from the defrozen plasma samples using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), followed by quantification using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), according to the manufacturers’ guidelines. 5-10 ng of cfDNA were then used to create WGS libraries following DNA end repair, A-tailing, and adapter ligation by the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). The constructed WGS libraries were first quantified (KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix; KAPA Biosystems), before paired-end sequencing on the NovaSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). To guarantee the integrity of the data, a series of quality assurance steps were implemented on the sequence data produced. The initial step involved refining the sequence reads with the application of Trimmomatic software. This was succeeded by the elimination of any PCR duplicates, a process carried out by the Picard toolkit from the Broad Institute in Massachusetts. Post-trimming, the sequences were mapped against the human reference genome, specifically the GRCh37/UCSC hg19 build, utilizing the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner for precise alignment. To remove any potential bias created by inconsistent depth, the WGS data were downsampled to an universal 5X coverage. Model construction and performance evaluation In this study, we explored the potential of preoperative cfDNA fragmentomics features in the detection of EC, prediction of clinicopathological features such as International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, histological subtype, differentiation grade, microsatellite instability (MSI), as well as recurrence-free survival (RFS). According to the available samples for each response and the number of positive events, various model construction/validation approaches were applied. Fragmentomics features and modeling algorithms In this study, we utilized five distinct types of features: copy number variation (CNV), fragment size score (FSS), fragment size distribution (FSD), mutation context and mutational signature (MCMS), and nucleosome footprint (NF). The aggregate count of these raw features amounted to 7230, with the following breakdown: 2475 for CNV, 1082 for FSS, 936 for FSD, 175 for MCMS, and 2562 for NF. We implemented two-dimensionality reduction techniques, namely autoencoder and principal component analysis (PCA), across all five feature types, which reduced each feature count to 50. These reduced features were also utilized for model construction. Detailed information on how these features were generated can be found in the Supplementary Methods https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105770 For base model construction, we utilized four different algorithms: generalized linear model (GLM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), random forest (RF), and deep learning (DL). For each type of feature, each of the four algorithms employed three sets of features (raw, autoencoder, PCA), resulting in 12 base models. This led to a total of 60 base models for the binary predictive models (for example, distinguishing between EC and healthy; or differentiating between type I and type II EC). For the predictive model aimed at estimating RFS, we opted for the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox algorithm in place of the previously mentioned four algorithms. This choice was made due to the algorithm’s ability to handle time-dependent data. Consequently, this resulted in the creation of 15 base models (five feature types times three sets) for creating the final RFS predictive model. Predictive models for cancer detection and clinicopathological characteristics To facilitate the construction of final predictive models, we first evaluated each of the 60 base models by using a 10 times repeated five-fold cross-validation on the training cohort. The only exception was the MSI prediction model, which utilized a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach due to limited sample size (further details available in Supplementary Methods https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105770 During each repetition, each of the 240 samples within the training cohort was predicted when treated as an out-of-sample data point and a prediction score was obtained. We then calculated the AUC receiver operating characteristic curve for each round of validation. The average AUCs from these 10 iterations were used to gauge the overall performance of the base models. Only those models with a mean AUC (mAUC) of 0.6 or higher were selected to be part of the final predictive model, which was constructed using an ensemble approach of averaging model predicted scores. Predictive model for recurrence-free survival We employed the LASSO Cox regression model to predict RFS. Recurrence survival data were available for 138 EC patients including 87 (10 positive events) in the training cohort and 51 (8 positive events) in the test cohort. Similarly, a stacking LOOCV approach was employed due to the limited sample size in the training cohort, especially the positive events. Sub-models with an LOOCV AUC of 0.6 or higher were selected. The final risk score was calculated as the average risk scores of the selected base models.

The retrospective training cohort consisted of 127 patients with EC from the Department of Gynecologic Oncology at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital and 124 healthy individuals from the hospital’s physical examination center. Out of these 251 participants, 7 were excluded due to failing sample quality control (QC) and an additional 4 were later excluded after failing QC in WGS, leaving 240 samples suitable for analysis as originally planned (refer to Figure 1 Supplementary Figure S1 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105770 Figure 1 Supplementary Figure S1 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105770 Supplementary Figure S1 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105770 Figure 1 Cohort description and flowchart.

Fragmentomics-based predictive models for cancer detection and clinicopathological subtyping Cancer detection model Using data from WGS of cfDNA, we developed a model to distinguish between patients with EC and healthy women. The model, which integrates 60 base models, demonstrated outstanding ability to identify EC, achieving AUC scores of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-1.00) for the training group, 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.99) for the independent test group ( Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figures 2 3 P Supplementary Figures S2 S3 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105770 Figure 2 Early detection of endometrial cancer by stacking modeling based on integrated cfDNA fragmentomics features. Figure 3 Early detection and prediction of endometrial cancer by integrated cfDNA fragmentomics features in the external cohort MCMS is the most predictive feature in both training and validation sets, as indicated by the highest AUC scores ( Supplementary Figure S3 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105770 Supplementary Figure S3C https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105770 CD59 FBXO3 HIPK3 KIAA1549L Supplementary Figure S3F https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105770 Supplementary Figure S3G https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105770 Supplementary Figure S3 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105770 Clinicopathological models We further explored the potential of cfDNA fragmentomics for various clinical and pathological characteristics, such as stages, histology subtypes, and grades, which previous studies have not fully examined. In our study, using patients with EC from both cohorts, our predictive model demonstrated a strong ability to distinguish between early stages (FIGO stage I and II) and late stages (FIGO stage III and IV). It achieved AUC scores of 0.82 (95% CI 0.74-0.91) and 0.72 (95% CI 0.57-0.87) in the training cohort and the independent test cohort, respectively, as seen in Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 3 Figure 4 Prediction of clinicopathological features of endometrial cancer by integrated cfDNA fragmentomics profiling. ) Due to the small number of samples, we opted to use an LOOCV method, combining all EC patients with available MSI status information from both cohorts. Our model successfully predicted the MSI status with a 90.0% sensitivity and a 65.0% specificity among the 56 EC patients, resulting in an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI 0.64-0.91), as shown in Figure 4 Fragmentomics profile as potential prognosis marker for endometrial cancer patients In this study, we assessed the potential of cfDNA fragmentomics as prognostic markers for patients with EC using both supervised and semi-supervised machine learning approaches. Recurrence-free survival predictive model We developed a LASSO Cox model to predict the risk of recurrence in EC patients using cfDNA fragmentomics features. This LASSO Cox regression model was trained on a group of 87 EC patients who had survival data available (including 10 who experienced relapse) from the training cohort, and then tested on a group of 51 patients (8 of whom had relapse events) from the independent test cohort. We ranked all 138 EC patients according to their model predicted risk score, from highest to lowest. The top one-third of patients were considered high-risk for recurrence, while the bottom two-thirds were deemed low-risk (see Supplementary Methods https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105770 As shown in Figure 5 P P Figure 5 P Figure 5 P Figure 5 Figure 5 Prediction of RFS in patients with endometrial cancer by integrated cfDNA fragmentomics profiling. P P Similarity network fusion using fragmentomics features In this study, we conducted a semi-supervised analysis using similarity network fusion (SNF) to subtype EC patients based on cfDNA fragmentomics characteristics. SNF created networks for each type of fragmentomics feature, which were then combined into a single network. Patients were grouped according to this integrated network, and their prognosis was assessed.

The predictive model developed here showcased an exceptional ability to identify EC, achieving AUC scores of 0.99 for the training cohort and 0.96 for the independent test cohort. Our fragmentomics-based liquid biopsy assay out-performs conventional screening techniques. Our assay demonstrates much higher preoperative sensitivity than tumor-informed methods like that of Ashley et al., which detected mutations in only 22% of EC cases (8/36). 19 19 , 21 Beyond cancer detection, our study also explored the utility of cfDNA fragmentomics profiles in predicting clinicopathological characteristics and RFS. The models for clinicopathological subtyping showed promising results, particularly in distinguishing between early and late stages of EC, as well as predicting histology subtypes. However, the low AUC scores in the test cohort for predicting grades and the limited samples for MSI prediction suggest the necessity for further optimization. It is noteworthy that despite these challenges, the model predicting MSI status still achieved a promising AUC of 0.77, highlighting the potential of cfDNA fragmentomics in identifying molecular characteristics of EC. The prognostic model for RFS, based on cfDNA fragmentomics features, presents a novel approach to stratifying EC patients into high- and low-risk categories for recurrence. The significant HRs observed in both the training and independent test groups validate the model’s capability to identify patients at higher risk of recurrence, providing valuable insights for potential personalized treatment. Moreover, the semi-supervised SNF subtyping analysis based on cfDNA fragmentomics features further validate its potential as prognostic biomarker for EC patients. In conclusion, our study gives a preliminary look at the potential utility of cfDNA fragmentomics in the area of EC beyond cancer detection. CfDNA fragmentomics presents a promising non-invasive method for the early detection, subtyping, and prognostication of EC. When implemented in healthcare settings, our assay can be used for early screening of individuals with average. For those who receive a positive screening result, further diagnostic procedures, such as transvaginal ultrasound, endometrial scraping, imaging, and biopsy are recommended. Following diagnosis, patients can be categorized into higher- and lower-risk groups using SNF. Patients identified as high-risk may require more frequent monitoring. For individuals with a negative early screening result or those with a positive early screening result but a negative diagnosis result, annual screening using the early detection model is recommended. However, it is important to note that the cohorts primarily consist of the Chinese population. Further validation is needed to assess the applicability of our assay across diverse ethnic groups. Despite some limitations, such as the need for further validation in larger, diverse cohorts and optimization of models for predicting certain clinicopathological characteristics, our study provides compelling evidence supporting the integration of cfDNA fragmentomics into the EC diagnostic and prognostic toolkit, especially demonstrating its applications in tumor subtyping and identification of patients who are more likely to experience disease recurrence. Future research should focus on refining these predictive models and exploring their clinical utility in personalized medicine for EC patients.
