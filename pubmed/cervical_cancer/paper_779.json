We hypothesized that ER stress mediates inflammatory responses in pulpitis through the CHOP/Caspase-12 pathway. Our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying pulpitis and suggest potential therapeutic strategies targeting ER stress for the treatment of pulpal inflammation. Materials and methods Human pulp tissue collection Human dental pulp tissues were obtained from healthy third molars, extracted from teeth diagnosed with irreversible pulpitis at Shenzhen Stomatology Hospital. Patient inclusion criteria: Patients aged 18 to 22 years without underlying diseases or periodontal disease. Nine cases of pulpitis third molars extracted for treatment purposes, with each patient independently diagnosed by two endodontic specialists. Nine healthy, caries-free third molars were selected as controls. Pulp samples were obtained by crown splitting and immediately placed in 4% paraformaldehyde fixative, stored at 4 °C for 48 h, then paraffin-embedded and sectioned into 3–5 μm thick sagittal sections for further use. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Shenzhen Stomatology Hospital. Animal model A total of 15 male Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old, weighing 250–300 g) were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Company. For the pulpitis model, the left maxillary first molar was selected for pulpitis induction, while the right maxillary first molar of the same rat served as a negative control. The rats were anesthetized intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg body weight) before mechanical exposure of the pulp in their first Maxillary molar, which was achieved using a water-cooled round carbide bur. The exposed pulp was left open to the oral environment for 3 days before being sealed with glass ionomer cement. Glass ionomer cement was mixed at a water-to-powder ratio of 1:1 to form a paste-like consistency and then filled into the access cavity. The purpose of this treatment was to seal the pulp chamber, restore tooth morphology, and prevent further bacterial invasion. Successful establishment of pulpitis was confirmed as follows: rats were sacrificed on the 3rd day post-exposure, maxillary bone specimens were collected, and HE staining was performed to observe the degree of pulpal inflammation, neutrophil infiltration, and tissue necrosis. The animals were randomly assigned to three experimental groups: sham-operated controls (underwent identical procedure without pulp exposure), untreated pulpitis, and pulpitis treated with 4-PBA (an ER stress inhibitor). At least three animals were included in each group. The administration details of 4-PBA in the animal model are as follows: a concentration of 5 mM was applied via local administration. Specifically, 5 mM 4-PBA was applied to collagen sponges for local pulp capping, followed by coronal glass ionomer filling and sealing. Administration occurred 3 days post-pulp exposure, and animals were sacrificed 4 days post-treatment (7 days post-pulp exposure). All animals were killed by cervical dislocation after anaesthesia with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium (40 mg/kg). This method was chosen due to its rapid and humane approach, minimizing suffering and ensuring a quick death. Maxillary bone specimens were collected on day 7 post-sacrifice. Subsequently, samples were placed in 4% paraformaldehyde fixative and stored at 4 °C for 48 h, followed by demineralization in 10% EDTA for 6 weeks with solution changes every 2 days. Tissues were paraffin-embedded and sectioned into 3–5 μm thick sagittal sections for further use. The experimental protocols were approved by the Laboratory Animal Welfare & Ethics Committee of Bestcell Model Biological Center (approval number: 2025-1-21A). Cell culture and treatment Primary human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) were isolated from healthy premolars and third molars extracted from patients aged 13–23 years for orthodontic treatment. Teeth were placed in sterile culture dishes and washed 3–4 times with PBS until all surface blood was completely removed. Teeth were split to extract the pulp, with 2 mm of apical pulp tissue removed. Pulp tissue was placed in digestion solution containing 3 mg/ml type I collagenase (Invitrogen, 17100017) and 4 mg/ml dispase (Gibco, 17105041), thoroughly minced, and digested in a cell culture incubator for 1 h. Digestion was terminated with complete medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, followed by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and tissue blocks were resuspended in complete medium with 20% fetal bovine serum, seeded in T25 culture flasks, and placed in a cell culture incubator. Medium was changed every 2 days, and when cells reached 80% confluence, they were passaged using trypsin digestion. P3-P5 cells were used for experiments. For LPS stimulation, cells were treated with 1 µg/mL E. coli LPS (Sigma, L2880) for 24 h. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with 2 mM 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA, MCE, HY-A0281) prior to LPS stimulation. Flow cytometric analysis To identify the cellular phenotype, hDPSCs at passage 3 were harvested and reconstituted in PBS at 1 × 10 6 Immunofluorescence staining Tissue Sect. (4 μm) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and subjected to antigen retrieval. After blocking, sections were incubated with primary antibodies against BiP (1:200), CHOP (1:200), Caspase-12 (1:200), and TNF-α (1:200) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, sections were incubated with appropriate fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies and counterstained with DAPI. Images were acquired using a confocal microscope (Olympus). Western blot analysis Total protein was extracted using RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked and incubated with primary antibodies against BiP (Proteintech, 11587-1-AP, 1: 1000), CHOP (Proteintech, 15204-1-AP, 1: 1000), Caspase-12 (Proteintech, 55238-1-AP, 1: 1000), TNF-α (Proteintech, 17590-1-AP, 1: 1000), and GAPDH (Proteintech, 10494-1-AP, 1: 20000) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, membranes were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Protein bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system. siRNA transfection Chemical synthesized siRNAs targeting PMAIP1 Real-time PCR analysis Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) and reverse transcribed using Reverse transcription reagents (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green master mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). GAPDH served as an internal control. Relative gene expression was calculated using the 2^(-ΔΔCT) method.

P Results Activation of ER stress signaling in pulpitis To investigate the potential involvement of ER stress in pulpitis pathogenesis, we first examined the expression patterns of key ER stress markers in clinical specimens and established rat pulpitis model. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed significantly elevated expression of BiP and CHOP in pulpitis specimens compared to healthy pulp tissues (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Activation of ER stress signaling in pulpitis ( A B C D E P F G P P P For mechanistic investigation, we isolated and characterized primary hDPSCs from healthy dental pulp tissues. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed their stem cell identity through positive expression of mesenchymal markers (CD73, CD90, and CD105) and negative expression of hematopoietic markers (CD34 and CD45) (Fig. 1 1 1 Transcriptomic analysis of pulpitis reveals global changes in gene expression and pathway activation To gain comprehensive molecular insights into pulpitis pathogenesis, we performed bioinformatic analysis of transcriptomic data from public datasets ( GSE98359 2 2 2 2 2 2  Fig. 2 Transcriptomic analysis of pulpitis reveals global changes in gene expression and pathway activation ( A GSE98359 B C D G Identification and characterization of ER Stress-Related DEGs in pulpitis To specifically investigate ER stress involvement in pulpitis, we performed integrative analysis between pulpitis DEGs and ER stress-associated gene sets. This systematic approach identified 19 overlapping genes implicated in both processes (Fig. 3 PMAIP1 NOD2 PIK3R1 THBS4 THBS1 STC2 RCN3 FCGR2B RASGRF1 NCCRP1 ATP2A3 3 3 RASGRF1 ATP2A3 ABCA7 RCN3 HSPA1A RASGRF1 PMAIP1 GRP78 DDIT3 CASP12  Fig. 3 Identification and characterization of ER stress-related DEGs in pulpitis ( A B C D Functional analysis of ER Stress-Associated gene networks in pulpitis Comprehensive pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of ER stress-related DEGs in critical biological processes and molecular pathways.

We examined PMAIP1 expression in rat pulpitis tissues after 4-PBA delivery. 4-PBA treatment reduced PMAIP1 expression compared to untreated pulpitis controls. This finding imply that 4-PBA therapeutic effects is mediated through downregulation of PMAIP1. Western blot analysis demonstrated that 4-PBA treatment effectively suppressed LPS-induced expression of BiP, CHOP, CASP12, and TNFα in hDPSCs (Fig. 5 5  Fig. 5 Therapeutic targeting of ER stress attenuates pulpal inflammation ( A E P P P P F Discussion Our study reveals novel molecular mechanisms underlying pulpitis pathogenesis, establishing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as a central orchestrator of inflammatory responses in dental pulp tissue. Through integrated transcriptomic and functional analyses, we identified PMAIP1 The marked upregulation of canonical ER stress markers (BiP and CHOP) in clinical pulpitis specimens provides the first direct evidence linking ER stress activation to pulpal inflammation. This finding extends beyond previous studies that primarily focused on inflammatory mediators in pulpitis [ 19 20 21 We also noticed that the prominently significant gene located at the top-right corner of Fig. 2 22 23 24 Our bioinformatic analysis identified PMAIP1 25 26 GRP78 DDIT3 27 28 29 Perhaps the most clinically relevant finding is the therapeutic efficacy of 4-PBA in attenuating both ER stress and inflammatory responses. The significant reduction in BiP, CHOP, CASP12, and TNF-α expression following 4-PBA treatment aligns with studies demonstrating its effectiveness in other inflammatory conditions [ 30 31 32 The translation of these findings into clinical practice could fundamentally change our approach to pulpitis treatment. Current therapeutic strategies primarily focus on symptom management and pulp preservation [ 33 The use of both human specimens and a rat model provides cross-species validation of our observations. The integration of transcriptomic analysis with functional studies offers robust evidence for the role of ER stress in pulpitis. However, certain limitations should be acknowledged. While our rat model successfully recapitulated key features of human pulpitis, species-specific differences in dental pulp biology May affect the generalizability of some findings. The temporal dynamics of ER stress activation during different stages of pulpitis progression require further investigation. Although 4-PBA showed promising results, optimization of its delivery method and timing for clinical application needs additional study. Additionally, the long-term effects of ER stress modulation on pulp tissue homeostasis and regeneration capacity remain to be determined. Our current findings establish the direct effects of ER stress on hDPSCs and provide the mechanistic foundation for understanding pulpal inflammation responses. However, to enhance biological relevance, future studies should incorporate heterogeneous cell co-cultures that include immune cells, endothelial cells, and other pulp tissue components, as these multicellular interactions are critical in the physiological context. And detailed characterization of the PMAIP1-mediated signaling network in pulpal inflammation, particularly its interaction with NOD2 and PIK3R1 pathways, will be crucial for understanding the complete molecular mechanism. The development of targeted delivery systems for ER stress modulators could enhance their therapeutic efficacy in dental pulp tissue [ 34 Conclusion Our study establishes ER stress as a critical mediator in pulpitis pathogenesis and identifies PMAIP1 Supplementary Information  Supplementary Material 1.
