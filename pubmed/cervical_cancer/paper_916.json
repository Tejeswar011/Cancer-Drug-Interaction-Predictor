This study fills that gap by examining long‑term trends and drivers of CRC burden in the selected East Asian countries—China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, and Mongolia—between 1990 and 2021, and by projecting future burden through 2036. Methods We obtained data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2021 on CRC-related prevalence, incidence, mortality, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in the selected countries, further assessed by age and sex. We quantified contributions of population growth, aging and epidemiological change via Results Although absolute CRC burden rose across the region—driven largely by population aging—with China exhibiting the highest numbers and Japan exhibiting the highest age‑standardized rates. Older adults bore the greatest share of burden. Decomposition and modeling indicate that demographic shifts have been the predominant force behind increasing CRC counts, and projected trends suggest the regional burden will remain substantial without targeted action. Conclusions This study provides novel, region‑specific evidence that demographic aging is the principal driver of rising CRC burden in East Asia. The findings highlight an urgent need for tailored prevention, screening and resource planning focused on aging populations to alter the projected trajectory.

Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) accounts for 9.6% of all cancers and, as of 2022, ranks as the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide [ 1 1 2 3 4 5 The selected East Asian countries—China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, and Mongolia—collectively represent approximately 22% of the global population and contribute around 24% of the global GDP, according to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2022) ( https://population.un.org/wpp/ 6 7 To the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused specifically on the epidemiological burden of CRC in these East Asian countries. One study highlighted the significant impact of ambient temperature on temperature-related mortality, especially in cardiovascular diseases, underscoring the relevance of environmental and regional factors [ 8 9 In this study, we comprehensively analysed the burden of CRC in selected East Asian countries between 1990 and 2021, assessing prevalence, incidence, mortality, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Additionally, we applied the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) models to project disease trends through 2036. The objective of this study is to provide data-driven insights for policymakers to evaluate the CRC burden across these countries and to support the design of targeted prevention strategies and equitable allocation of healthcare resources. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Data source The Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) GBD Results Tool ( https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/ 2.2. Definition In this study, CRC was defined based on the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) codes C18–C21, D01.0–D01.2, and D12–D12.9 [ 10 2.3. Ethics statement The data used in this study are publicly available, and patient information was derived from aggregated rather than individual-level data. As such, the study falls under exemptions for ethical review, specifically under the category: ‘Research using pre-existing data, records, discarded pathological specimens, or examination specimens, where the resources are publicly available or the data maintained by the researcher cannot directly or indirectly identify the subjects.’ All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the principles stated in the Declaration of Helsinki. Therefore, the Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine determined that this study did not require ethical approval. 2.4. Data analysis The statistical methodology used in the GBD 2021 study has been described in detail elsewhere [ 6 Average annual percent change (AAPC) and annual percent change (APC), along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were calculated to evaluate trends in the age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR), age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), age-standardized YLDs rate, age-standardized YLLs rate, and age-standardized disability-adjusted life years rate (ASDR) using Joinpoint regression analysis (Joinpoint Regression Program, Version 5.1.0). All age-standardized rates (ASRs) were calculated based on the GBD World Population Age Standard. Decomposition analysis was used to partition differences in total deaths into contributions from population growth, population aging, and changes in mortality [ 11–16 15 The ARIMA model combines autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) [ 17 18 17 17 To project CRC burden through 2036, a BAPC model was implemented using the BAPC and INLA packages in R. All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 4.4.1) and Zstats version 1.0 ( www.zstats.net 19 3. Results 3.1. Overall burden In both 1990 and 2021, Japan recorded the highest ASPR among the selected East Asian countries. In 1990, the ASPRs of China and South Korea were below the global ASPR. However, by 2021, the ASPRs of both countries had surpassed the global level. In contrast, North Korea and Mongolia had ASPRs below the global ASPR in both 1990 and 2021, respectively ( Table S1 Similarly, Japan had the highest ASIR among the selected East Asian countries in both years. In 1990, the ASIRs of China and South Korea were below the global ASIR but above that of Asia. By 2021, the ASIRs of China and South Korea had surpassed both the global and Asian levels. North Korea and Mongolia exhibited ASIRs below both the global and Asian values throughout the period ( Table 1 Table 1.

Decomposition analysis In China, the change in prevalence rate was attributed 34.24% to aging, 15.12% to population growth, and 50.64% to epidemiological changes. In Japan, aging contributed the most (72.09%), followed by epidemiological change (26.05%) and population growth (1.86%). In South Korea, the respective contributions were 37.56% from aging, 11.14% from population, and 51.30% from epidemiological factors. In North Korea, population growth played the dominant role (41.10%), followed by epidemiological change (30.31%) and aging (28.59%). In Mongolia, the largest contribution was from population growth (63.64%), with smaller contributions from epidemiological change (23.88%) and aging (12.48%) ( Figure 8(A) Figure 8. Decomposition analysis. A: Prevalence; B: Incidence; C: Mortality. For incidence rates, epidemiological change was the largest contributor in South Korea (61.64%) and China (43.65%). In contrast, population growth dominated in North Korea (80.43%) and Mongolia (78.51%). Aging accounted for 27.58% of the change in China, 67.93% in Japan, and only 2.94% in North Korea. Mongolia showed a slight negative contribution from aging (−3.79%), suggesting a potential offset effect ( Figure 8(B) Regarding mortality, aging was the most influential factor in China (88.36%), Japan (103.99%), and South Korea (86.37%). Population growth had the largest effect in North Korea (49.52%) and Mongolia (58.10%). Notably, epidemiological change had a negative contribution in China (−14.04%), Japan (−6.30%), South Korea (−0.76%), and North Korea (−22.13%), indicating possible improvements in disease management or health interventions. Mongolia was the exception, where epidemiological change had a small positive effect (4.60%) ( Figure 8(C) 3.6. ARIMA prediction In China, the ASPR increased from 69.90 in 1990 to 168.62 in 2021, and is projected to reach 189.93 by 2030 and 204.14 by 2036 ( Figure S12A Figure S12B Figure S12C Figure S12D Figure S12E For ASIR, China showed growth from 19.04 in 1990 to 31.44 in 2021, with projections of 35.47 by 2030 and 38.15 by 2036 ( Figure 9(A) Figure 9(B) Figure 9(C) Figure 9(D) Figure 9(E) Figure 9.

Female ASIR rose slightly from 33.71 in 1990 to 35.62 in 2021, with projections of 33.31 in 2030 and 31.91 in 2036 ( Figure 11(B) In South Korea, the ASIR for males nearly doubled from 24.57 in 1990 to 48.80 in 2021, and is expected to decline to 47.13 by 2030 and 44.82 by 2036. Among females, the rate increased from 16.06 in 1990 to 25.00 in 2021, and is projected to slightly decrease to 23.91 in 2030 and 23.38 in 2036 ( Figure 11(C) In North Korea, male ASIR rose modestly from 17.11 in 1990 to 19.28 in 2021, and is expected to stabilize at 19.16 in 2030 and 19.06 in 2036. For females, the ASIR increased from 11.88 in 1990 to 12.65 in 2021, then is predicted to decline slightly to 12.06 in 2030 and 11.66 in 2036 ( Figure 11(D) In Mongolia, male ASIR increased from 8.81 in 1990 to 12.08 in 2021, with projections of 13.55 in 2030 and 14.72 in 2036. The female ASIR rose modestly from 8.62 in 1990 to 8.95 in 2021, and is expected to remain nearly stable, with values of 8.93 in 2030 and 8.94 in 2036 ( Figure 11(E) 4. Discussion This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the CRC burden in selected East Asian countries from 1990 to 2021, highlighting key epidemiological trends and regional disparities that are critical for informing public health policies and guiding resource allocation. Our findings indicate that China recorded the highest absolute numbers of incidence, prevalence, mortality, YLLs, YLDs, and DALYs among the selected countries in both 1990 and 2021. Japan consistently exhibited the highest age-standardized ASIR, ASMR, ASPR, YLDs rate, YLLs rate, and ASDR during the same period. In contrast, Mongolia reported the lowest numbers and rates for these metrics in both years. From 1990 to 2021, the ASPR, ASIR, and age-standardized YLDs rate in the region showed an overall upward trend, while the age-standardized YLLs rate and ASDR demonstrated a general decline. The AAPCs of ASPR, ASMR, YLDs rate, YLLs rate, and ASDR in China, North Korea, and Mongolia were all higher than the global averages. These results emphasize the substantial CRC burden in East Asia, particularly in China and Japan. From an age-specific perspective, individuals aged 50 years and older accounted for the highest numbers of cases and burden (incidence, prevalence, mortality, YLDs, YLLs, and DALYs) across sexes in 2021. Additionally, the highest rates for these indicators were consistently observed among those aged 70 and above. The prevalence and incidence rates in East Asia are strongly influenced by population aging, exceeding global levels. Mortality rates, except in Mongolia, are similarly affected by aging and remain above global averages, underscoring a significant disease burden among elderly populations. Globally, gastrointestinal cancers account for nearly one-third of cancer-related deaths, with CRC contributing the largest share [ 20 21–25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Using the ARIMA and BAPC models, we projected CRC trends up to 2036. Compared to 2021, the ASPR in China, Japan, South Korea, and North Korea is expected to increase by 2036, whereas Mongolia’s ASPR began declining after peaking around 2019. The ASIR of China and South Korea is projected to rise by 2036. In Japan, the ASIR peaked around 2016, declined, and then showed a minor increase in 2021. In North Korea, ASIR peaked around 2010, declined, and is expected to rise again by 2030. In Mongolia, ASIR declined following a peak in 2019 and has remained stable since 2021. As for mortality, the ASMR in China, Japan, and North Korea is projected to decline by 2036, while South Korea’s ASMR is expected to remain stable. In Mongolia, ASMR displayed two notable peaks—in 1996 and 2019—suggesting fluctuating burden trends over time. Our study has several limitations that warrant consideration. Although the GBD data provide a valuable and comprehensive resource for analysing global cancer incidence and mortality, certain limitations affect their interpretation. First, the completeness and quality of cancer registries vary substantially across countries and regions. In low- and middle-income countries, underreporting and incomplete case ascertainment are common, which may result in an underestimation of the true CRC burden. While statistical models can partially compensate for data gaps, estimates in low-SDI regions often rely on predictive covariates or global trends, sometimes informed by data from a single country. These extrapolations may be less representative, and thus, caution is needed when interpreting findings from such areas. There is a clear need for additional high-quality, population-based studies, particularly in data-scarce settings. Second, the GBD framework, being primarily descriptive, does not directly estimate environmental, lifestyle, screening, or genetic drivers of CRC trends, limiting causal inference and fueling disagreement about the relative contributions of behavior, environment, and healthcare access. Third, model dependence and the choice of covariates introduce additional, partially unquantified uncertainty (for example, model misspecification and biased predictors) that may not be fully captured by published uncertainty intervals. These limitations highlight the importance of cautious interpretation and emphasize the need for ongoing improvements in global cancer surveillance. Our findings highlight critical targets for public health action aimed at reducing the CRC burden: Expand evidence-based screening programs Adopt age-sensitive prevention strategies Strengthen cancer registry infrastructure 5. Conclusions In conclusion, the CRC disease burden in selected East Asian countries has steadily increased over the past three decades, particularly among elderly populations. Given the multifactorial nature of CRC pathogenesis, future research should emphasize etiological mechanisms and the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. This study underscores the urgent need for coordinated cancer control strategies across healthcare systems, policymakers, community organizations, and international agencies. Alignment of resources, strengthened research collaboration, and implementation of effective policy frameworks are critical to ensuring comprehensive cancer care and reducing the CRC burden in East Asia. Public health efforts must prioritize early diagnosis and prevention, while optimizing the regional distribution of healthcare resources and advancing effective environmental health policies. Strengthening CRC epidemiological research in the region is essential—particularly to inform differentiated, precision-based prevention and control strategies across regions, age groups, and genders. Furthermore, greater attention should be directed toward rehabilitation and long-term care to enhance patient quality of life and reduce strain on healthcare systems [ 34 35 Taken together, these issues imply that modeled regional estimates are valuable for hypothesis generation and broad planning but should be interpreted cautiously, prioritized with investments in standardized, population‑based cancer registries, subjected to transparent modeling and sensitivity analyses, and complemented by etiologic research so that future work can move from descriptive burden estimates toward context‑specific prevention and control strategies for CRC in East Asia. In future research, we will continue to monitor GBD updates and investigate the environmental, genetic, and lifestyle factors that contribute to variations in CRC trends across the selected East Asian countries.
