Breast-conserving therapy (BCT) is a key treatment option for early-stage breast cancer, balancing oncologic control with cosmetic outcomes. However, postoperative breast deformities occur in approximately 25% to 30% of cases, significantly impacting patients’ body image and psychological well-being. Although advances in oncoplastic surgery have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of corrective procedures—effectively improving breast appearance, alleviating anxiety, and enhancing quality of life—the acceptance rate of such surgeries remains relatively low in China. This reluctance is influenced by multiple factors, including personal characteristics, social support, disease-related features, and treatment experiences. This article reviews the necessity and safety of deformity correction after BCT, as well as the factors affecting patients’ willingness to undergo such procedures. The aim is to help clinicians identify suitable candidates for corrective surgery, promote multidisciplinary interventions and decision-making support, and ultimately improve the correction rate and overall quality of life for breast cancer patients. breast-conserving surgery postoperative deformity willingness for correction influencing factors breast cancer The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-in-acceptance Breast Cancer 1 Background According to the latest data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) released in 2020, breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women worldwide, accounting for an estimated 11.7% of new cancer cases ( 1 2 3 4 However, recent studies have reported that approximately 25% to 30% of patients develop varying degrees of breast deformities after undergoing conventional breast-conserving surgery (CBCS). The more pronounced the deformity, the higher the risk of depressive symptoms—reported at 16.2% for mild asymmetry, 18.0% for moderate, and up to 33.7% for severe asymmetry ( 5 2 Material and methods We conducted a literature search in PubMed from inception to February 2025. The search strategy included a combination of keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH) related to “oncoplastic breast-conserving reconstruction,” “post–breast-conserving surgery,” “deformity correction,” “perforator flap,” “willingness for correction,” and “influencing factors.” Articles were screened for relevance based on titles and abstracts, and full texts were reviewed when necessary. Additional references were identified through manual searching of the bibliographies of selected articles. 2.1 Current status and impact of breast deformities after breast-conserving surgery In recent years, with improvements in early breast cancer screening and evolving treatment paradigms, breast-conserving surgery (BCS) has seen increasingly widespread use in clinical practice. However, the incidence of postoperative breast deformities remains high. These deformities—ranging from asymmetry and contour depressions to scarring—compromise the aesthetic integrity of the breast and may lead to psychological distress and social withdrawal ( 6 7 8 9 6 10 2.2 Safety and surgical options for correcting breast deformities after breast-conserving surgery Currently, a wide range of surgical techniques are available for correcting breast deformities following BCS. With advances in reconstructive surgery, local perforator flaps such as the anterior intercostal artery perforator (AICAP) flap, thoracodorsal artery perforator (TDAP) flap, and lateral intercostal artery perforator (LICAP) flap have proven effective in repairing post-BCS breast defects. Studies have shown that flap techniques can safely restore breast contour ( 11 12 13 14 Autologous fat grafting (AFG) is another well-established method for addressing localized volume deficits. Evidence suggests that AFG does not increase the risk of cancer recurrence ( 15 16 17 For patients presenting with macromastia or breast asymmetry following BCS, reduction mammaplasty and mastopexy are often recommended. These procedures have not been shown to increase the risk of tumor recurrence, and their complications are generally controllable, supporting their safety ( 18 19 p 20 21  Table 1 Table 1 Common complications and reported incidence of deformity correction techniques after breast-conserving surgery. Surgical technique Main complications Reported incidence (from included studies) References Autologous fat grafting (AFG) Fat necrosis, oil cysts, volume resorption No recurrence increase observed; Local recurrence rate: 3.15% (AFG group) vs 5.3% (non-AFG) ( 16 17 Local perforator flap Partial flap necrosis, wound dehiscence, seroma Flap necrosis: rare ( 13 14 Latissimus dorsi (LD) flap Donor site morbidity (pain, seroma), scar No specific complication rate reported; used for large defects ( 14 Reduction mammoplasty/Mastopexy Nipple-areola sensory loss, asymmetry, wound healing delay Local recurrence rate: 4.1% during 5-year follow-up (n=77) ( 19 Contralateral symmetry procedures Extended surgery time, wound tension No significant difference in contralateral cancer rate: 8.6% vs 5.7% (p=0.87) ( 20 Implant-based techniques (rare in BCT correction) Capsular contracture, radiation-related complications Higher complication rate post-radiotherapy: 68% vs. 31% (p=0.006) ( 56 2.3 Clinical necessity and outcome evaluation of deformity correction after breast-conserving surgery With the ongoing refinement of breast-conserving techniques, the concept of oncoplastic surgery has emerged as a critical advancement in the field. According to the American Society of Breast Surgeons, oncoplastic techniques are generally categorized into two approaches: volume displacement and volume replacement ( 8 22 23 24 25 A study by P.Berrino et al. demonstrated that 78% of patients with Grade II deformities who underwent corrective surgery achieved good to excellent cosmetic outcomes ( 26 27 28 In previous studies, a lack of standardized tools for evaluating patient satisfaction and aesthetic outcomes has been noted, with most satisfaction data derived from case series being largely subjective. In response, several objective assessment tools have recently been introduced for evaluating postoperative outcomes. For instance, computer-based programs such as BCCT. Core (Breast Cancer Conservative Treatment: Core) have been widely promoted for the objective scoring of cosmetic outcomes in breast-conserving treatment ( 29 30 31 2.4 Factors influencing willingness to undergo deformity correction after breast-conserving surgery A study conducted by the University of Texas found that among women dissatisfied with their cosmetic outcomes following BCS, 46.2% expressed interest in undergoing breast reconstruction ( 32 33 34  Table 2 Table 2 Patient-related influencing factors. Category of factors Specific factors and manifestations Tendency References Personal and Psychological Concern for breast appearance Tends to accept ( 36 60 Fear of surgical risks (e.g., complications, anesthesia, recovery time) Tends to decline ( 58 59 Presence of anxiety or depression Tends to decline ( 24 52 High aesthetic expectations Tends to accept ( 60 Socio-demographic Age < 50 years Tends to accept ( 34 36 Higher education level Tends to accept ( 40 43 Urban residence Tends to accept ( 38 39 Employed outside the home Tends to accept ( 48 Spousal or family support Tends to accept ( 49 Religious or cultural concerns Tends to decline ( 43 44 Physical and Clinical Obesity (BMI > 30) Tends to decline ( 46 47 Large tumor size or advanced TNM stage Tends to decline ( 20 38 History of radiotherapy Tends to decline ( 55 56 Moderate to severe deformity (Grade II–III) Tends to accept ( 26 57 Healthcare System Lack of surgical information provided by physicians Tends to decline or hesitate ( 61 62 Lack of insurance coverage for corrective procedures Tends to decline ( 76 78 2.4.1 Sociodemographic factors 2.4.1.1 Age Age is a critical factor influencing the willingness to undergo corrective procedures. According to data from China’s National Cancer Center, the age-standardized incidence of breast cancer peaks in the 45 – 54 age group ( 35 36 2.4.1.2 Economic status and geographic location Socioeconomic status and place of residence also significantly affect the likelihood of choosing reconstructive surgery. A study from Western Australia revealed that patients from disadvantaged backgrounds—particularly those with low income or living in rural areas—were less likely to undergo reconstruction ( 37 P 38 39 2.4.1.3 Race and cultural background One U.S. study found that patients living in communities with lower educational attainment (i.e., where more than 21% of residents had not completed high school) had significantly lower breast reconstruction rates than those in more educated areas (OR=1.152; 95% CI=1.104 – 1.203; p 40 p p p 41 42 P 43 44 45 2.4.1.4 Body mass index Overweight and obesity—defined as BMI >25 and BMI >30, respectively—are associated with decreased willingness for corrective surgery. This may be due to concerns about postoperative complications, which tend to be more common in obese patients ( 46 47 2.4.1.5 Employment status Employment status is another relevant factor. One study showed that among patients who did not undergo breast reconstruction, a significantly higher proportion were unemployed (48.9% vs. 21.3%, P 48 2.4.1.6 Spousal support Spousal support plays a crucial role in reconstruction decision-making. A domestic qualitative study found that a partner’s attitude significantly affected a patient’s willingness to pursue reconstruction ( 49 50 51 2.4.1.7 Psychological factors A study from Australia found that regret associated with reconstruction decisions was strongly linked to poor body image and psychological distress ( 52 53 2.4.2 Disease-related factors 2.4.2.1 Tumor size Several studies have shown that the likelihood of undergoing breast reconstruction decreases as the size of the invasive tumor increases ( 41 20 2.4.2.2 TNM stage Advanced TNM staging is associated with a higher risk of local recurrence and lower disease-free survival, which may influence patients to forgo reconstruction. Studies have confirmed that patients with later-stage disease are less likely to opt for breast reconstruction ( 38 in situ 36 2.4.2.3 Radiotherapy Generally, all patients with invasive breast cancer undergoing BCS are recommended to receive whole-breast radiotherapy ( 54 55 P P ( 56 2.4.2.4 Degree of deformity Based on Clough’s classification ( 57 2.4.3 Other factors 2.4.3.1 Fear and anxiety about surgery Fear of undergoing a second surgery is one of the most commonly cited reasons for declining corrective procedures ( 58 59 2.4.3.2 High expectations for postoperative aesthetic outcome Many patients hope to restore their preoperative breast appearance through corrective surgery, thereby avoiding the emotional distress caused by wearing prostheses or seeing bodily changes in the mirror. Some seek to reclaim a sense of normalcy and femininity. In a multicenter qualitative study comparing mastectomy and oncoplastic BCS, one of the most influential factors in patient choice was the desire to preserve or restore feminine identity and appearance postoperatively ( 60 2.4.3.3 Surgeons’ attitudes toward deformity correction Surgeons’ attitudes toward reconstruction can significantly affect patients’ willingness to undergo deformity correction. A nationwide survey in Japan found that 31.3% of breast surgeons never provided patients with information about reconstructive options ( 61 62 63 2.5 Types of corrective procedures for postoperative breast deformity For patients with a strong desire for correction, selecting an appropriate surgical approach is crucial. Common techniques include: 1. Flap-based reconstruction – such as local tissue advancement flaps, latissimus dorsi (LD) flaps, thoracodorsal artery perforator (TDAP) flaps, and deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flaps; 2. Reduction mammaplasty, mastopexy, or implant placement; 3. Autologous fat grafting or liposuction; 4. Scar revision or secondary reconstruction modifications. As shown in  Table 3 64 65 Table 3 Comparative overview of deformity correction techniques. Procedure Advantages Disadvantages Indications Local Flap Transfer (e.g., LD flap) Good blood supply, can fill larger defects Significant surgical trauma, potential large scarring and functional Moderate to large breast tissue defects; unsuitable for implant or fat reconstruction; requires relatively sufficient local tissue Distal Flap (e.g., abdominal muscle flap) Sufficient volume, can correct large deformities simultaneously Longer procedure, higher risk of long-term complications Large tissue defects requiring substantial volume reconstruction Autologous Fat Grafting Maintains natural feel; minimally invasive, no visible incisions, natural shape Varying fat survival rates; limited volume of grafts; potential for fat necrosis or complications post-op Small volume deficiencies, poor breast contour; patients with moderate BMI Contralateral Breast Correction Improves symmetry between both breasts, enhances overall aesthetics Increases surgical scope, may require additional recovery time Significant asymmetry in contralateral breast after breast-conserving surgery Breast Reduction/Fixation Improves ptosis, restores breast contour and symmetry, suitable for larger breasts Reduces glandular tissue, potential for nipple sensation loss or scarring Moderate to large breasts with ptosis, mild to moderate volume asymmetry or deformity Biological Fillers Simple procedure with no donor site damage High cost, risk of foreign body infection Thin patients or those with insufficient local tissue; seeking minimally invasive options LD flap, Latissimus Dorsi flap. The extent of the defect is categorized based on the proportion of total breast volume lost. A loss of less than 15% is considered a small defect, 15% to 30% is considered a moderate defect, and greater than 30% is considered a large defect. This can also be assessed in conjunction with the extent of anatomical structure damage. In addition to surgical repair, a comprehensive patient-centered strategy should incorporate psychological support. As shown in  Figure 1 66 67 68 69 30 Figure 1 Preoperative evaluation of patients’ general treatment preferences and psychological condition. Preoperative chart for evaluating patients' psychological conditions and treatment preferences. Key criteria for psychological evaluation include depression, body image distress, and fear of cancer recurrence. Treatment recommendations based on defect extent: less than 15% suggests biological fillers or fat transfer; 15-30% involves local flap transfer; over 30% requires high cooperation for distal flap. Breast asymmetry leads to symmetrization or reduction surgery. 2.6 Clinical practice recommendations and strategies To address the multifaceted factors influencing Chinese women’s willingness to undergo corrective surgery after BCS, several practical strategies should be implemented—ranging from physician communication and public education to policy reform and insurance coverage. First, medical professionals should enhance health education regarding breast deformity correction and diversify the channels through which patients receive information. Lack of knowledge or misconceptions may deter patients from pursuing corrective procedures. Surgeons should use verbal explanations, visual aids, internet resources, and videos to communicate accurate, evidence-based information ( 70 71 Second, surgeons should implement personalized psychological interventions. Existing studies show that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) aimed at reducing body image anxiety can significantly improve postoperative adjustment ( 67 72 73 74 75 Finally, more attention should be paid to spousal support and healthcare policy. Partners should be encouraged to respect and support patients’ decisions, empowering them to pursue surgery with confidence. Economic concerns are among the primary reasons for declining reconstruction ( 76 77 78 3 Conclusion and outlook With the widespread adoption of breast-conserving surgery (BCS), increasing attention has been paid to postoperative breast aesthetics and quality of life. Although BCS has been widely validated for its oncologic safety, the incidence of postoperative breast deformities remains non-negligible, with significant implications for patients’ psychological health and social functioning. Current evidence supports that deformity correction procedures are safe and effective, offering substantial improvements in breast appearance, self-image, and quality of life. However, the overall correction rate in China remains low due to various barriers, including patient-specific factors, unequal access to healthcare resources, and insufficient postoperative education. Most current research in this field relies on retrospective case series, lacking large-scale, multicenter, prospective randomized trials ( 17 29 79 Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank the medical staff and administrative personnel at Shanxi Bethune Hospital and the Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University for their support.
