Treating cats can be difficult because there are few effective drugs available, and the commonly used one does not always work well. In this study, 29 cats with sporotrichosis were treated with the usual drug (itraconazole) combined with a natural substance called beta-glucans, which may help the immune system. Most cats (about 72%) were cured within 10 weeks. Some cats had lesions in their noses and respiratory problems, which often makes treatment harder. A small number of cats did not get better or were lost to follow-up during the study, and side effects were rare. These results suggest that adding beta-glucans to itraconazole might help cats recover better and reduce side effects. This could improve care for cats with sporotrichosis and help prevent the spread of the disease.

Introduction Feline sporotrichosis is a subcutaneous mycosis caused by pathogenic species of the genus Sporothrix S. brasiliensis S. schenckii S. globosa S. humicola 1 S. davidellisii 2 S. schenckii S. brasiliensis 1 S. brasiliensis 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Feline sporotrichosis can be acquired through traumatic implantation from environmental sources such as plant material, soil, and decaying wood. Transmission can also occur through contact with infected cats, primarily via bites, scratches, or exposure to lesion exudates and respiratory droplets [ 1 10 1 11 12 13 14 Sporothrix 15 16 17 18 Sporotrichosis occurs more frequently in young adult, mixed-breed, unneutered male cats. Clinical presentations range from a single localized lesion to multiple lesions, with some cases progressing to fatal systemic dissemination. Nasal mucosal involvement is frequent and commonly associated with respiratory signs such as sneezing, inspiratory dyspnea, and nasal discharge. Lymphadenomegaly is a typical finding, whereas lymphangitis is less frequently documented [ 19 20 21 To date, few effective antifungal drugs are available for the treatment of this mycosis in cats, and therapeutic studies remain scarce. Although itraconazole (ITZ) remains the first-line therapy for feline sporotrichosis, accumulating evidence indicates that this recommendation should be considered with nuance. Reported cure rates have varied substantially across studies, ranging from 77% in naïve cats [ 22 20 23 24 25 26 20 20 26 The main adverse reactions associated with the treatment using ITZ, whether as monotherapy or in combination with KI, are well documented in the literature. These include gastrointestinal disturbances, such as diarrhea, anorexia, vomiting, and hyporexia, as well as elevations in liver enzymes [ 20 27 Other systemic antifungal agents described for the treatment of feline sporotrichosis include ketoconazole, KI as monotherapy, sodium iodide, fluconazole, terbinafine, posaconazole, isavuconazole, and amphotericin B. Adjunctive therapies include local heat therapy, laser therapy, photodynamic therapy, cryosurgery, surgical excision of lesions, and intranasal clotrimazole spray [ 19 21 25 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 Multiple factors can influence the therapeutic response in feline sporotrichosis. Treatment success depends not only on the host-pathogen interaction and owner adherence, but also on therapy-related variables such as drug formulation, administration practices, and the pharmacokinetics of antifungal agents [ 21 39 Sporothrix 1 40 41 Beyond the variability in reported cure rates, studies have provided insights into why ITZ monotherapy often fails. Histopathological analyses of refractory nasal lesions have revealed persistent fungal structures and scarce immune cell infiltration despite prolonged therapy [ 42 23 low 43 In light of these challenges, there has been growing interest in exploring adjunctive strategies capable of enhancing the host immune response to improve treatment outcomes. β-glucans are naturally occurring polysaccharides found in the cell walls of yeasts, mushrooms, algae, bacteria, barley, and oats [ 44 45 46 47 The unicellular alga Euglena gracilis 48 49 E. gracilis 50 In veterinary medicine, studies investigating E. gracilis 51 52 53 54 E. gracilis In this context, there is a clear need for alternative or adjunctive therapeutic strategies that can overcome the limitations of ITZ monotherapy and reduce the adverse reactions associated with the ITZ + KI regimen. Despite their documented immunomodulatory and hepatoprotective properties in other species and clinical conditions, β-glucans from E. gracilis E. gracilis 2. Materials and Methods This was a prospective, uncontrolled interventional study, conducted between 2023 and 2024 at Laboratório de Pesquisa Clínica em Dermatozoonoses em Animais Domésticos (Lapclin-Dermzoo), Instituto Nacional de Infectologia Evandro Chagas (INI), Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz). The study protocol and informed consent form were approved by the Institutional Ethics Commission on the Use of Animals (CEUA/Fiocruz), under license number LW26/23. 2.1. Inclusion, Exclusion and Elimination Criteria Cats aged between 6 months and 8 years, weighing at least 3 kg, and showing clinical signs suggestive of sporotrichosis were included. Exclusion criteria comprised prior treatment with oral antifungals or corticosteroids, as well as pregnancy or lactation. Cats with negative fungal culture results or whose owners declined treatment were withdrawn from the study. 2.2. Study Procedures and Techniques All cats enrolled in the study were evaluated monthly through clinical examination, collection of clinical specimens, and photographic documentation. A detailed anamnesis was performed at each follow-up visit. Information provided by the owners was used to estimate the duration between the appearance of clinical signs and the initial clinical evaluation. At the first visit, samples for fungal culture were collected from ulcerated cutaneous lesions using a sterile swab and seeded onto Sabouraud dextrose agar and Mycosel agar (Difco™; Becton, Dickinson and Company, Sparks Glencoe, MD, USA), incubated at 25 °C, and observed for four weeks for fungal growth. Dimorphism was demonstrated by conversion to the yeast-like form on brain heart infusion agar medium (Difco™) at 37 °C [ 1 The presence of cutaneous and/or mucosal lesions, extracutaneous signs (lymphadenomegaly and respiratory signs), and the animal’s overall condition (good, fair, or poor) were evaluated during clinical examination. To estimate the level of dissemination of cutaneous lesions, the cats were divided into three groups: L1 (cutaneous lesions at one site), L2 (cutaneous lesions at two non-adjacent sites), and L3 (cutaneous lesions at three or more non-adjacent sites) [ 19 Blood samples were collected for serum biochemistry evaluation (urea, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], and gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT]). 2.3. Treatment The research team supervised the treatment process throughout the study, with evaluations conducted at each follow-up visit. The cats were treated with ITZ capsule (100 mg per cat; Traxonol ® E. gracilis ® Owners were instructed to administer both drugs simultaneously, either directly into the oral cavity or mixed with small amount of canned cat food. They were also advised to contact the veterinary staff if signs of hepatotoxicity occurred, such as hyporexia, vomiting, or diarrhea. All procedures and drugs were provided free of charge. For the purposes of this study, the cats were followed up for a maximum period of 5 months predefined based on the median treatment duration observed in previous studies using ITZ monotherapy [ 20 2.4. Monitoring of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) Adverse clinical reactions and laboratory abnormalities were evaluated in the follow-up appointments. Cats presenting anorexia or hyporexia combined with body loss of >10% or the association of adverse clinical reactions and elevated serum aminotransferase had their treatment interrupted temporarily for a minimum of 7 days and received hepatoprotective therapy consisting of oral silymarin (30 mg/kg/day; compounded formulation) until the end of the study [ 20 Laboratory abnormalities were classified as mild (serum transaminase levels less than two times the upper limit of the reference range), moderate (serum transaminase levels two to five times the upper limit of the reference range), or marked (serum transaminase levels greater than five times the upper limit of the reference range) [ 55 2.5. Statistical Analysis An exploratory analysis of the database was performed, along with univariate and bivariate analyses. For continuous variables (age and weight), and measures of central tendency (median) were used. Frequency analysis was performed for categorical variables, including sex, neuter status, overall condition, distribution of cutaneous lesions, cutaneous lesions on the nasal region, mucosal lesions, respiratory signs, ADRs, time until clinical cure, and outcomes. A time-to-event analysis was performed using Kaplan–Meier survival curves to evaluate clinical cure. Survival distributions were compared with the log-rank test across three variables: presence or absence of mucosal lesions, neuter status, and outdoor access. Statistical significance was defined as p All analyses were performed using R statistical software, version 4.4.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). 3. Results A total of 92 cats were evaluated for eligibility. Of these, 42 cats with suspected sporotrichosis met the inclusion criteria and were initially enrolled. Among them, 13 (31.0%) were withdrawn from the study, either due to a negative fungal culture (5; 11.9%) or owner refusal (8; 19.1%). The remaining 29 (69.0%) were followed until a final outcome was reached. All animals were mixed-breed cats from metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro. Most were male (25; 86.2%) and in good overall condition (21; 72.4%). The median age was 33 months (range: 11–72 months), and the median weight was 4.3 kg (range: 3.0–5.7 kg). More than half of the cats (17; 58.2%) had outdoor access. The time interval between the onset of clinical signs ranged from 1 to 48 weeks, with a median of 4 weeks. Ulcerative cutaneous lesions were observed in all animals. The cephalic region was the most affected anatomical site (24; 82.7%), and 15 (51.7%) had lesions on the nasal area. Mucosal involvement was noted in 19 (65.5%), predominantly affecting the nasal mucosa (18; 62.1%), of which 4 (4; 13,8%) also presented conjunctival lesions. Additionally, 1 cat exhibited exclusive conjunctival involvement (1; 3,4%). Respiratory signs, including sneezing, rhinorrhea, or inspiratory dyspnea, were reported in 17 (58.6%). Only one cat exhibited nodular ascending lymphangitis. Treatment Outcome Clinical cure was achieved in 21 cats (72.4%), with a median time to cure of 10 weeks (range: 4–19 weeks) ( Figure 1 Kaplan–Meier survival analyses were performed to explore prognostic variables associated with time to clinical cure. Cats with mucosal involvement had a significantly longer time to cure compared to those without (log-rank test, p Figure 2 p p Failure occurred in 5 (17.2%), of which 3 (10.3%) presented with respiratory signs, nasal mucosal lesions, cutaneous lesions at three or more sites (L3), and fair overall condition. Three cats (10.3%) were lost to follow-up: two escaped, and one had scheduled visits discontinued by the owner despite repeated contact attempts. No deaths occurred during the study period. Regarding the administration of ITZ by the owners, 17 (58.6%) received this drug as an opened capsule mixed with food, while 12 (41.4%) received a closed capsule. ADRs were observed in 2 cats (6.9%) within the first month of treatment. One cat experienced anorexia, vomiting, and weight loss, while the other presented anorexia and weight loss associated with mild ALT and AST elevation. In both cases, treatment was temporarily suspended for 7 days, and oral silymarin was maintained throughout the study period. The clinical, laboratory and therapeutic characteristics of all cats are described in Table 1 4. Discussion The role of β-glucans in fungal infections remains poorly explored. Given the challenges in managing feline sporotrichosis, this study evaluated the potential benefits of combining β-glucans with ITZ in this context. In cats with sporotrichosis treated with ITZ, clinical cure rates vary widely, ranging from 38.8% to 100% [ 20 22 29 56 20 29 20 46 47 57 58 59 60 50 The time between the appearance of cutaneous lesions and the initial clinical visit in this study was shorter (median: 4 weeks) than that reported in previous studies (median: 8 weeks) [ 19 20 22 21 To reduce owner contact with sick animals and minimize the risk of zoonotic transmission, administering ITZ as an opened capsule mixed with food is recommended [ 21 39 There are few reports on the use of β-glucans as adjuncts in the treatment of cutaneous diseases in dogs and cats. A dog with refractory demodicosis and secondary infections was treated with ivermectin, antibiotics, and daily β-glucan (20 mg), showing clinical and microscopic improvement after two months; however, the β-glucan source was not specified, and the improvements could not be solely attributed to it due to concurrent therapies [ 61 62 63 64 In our study, most cats that experienced treatment failure presented with respiratory signs, nasal mucosal involvement, cutaneous lesions affecting three or more sites (L3), and a fair overall condition. These clinical features have been previously recognized as prognostic markers, thereby underscoring their significance in predicting therapeutic outcomes in feline sporotrichosis [ 20 22 29 p 20 The treatment abandonment rate was comparatively low, especially when contrasted with earlier studies, reporting rates ranging from 34% to 38.5% [ 19 65 20 ® In our study, the incidence of ADRs was low (6.9%), with only one case of laboratory abnormality (3.5%). This rate is lower than those reported in previous studies, which described clinical ADRs in up to 42.2% of cats and elevated serum transaminases in 60% of cases during ITZ monotherapy [ 20 29 60 66 67 E. gracilis 68 In Brazil, an important strategy for treating feline sporotrichosis is the combination of ITZ with KI. A study evaluating this regimen reported a higher clinical cure rate (88%); however, clinical ADRs were more frequent (47%), as well as laboratory abnormalities (51.8%) [ 20 Although 92 cats were initially evaluated, only 42 (45.6%) met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled. Most exclusions were due to prior antifungal treatment, reflecting the epidemiological context of the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro, where feline sporotrichosis has been endemic for over two decades and cat owners are familiar with ITZ as the primary treatment, often using it empirically before seeking specialized care. Despite the limited sample size, the findings provide clinical insights and underscore the potential of combining ITZ with β-glucans in feline sporotrichosis. 5. Conclusions Feline sporotrichosis has limited therapeutic options and treatment failures are frequent. In the population of cats studied the combination of ITZ with β-glucans derived from E. gracilis Acknowledgments We would like to thank the staff of the Laboratório de Dermatozoonoses em Animais Domésticos (INI/Fiocruz), with a special acknowledgment to Rodrigo Caldas Menezes.
