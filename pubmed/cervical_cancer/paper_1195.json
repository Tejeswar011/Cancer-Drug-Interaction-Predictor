However, their potential to affect reproductive success in cattle during pregnancy has not been directly confirmed. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the investigated pesticides on cervical contractions in pregnant cows. Cervical strips from cows at 4–6 months of gestation were treated with the eight singular pesticides (used at non-toxic, environmental dose) or oestradiol (E2) under two different conditions (37.5 °C for 24 h and 4 °C for 48 h), which were applied to assess pesticide effects under both physiological and prolonged-exposure settings. The strength of the contractions was then measured. The findings of the study demonstrated that both the carbamates and glyphosate increased the force of cervical strip contractions to a greater extent than cypermethrin. In contrast, fenvalerate was observed to induce a state of cervical relaxation, analogous to the effects of E2, while DDT, malathion and atrazine exerted no effect on cervical motor function during the period of pregnancy under investigation. These preliminary findings indicate a potential impact of pesticides on cervical function during pregnancy, but should be interpreted with caution as they are based on isolated tissue at a single concentration. Further in vivo and dose–response studies are needed to confirm their biological and clinical relevance. pesticides insecticides herbicides contractions cervix pregnancy cow National Science Centre, Poland 2017/25/B/NZ9/01620 Polish Academy of Sciences 14/FBW/2023 21/FBW/2024 This study was supported by the National Science Centre, Poland (Project 2017/25/B/NZ9/01620) and by the Polish Academy of Sciences (14/FBW/2023, 21/FBW/2024). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Plant protection products find application in the management of pests, which may include insects and weeds. The predominant chemical classifications of synthetic insecticides encompass the categories of organochlorine, organophosphate, carbamate, and pyrethroid. Following the production of DDT in the late 1940s, organochlorine chemicals were the first to be introduced. The recognition of DDT as a persistent environmental pollutant [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 5 8 9 10 11 Due to their persistence and widespread use, all the pesticides studied have been detected in the environment or in living organisms. Furthermore, these levels have been shown to be highly comparable. Carbaryl has been detected in water (0.2–4 ng/mL) [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 After bioaccumulation, these pesticides have the potential to act as endocrine disruptors [ 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 The cervix plays a pivotal role during pregnancy by maintaining the foetus in a safe and contained uterine environment that gradually closes. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the substance under discussion has the capacity to act as an agent that obstructs the ascent of pathogens from the vagina into the uterine cavity [ 35 36 37 38 38 39 40 41 The cervix is defined as a firm cylinder, connecting the vagina (external os) and the uterus (internal os). Despite the anatomical disparity between the cervix and the uterus, both structures are interconnected via direct anatomical connections, such as gap junctions, which facilitate direct communication between these two anatomical structures. The cervix is lined with a mucus-secreting epithelium, while the deeper part is composed of extracellular matrix (up to 90%, mostly collagen, some elastin, proteoglycans) with minimal cellular content (10–15% fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, glandular cells, vascular cells, immune cells). The cervix is not a homogeneous structure. A notable observation is the presence of significant collagen cross-linking heterogeneity between the internal and external os. The orientation of the inner and outer muscle layers is circular and longitudinal, respectively. The longitudinal muscle layer of the cervix is thicker than the circular layer, and the area of the internal os is significantly more cellular than of the external os, containing approximately 50–60% smooth muscle cells. The outer smooth muscle layer of the bovine cervix is also comparatively thick, in comparison to other species. In addition, the muscle layer on the uterine side is much thicker than that of the vaginal os. [ 38 39 40 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 59 64 65 66 The objective of this study was to ascertain the impact of the pesticides under investigation on cervical contractions during pregnancy. The measurement was conducted with the objective of estimating the potential to disrupt the final reproductive success. Furthermore, in accordance with the findings of our preceding studies concerning the impact of xenobiotics on myometrial contractions, the second objective of these studies was to ascertain the conditions of cervical incubation with the most protracted treatments of environmental doses. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Chemicals Atrazine: 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-1,3,5–triazine [CAS No. 1912-24-9]; carbaryl: 1-Naphthyl-N-methylcarbamate [CAS No. 63-25-2]; cypermethrin: [cyano-(3-phenoxyphenyl)methyl] 3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylate [CAS No. 52315-07-8]; DDT: 1,1,1-Trichloro-2,2-bis (4-chlorophenyl)ethane [CAS No. 50-29-3]; fenvalerate: α-Cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl α-(4-chlorophenyl)-iso-valerate [CAS No. 51630-58-1]; glyphosate: N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine [CAS No. 1071-83-6]; malathion: diethyl 2-dimethoxyphosphinothioylsulfanylbutanedioate [CAS No. 121-75-5]; and thiram (bis-dimethylthiocarbamoyl disulfide) [CAS No. 137-26-8]. All pesticides were of analytical standards purity. They were dissolved in DMSO (HPLC purity grade) at the doses studied, which were in the environmentally relevant range (10 ng/mL). The final concentration of DMSO in the culture media did not exceed 0.1%. Therefore, 0.1% DMSO was added to the control samples. Each medium was then supplemented with gentamicin (20 μL/mL). All materials used in these studies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poznan, Poland) unless otherwise stated. 2.2. Material Bovine cervixes were obtained from a commercial abattoir at 4–6 months of gestation. The stage of gestation was determined according to the criteria of Hafez [ 67 2 4 2 4 2 3 2 2 2 59 64 65 66 60 61 63 59 64 65 66 2 2 5 2 2.3. Preliminary Experiment: Effect of Pesticides on Cell Viability Cervical tissues (n = 4 cows) were incubated for 72 h with each of the pesticides tested separately (at a dose of 10 ng/mL) or with E2 (10 −8 2.4. Experiment: Effect of Pesticides on Cervical Smooth Muscle Contractility The cervical strips were incubated (24 or 48 h) without treatment (control), with E2 (10 −8 59 64 65 66 2.5. Determination of Cell Viability Cell viability after pesticide treatment was measured using by a TOX-1 test (an in vitro toxicology assay kit based on MTT) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. This method is based on the ability of the mitochondrial enzyme dehydrogenase in living cells to convert a tetrazolium salt (MTT; yellow colour) into a formazan (blue colour). The cervical cells were incubated with MTT (20 µL/well) for 4 h. The absorbance of the reaction product was than measured at λ = 570 nm using an ELISA plate reader (Multiscan EX, Labsystem, Vantaa, Finland). 2.6. Measurement of Smooth Muscle Contractions The strips were placed individually into the chambers of an HSE Schuler organ bath apparatus (March–Hugstetten, Germany) containing KRS (10 mL) consisting of NaCl (120.3 mM), KCl (5.9 mM), CaCl 2 2 2 4 3 2 59 64 65 66 2.7. Statistical Analysis The mean (±SEM) values of contraction force were expressed in mN and calculated from all measurements taken at four-second intervals for 15 min. All means (±SEM) were compared using one-way ANOVA for repeated measures, followed by the Newman-Keuls test after testing for normality. All statistical analyses and figure generation were performed using Prism 10 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., Boston, MA, USA). 3. Results The changes in cervical contractions were not evoked by the cytotoxic effects of the applied pesticides. Carbaryl, cypermethrin, thiram, and glyphosate increased the force of contraction of cervical strips. The administration of fenvalerate and E2 reduced in the intensity of cervical contractions. The viability of cervical cells was unaffected by any of the studied pesticides or E2 ( p p Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 3 p Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 3 p Figure 5 p Figure 5 p p p Figure 6 4. Discussion We have carefully studied the mechanism by which the use of pesticides adversely affects cervical function in cattle in vitro during the oestrus cycle [ 59 64 65 66 59 64 65 66 The present study set out to investigate the hypothesis that glyphosate exerts a direct effect on the force of cervical contractions during pregnancy. The results of the study demonstrate that glyphosate does indeed have a direct effect on the force of cervical contractions during pregnancy. This is the first instance in which the direct effect of glyphosate on the spontaneous motor activity of the bovine uterus has been observed. Our previous studies have demonstrated that glyphosate does not affect the force of cervical [ 65 63 It was demonstrated that both carbamates, carbaryl and thiram, produced a stimulatory effect on cervical contractions similar to that previously observed in strips treated with glyphosate. However, it was only thiram that produced the same effect on cervical motor function during the oestrous cycle, in contrast to carbaryl [ 59 59 Furthermore, cypermethrin has been demonstrated to augment the intensity of cervical contractions during pregnancy, though it exerts no direct influence on smooth muscle activity during the oestrous cycle [ 66 66 In the present study, it was observed that some pesticides did not elicit a response. The representative of the organochlorine (DDT) and organophosphate (malathion) insecticides as well as the herbicide atrazine, did not affect the cervical contractions under either condition studied. As previously indicated, atrazine has been demonstrated to exert a significant impact on the force of cervical contractions [ 65 62 64 68 41 60 63 49 69 70 26 29 30 24 27 28 31 32 64 71 It was also noted that E2 led to a reduction in the strength of cervical contractions during pregnancy. The observed decrease in cervical counterattraction has been shown to induce cervical relaxation [ 47 48 38 47 48 72 73 74 In our previous reports, we investigated the adverse effect of chlorinated pesticides [ 41 61 66 75 59 64 65 66 This study has several important limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, the results were obtained using an in vitro cervical smooth muscle model, which does not allow direct extrapolation to clinical reproductive outcomes such as miscarriage, preterm birth, or delivery disorders. Second, only parent pesticide compounds were investigated, whereas their biologically active metabolites were not included; future research should therefore address the potential effects of relevant metabolites. Third, the experiments were conducted using a single effective concentration, selected on the basis of earlier data and published studies, which ensures relevance but limits the ability to establish full dose–response relationships. Finally, the present study focused exclusively on cervical smooth muscle, without assessing other reproductive tissues such as myometrium, endometrium, or placenta. This narrows the scope of interpretation and highlights the need for further studies in a broader reproductive context. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, the carbamates studied (carbaryl, thiram), glyphosate and cypermethrin had a stimulatory effect on the strength of cervical contractions in mid-pregnancy. The effect of atrazine, DDT and malathion were found to be negligible. Conversely, fenvalerate was observed to induce a relaxation of cervical contractions in a manner similar to E2. The results of this study suggest that pesticides are more likely to induce cervical contractions and inhibit labour than they are to induce miscarriages. However, further molecular investigations are required to confirm these findings. Moreover, it is generally accepted that a 24-h incubation at physiological temperature is adequate for the study of the longer-term effects of xenobiotics on cervical contractions. However, the findings are limited to ex vivo cervical tissue tested at a single effective concentration of the parent compounds. Further molecular and functional studies should therefore address relevant metabolites, evaluate dose–response relationships across a range of environmentally relevant exposures, and extend observations to other reproductive tissues. Although a 24-h incubation at physiological temperature proved adequate for assessing pesticide effects under controlled conditions, these mechanistic ex vivo results should not be directly extrapolated to clinical reproductive outcomes without in vivo or epidemiological confirmation.
