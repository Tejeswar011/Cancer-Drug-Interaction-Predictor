This study aimed to investigate the functional mechanism of circRNA-14,052 in breast cancer progression. Methods The biological functions of circRNA-14,052 were assessed using CCK-8, wound healing, flow cytometry assays. The ceRNA regulatory network of circRNA-14,052-miR-214-3p- IKBKB was validated by luciferase reporter assay. Results The levels of circRNA-14,052 were notably elevated, but the levels of miR-214-3p were markedly reduced in breast cancer tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Downregulation of circRNA-14,052 or overexpression of miR-214-3p reduced MCF-7 cell proliferation and triggered cell apoptosis. Mechanically, circRNA-14,052 could elevate IKBKB levels via competitively sponging miR-214-3p. Notably, miR-214-3p inhibition reversed the growth-suppressive effects of circRNA-14,052 silencing. Additionally, circRNA-14,052 knockdown notably reduced IKBKB, IL-6, JAK2 and STAT3 levels in MCF-7 cells; whereas these changes were reversed by miR-214-3p deficiency. Furthermore, deficiency of circRNA-14,052 reduced xenograft tumor growth in vivo through targeting miR-214-3p/IKBKB/IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 axis. Conclusion Collectively, our results showed that circRNA-14,052 promotes breast cancer progression via the miR-214-3p/IKBKB axis. Targeting this molecular axis may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.

Given its marked dysregulation and unknown biological functions, we then aimed to explore the functional role and molecular mechanisms of circRNA-14,052 in breast cancer. We identified miR-214-3p as the binding molecule of circRNA-14,052, noting that their interaction may influence tumor cell growth. MiR-214-3p has emerged as a significant tumor suppressor in various cancers, including breast cancer [ 8 9 Materials and methods Clinical samples Nine pairs of tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected from three breast cancer patients who had surgeries at Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University. The criteria for inclusion included: (a) all subjects satisfied the diagnostic requirements for breast cancer; (b) complete clinical and imaging records were available; (c) comprehensive clinicopathological data for each patient was provided; (d) patients with a history of other malignancies were excluded. The ethical committee of Inner Mongolia Medical University (grant number YJS2024055) approved this study, and all participants gave their informed consent, adhering to the Declaration of Helsinki. Supplementary Table S1 Realtime quantitative PCR Total RNA was extracted with the use of Redzol Reagent (FTR-50, Sbsgenetech, Beijing, China) and examined by Nanodrop (Biosystems, Germany). The extracted RNA underwent reverse transcription to form cDNAs utilizing SureScript™ First-Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (QP056, GeneCopeia, US). RT-qPCR was conducted using the 2×SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (MPC2203026, Servicebio, Wuhan, China). For mRNA, GAPDH served as the internal reference, whereas U6 gene was used for miRNA. Each sample had three replicates. The expression levels were calculated by the 2 –△△CT 1  Table 1 Primer sequences for RT-qPCR Genes Forward Primer (5’-3’) Reverse Primer (5’-3’) GAPDH CGAGATCCCTCCAAAATCAA TTCACACCCATGACGAACAT IKBKB TGAGAAGACTGTTGTCCGGC GCAGGGTGCAGAGGTTATGT miR-214-3p AGCAGGCACAGACAGGCA GCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTC circRNA-14,052 TTGCATGCTCTAACCCTGGG TACCCCTTATCTGCCAGCCT U6 CTCGCTTCGGCAGCACA AACGCTTCACGAATTTGCGT IL-6 TGCCTTCTTGGGACTGAT CTGGCTTTGTCTTTCTTGTT JAK2 AATGAGTGAAACCGAAAG CAGTACCAATGAGGGAAG STAT3 CACCCAACAGCCGCCGTAGT TGCCGCCTCTTCCAGTCA Cell culture and transfection Human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (BNCC100137, BeNa Culture Collection), MDA-MB-231 (BNCC337894, BeNa Culture Collection) and HEK293T cells (CL-0005, Pricella) were utilized at low passage numbers (< 10) [ 10 2 2 For transient transfection, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with miR-214-3p mimic or inhibitor using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent. Construction of stable cell lines The sequence of circRNA14052 siRNA (sense: 5’-UUUAUACCACACUCAAACCCU-3’; anti-sense: 5’-GGUUUGAGUGUGGUAUAAAUU-3’) was cloned into the PGMLV-6751 lentiviral vector. CircRNA14052 overexpression (circRNA-14052-OE) plasmids were obtained from Hanbio. The empty vector was used as the negative control. These vectors were then transfected into HEK293T cells using the Lipofectamine 2000. After 72 h, the virus were collected and transduced into breast cancer cells. After 72 h of cultivation, cells were selected using a culture medium containing puromycin. Two weeks later, a stable circRNA-14,052 knockdown cell line (LV-circRNA-14052 siRNA) and a stable circRNA-14,052 overexpression cell line (LV-circRNA-14052 OE) were established. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay Cell viability was evaluated using CCK-8 (C0009S, Beyotime) reagent. Cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and cultured in a 37℃ incubator. At the time points of 24, 48, and 72 h, all cells were washed by HBSS and added fresh medium with 10 µL of CCK-8 solution for 4 h at 37 ℃. The optical density (OD) of each well was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader. Colony-formation assay Cells were seeded on a 12-well plate, with 1000 cells placed in each well and 3 replicates set for each group. The cells were then incubated for a week until colony formation was visible. The culture medium was discarded and replaced with cell fixative (BN20094, Bioregenmed) to fix for 30 min. After removing the cell fixative, the samples were stained with 0.1% crystal violet staining solution for 3 min. The colonies were observed using a microscope and subsequently counted. Flow cytometry Flow cytometry was performed according to the instructions of Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis kit (AP101, Liankebio). The cells were suspended and mixed with Annexin V-FITC (5 µl). Then, propidium iodide (PI, 5 µl) staining solution was added and incubated in the dark for 15 min, followed by an ice bath. Experiments were performed on a flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with three replicates set for each group. Dual-luciferase reporter assay The dual-luciferase reporter was modified by cloning either the wild-type or mutant 3’-UTR of IKBKB or the wild-type or mutant form of circRNA14052, which contains the binding site for miR-214-3p. Next, 293T cells underwent co-transfection with either miR-214-3p mimics or inhibitor, along with the aforementioned dual-luciferase reporter plasmids, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) for 48 h. The Dual-luciferase Gene Detection Kit (RG006, Beyotime) was performed to assess the luciferase activity. Transwell invasion assay Matrigel (Corning, 356234) was diluted with DMEM to a concentration of 300 µg/mL on ice and then 100 µL was applied to coat the surface of the membrane in the chamber. The chamber was subsequently placed in a 24-well plate and incubated for three hours at 37 ℃. In the lower chamber, 600 µL of medium supplemented with 10% FBS was added. Each well in the upper chamber received 100 µL of a cell suspension containing 1*10 4 Wound-healing assay 5 * 10 5 2 Western blot Western blot assay was employed to determine the protein levels of STAT3, JAK2, IL-6 and IKK beta (IKBKB) in MCF-7 cells or tumor tissues. This method consists of four main steps: (Ⅰ) protein extraction and quantification; (Ⅱ) electrophoresis and transfer; (Ⅲ) immunoblotting and (Ⅳ) detection and analysis. First, proteins were extracted from cells using RIPA lysis buffer (BN25001-A, Bioregenmed, China) and quantified by a BCA test kit (Utibody, SL201). Second, the protein samples were loaded onto 5% SDS-PAGE gel and subsequently transferred onto a PVDF membrane (0000175594, Millipore). Third, the PVDF membrane was blocked in 5% skim milk for 2 h at room temperature, and then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-STAT3 antibody, ab68153, 1:1000; anti-JAK2 antibody, ab108596, 1:2500; anti-IL-6 antibody, ab233551, 1:1000; anti-IKK beta (IKBKB) antibody, ab32135, 1:1000) overnight at 4 ℃ and with a secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (HRP), ab205718, 1:8000, Abcam) for 1.5 h. Finally, images were captured using a chemiluminescence imaging system (ChemiScope6100) and analyzed for grayscale using Image J software. Immunofluorescence staining assay The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde fixative (P0099, Beyotime) for 40 min and washed with PBS three times. The samples were blocked by BCA for 90 min and washed twice with PBS. Samples were subjected to probing with primary antibodies (anti-IL-6 antibody, ab233551; anti-JAK2 antibody, ab108596; anti-STAT3 antibody, ab68153; Abcam), and then a secondary antibody was applied for 20 min. Images were photographed under a fluorescence microscope (BH2-RFCA, OLYMPUS). The nucleus were stained with DAPI (C0065, Solarbio, Beijing, China). Animal experiments Ethical approval and animal care Experiments involving animals were performed in compliance with guidelines by the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and in alignment with ARRIVE guidelines. Animal experiments were approved by the ethics committee of Inner Mongolia Medical University (YJS2024055). A total of twenty BALB/c nude mice (SPF-level, purchased from Spfbiotech, Beijing, China) were fed in a place with a standard light-dark cycle at room temperature (21–26℃) and humidity of 50–60%, with food and water ad libitum. Experimental groups and tumor implantation After one-week acclimatization, all mice were randomly divided into four groups ( n 11 6 Tumor growth monitoring The width and weight of the tumors were recorded once a week for five weeks in a blinded manner. The tumor volume was calculated using the formula: (length × width²)/2. After 35 days, all mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation under anesthesia (1% isoflurane inhalation), followed by isolation of the tumors. Mice were humanely euthanized if they reached humane endpoints, such as tumors exceeding 2 cm (no animals met these criteria) [ 12 13 Histopathology study After dewax and rehydrate, the tumor sections were stained by Harris’ hematoxylin (ZLI-9610, Zsbio, Beijing, China) for 5–10 min, followed by staining with eosin (ZLI-9613, Zsbio, Beijing, China) for 1–3 min. The sections were dehydrated by alcohol until transparent, sealed with neutral gum, and then observed under a microscope (CKX43-LP, OLYMPUS, Japan). Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End labeling (TUNEL) staining assay Cell apoptosis was assessed using the TUNEL kit (G1504, Servicebio). Briefly, sections were incubated with CF488 dUTP Labeling Mix and Recombinant TDT enzyme at 37 °C for one hour. Next, sections were stained with DAPI for 5 min. A fluorescence microscope was used for observing cell apoptosis in tumor tissues. Statistical analysis All data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). A t-test was employed to compare the differences in circRNA14052 and miR-214-3p levels between tumor and matching normal tissues. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to analyze the differences in tumor growth curves and body weight data. The dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and CCK-8 assay were also analyzed using two-way ANOVA. For other experiments, one-way ANOVA was applied to determine differences among multiple groups. All analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 9.0. At least three independent repeats were carried out for each experiment [ 14 15 p Results Overexpression of circRNA-14,052 promotes the proliferation of breast cancer cells To determine the role of circRNA-14,052 in breast cancer, we first examined its expression in tumor samples collected from patients with breast cancer. Compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues, circRNA-14,052 levels were notably elevated in breast cancer tissues (Fig. 1 1 1 1  Fig. 1 The role of circRNA-14,052 in breast cancer cells.

( A n P B n P P C n P P D n P P E n P IKBKB is a direct target of miR-214-3p Next, we sought to identify the downstream targets of miR-214-3p. Through bioinformatics analysis, we screened potential target genes for miR-214-3p, and found that IKBKB may be the most likely target gene, which functions as tumor promoter in cancers [ 17 18 4 4 4  Fig. 4 IKBKB is a target of miR-214-3p. ( A B n P C n P Furthermore, miR-214-3p inhibitor notably elevated the expression level of IKBKB in MCF-7 cells; whereas miR-214-3p mimics significantly reduced IKBKB levels in cells (Fig. 4 CircRNA-14,052 affects the breast cancer progression in vitro via miR-214-3p/IKBKB axis Given the observed oncogenic effects of circRNA-14,052 and tumor-suppressive effects of miR-214-3p in breast cancer, we then performed rescue assays to investigate whether circRNA-14,052 promotes breast cancer progression by sponging miR-214-3p to regulate IKBKB expression. As shown in Fig. 5 5 5 S1 S1 S1 S1 S1 S1  Fig. 5 The role of circRNA-14,052/miR-214-3p axis in breast cancer. MCF-7 cells were transfected with LV-NC, LV-circRNA-14,052-siRNA, miR-214-3p-inhibitor, and LV-circRNA-14,052-siRNA + miR-214-3p-inhibitor. ( A n P P P B n P C n P P P D n P E n P Furthermore, the knockdown of miR-214-3p increased the expression levels of IL6, JAK2, and STAT3 in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 6 6  Fig. 6 circRNA-14,052/miR-214-3p axis regulates the expression of IL-6, JAK2 and STAT3.

Results showed that deficiency of circRNA-14,052 led to a significant decrease in the tumor size and an increase in the body weight of nude mice (Fig. 7 7 7 7 8 8  Fig. 7 The role of the circRNA-14052 in breast cancer in vivo. ( A n P P B C n P  Fig. 8 The circRNA-14,052 affects the breast cancer progression in vivo via miR-214-3p/IKBKB/IL6/JAK2/STAT3 axis. ( A B n P P P C-G n P P P Discussion In this study, we identified circRNA-14,052 as a novel oncogenic circRNA that promotes breast cancer progression by sponging miR-214-3p and upregulating IKBKB, thereby activating the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling axis. These results establish a previously unrecognized ceRNA regulatory network in breast cancer pathogenesis, highlighting circRNA-14,052 and its downstream effectors as potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer treatment. Unlike linear RNA, circular RNA forms a closed loop and lacks both a 5’ cap and a 3’ poly (A) tail, which renders it less susceptible to degradation by RNA exonucleases [ 19 20 21 22 24 25 26 27 1 It has been found that circular RNAs can competitively bind to miRNAs through complementary base pairing thereby relieving the inhibitory effect of miRNAs on target genes, which is known as the circRNA/miRNA regulatory axis [ 28 29 30 34 35 36 In this study, we verified that IKBKB is a direct target gene of miR-214-3p through dual-luciferase assays and RT-qPCR (Fig. 4 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 6 5 6 This study has several limitations. First, we investigated the role of the circRNA14052/miR-214-3p/IKBKB axis in only two breast cancer cell lines: MCF-7 (Luminal A cell line) and MDA-MB-231 (TNBC cell line). Future studies should expand to additional breast cancer cell lines (e.g., Luminal B and HER2-enriched breast cancer cell lines) to validate the biological functions and clinical relevance of circRNA14052 in breast cancer. Second, the regulatory effects of this axis in other cancer types remain unknown; thus, further research using diverse tumor models is needed to determine its universal role in cancer progression. Notably, liquid biopsy has emerged as a promising non-invasive tool for cancer detection and monitoring [ 44 45 46 Conclusion In conclusion, we found that circRNA-14,052 could promote the progression of breast cancer via the miR-214-3p/IKBKB/IL6/JAK/STAT3 axis. Thus, targeting circRNA14052/miR-214-3p/IKBKB axis may be a promising approach for the treatment of breast cancer. We hope our work may provide a new perspective on the treatment of breast cancer.
