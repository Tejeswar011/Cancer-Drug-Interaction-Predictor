The rise of precision oncology has been fueled by the identification of oncogenic driver mutations, such as EGFR ALK KRAS EGFR KRAS STK11 KEAP1  1  2 Among KRAS KRAS  3 G12C  4  5  6  7  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14 Emerging evidence suggests that not all KRAS‐driven tumours are biologically equivalent; subtype‐specific features—such as co‐occurring mutations, metabolic reprogramming and immune‐suppressive stromal interactions—play critical roles in shaping therapeutic vulnerabilities and resistance mechanisms.  15  16 KRAS KRAS G12C Previous studies, including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) classification (TRU, PI, PP),  17  18 KRAS G12C KRAS G12C KRAS G12C 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Non‐negative matrix factorisation clustering Non‐negative matrix factorisation (NMF) clustering was applied to identify molecular subtypes of KRAS G12C z k k 2.2 External subtype validation To validate the robustness of the NMF‐derived molecular subtypes, we employed a supervised machine learning–based strategy. Specifically, subtype labels obtained from the TCGA cohort were used to train classification models, including support vector machine, logistic regression and random forest, based on transcriptomic features. These models were then applied to an external KRAS G12C 2.3 Differential analysis of molecular subtypes After identifying the three molecular subtypes (KC1, KC2 and KC3) using NMF clustering, differential expression (DE) analysis was performed to identify subtype‐specific gene signatures. Specifically, KC1 was compared to both KC2 and KC3, and DE was assessed using the limma package in R with the following criteria: log2 fold change (log2FC) > 1 and adjusted p p For each comparison (KC1 vs. KC2, KC1 vs. KC3), genes that were upregulated or downregulated in one subtype compared to the other were identified. The intersection of upregulated and downregulated genes between each pair of subtypes was then performed, yielding a refined list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were characteristic of each molecular subtype. This strategy enabled the identification of core genes that could be further explored in the context of their potential roles in disease progression and therapy response. The same approach was subsequently applied to KC2 and KC3, comparing each with the remaining subtypes to pinpoint their distinct molecular signatures. 2.4 Machine learning‐based validation using independent datasets Two predictive models were constructed to assess therapeutic response. The first model was built using the feature genes derived from the three KC subtypes, while the second model was constructed based on previously reported KRAS G12C Supporting Information 2.5 Single‐cell nucleus sequencing See the detailed information in the Supporting Information 2.6 Establishment of KRAS G12C We constructed three distinct gene sets for downstream analyses. Subtype‐specific gene sets: subtype‐associated gene signatures were derived based on previously identified DEGs among the three molecular subtypes (KC1–KC3) of KRAS G12C S2 G12C_Bulk_RNA_seq gene set: the gene sets were derived from publicly available datasets.  8 Supporting Information G12C_scRNA_seq gene set: from the previously identified KRAS G12C Supporting Information 2.7 Independent cohorts of immunotherapy Three NSCLC cohorts were analysed to evaluate immunotherapy response across KC1–KC3 subtypes.  Public cohorts GSE126044 GSE135222 GSE126044 GSE135222  Internal cohort KRAS G12C KRAS G12C 2.8 CellChat Cell‒cell communication was analysed using the CellChat R package. The gene expression matrix was preprocessed, normalised, and filtered to retain high‐quality cells with sufficient marker gene expression. Cell types were annotated based on known markers, and clustering was performed to identify distinct populations. Intercellular interactions were inferred using curated ligand‒receptor pair databases. Statistical analysis identified significant communication pathways based on p 2.9 Cell cultures Cells were maintained in RPMI‐1640 medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin‒streptomycin (see Supporting Information 2.10 Synergy determination To determine the presence of synergy between two drug treatments, cells were treated with increasing concentrations of either drug for 72 h followed by the determination of viable cells. The experiment was carried out in biological triplicate. The data were expressed as % inhibition relative to baseline and the presence of synergy was determined by the Bliss method using the synergy finder R package.  19 2.11 Haematoxylin and eosin, immunohistochemistry and multiplex immunohistochemistry Continuous 5‐µm‐thick sections were obtained from LUAD specimens and subjected to dewaxing, rehydration and antigen retrieval, followed by multiplex immunofluorescence staining in combination with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, as described previously.  20  21  22 S1 Supporting Information 2.12 Xenograft model The mouse experiments were performed in accordance with animal welfare guidelines and protocols approved by Animal Ethics Committee of Shanghai Chest Hospital (#IS23098).

Among the three subtypes, KC2 was linked to the poorest prognosis, followed by KC1, while KC3 exhibited the most favourable survival outcomes (Figure 1C 1D p −14 S1C Importantly, the three subtypes were validated in an independent clinical cohort of 68 KRAS G12C  25 1E In summary, we identified and validated three distinct molecular subtypes of KRAS G12C 3.2 Molecular characteristics that determine the biological heterogeneity of KRAS G12C To better understand the molecular underpinnings of the three identified subtypes of KRAS G12C 2A S2 FIGURE 2 Molecular characterisation of KRAS G12C p * p ** p *** p KRAS G12C KRAS G12C The KC1 subtype exhibited a distinct neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation phenotype, characterised by the upregulation of key NE transcription factors, including ASCL1 NEUROD1 2B S2A  26 S2A S2B S2A,B  27  28 DLL3 RET  29  30 S2C S3 KRAS  29  30  31  32  33 S5A S4 The KC2 subtype, associated with the poorest prognosis, exhibited strong upregulation of cell cycle‐related genes, including CDK6 E2F7 CCNE1 TK1 2B S3A S5A S4 S3B,C S3D S2  34  35 KRAS G12C 2C  36 S2 S3D S2 KRAS G12C 2D,E S5B S5A S4 S5A S4 The KC3 subtype, associated with the most favourable prognosis, exhibited a well‐differentiated LUAD phenotype, as indicated by the high expression of distal airway‐related genes, including SCGB1A1 SCGB2A1 AGER SFTPC MS4A15 NAPSA HOPX 2B S4A,B  37 S5A S2 S4 S5A S4 S5A S4 To further confirm the prognosis of these findings, we performed co‐staining for pan‐cytokeratin, ASCL1, and KRT6A on clinical tumour samples from treatment‐naïve KRAS G12C 2F S5C 2C Collectively, these findings highlight the molecular and clinical diversity of KRAS G12C 3.3 Proteo‐genomic characterisation of KRAS G12C We and other groups previously showed the importance of co‐occurring mutated genes in modulating the pathobiology and therapy response of KRAS  3  38  39  40 KRAS G12C STK11 KEAP1 CDKN2A  41 Among the well‐characterised co‐occurring mutations (Figure S6A  3  38  39  40 KRAS STK11 KRAS G12C S6B  42  43  44 STK11 TP53 KRAS CDKN2A/B 2G S6C To further delineate the molecular diversity of KRAS G12C S5 S6D INK4A S5 S6E S5 S6F  41 Overall, our findings underscore the complex interplay between co‐occurring genetic mutations and proteomic alterations in shaping the distinct subtypes of KRAS G12C STK11 3.4 Differential responses to G12Ci across the three subtypes To refine patient stratification, we constructed gene sets based on the defining features of the three subtypes.

The TME, composed of stromal and immune cell populations, plays a critical role in modulating tumour aggressiveness and treatment response to therapeutic agents such as KRAS inhibitors and immunotherapies,  45 KRAS G12C  15  16  46 KRAS G12C To characterise the TME across the three subtypes, single‐nucleus RNA‐seq (snRNA‐seq)  47 KRAS G12 C 4A S8 S9A FIGURE 4 Single‐nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA‐seq) analysis of immune microenvironment across the three subtypes. (A) Study design: integration of preoperative positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging, histopathology (haematoxylin and eosin [H&E]/immunohistochemistry [IHC]) and snRNA‐seq of KRAS G12C KRAS G12C After stringent quality control, 44 005 cells were retained for downstream analysis (Figures 4B S9B,C S9D  48  49 S9E,F S9G Our snRNA‐seq analysis uncovered significant heterogeneity in the TME composition across the three subtypes. The KC1 subtype was dominated by cancer cells and exhibited an immune‐desert phenotype, with minimal infiltration of immune and stromal cells (Figure S9H 4C To delineate subtype‐specific intercellular communication networks, we applied the CellChat algorithm, which revealed divergent ligand‒receptor signalling patterns. By comparing the interaction frequencies and the intensity of responses between the three subtypes, we found that KC2 exhibited the strongest interaction intensity, followed by KC1, while KC3 had the weakest. This is consistent with our previous hypothesis that KC2 represents the most malignant subtype, while KC3 is in a relatively dormant state (Figure 4D 4E Pathway enrichment analysis revealed subtype‐specific signalling networks (Figures 4F S9H  50 4F The above observations were further revealed by deconvolution of TCGA bulk RNA‐seq data. Notably, no significant differences in KRAS S10A TME stratification, based on pan‐cancer microenvironment subtypes  51  49 S10B F S10B  31 S10D  48  52 S10C Synthesising these findings, KC1's immune‐desert phenotype portends resistance to ICIs. KC2's immune‐active TME (IE subtype), elevated proliferation and C1/C2 signatures align with reported ICI‐sensitive NSCLC cohorts. KC3's hybrid landscape—combining inflammatory (C3) and suppressive (C4) features—implies nuanced therapeutic opportunities, potentially requiring stromal modulation (e.g., CAF inhibition) to augment ICIs. 3.6 Unique TIMEs associated with KC2 and KC3 subtypes We observed substantial differences in the proportions of stromal cells, myeloid cells and CD8+ T cells among the three subtypes (Figure 4C Myeloid subpopulations also show significant subtype‐specific differences (Figure S11A  53 5A 5B S11B 5C 5C S11C FIGURE 5 Unique TIMEs associated with KC2 and KC3 subtypes.

Proportional analysis revealed a predominant distribution of T cells in both KC2 and KC3, although with notable differences in CD8+ T cells between the two subtypes (Figure S13A 5F S13B,C 5F S13D 5G Clinical validation in immunotherapy cohorts ( GSE207422  56 5H,I GSE135222  57 5J S13E 5K Overall, our snRNA‐seq analysis delineates the immunological continuum of KRAS G12C 3.7 KC1 subtype displays vulnerabilities to MEK inhibitor plus G12Ci and is associated with SMARCA4 loss‐of‐function Our findings suggest that the KC2 subtype exhibits high sensitivity to G12Ci and is predicted to respond favourably to ICIs, highlighting the potential therapeutic benefit of combining G12Ci with ICIs for this subtype. Conversely, KC3 tumours may be optimally treated with a combination of CAF‐targeted therapy and ICIs. However, KC1 tumours, characterised by resistance to G12Ci and an immune‐desert TME, pose a significant therapeutic challenge. These features limit the efficacy of both G12Ci monotherapy and ICI therapy, underscoring the need for novel treatment strategies.

Interestingly, tumours with SMARCA4 loss, a hallmark of poorly differentiated NSCLC, showed high expression of NE markers, particularly SYP (Figures 6I S16A  65  66 KRAS G12C We first queried the public RNA‐seq datasets of KRAS SYP S16B S9 S16B S9 EGFR S16C Pharmacological inhibition of SMARCA4 using ACBI1 (a SMARCA2/SMARCA4 degrader) or genetic knockdown significantly increased SYP expression and conferred resistance to G12Ci (Figures 6J,K S16D‒G 6L–N S16H S17A‒C In summary, our integrative analysis of cancer cell heterogeneity and the TME supports personalised treatment strategies tailored to KC1–KC3 subtypes, advancing precision oncology for KRAS G12C KRAS G12C 4 DISCUSSION This study represents an advancement in the understanding of KRAS G12C KRAS G12C KRAS G12C KRAS G12C KRAS G12C KRAS The KC1 subtype is characterised by an NE phenotype, with poor immune infiltration. Typically, SCLC and large‐cell neuroendocrine carcinoma show NE morphology and are immunostained for NE markers SYP and/or CHGA. However, NE differentiation is not restricted to these tumours and studies have described that NE features were also observed in a subset of LUAD. Clinical data showed that approximately 10%‒20% of LUAD were positively stained for the established NE markers.  31  67  68  67  68 SMARCA4  41 KRAS G12C The SMARCA4 KEAP1 STK11  69 STK11  40  70 S5A S1  15  71 KRAS  72 The KC2 subtype represents the most aggressive form of KRAS G12C KRAS G12C  48  52 5 S13E  15 NCT04613596 KRAS G12C The KC3 subtype, in contrast, displays a well‐differentiated alveolar phenotype and is associated with the best prognosis among the three subtypes. However, despite its positive clinical outcomes, KC3 tumours demonstrate the poorest response to G12Ci. This lack of responsiveness may be attributed to the lower levels of oncogenic KRAS G12C KRAS G12C 5 Specifically, our in vitro experiments demonstrated that modulation of SMARCA4 expression in KC2 (H358) and KC3 (SW1573) cell lines induced NE‐like differentiation, recapitulating features characteristic of the KC1 subtype. These observations suggest that KC2 and KC3 cells may have the capacity to transition towards KC1 under specific genetic perturbations, underscoring the plastic and dynamic nature of KRAS G12C In a previous study by Xue et al.,  8 KRAS G12C KRAS G12C Notably, previous studies  17 KRAS KRAS G12C Intriguingly, our findings contrast with the recent report  14 KRAS G12C Heterogeneity and biological plasticity are typical features of tumours, which limit the initial therapy response rate and allow for the early adaptation to clinical treatment, thereby representing a critical challenge of curation in various cancer types, including KRAS KRAS G12C  8  8 KRAS G12C KRAS G12C In conclusion, this study provides a novel molecular framework for understanding KRAS G12C KRAS G12C KRAS G12C KRAS G12C This study is constrained by the relatively modest sample size for molecular subtyping ( n n AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS  Conceptualisation, data curation, formal analysis, investigation, methodology, validation, visualisation, writing—original draft and writing—review and editing Supervision, funding acquisition, project administration, resources and writing—review and editing Participated in discussions Formal analysis, software, resources, visualisation and writing—review and editing CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT The authors declare they have no conflicts of interest.
