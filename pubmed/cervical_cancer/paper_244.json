Methods Anti-CEACAM5 VHH (6B11) affinity and specific cellular binding was confirmed by ELISA, FACS and immunofluorescence in cancer cell lines with varying CEACAM5 expression levels. Intracellular penetration ability within tumor spheroids was tested with Oregon Green 488 labeled 6B11 (OG488-6B11). Biodistribution and binding specificity of 99m Result 6B11 demonstrated high binding affinity (EC 50 p p p 99m Conclusion The anti-CEACAM5 VHH 6B11 is a good candidate for SPECT-based cancer diagnosis and can be potentially used as targeting moiety in the development of VHH-based drug conjugates for cancer treatments.

Furthermore, we investigated the cellular distribution and penetration as well as internalization capability to demonstrate the potential for VHH-drug conjugation for therapeutic application. Materials and methods Extended information, protocols and experimental procedures are provided in supplementary materials. Anti-CEACAM5 VHH production, 99m The selected VHHs were produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) followed by purification using HisPur™ Ni-NTA Spin Purification Kit (Thermofisher, 88229) and Spin Desalting Columns (Thermofisher, 89894) or Pierce™ Protein Concentrators (Thermofisher, 88526). VHH yield was determined using Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kits (Thermofisher, A55864 For labeling VHH with 99m 99m Cell culture All cells were cultured routinely in a 5% CO 2 21 Spheroid formation and VHH diffusion assay Single cells were seeded in an ultra-low attachment plate (7007, Corning) and plates were incubated at 37 °C / 5% CO 2 2 In vivo study to test 99m All animal experiments were in accordance with local institutional guidelines for animal welfare and approved by the Animal Ethical Committee of the University of Maastricht (AVD10700202216527).

P values were determined using two-way ANOVA or Mann-Whitney U tests, and p values less than 0.05 indicated statistically significant difference. Results VHH generation, production and validation Human CEACAM5 was used for immunization of llamas to construct the library and 11 novel anti-CEACAM5 VHHs were selected from phage display (Fig. S1 S1 1 29 To further confirm the binding specificity and penetrating ability of 6B11 in a 3D cellular model, VHH was conjugated with Oregon Green 488 (OG488). The resulting product, OG488-6B11, was a mixture of 6B11 tagged with a 1×, 2× or 3× OG488 moiety as determined by MALDI-TOF-TOF-MS, with an average molecular weight of 15 kD (Fig. S6). Cellular binding affinity of OG488-6B11 was dependent on the dose and target expression levels, but overall, 7-fold lower compared to 6B11 (Fig. 1 1 Fig. 1 Cellular binding and distribution of fluorescent labeled VHH.

Overall, the results indicated that none of the VHHs could significantly inhibit cancer cell viability, migration and adhesion (Fig. 5 5 5 5  Fig. 5 In vitro viability assay of 6B11 and cellular uptake of OG488-6B11. ( A n B C D Discussion CEACAM5 has been used as a marker for cancer diagnosis due to its overexpression in various cancers. In this study, a novel VHH against CEACAM5 was developed which was labeled with 99m 99m 99m 28 The small molecular size enables VHHs to aggregate quickly with their target and their blood clearance is fast, which makes VHHs good candidates being developed for cancer management. 99m 30 99m 31 33 34 34 36 37 99m 38 The development of ADCs is based on the concept of using antibody (fragments) as a carrier to specifically bring drugs to its target cells without causing toxicity to cells which do not express the target. However, conventional antibody-based ADCs harbor many unsolved obstacles, such as low vascular leakage and solid tumor penetration rate [ 39 16 40 41 42 43 The VHH developed in the present study still can be improved in several aspects. Firstly, 6B11 pharmacokinetics can be improved since its fast blood clearance can result in low tumor accumulation. Several strategies have been explored to improve VHH pharmacokinetics, such as PEGylation, fusion with other functional domains, and modifying the tumor microenvironment to enhance the penetration and retention of nanobodies [ 44 46 47 48 7 99m 49 50 51 52 53 20 54 Conclusion This study proved that the anti-CEACAM5 VHH 6B11 maintained good binding affinity and specificity after being labeled with 99m Electronic supplementary material Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
