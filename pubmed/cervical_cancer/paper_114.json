ABSTRACT Advanced pelvic surgeries, such as radical hysterectomy, deep endometriosis surgery and sacrocolpopexy, pose risks to autonomic pelvic nerves leading to voiding dysfunction and reduced quality of life. This review article evaluates neuropelveological strategies for preventing and managing bladder dysfunction by exploring pelvic neural anatomy, nerve-sparing techniques, and postoperative rehabilitation approaches. Nerve-sparing approaches can reduce postoperative urinary retention and improve recovery of bladder function. Neuromodulation techniques provide additional support in managing persistent voiding dysfunction in selected cases. A multidisciplinary approach integrating detailed knowledge of pelvic neural anatomy, precise surgical techniques and structured postoperative management can minimise bladder dysfunction and optimise patient outcomes.

Understanding the anatomy and topography of these neural pathways is critical to minimising complications during pelvic surgeries. 6 The superior hypogastric plexus (SHP) is the origin of sympathetic innervation to the bladder and other pelvic organs. This triangular network is formed by fibres from T11-L2, which converge from the abdominal aortic plexus, lumbar splanchnic nerves, and inferior mesenteric plexus. 7 Figure 1 8 The HNs are critical structures for bladder storage function, as they facilitate detrusor relaxation and internal sphincter contraction. 9 10 11 Figure 2 12 13 The pelvic splanchnic nerves (PSNs), carrying parasympathetic fibres, originate from S2-S4 spinal segments. These delicate nerves travel through the dorsocaudal pararectal space before merging with the hypogastric nerves to form the inferior hypogastric plexus (IHP) ( Figure 3 2 15 9 The IHP, also referred to as the pelvic plexus, is the neurological hub for autonomic control of pelvic viscera. Approximately 2 × 2 cm in size, the IHP is located in the visceral pelvic fascia, between the anterolateral surface of the rectum and the posterolateral surface of the vaginal fornix. 16 17 6 18 The vesical branches of the IHP pass beneath the inferior vesical vein and run parallel to the blood vessels of the paracolpium in close proximity to the vaginal wall before reaching the bladder ( Figure 4 19 Sensory signals from the bladder are primarily transmitted via the HNs, with additional minor nociceptive contributions from the PSNs. These fibres relay critical information about bladder fullness and nociceptive stimuli to the central nervous system, enabling proper coordination of the micturition reflex. 10 9 These interconnected plexuses and their efferent branches represent a delicate balance of motor, sensory, and autonomic functions, and nerve-sparing approaches and intraoperative neuro-navigation are pivotal in preserving these structures and optimising functional outcomes. 20 21 Radical Hysterectomy (Cervical Cancer Surgery) Radical hysterectomy is among the most challenging pelvic surgeries and demands meticulous dissection of the parametrial and paracervical regions. 19 22 23 Dissection of the dorsal parametrium poses a particular risk to the HNs, which are essential for bladder storage. These nerves facilitate detrusor relaxation and contribute to the tone of the internal urethral sphincter. Damage to these nerves can result in stress urinary incontinence due to decreased sphincter tone, as well as bladder overactivity caused by parasympathetic dominance. 24 25 26 The vesicouterine ligament is another critical site. This structure houses the vesical branches of the IHP, which provide motor innervation to the detrusor muscle. Resection of this ligament can cause denervation of the bladder, leading to detrusor atony and voiding dysfunction. 19 25 Early bladder complications after radical hysterectomy primarily manifest within the first 3-6 months and are characterized by parasympathetic dominance. 23 22 Late bladder complications, occurring beyond 6 months post-surgery, often stem from incomplete nerve recovery or aberrant nerve regeneration. 18 3 27 Deep Endometriosis Surgery Deep endometriosis (DE) poses significant challenges, as infiltration around pelvic autonomic nerves is common and leads to severe anatomical distortion. Bladder dysfunction following DE surgery arises through two primary mechanisms: direct infiltration of the nerve fibres by endometriotic lesions and collateral damage caused by surgical dissection or resection. 1 28 The localization and extent of endometriotic nodules play a critical role in determining the risk of postoperative bladder dysfunction. According to Boulus et al., 4 Parametrial infiltration significantly increases the likelihood of autonomic nerve injury. Posterior DE nodules involving the rectovaginal septum, uterosacral ligaments, and the parametrium have been associated with a higher incidence of postoperative voiding difficulties. 29 30 31 The need for colorectal resection further compounds the risk. Roman et al. 28 32 33 34 Bladder dysfunction after DE surgery typically arises from either reversible neuropraxia or irreversible axonal injury. Neuropraxia, due to inflammation or thermal injury, preserves axonal continuity and often resolves over time. This explains the relatively high recovery rates observed in studies such as those by Boulus et al. 4 35 36 37 It is also important to recognize that patients with endometriosis may present with lower urinary tract symptoms that are preexisting and attributable to the disease itself, rather than being solely iatrogenic in origin. Preoperative bladder dysfunction caused by nerve damage and infiltration by the endometriosis strongly predicts postoperative outcomes. According to Boulus et al., 4 32 38 Sacrocolpopexy for Pelvic Organ Prolapse Abdominal and minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy remain the gold standards for managing pelvic organ prolapse. 39 Dissection at the sacral promontory poses a high risk to the SHP and HNs. According to Ercoli et al., 40 40 41 The vesical branches within the vesicouterine ligament are particularly vulnerable during anterior vaginal wall fixation. Shiozawa et al. 42 Nerve-sparing Techniques and Preventive Strategies Nerve-sparing techniques have become a cornerstone in minimising autonomic nerve damage during pelvic surgeries. These approaches require a deep understanding of pelvic anatomy and surgical precision, emphasising the preservation of key autonomic structures while ensuring oncological and functional outcomes. The concept of nerve-sparing was first introduced in oncological surgery, particularly in the context of radical hysterectomy, to reduce the significant morbidity associated with pelvic organ dysfunction. 43 19 44 45 46 Over time, these principles have been adapted to other complex pelvic surgeries, including procedures for deep infiltrating endometriosis and prolapse surgery, to optimize outcomes and improve quality of life. Volpi et al. 47 48 13 1 Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality are providing new opportunities for enhancing pelvic nerve preservation. According to Kinoshita et al., 49 The fundamental principle of nerve-sparing surgery is to minimize unnecessary nerve dissection, handling, and manipulation to prevent potential nerve damage. These techniques should be employed only when the nerves are directly affected by the disease, ensuring that interventions are justified and beneficial. It is strongly advised against performing unnecessary nerve dissection, as preserving nerve integrity is essential for maintaining postoperative function. Studies have emphasized that systematic full surgical dissection of pelvic nerves is not required unless there is direct nerve entrapment, reinforcing the importance of a tailored approach in complex gynaecological procedures. Research further supports that unnecessary nerve handling can increase the risk of postoperative dysfunction, making precise surgical planning crucial. A simplified approach to nerve-sparing using the HNs as landmarks has been proposed 50 46 5 51 The successful application of nerve-sparing strategies in pelvic surgeries relies on a combination of advanced anatomical knowledge, precise surgical techniques, and the integration of innovative tools such as neuro-navigation and artificial intelligence. These approaches facilitate real-time nerve identification, minimising intraoperative damage and optimising functional recovery. By prioritising nerve preservation, these methods contribute to improved patient outcomes, reduced postoperative complications, and an overall better quality of life. Postoperative Management of Voiding Dysfunction The management of voiding dysfunction following neurological damage during pelvic surgeries is crucial to restoring normal voiding function and preventing long-term bladder complications. Early identification and management of voiding dysfunction is critical. Clear, structured protocols for catheter removal and trial without catheter (TWOC) should be implemented postoperatively. While often implied, this step must be explicitly recognized as one of the most effective and straightforward strategies to ensure timely diagnosis and prevent long-term complications. TWOC is a standardized protocol used to assess a patient’s ability to void spontaneously after catheter removal. It typically involves removing the indwelling catheter 24–72 hours postoperatively, depending on the extent of nerve dissection, followed by close monitoring of spontaneous urination and post-void residual (PVR) volume measured with bladder ultrasound or catheterization. A PVR less than 100 mL is generally considered a successful trial. Higher residuals may necessitate ISC or reinsertion of the catheter. The implementation of a TWOC protocol enables early detection of voiding impairment, prevention of bladder overdistension, and timely initiation of rehabilitative strategies. Patients with a post-void residual volume exceeding 100 mL are typically advised to perform ISC four to six times daily to prevent bladder overdistension and maintain low residual volumes. 4 52 4 36 5 In addition to ISC, pharmacological interventions such as alpha-adrenergic blockers are effective in reducing hypertonicity of the internal urethral sphincter, facilitating voiding, and alleviating retention. 4 2 Electrostimulation therapy targeting the sacral or tibial nerves provides additional support in managing bladder dysfunction. Tibial nerve stimulation offers retrograde activation of sacral plexus pathways governing bladder function. 53 4 Sacral Nerve Stimulation Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) involves the implantation of electrodes to deliver mild electrical pulses to the sacral nerves, particularly the S3 segment, to regulate bladder and anal sphincter activity. This procedure comprises a two-stage process: the initial phase involves the percutaneous insertion of a temporary electrode wire through the S3 sacral foramen to evaluate efficacy, followed by the second stage in which the electrode is connected to a permanent implantable pulse generator. 54 55 56 Agnello et al. 57 57 The LION procedure, pioneered by Possover, provides a targeted approach by directly stimulating pelvic nerves, such as the SHP or pudendal nerve. 14 58 59 Importance of Adequate Follow-up in Preventing Chronic Morbidity The long-term outcomes of bladder dysfunction are closely tied to the quality of postoperative follow-up. As detailed by Possover, inadequate follow-up can lead to insidious and irreversible complications. 2 Failure to identify early signs of sensory or motor deficits with flow deterioration on postoperative uroflowmetry or clinical red flags such as reduced urinary frequency or the need for Valsalva manoeuvres to complete emptying, allows for progressive bladder overdistension. This can result in secondary myogenic damage, reduced elasticity, and eventual loss of detrusor contractility. Possover emphasized that regular assessments of post-void residual volumes and bladder sensation, paired with timely interventions like ISC, are critical to preventing such outcomes. Without proactive management, complications such as recurrent urinary tract infections, overflow incontinence, and even renal impairment due to bilateral ureterohydronephrosis may develop. The findings from Possover’s study underline the necessity for structured follow-up protocols focusing not only on voiding function but also on sensory and neurological assessments of the bladder. This approach ensures early detection of dysfunctions, timely interventions, and preservation of long-term bladder health. Conclusion Bladder dysfunction following advanced pelvic surgeries remains a significant challenge that can greatly affect a patient’s quality of life. A comprehensive approach incorporating meticulous surgical planning, a profound understanding of pelvic neural anatomy, and the implementation of nerve-sparing techniques are essential to minimize the risk of autonomic nerve injury. Avoiding unnecessary nerve dissection and manipulation is paramount, as excessive handling can result in irreversible damage and long-term functional impairment. A tailored surgical approach, guided by preoperative imaging and intraoperative neuro-navigation, allows for precise dissection while preserving essential nerve structures. When disease infiltration creates the need for nerve resection, selective dissection should be employed to balance oncological control with functional preservation. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and augmented reality further enhance intraoperative nerve identification, reducing the risk of inadvertent damage and improving surgical outcomes. Beyond intraoperative strategies, postoperative management plays a crucial role in bladder function recovery. Multimodal rehabilitation, including pharmacological therapies, electrostimulation, and neuromodulation techniques, is essential for restoring autonomic control and preventing long-term complications such as detrusor hypotonia or atonia or chronic urinary retention. Early and structured follow-up, incorporating urodynamic and uroflowmetry assessments and targeted interventions, is critical in identifying dysfunction at an early stage and preventing irreversible sequelae. Ultimately, optimising patient outcomes in pelvic surgery requires a multidisciplinary effort that integrates advanced surgical techniques, technological innovations, and individualized patient care strategies. By prioritising nerve preservation and ensuring meticulous postoperative management, the risk of bladder dysfunction can be significantly mitigated, leading to improved patient recovery, functional outcomes, and overall quality of life.
