The resulting cyclic changes in gene expression promote the acquisition of high oxidative capacities and gains in capillaries. If training stops or remains at the same intensity, adaptation ceases. Whether silencing HPTMs helps to halt adaptation remains understudied.

This tissue supports movement as well as cardiovascular and metabolic health. To properly function, the skeletal muscle is equipped with an impressive network of vascular capillaries (Wagenmakers et al., 2016 2005 2015 2009 2008 2009 1992 2011 Over the last three decades, multiple studies have helped elucidate the molecular processes that support the skeletal muscle adaptation to endurance training (reviewed in Booth et al., 2015, 2015 2008 2014 2013 1998 2016 Myh7 Notch1 Vegfa Kdr 2009 2010 2003 2011 2014 2025 The role of epigenetic processes (i.e. methylation and histone modifications) in skeletal muscle adaptation to training has generated considerable interest (Jacques et al., 2019 2019 2019 Ac me3 2015 2009 Ac me3 Ac 2009 me3 Pgc1α 2015 me1 Ac 2021 2021 2012 2019 Our previous work indicates that the E3 ubiquitin ligase MDM2 (murine double minute 2) supports skeletal muscle vascular homeostasis and endurance exercise angiogenesis (Roudier et al., 2012 2016 2009 2014 2005 2018 2019 2004 2016 2016 2018 2016 me3 me3 Ub 2016 2013 Methods Ethical approval All mice were purchased from Charles River Inc.

All investigators involved in handling animals understand the animal ethical principles under which the Journal of Physiology Mouse training protocol Fourteen female C57Bl6 mice arrived in the animal facilities at the age of 7 weeks. All mice were fed the standard chow ad libitum vs n 2023 V ˙ O 2 max Determination of capillary to fibre ratio by immunohistochemistry Three cryosections were performed per animal in the mid‐belly of the EDL muscle. Cross‐sections 10 µm thick were allowed to dry for a few minutes before being fixed with 3.7% formalin solution in PBS for 15 min. After three washes with PBS, cross‐sections were incubated for 1 h (room temperature) with Griffonia Simplicifolia Lectin I (GSL I) isolectin B4 conjugated to DyLight® 594 (#DL‐1207; Vector Laboratories, Burlington, ON, Canada, dilution 1:333 in PBS) and Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to Alexa Fluor™ 350 (# W11263 n Cell culture C2C12 myoblasts were purchased from ATCC (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA, cat. no. CRL‐1772). C2C12 cells were cultured onto six‐well plates with a loading density of 800,000 cells per well and cultivated in growth media (DMEM, Wisent Bio Products, cat. no. 319010; St Bruno, QC, Canada) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, cat. no. 080150; Wisent Bio Products) and an antibiotic solution containing 10,000 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Gibco, cat. no. 15140122; Thermofisher, Burlington, ON, Canada). Once C2C12 myoblasts reached confluency (90–95%), the C2C12 myotubes were differentiated into myotubes through serum starvation; the growth medium was replaced with a differentiation medium: DMEM containing 2% heat‐inactivated horse serum (Wistent Bio Products, cat. no. 065250) and 1% penicillin‐streptomycin. C57BL/6 mouse primary skeletal muscle microvascular endothelial cells (mSMECs) were purchased from Cell Biologics (cat. no. C57‐6220,Cedarlane, Burlington, ON, Canada). All primary microvascular endothelial cells were platted on gelatin‐coated culture dishes (Bioshop, cat. no. GEL771.500, Burlington, ON, Canada). Cells were cultured in complete Endothelial Cell Media with supplements (Complete Mouse Endothelial Cell Medium, Cell Biologics, cat. no. M1168, Cedarlane).

Indeed, endurance training increased the level of COX‐IV and PECAM by 140% and 57% in the gastrocnemius muscle (Fig. 1 A 1 B 1 C Figure 1 Nine weeks of endurance training induces mouse skeletal muscle metabolic and vascular adaptations Female C57Bl6 mice were kept sedentary (Sed) or endurance trained (Tr) for 9 weeks (treadmill running, 5 days/week), and skeletal muscles were collected 72 h after the last bout of endurance exercise. A B A B C A C n t P P Endurance training increased the protein levels of MDM2, EZH2 and NEDD4, three enzymes catalysing post‐translational modifications of histone H3 We evaluated in the gastrocnemius muscle of female C57B6 mice whether endurance training will impact the expression of histone modifiers previously reported to regulate silencing HPTMs, including MDM2 and EZH2. We also tested whether endurance exercise will change the protein level of NEDD4, previously reported to ease re‐activation of previously silenced genes through H3 ubiquitylation (Zhang et al., 2017 First, we assessed whether training alters the expression of MDM2 and EZH2, as both enzymes could cooperate to establish post‐transcriptional modifications on H2 and H3 (Wienken et al., 2016 2013 2012 2 A 2 B 2001 2010 2012 P vs 2 A P vs 2 B Figure 2 Nine weeks of endurance training induces MDM2, EZH2 and NEDD4 protein expression in mouse gastrocnemius muscle Female C57Bl6 mice were kept sedentary (Sed) or endurance trained (Tr) for 9 weeks (treadmill running, 5 days/week), and skeletal muscles were collected 72 h after the last bout of endurance exercise.

With this in mind, we assessed whether EZH2 is required for the establishment of the ubiquitylation detected at 25 kDa. To do so, C2C12 myotubes were incubated with GSK343, a chemical inhibitor of EZH2 (1 and 5 µM), for 48 h and the resultant effect on H3K27 me3 GSK343 treatment (1 and 5 µM) significantly impacted the levels of H3K27 me3 10 A me3 vs P vs P n me3 me3 F P n 10 A Figure 10 Inhibition of EZH2 by GSK343 decreases the abundance of the H3K27 me3  A me3 B me3 C Notch1 A C n t post hoc P P D Notch1 n post hoc vs P P We had observed that the ubiquitylated form of the H3 mark is responsive to exercise and EPS, an exercise‐like stimulus (Figs 3 D 4 C P P me3 Post hoc me3 vs vs vs vs P n 10 B We next examined the effect of EZH2 inhibition (GSK343 treatment, 1 µM, 48 h) on the expression of Notch1 me3 Notch1 vs vs 10 C Notch1 To assess whether E2H2 activity is required to promote changes in Notch1 in vitro 10 D P Notch1 Notch1 vs vs Notch1 vs vs P Notch1 Inhibition of MDM2 activity decreases the relative abundance of ubiquitylated‐H3 detected by α‐H3K27 me3 Expression of the ubiquitylated‐H3 band detected at 25 kDa increased as myotube differentiation progressed (Fig. 9 A 11 A vs vs vs vs P n me3 Figure 11 Inhibition of MDM2 by Serdemetan reduces the abundance of H3K27 me3 Notch1  A n post hoc P P B D B n C D me3 n t P P E Notch1 n post hoc P P F I F Notch1 Hprt n post hoc vs P P G – I me3 H I n post hoc P P To assess whether MDM2 regulates this ubiquitylation, we treated differentiated C2C12 myotubes with Serdemetan (1 µM), a chemical inhibitor of MDM2, for 24 or 48 h (Fig. 11 B D 2011 Serdemetan treatment increased MDM2 expression in C2C12 myotubes (Fig. 11 B P me3 vs vs P U n vs vs P U n 11 C  D Notch1 Notch1 vs vs P n 11 E To determine whether MDM2 activity was required to upregulate Notch1 11 F I Notch1 f P 11 F P Notch1 P me3 11 H me3 11 I P P vs me3 11 I Notch1 Since differentiation led to an increase in the ubiquitylated form of H3, we tested whether EZH2 and MDM2 inhibitions had an impact on the differentiation states of myotubes pre‐treated with Serdemetan and GSK343.

A B n P Discussion Here, we aimed to test whether endurance training increases gene silencing capacity through EZH2/MDM2‐related HPTMs, when muscle remodelling comes to a standstill. Nine weeks of endurance training led to vascular and metabolic muscle adaptations. In the muscle tissue, training did not change the overall abundance of silencing marks (i.e. H3K27 me3 Ub me3 me3 Kdr 2020 Notch1 2013 2022 me3 Kdr Kdr Notch1 me3 Notch1 me3 Ac me3 Ub Ub Ub me3 Ub Notch1 Ub Notch1 Ub Notch1 Notch1 Role of HPTMs in skeletal muscle The epigenetic mechanisms that shift gene expression when the skeletal muscle adapts to endurance exercise remains to be fully understood. DNA methylation only partly explains the changes in gene expression observed with endurance training (Kanzleiter et al., 2015 2014 2014 2015 2015 2024 2009 2009 2023 HPTMs play an important role in regulating muscle phenotype. Indeed, the distribution of HPTMs is considerably different between the plantaris (low C‐to‐F ratio and glycolytic) and the soleus (high C‐to‐F ratio and oxidative) muscles in rats (Kawano et al., 2015 2009 me3 Ac Myh1 Myh2 Myh7 2015 2009 2015 2015 2009 Beyond basal muscle phenotype, HPTMs might be key to acquiring greater muscle oxidative metabolism and capillarization in response to training.

Our study aimed to assess whether silencing HPTMs help halt muscle adaptations after weeks of endurance training to establish a new resting muscle homeostasis. We used the MDM2/EZH2 path as a framework to assess whether PRC2‐related HPTMs help silence genes (i.e. Kdr Notch1 2016 me3 me3 me3 2021 me3 2024 me3 Pgc1A Myh4 me3 me3 Kdr Notch1 me3 Kdr Notch1 2016 VEGFR2 is crucial to sensing angiogenic factors.
