The Nod-like receptor (NLR) family is involved in innate immunity and tumor progression, but its role in HCC remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value and biological function of NLR genes in HCC. Methods Transcriptomic and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were analyzed using nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to classify HCC into molecular subtypes. Differentially expressed genes were used to build an NLR-based prognostic model (NLR_score) through univariate Cox, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and multivariate Cox regression. Predictive performance and correlation with chemotherapy sensitivity were assessed. NLR family pyrin domain containing 5 (NLRP5) was identified as a key oncogene and validated via in vitro in vivo Results The two NMF-defined subtypes showed distinct survival outcomes. The NLR_score reliably predicted prognosis and was associated with sensitivity to six chemotherapeutic drugs. NLRP5 knockdown suppressed HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro in vivo Conclusion This study developed an NLR-based prognostic model that effectively stratifies HCC patients by survival risk. NLRP5 was identified as a novel oncogene promoting HCC progression via the p53 pathway, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target.

The composition consists of three types of domains with different functions: a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain located at the C-terminus, a nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NACHT) positioned in the middle, and an N-terminal effector domain [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the role of NLR family genes in HCC. Specifically, we sought to classify distinct NLR-based molecular subtypes and explore their association with patient prognosis and the tumor immune microenvironment. We also aimed to construct a prognostic scoring system (NLR_score) for risk stratification and treatment guidance. Furthermore, we investigated the functional role of NLR family pyrin domain containing 5 (NLRP5) in HCC progression. This study provides a basis for understanding the clinical relevance of NLRs and evaluating NLRP5 as a potential therapeutic target in HCC. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Data Download and Processing Gene expression profiles and clinical prognosis data of HCC patients were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ https://dcc.icgc.org/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/ GSE146115 2.2 Graphics Drawing In this study, the ‘ggplot2’ (version 3.5.2) package was used to draw the volcano map, bubble chart, and violin plots ‘pheatmap’ (version 1.0.12) package was used to draw the heat map. The ‘RCircos’ (version 1.2.1) package was used to draw the circular diagram. The ‘Seurat’ (version 5.3.0) package to draw Feature plots. 2.3 The Determination of the Subtypes of Nonnegative Matrix Factorization It is a powerful method for classifying diseases based on the expression of specific genes in nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) [ 19 2.4 Processing of the scRNA-Seq Data The scRNA-seq data processing was performed according to our previous treatment methods [ 20 21 2.5 Basic Ontology Analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Analysis The analysis of differentially expressed genes involved the examination of biological processes (BPs), cellular components (CCs), and molecular functions (MFs). Additionally, the KEGG analysis and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) analysis were conducted to explore the signal transduction pathways of the differentially expressed genes. The Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG analyses were performed by utilizing the packages ‘clusterProfiler’ (version 4.10.1), ‘org. Hs. eg. db.’ (version 3.18.0), ‘enrichplot’ (version 1.22.0), ‘GSVA’ (version 1.50.5), and ‘GSEABase’ (version 1.64.0). 2.6 Construction and Validation of NLR Score Based on the ‘survival’ software package (version 3.8.3), the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between C1 and C2 samples were filtered and screened by univariate Cox analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis, and multivariate Cox analysis. In LASSO regression, we use the k-fold cross-validation (10-fold cross-validation) method to select the regularization parameter λ, which is implemented by the R package ‘glmnet’ (version 4.1.8). At the same time, based on the results of multivariate Cox analysis, we established a five-gene optimal prognostic model ( N L R  s c o r e N L R  s c o r e N L R  s c o r e = ∑ n = 1 N Expression ( i ) ∗ C o e f f i c i e n t  ( i ) 2.7 Somatic Mutation Spectrum Analysis This study employed the ‘maftools’ package (version 2.24.0) to calculate somatic mutations in the TCGA-HCC sample data [ 22 2.8 Evaluation of Immune Cell Infiltration The study utilized the Single Sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm to assess the levels of infiltration of 28 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the TCGA-HCC cohort. The level of immune cell infiltration was compared among different NLR subtypes and NLR_score.

The RNA isolation and qRT-PCR protocols were performed following the previously stated methods [ 24 Table 2 24 Table 2 qRT-PCR primers Gene Forward primer (5 ′ ′ Reverse primer (5 ′ ′ ACTB CACCATTGGCAATGAGCGGTTC AGGTCTTTGCGGATGTCCACGT NLRP4 ATCTTTCGGGATAGGTTCCTGT ACACGATCTCTGTTATAGGAGCA NLRP5 CTGGACGCCTTCCACTGTCTTT CGCAAATACGGACAGTGCTGGA 2.12 Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) Assay After transfection treatment, HCCLM3 and HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM Medium supplemented with 10% FBS in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 2.13 Colony Formation Assay A sum of 1000 HCCLM3 and HepG2 cells was gathered subsequent to undergoing transfection treatment, subsequently amalgamated, and placed in a 6-well plate. A sufficient quantity of culture medium was added, and the cells were grown for a period of 10 days before ending the experiment. Afterward, the cells were washed with 1× PBS (pH 7.4), then treated with 4% paraformaldehyde to fix them for 15 min, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for the same duration. Finally, images were captured to document the number of cell clusters formed using ImageJ software (Version 1.53t, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). 2.14 Transwell Assay During the migration experiment, a suspension of 5 × 10 4 2.15 Western Blot The HCCLM3 cells underwent two washes with cold 1× PBS (pH 7.4) and were subsequently lysed in radio-immunoprecipitation assay lysis (RIPA) buffer (Beyotime, Cat No. P0013) supplemented with the protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Beyotime, Cat No. P0013). The bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime, Cat No. P0011) was utilized to determine the protein concentration in cell lysate in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The cell lysate was mixed with SDS loading buffer and heated to 100°C for 10 min. Subsequently, the cell lysate was separated by SD-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Merck, Cat No. ISEQ00010, Darmstadt, Germany) that had been previously treated with methanol. Afterward, the membrane was blocked using 5% skim milk for 1 h and subsequently exposed to primary antibodies at 4°C overnight. The antibodies employed were as listed: NLRP5 (1:1000; Cat No. PA5-21021, Thermo Fisher Scientific); p53 (1:500; Cat No. AF0879, Affinity, Changzhou, China); MDM2 (1:1000; Cat No. 51541, CST, Danvers, MA, USA); Bax (1:2000; Cat No. 50599, Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA); P21 (1:2000; Cat No. 10355, Proteintech); and β-actin (1:3000; Cat No. T0022, Affinity). The membrane was washed three times with TBST (Biosharp, Cat No. BL346A, Hefei, China) for 10 min each, then incubated with an HRP-labeled secondary antibody (1:5000; Cat No. SA00001-1/2, Proteintech) for 1 h at room temperature. The protein bands were subsequently identified using an enhanced ECL chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat No. 34580) detection system. 2.16 Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Analysis The cell cycle was evaluated utilizing a Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Analysis Kit (Beyotime, Cat No. C1052), while the cell apoptosis was measured using an Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Beyotime, Cat No. C1062) following the manufacturer’s guidelines. The HCCLM3 Cells were collected 48 h post-transfection with siRNA. In order to examine the cell cycle, cells were first exposed to cold 75% ethanol and then kept at 4°C for 24 h to ensure fixation. Afterward, every group was subjected to a prepared 1× propidium iodide solution and placed in the dark for 30 min. To investigate cell apoptosis, 1× Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide staining solution were added, and then the cells were gently mixed. Following that left to incubate dimly at ambient temperature for 20 min. Ultimately, FACS Celesta (BD, San Jose, CA, USA) was employed to collect data, which was subsequently analyzed utilizing FlowJo software (Version 10.10, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). 2.17 Animal Models C57BL/6 mice carrying the H11-LSL-MYC and Alb-Cre transgenes were obtained from the Shanghai Model Organisms Center and maintained in the specific pathogen-free (SPF) animal facility of Anhui Medical University. By crossing these two strains, we generated Alb-Cre + + 25 + + in vivo 2.18 Immunohistochemical Staining Mouse liver cancer tissues were washed with 1× PBS (pH 7.4), then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, dehydrated, and embedded. The resulting samples were then sliced into sections measuring 0.4 µm in thickness and were dewaxed and then treated with 10 mM citrate antigen retrieval solution (pH 6.0) in a microwave oven for 15 min to facilitate antigen retrieval. After undergoing natural cooling, the sections were subjected to a 25-min treatment with a 3% H 2 2 2.19 Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay Apoptosis in mouse liver tissue was assessed utilizing the TUNEL Apoptosis Detection Kit (Yesen, Cat No. 40306ES20, Shanghai, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions. To remove paraffin, paraffin-embedded tissue sections underwent a step-by-step process using xylene, ethanol, and distilled water, respectively. Afterward, 20 μg/mL Proteinase K was added slowly and left to incubate at room temperature for 20 min. After the 1× PBS (pH 7.4) washing, samples were treated with 1× TdT incubation buffer and then incubated at 37°C for 60 min. Subsequently, the samples were treated with 1× equilibration buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min, protected from light. Finally, all samples were counterstained with 0.5 μg/mL DAPI (Beyotime, Cat No. C1006) and then sealed using an anti-fluorescence quencher (Beyotime, Cat No. P0126). Images were promptly observed and captured using Zeiss LSM980 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). 2.20 Statistical Analysis All bioinformatics analyses were conducted using R software (version 4.2.3). Spearman correlation analysis was performed to assess associations between variables. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used to generate survival curves. For statistical comparisons, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was applied to non-normally distributed data, while normally distributed data were analyzed using the unpaired Student’s t p 3 Results 3.1 Distribution of NLR Family Genes and Establishment of NLR Subtypes In this study, a total of 18 NLR family genes were selected for further examination [ 26 Fig. 1A Fig. 1B Fig. 1C Fig. 1D Fig. 1E Fig. 1G Figure 1 Genomic landscape and molecular classification of NLR family genes in HCC.

Despite significant advancements, the intricate processes governing its initiation and progression are still not fully elucidated. The NLR family has garnered considerable attention for its multifaceted roles in cancer development, presenting promising avenues for molecular therapeutic targeting [ 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 The study then rigorously validated the NLR_score’s prognostic power across TCGA-HCC and ICGC-HCC cohorts, consistently finding that a high NLR_score correlated with significantly reduced OS. Delving into the biological distinctions via Gene Set Variation Analysis, we found crucial metabolic and proliferative differences. The high NLR_score group was markedly enriched in linoleic acid metabolism. This pathway is often hijacked by cancer, producing pro-inflammatory lipid mediators and reactive oxygen species that fuel tumorigenesis, proliferation, and foster a pro-tumorigenic inflammatory microenvironment in HCC [ 38 39 40 Our prognostic analysis of individual NLR family genes identified NOD1, NOD2, NLRP4, and NLRP5 as significant risk factors impacting OS in HCC patients. Given the limited research on NLRP4 and particularly NLRP5 in HCC, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into their roles. Our experiments definitively showed that NLRP5, but not NLRP4, significantly promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cell lines. In vivo 41 42 43 44 45 Despite these compelling findings, our study has certain limitations: First, we did not comprehensively evaluate NLRP5’s impact on tumor-infiltrating immune cells, such as macrophages and CD8 + We would like to thank the Scientific Research and Experimental Center of Anhui Medical University for their invaluable support and assistance in this study.
