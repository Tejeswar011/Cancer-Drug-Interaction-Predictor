On the one hand, researches revealed that people diagnosed with anxiety or depression are more likely to develop cancers [ 1 2 3 4 1 5 6 7 8 9 5 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for about 80–85% of all lung cancers, of which about 75% of patients are diagnosed to be in the middle to late stages, and the 5-year survival rate is extremely low [ 10 11 6 6 12 5 The stress response consists of neuroendocrine cascades mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis through the release of stress neurotransmitters and hormones, including catecholamines and glucocorticoids (GCs) [ 13 14 15 16 17 8 However, the effect and the mode of stress on T cell in tumor microenvironment of NSCLC, especially for CD8 + + Materials and Methods Cell culture LLC cells were purchased from the Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SCSP-5252), and maintained in the Lab of Institute of Integrative Medicine, Fudan University. KLN205 cell was a gift from Institute of Integrative Medicine, Fudan University. Cells were cultured with DMEM (6,124,404, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (40131ES76, Yeasen Biotechnology) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution (GNM15140-1, GENOM), kept at 37 °C in an incubator with humidity and 5% CO 2 Animals Male C57BL/6 J and DBA/2 mice, 6–8 weeks old, weighing 20-22g, were purchased from Shanghai Jihui Experimental Animal Feeding Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) (SCXK (沪) 2022–0009) and raised under specific pathogen-free conditions at Fudan University (Shanghai, China). Each set of five mice was kept in plastic cages (300 × 200 × 120 mm) with paper chips for bedding. Rooms were kept at a constant temperature (23 ± 3 °C) and humidity (50% ± 10%), with simulated day/night cycles (12 h each day, lights on at 8:00 am). Animal experimental protocols were approved by Fudan University’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Number: 202405FD0001). All authors are informed and agree. After one-week adaption, the mice were randomly divided into five groups: the control group (Con), corticosterone treatment group (COR), RU486 treatment group (RU486), the acute restrain (AR) stress group and AR + RU486 treatment group (AR + RU486). In short, 5 × 10 5 18 Isolation and cultivation of primary CD8 + CD8a (Ly-2) MicroBeads (130–117-044, Miltenyi Biotec) was used to isolate CD8 + + + 2 Open-field test The open-field test (OFT) was performed in a box (80 cm × 80 cm × 80 cm). Each mouse was placed in a corner at the start of the test and recorded for 6 min by a camera located above the box. We cleaned the device with 75% alcohol after each trial. A tracking system with an automated analysis system recorded the number of entries into the center zone, the time spent in the center zone and the total distance traveled (Omnitech SuperFlex). The center area of the open-field apparatus was 25% of the total area (a square of approximately 40 cm × 40 cm). Light–dark box test For the light–dark box test (LDBT), each mouse was placed in the center of a light compartment (30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm, white surfaces) connected with a dark compartment (20 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm, black surfaces) by a square aperture. Mouse activity was recorded during a 6-min test period. The time that the mouse spent in the light box, as well as the number of transitions from the light to the dark compartment, was analyzed by Noldus EthoVision XT. Forced swimming test The forced swimming test (FST) was used to estimate the depression-related behavior as described before [ 19 Flow cytometry Mix tumor tissues or cultured CD8 + ELISA The level of corticosterone (COR), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), norepinephrine and adrenaline in the mice serum was measured by COR kits (RK09054, ABclonal Biotech), ACTH kits (RK09105, ABclonal Biotech), norepinephrine kits (RK00694, ABclonal Biotech) and adrenaline kits (RK09110, ABclonal Biotech) following the manufacturers’ instructions, respectively. Immunofluorescence Immunofluorescent staining was conducted on tumor tissue sections embedded in paraffin, following established protocols. After standard procedures for deparaffinization, rehydration and blocking, the sections were subjected to overnight incubation at 4 ℃ with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies utilized in this investigation targeted CD8a (ab217344, Abcam, UK), PD-1(ab214421, Abcam, UK), TIM-3 (75743T, CST, USA) and GR (24,050–1-AP, Proteintech, China). Subsequent to PBS washing, the sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescence-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies. Following an additional wash, the sections were mounted using a mounting medium containing 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Ultimately, the stained sections were examined and documented through a confocal microscope. Fluorescence intensity of slices was analyzed by ImageJ software.

Group-to-group comparisons were made utilizing the unpaired Student’s t-test, while multi-group analyses were conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc tests. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the linear relationship between two variables or genes. Significance levels were designated as follows: * p p p p Results Stress leads to accelerated proliferation of NSCLC To investigate the potential impact of stress on NSCLC development, we took advantage of acute restraint stress (AR) models (Fig. 1 1 1 1 3 1 1 1 Fig. 1 Stress promotes NSCLC progression. a b c b c d e f g h p p p Stress induces alterations in tumor immune microenvironment of NSCLC To investigate the potential immunosuppressive impact of acute restrain stress, we analyzed the immune infiltrates of subcutaneous cancers in mice using flow cytometry (Fig. 2 + 2 2 2 + + 2 2 2 2 2 Fig. 2 Stress impairs NSCLC immunosurveillance. a b + c d e f g + h + + p p p Stress promotes exhaustion of CD8 + Due to the crucial role of T lymphocytes in tumor immunity, we further analyzed the immune function changes of T cells in subcutaneous tumors of mice. Flow cytometric analyses showed that anxiety-like behavior caused by stress can inhibit the proliferation and tumor killing function of T cells and induce T cell exhaustion, specifically manifested in reduced secretion of TNF-α and IFN-γ (Fig. 3 3 + 3 + + + + + + 4 + + + 4 + + + + + 4 Fig. 3 Stress increases CD3 + a + + b + + c + + d + + e + + f + + g + + p p Fig. 4 Stress induces CD8 + a + + b + + c + + d e p p p p HPA axis involves in tumor growth promoting effect induced by stress Previous studies indicated that stress often causes disruption of the HPA axis. Thus, we further explored in the alternations of stress hormones in mice serum by ELISA after ten-day AR. After AR treatment in mice, a significant elevation of ACTH and COR in serum was observed (Fig. 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 + 5 + 5 Fig. 5 Stress elevates corticosterone in blood and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in tumor.
