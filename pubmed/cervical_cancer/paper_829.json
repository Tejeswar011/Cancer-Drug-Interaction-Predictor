However, disease‐specific metabolic alterations in BU remain largely unknown. Here, untargeted metabolomics and single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) are performed in patients with BU and healthy controls (HC). scRNA‐seq data of experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) mice are also incorporated. The data showed an altered metabolic profile, characterized by upregulated glycolysis in BU. MYC is predicted to be a hub molecule regulating glycolysis and T cell response. Notably, it is discovered that the expression level of MYC is higher in BU compare to HC and may reflect the treatment response of BU disease. Correspondingly, the scRNA‐seq data of EAU mice also reveal higher glycolysis levels and MYC expression. Further studies reveal that inhibition of MYC repressed glycolysis and exerted therapeutic effects similar to those of glycolysis inhibitors, including amelioration of EAU and repression of the abnormal response of effector T cells (T helper [Th]‐1 and Th17 cells). Mechanically, inhibiting MYC disrupts the glycolysis‐PI3K signaling circuit to curb the effector T cell response in uveitis. Collectively, the study indicated that MYC promoted glycolysis to fuel abnormal T‐cell responses, thus therapeutically targeting MYC would provide an attractive approach for treating BU. Integrated single‐cell transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses reveal that MYC‐driven glycolysis activates the PI3K‐AKT‐FOXO1 pathway, disrupting Th17/Treg balance and promoting uveitis. MYC inhibition restores immune homeostasis and alleviates disease symptoms. These findings highlight MYC as a key metabolic regulator and suggest its potential as a therapeutic target in Behçet's uveitis.

[  1 ] [  2  3  4 ] [  5 ] [  4 ] [  6 ] [  7 ] [  7 ] Recent studies have shown the role of immune cells in the pathogenesis of BU. Enhanced effector T cells (T helper [Th]‐1 and Th17 cells) and suppressed regulatory T (Treg) cells have been observed in patients with BU. [  8  9 ] [  4 ] [  10 ] [  10 ] [  11  12 ] In recent years, the importance of cellular metabolism in immune cells and autoimmune diseases has been proposed, thus initiating a novel field named immunometabolism. [  13 ] [  14 ] [  15 ] [  13 ] [  16 ] Single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) allows high‐throughput and high‐resolution analysis of individual cells [  17 ] [  18  19 ] [  20 ] 2 Results 2.1 Study Design and Serum Metabolic Profile of BU To explore the metabolic and transcriptional alterations during BU, we conducted untargeted metabolic analysis and scRNA‐seq on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy controls (HCs) and patients with BU ( Figure  1 [  21 ] 1B 1B 1C 1C 1D 1E 1F 1G 1G [  20  22  23  24 ] [  24 ] [  22  23 ] [  18  25 ] 1H 1I,J S1A,B Figure 1 Patients with BU showed a different metabolic profile compared to HCs.

T cell (TC: CD3D, IL7R), natural killer cell (NK: NCAM1), B cell (BC: CD79A, MS4A1), monocyte (MC: CD14, LYZ), and dendritic cell (DC: CLEC10A, CD1C) were annotated based on the expression of canonical lineage markers and other genes specifically upregulated in each cluster ( Figure  2 S1C,D [  26  27  28 ] 2B 2B 2C S1E Figure 2 scRNA‐seq depicted altered transcriptome of PBMCs during BU A) UMAP clustering of PBMCs from all participants.

We obtained results similar to the GO analysis that the pathways related to inflammation, immune response, and cell activation were enhanced in the BU group (Figure S1E S1E 2D [  29  30 ] 2E [  18 ] 2F Next, we conducted DEG analyses for each major immune cell type. The genetic changes of all five major immune cell types were mainly upregulated in BU (Figure 2G 2H 2H 2H [  8  9 ] 2I 2I 2I 2.3 MYC is a Potential Regulator of Glycolysis in T Cells during BU Pathogenesis Although abnormalities in various immune cells are critical contributors to autoimmune destruction in uveitis, T cells, especially effector T cells (e.g., Th1 and Th17 cells) and Treg are considered pivotal in the pathogenesis of uveitis and its classic animal model, EAU.

MYCi361 disturbed CD4+ T cell proliferation (Figure 3M 3N 3N 2.4 Enhanced Glycolysis and MYC Expression were Observed in EAU EAU model was developed to further investigate the role of MYC. Cervical draining lymph nodes (CDLNs) are the major draining lymph nodes of the eyes and may be important sources of auto‐reactive immune cells that target the eyes.

[  48  49 ] [  22  23 ] 6G–L S8A–F 3 Discussion In this study, we used untargeted metabolomics and scRNA‐seq to show metabolic signatures and transcriptional alterations in BU. Using untargeted metabolomics and a seahorse extracellular flux analyzer, our study showed that patients with BU had altered serum metabolic profiles and upregulated glycolysis compared to those with HCs. scRNA‐seq data showed that genes involved in adaptive immunity and T‐cell responses were upregulated in BU. Metabolic analysis tools plugged into the scRNA‐seq indicated the enhanced glycolytic capacity of total immune cells and T cell subsets, particularly CD4+Tem cells. Using CytoHubba, MYC was predicted to be a hub gene. Notably, MYC expression was correlated with disease stage and might reflect the treatment response in BU disease. Further experiments based on EAU showed that MYC regulates the effector T cell response in uveitis by regulating the collaboration between PI3K‐AKT‐FOXO1 signaling and glycolysis. MYC inhibitor disrupted the glycolysis‐PI3K signaling circuit to repress abnormal effector T‐cell responses. Metabolism regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation, and function under healthy and disease conditions.

We further observed that the expression of MYC was correlated with BU development and reflected the treatment response. Thus, MYC might be a predictor of treatment response and a novel therapeutic target for patients with BU especially those response inadequately to conventionally therapy. 5 Experimental Section Mice Wild‐type C57BL/6J mice (six‐ to eight‐week‐old, 18–25 g) were purchased from Guangdong Medical Lab Animal Center (Guangzhou, China). The mice were housed individually in cages with unrestricted access to food and water under specific pathogen‐free (SPF) conditions. They were maintained at a temperature of 22–24 °C, a relative humidity of 50–70%, and a 12‐h light/dark cycle in the animal facilities at at the Experimental Animal Center of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center of Sun Yat‐Sen University. All experimental procedures involving mice were approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center of Sun Yat‐Sen University (approval no. 2018‐0189). Human Donors BU was diagnosed based on disease manifestations and the results of standard coherent optical tomography, according to the International Criteria for BD (ICBD). [  66 ] S1 Additionally, 10 BU patients with improvement after treatment (BU treated) and 10 BU patients who responded inadequately to corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs (BU response inadequately) were recruited. The “BU treated” was diagnosed by a two‐step decrease in level of inflammation (anterior chamber cells, vitreous haze) or anterior chamber cell grade of 0.5+ to 0, a vitreous haze grade of 0.5+ to 0, and no newly enlarged active inflammatory choroidal or retinal lesions in both eyes after therapy. [  67  68 ] [  67 ] The clinical information including gender, age, affected organs, disease score, as well as grading for anterior chamber cells and anterior chamber flare was supplied in Table S1 Establishment of EAU IRBP1‐20 and complete Freund's adjuvant containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Ra were used to establish EAU mice. In addition, pertussis toxin in PBS was intraperitoneally injected on day 0 and day 2 after immunization. [  69 ] [  69 ] Treatment Protocols The mice were intraperitoneally injected daily with 2‐deoxy‐d‐glucose (2‐DG) (50 mg kg −1 −1 [  20 ] −1 m [  70 ] Mice were intraperitoneally injected with MYCi361 (50 mg kg −1 −1 [  71 ] −1 m [  71 ] Adoptive Transfer Experiment Cells from the CDLNs of EAU mice (day 14) stimulated with IRBP1‐20 (20 ug mL −1 7 Lentivirus Transduction MYC expression was knocked down using shRNA carried on a lentivirus vector (OBIO, Shanghai, China). The shRNA target sequences for MYC were 5′‐ACGTCTTGGAACGTCAGAG‐3′. The negative control shRNA sequence was 5′‐TTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT‐3′. Cells were incubated with lentivirus and polybrene (5 µg mL −1 −1 Flow Cytometry After staining with live/dead dye, the harvested cells of mice were stained with surface markers. For mice samples, the cells were stained with PerCP/Cyanine5.5‐anti‐CD4 (Biolegend, 100434, 0.2 µg mL); For human samples, the cells were stained with APC‐anti‐CD4 (Biolegend, 344613, 0.2 µg mL −1 For intracellular staining, the cells of mice were stimulated with 50 ng mL −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 CFSE Assay PBMC from 6 BU patients were collected using Ficoll‐Hypaque solution (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA), followed by standard density gradient centrifugation. ≈1 × 10^6 CD4+ T cells of PBMC from each BU patient were isolated using flow cytometry. Purified CD4+ T cells were conjugated with 2.5 m m Seahorse Assay Seahorse Bioscience XFe24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent) was used to measure the glycolytic activity of intact PBMCs and cells of CDLNs by monitoring the ECAR according to the instrument manual. In detail, the XFe24 sensor cartridge was soaked in Calibrant overnight. PBMCs from HC and patients with BU (5 × 10^5 cells per well) or CDLN cells from EAU mice with/without treatment (5 × 10^5 cells per well) were seeded in poly‐lysine coated XFe24‐well seahorse culture microplate in 200 µL of Agilent Seahorse XF RPMI, pH 7.4 containing 2 m m Metabolomic Analysis—Sample preparation Plasma contains a substantial amount of proteins, lipids, and other non‐target components, which can affect the stability of instrument detection and potentially lead to biases that may interfere with metabolite signals. Thus the plasma samples were processed and obtained their extracts for analysis. The collected plasma samples were thawed on ice. Added 400 µL pre‐cooled methanol to 1.5 mL EP tubes. A 100 µL sample was added to the tube and vortexed. The mixture was then stored at −20 °C for 2 h. After centrifuging at 20 000 g for 10 min, the supernatants were transferred into a new 1.5 mL EP tube and dried off. The dried plasma extract for subsequent analysis was stored at −80 °C. Additionally, a pooled extract was prepared for QC by combining 10 µL of extract from each sample. Metabolomic Analysis—Liquid Chromatography‐Mass Spectrometry All samples were analyzed using the Waters ACQUITY UPLC System with an ACQUITY UPLC T3 column (100 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.8 µm). The mobile phase consisted of phase A (5 mmol L −1 −1 Metabolomic Analysis—Quality Control and Quality Assurance (QA) To minimize batch‐to‐batch variability, all clinical samples were processed and analyzed in a single analytical batch. Specifically, sample preparation, extraction, and LC‐MS analysis were conducted in a continuous sequence without inter‐batch interruptions. Additionally, during the sequencing process, the samples were analyzed in a random order to avoid potential grouping effects based on sample type or acquisition time (Table S4 To monitor and correct for potential signal drift and ensure system stability, a total of 7 QC samples were inserted at regular intervals throughout the sequence: three QC samples were used initially to stabilize the system, and one QC sample was run after every 10 experimental samples. Metabolomic Analysis—Batch Effect Evaluation and Correction Although all samples were processed and analyzed in a single analytical batch, potential intra‐batch effects were carefully evaluated using unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA). PCA plots demonstrated no significant clustering based on injection order or other potential confounding factors, confirming the absence of detectable batch effects. Furthermore, quality control‐based robust LOESS signal correction was applied to QC samples to minimize any potential signal drift. Metabolomic Analysis—Data Preprocessing and Normalization The intensity of peak data was further preprocessed by metaX. Those features that were detected in less than 50% of QC samples or 80% of biological samples were removed, and the remaining peaks with missing values were imputed with the k‐nearest neighbor algorithm to further improve the data quality. PCA was performed for outlier detection and batch effects evaluation using the pre‐processed dataset. Probabilistic Quotient Normalization (PQN) was used to normalize the data to obtain the normalized ion intensity data of each sample. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) of the metabolic features was calculated across all QC samples, and those >30% were then removed. Metabolomic Analysis—Metabolites identification The acquired MS data pretreatments including peak picking, peak grouping, retention time correction, second peak grouping, as well as annotation of isotopes and adducts were performed using XCMS software. LC−MS raw data files were converted into mzXML format and then processed by the XCMS, CAMERA, and metaX toolbox implemented with the R software. Each ion was identified by combining retention time (RT) and m/z data. Intensities of each peak were recorded and a 3D matrix containing arbitrarily assigned peak indices (retention time‐m/z pairs), sample names (observations), and ion intensity information (variables) was generated. The online HMDB database was used to annotate the metabolites of samples by matching the exact molecular mass data, name, and formula of samples with those from the database. If a mass difference between the observed and the database value was less than 10 ppm, the metabolite would be annotated and the molecular formula of metabolites would be further identified and validated by the isotopic distribution measurements. Compound mass spectrometry databases and an in‐house fragment spectrum library of metabolites were also used to validate the metabolite identification. Thus, metabolites were annotate by matching MS1 using the online HMDB database and matching MS/MS spectra using compound mass spectrometry databases, both in‐house and open source. According to the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI), [  21 ] Metabolomic Analysis—KEGG Enrichment Analysis Supervised PLS‐DA was conducted to discriminate the different variables between groups, and the VIP value was calculated. A VIP cut‐off value of 1.0 was used to select important features. In the multivariate models, seven‐fold cross‐validation was used to safeguard against overfitting. Non‐parametric methods (Mann‐Whitney U test) were conducted to detect significantly differences in metabolite between the 2 groups (p value adjusted by FDR <0.05). KEGG enrichment analysis was performed on significantly different metabolites. [  20 ] Isolation of CDLNs and PBMC for scRNA‐Seq For pipeline analysis, CDLN cells were harvested from normal group and EAU groups at different time points. The cell viability in each sample exceeded 85%. For PBMC, the venous blood samples were extracted using Ficoll‐Hypaque solution, then processed via standard density gradient centrifugation approaches to obtain PBMCs. The cell viability was more than 85% in all the samples. scRNA‐Seq Data Processing scRNA‐seq libraries were generated using the Chromium Single Cell 5′ Library and Gel Bead Kit (10x Genomics, 120237) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In detail, after washing with 0.04% BSA buffer (0.02 g BSA dissolved in 50 mL of deionized PBS), cells were captured in droplets. Then, reverse transcription, emulsion breaking, barcoded‐cDNA purification with Dynabeads, and PCR amplification were conducted step by step. The amplified cDNA was then used to construct the 5′ gene expression library. Specifically, fragmenting and end‐repair, double‐size selection with SPRIselect beads, and sequencing were conducted on 50 ng of amplified cDNA using the NovaSeq platform (Illumina NovaSeq6000) to yield 150 bp paired‐end reads. Initial processing of the sequenced data was performed using CellRanger software v3.0.2 (10x Genomics). Data were analyzed using the Scanpy package (v1.9.1) in python (v3.7.12). The batch effect across different samples was removed using the bbknn package (v1.1.5). Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering Analysis For scRNA‐seq data analysis with Scanpy, Scanpy used “pp.normalize_total” to scale and standardize the count values of the single‐cell expression matrix, commonly known as CPM (counts per million). Furtherly, in order to better balance the impact of different sequencing depths among different samples, Scanpy further used the “pp. log1p” function to perform log (CPM+1) conversion on CPM values. After that, “sc.tl.leiden” was used to cluster cells, and the “sc.pl.umap” function was used to visualize with a 2D UMAP algorithm. Additionally, “sc.tl.rank_genes” was used to generate marker genes of different clusters and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) on distinct cell types. To understand the global transcriptional changes during BU, DEG analysis between all immune cells from the BU group and those from the HC group was conducted using “sc.tl.rank_genes” of Scanpy. Genes with | Log2 (fold change) | >0.5 and adjusted p GO Analysis Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using the Metascape web tool ( www.metascape.org Protein‐Protein Interaction Network Construction and Hub Genes Prediction The upregulated DEGs of T cells in the BU/HC comparison group were inputted into the String database [  38 ] [  39 ] Statistics All experiments were repeated at least three times.
