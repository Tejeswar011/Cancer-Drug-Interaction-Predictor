The expression of various types of testis cancer antigens (TCAs) in breast carcinomas suggests a potential transition to male germ cell features within the tumor. This study explores the cellular populations in breast cancer that express genes associated with male germ cell development. We re-analyzed published datasets to identify the germline-associated genes in breast tumors. We then experimentally validated the expression of the identified genes in 28 breast tissue tumor samples using a quantitative RT-PCR. Based on available datasets, we also performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the tumor heterogeneity and cellular clustering. A total of 455 overexpressed genes were identified that were related to fetal primordial germ cells (PGCs), particularly those in the male gonad. Our examinations showed a significant overexpression of five genes ( CCNB1 CCNB2 PTTG1 RACGAP1 UBE2C breast cancer epithelial-to-germline transition cellular clustering in silico analysis single-cell RNA sequencing observational study Cancer Research Center of Tehran University of Medical Science 99-1-115-47842 This research was funded by the Cancer Research Center of Tehran University of Medical Science, grant number no. 99-1-115-47842. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Breast cancer, as identified in the latest GLOBOCAN study, remains the second most commonly diagnosed malignancy globally across both sexes [ 1 2 The concept of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has typically been accepted in the definition of carcinoma development and progression [ 3 3 4 4 5 4 5 Recent studies have brought to light the possible role of germline-associated genes, like testis cancer antigens (TCAs), in the development of breast carcinoma [ 6 6 7 testis specific-10 TSGA-10 testis expressed-101 TEX101 outer dense fiber of sperm tails-3 ODF-3 8 Piwi-like RNA-mediated gene silencing-2 Piwil-2 9 10 Piwil2 9 10 11 Piwil-2 Piwil2 12 Building on this premise, our observational study proposes a possible mechanism in breast tumors characterized by cells with germline traits. This mechanism, termed the epithelial-to-germline transition (EGT), is hypothesized as a possible transformative process leading to the formation of germline-like cells into the tumor. Our research aims to identify and analyze genes involved in this transition in breast carcinoma and to explore their impact on the tumor microenvironment and cellular heterogeneity. 2. Results 2.1. Bioinformatics Analysis of Breast Tumor Differential Gene Expression We performed a series of bioinformatics analyses on the differential gene expression of breast tumors using the available data from two GSE29044 GSE29431 GSE29044 GSE29431 Figure 1 Figure 1 Supplementary Excel file Figure 1 Figure 1 2.2. Association of Breast Tumors’ Differentially Expressed Genes with PGCs The cell type annotation revealed that our 455 target genes in breast tumors were associated with seven types of PGCs. These cell types included fetal adrenal gland PGCs, fetal female gonad PGCs, fetal muscle PGCs, fetal male gonad PGCs, fetal brain PGCs, fetal kidney PGCs, and fetal eye PGCs. The number of active genes in each cell type was 42, 35, 26, 25, 20, 20, and 18, respectively ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 The analysis of genomic data from “The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA)” database, https://ualcan.path.uab.edu/analysis.html Figure 3 CCNB1 CCNB2 CHEK1 FEN1 PTTG1 RACGAP1 UBE2C Figure 3 2.3. Relative Gene Expression Analysis of PGC-Associated Genes in Breast Tumors In this study, we relatively assess the expression of our candidate genes in the tumor samples of 27 individuals with breast carcinoma. The majority of the patients (55%) were over 55 years old, while 29.4% were in the 36–45 and 46–55 age groups, respectively. Only 5.9% of the patients were in the 20–35 age range. No patients under 20 years old were included in this study. The most common stage of cancer among the patients was stage 3 (47.1%), followed by stage 2 (41.2%). Only 11.8% of the patients had metastatic breast cancer. There were no cases of stage 1 breast cancer in the study ( Figure 4 Figure 4 The relative gene expression analysis of seven PGC-associated genes, including CCNB1 CCNB2 FEN1 MCM4 PTTG1 RACGAP1 UBE2C CCNB1 CCNB2 PTTG1 RACGAP1 UBE2C p Figure 4 Figure 4 2.4. Breast Tumor Cellular Clustering Based on the results derived from our experimental evaluations, a series of scRNA-seq analyses on the GSE180286 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 SRY-box transcription factor 4 SOX4 epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR Notch receptor 1 NOTCH1 aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 ALDH1A1 The UMAP analysis of our experimentally approved PGC-associated genes delineated distinct cell populations within the breast cancer tissue, such as B cells, T cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, luminal epithelial cells, and several others. The trajectory analysis illustrates differentiation pathways among various cell types with breast tumor stromal cells, epithelial progenitor cells, and basal cells charting distinct routes, showing diverse origins and lineage commitments ( Figure 6 The pseudotime overlay further quantifies this developmental progression, situating breast cancer stromal cells along a continuum that suggests a maturation from a less differentiated state toward a more specialized stromal phenotype ( Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 FEN1 RACGAP1 MCM4 CCNB1 CCNB UBE2C Figure 6 Figure 6 PTTG1 RACGAP1 Figure 6 3. Discussion Our results are consistent with previous studies that have reported the aberrant expression of testis cancer antigens in various malignancies, including breast cancer. TCAs, also known as cancer–testis antigens (CTAs), are a group of proteins that are normally expressed only in the testis and the germlines but are reactivated in malignant cells [ 6 7 13 13 14 15 15 16 17 18 BUB1B CCNB1 CCNB2 CHEK1 FEN1 MCM4 POLE2 PTTG1 RACGAP1 TTK UBE2C, Previous research has suggested that the aberrant expression of TCA genes may reflect a form of developmental plasticity, whereby epithelial tumor cells temporarily take on germline-like characteristics through epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming [ 13 15 19 20 CCNB1 CCNB2 PTTG1 RACGAP1 UBE2C The B-type cyclins, CCNB1 Cyclin B1 CCNB2 Cyclin B2 21 22 CCNB1 CCNB2 CCNB1 CCNB1 CCNB2 CCNB1 CCNB2 CCNB1 CCNB2 23 24 CCNB1 CCNB2 25 PTTG1 26 PTTG1 PTTG1 KIFC1 KIF2C cell division cycle 20 CDC20 CCNB1 kinase B AURKB cyclin B/CDK1 27 RACGAP1 RACGAP1 28 29 RACGAP1 30 RACGAP1 31 UBE2C 32 33 UBE2C 34 UBE2C 35 Prior clinical and observational studies have demonstrated a positive correlation between the EGT gene cluster and a poor prognosis as well as therapy resistance in patients with breast cancer [ 36 37 38 CCNB1 CCNB2 PTTG1 RACGAP1 UBE2C CCNB1 CCNB2 39 PTTG1 PTTG1 40 41 RACGAP1 RACGAP1 RACGAP1 42 UBE2C UBE2C 38 43 Based on the findings from our experimental study on the patients’ tumor samples, we further performed an scRNA-seq analysis of the GSE180286 44 45 45 46 47 FEN1 RACGAP1 MCM4 CCNB1 CCNB2 PTTG1 UBE2C 36 37 38 Furthermore, our pseudotime analysis and clustering results ( Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 In summary, this study introduces the EGT as a possible developmental mechanism in breast carcinoma. Mechanistically, it could be proposed that a sequential reprogramming process may trigger chromatin remodeling, DNA hypomethylation, and the reactivation of germline transcription factors, ultimately leading to the aberrant expression of typically silenced testis-restricted genes. Such a transition could confer an increased stemness, immune evasion capacity, and therapeutic resistance upon tumor cells. Further research is needed to validate and explore this mechanism and to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer. Our study also has some limitations, including its reliance on a single scRNA-seq dataset, potential differences in gene expression between bulk and single-cell levels, and a lack of investigation into the functional roles of the 11 genes in different cell clusters. Further research is necessary to functionally examine the role of EGT genes in the development of breast carcinoma cells. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Identify the Germline-Associated Genes in Breast Tumors 4.1.1. Bulk mRNA Expression Analysis We utilized the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds GSE29044 GSE42568 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/ https://huygens.science.uva.nl/VolcaNoseR/ p 4.1.2. Enrichment Analysis Comprehensive enrichment analysis of the upregulated genes was employed using the EnrichR system, accessible at https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/ GSE29044 GSE42568 https://bioinfo.uth.edu/webcsea/ 4.1.3. Network Analysis and Identification of Target mRNA To identify key involved genes, we used protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks within gene sets related to the fetal germ gonad area, and we utilized the STRING database, https://string-db.org/ To analyze the gene expression levels of our targeted genes, we utilized the “The Cancer Genome Atlas” (TCGA) database, accessible at https://ualcan.path.uab.edu/analysis.html 4.2. The Experimental Validation of the Candidate Gene Expression in Breast Tumor Samples 4.2.1. Ethical Considerations and Biopsy Procedures The experimental phase of this study involved a cohort of 28 female participants who had recently been diagnosed with breast carcinoma. This study took place from January 2021 to April 2023 at the Cancer Institute of Iran, affiliated with Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, Iran). Tumor tissue samples were collected by the Iran National Tumor Bank at the Cancer Institute of Iran during that period of time. All participants, aged 20 or above, provided their written informed consent prior to the procedure. They underwent ultrasound-guided biopsies with a 14-gauge core needle. A pathologist then conducted tumor histopathological examinations using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations and approved by the Institutional Review Board of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran (ethical code: IR.TUMS.IKHC.REC.1399.384). The demographic and clinicopathological details of the patient are presented in Figure 4 4.2.2. SYBR Green Quantitative PCR (qPCR) Techniques Total RNA was extracted from the tissue samples using the RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany; Cat. No. 74534). The isolated RNA was then converted into cDNA using the cDNA synthesis kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan; Cat. No. RR037A). We assessed the expression of targeted mRNAs via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), employing SYBR Green Real-Time PCR Master Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA; Cat. No. 4309155) and conducting the analysis on an ABI Prism 7900HT system in triplicate. For normalization, GAPDH served as the internal control gene, and the ΔΔCt method was used to normalize expression levels. We utilized RStudio, along with the ggplot2 package, for graphical representation of mRNA expression data. The primers were designed using Primer3 software (version 2.5.0), a standard in bioinformatic primer design, ensuring sequence specificity and optimal annealing characteristics. Their sequences were validated for specificity using the NCBI BLAST database, accessible at https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi Table 1 4.3. Cellular Clustering of Breast Tumor Cells and Target Cell Detection In this study, scRNA-seq was conducted on breast cancer cells, utilizing the GSE180286 https://satijalab.org/seurat/ Cluster annotation was performed using a two-step strategy. First, we identified cluster-specific marker genes using FindAllMarkers (Seurat package, Version 4.3.0) with the following cutoffs: adjusted p https://bioinfo.uth.edu/webcsea/ For pseudotime trajectory analysis in our Seurat dataset, we employed the Destiny package, https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/destiny.html https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3/ 4.4. Statistical Methodology The data were statistically processed and presented as mean ± standard deviation. This analysis was performed using SPSS (Version 26.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). For mean comparison across different groups, an ANOVA test was applied, complemented by a Tukey post hoc test for detailed group analysis. A p p 5. Conclusions Breast cancer, characterized by its complexity and heterogeneity, presents substantial challenges in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. This study introduced a novel concept, the “epithelial-to-germline transition,” elucidating the reactivation of testis cancer antigens and the acquisition of germline characteristics by carcinoma cells in breast tumor development. Through integrative analyses of transcriptomic datasets, we identified a germline-associated molecular signature, with CCNB1 CCNB2 PTTG1 RACGAP1 UBE2C Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms26188958/s1 Author Contributions Conceptualization, H.K. and S.K.; methodology, H.K. and S.K.; validation, R.S., H.M., and K.N.; formal analysis, H.K. and S.K.; investigation, H.K., S.K., and M.D.; resources, S.R.M.; data curation, H.K., S.K., M.D., A.E.R., and A.M.; manuscript writing and original draft preparation, H.K., S.K., and M.D.; editing, A.E.R., A.M., M.d.C.S., F.C., and S.R.M.; supervision, H.M. and K.N.; project administration, H.M. and K.N.; funding acquisition, H.M.
