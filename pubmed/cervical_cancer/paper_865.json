B7-H3 and CD39, as immune checkpoints, are potential modulators of the tumor microenvironment and may influence the efficacy of immunotherapies. Methods B7-H3, CD39, and CD8 expression was assessed via immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 268 GC tissues and 80 gastric precancerous lesions. The correlation between B7-H3 and CD39 expression was analyzed using Spearman's correlation. Multiplex immunohistochemistry (m-IHC) was employed to determine the co-localization of B7-H3 and CD39 in GC tissues. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression models were utilized to evaluate clinical outcomes in different patient subgroups. Results Both B7-H3 and CD39 expression showed a stepwise increase during gastric carcinogenesis including chronic superficial gastritis (CSG), chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN), high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) to GC, with significantly higher expression levels in GC tissues compared to all precancerous lesions ( P P P P P P P P P P P Conclusion The co-localized expression of B7-H3 and CD39 in GC patients is strongly associated with poor prognosis. This dual-target expression pattern provides novel insights and a theoretical foundation for the development of dual-target immune checkpoint inhibitors as potential therapeutic strategies.

The disease predominantly affects middle-aged and older men, especially in East Asia. 1 2 3 4 B7-H3 (CD276) is a co-stimulatory molecule characterized by low expression in normal tissues but significantly elevated levels in tumor tissues. 5 7  8 9 10 131 11 12 CD39, first identified in Epstein-Barr virus-infected B-lymphocytes in 1982, is another critical immune molecule in the TME. As an ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase, CD39 regulates the conversion of extracellular ATP (eATP) into adenosine, balancing the pro-inflammatory immune response and the immunosuppressive effects of adenosine. 13 14 15 17 16 18 Despite their distinct roles in cancer progression and immune evasion, the synergistic effects of B7-H3 and CD39 in GC remain poorly understood. Our previous research identified B7-H3 as a critical prognostic marker, with elevated expression in the TME strongly associated with poorer survival outcomes. 19 20 21 22 Materials and Methods Patients and Specimens This retrospective cohort study was conducted in accordance with the REMARK guidelines for tumor marker prognostic studies.  23 Gastroscopic biopsy specimens were obtained from all cases except GC, which were collected through surgical resection. All tissue samples, regardless of collection method, were harvested from the gastric antrum. All diagnoses were independently confirmed by two certified pathologists. Post-surgical resection specimens were fixed in neutral-buffered formalin and subsequently embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. This retrospective study incorporated a comprehensive dataset of clinicopathological characteristics, including age, gender, tumor volume, tumor differentiation, stage, and depth (as detailed in Table 1 Table 1.

Exclusion Criteria Samples were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: Non-adenocarcinoma histology (eg, neuroendocrine carcinoma, lymphoma, or gastrointestinal stromal tumor [GIST]); Non-radical surgical procedures (palliative resection, exploratory laparotomy, or endoscopic submucosal dissection/mucosal resection [ESD/EMR] specimens); Inadequate tumor content or compromised sample quality (eg, excessive decalcification, autolysis); Concurrent active autoimmune disorders (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis), HIV infection, or active syphilis; Missing essential clinical information (particularly pTNM staging data). Tissue Microarray (TMA) Construction Tissue Microarray (TMA) was constructed using an automated tissue array instrument. Each paraffin-embedded specimen was divided into two 1 mm cores, each containing tumor cell tissue and infiltrating immune cell tissue. Subsequently, 4-μm-thick TMA sections were created. Immunohistochemistry and Scoring 4-μm-thick sections were cut from paraffin-embedded tissue blocks, mounted on polylysine-coated slides, and then deparaffinized and rehydrated using xylene and graded alcohol. The sections were treated by autoclaving in sodium citrate retrieval solution for 3 min. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min at room temperature. After washing twice in PBST, sections were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin for 45 min, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. The following primary antibodies were used according to the manufacturer's instructions: mouse anti-human B7-H3 monoclonal antibody, 1/200 dilution (Cat No: 66 481-1-Ig, Proteintech, China), rabbit anti-human CD39 polyclonal antibody, 1/1000 dilution (Cat No: 14211-1-AP, Proteintech, China) and mouse anti-human CD8 monoclonal antibody, 1/10 000 dilution (Cat No: 66868-1-Ig, Proteintech, China). After primary antibody binding, slides were washed with PBST and then incubated with labeled polymer horseradish peroxidase rabbit/mouse antibody for 15 min ( GP016129 Multiple Immunohistochemistry and Scoring Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and antibodies specific for B7-H3, CD39, and CD8 were performed on gastric cancer TMA tissues as described above. Briefly, slides were dewaxed in xylene and then rehydrated with ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed at boiling point in sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 15 min and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 min at room temperature. Nonspecific antigen binding was blocked with goat serum solution for 30 min. Slides were incubated with the primary antibody B7-H3 (1:200, Cat No: 66481-1-Ig, Proteintech, China) overnight at 4 °C, and then horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled secondary antibody was added for 30 min at room temperature. Next, slides were incubated with tyramide signal amplification (TSA) Fluorescein (Cat No: NEL701A001KT, Akoya) for 10 min at room temperature. Between subsequent staining runs, slides were microwaved to remove the Ab-TSA complex and blocked with goat serum solution, and the CD39 primary antibody was incubated between this cycle using TSA Cyanine 3 (Cat No: NEL704A001KT, Akoya) to correspond to the label. Similarly, in the last run, CD8 was visualized using TSA Cyanine 5 (Cat No: NEL705A001KT, Akoya), and finally, nuclei were visualized with DAPI (DAPI Fluoromount-G, Southern Biotech, USA). Representative images of each sample were captured and analyzed by Mantra and Inform software (Akoya Biosciences). Pathologic tissues from each patient were randomized in 4 multispectral regions (200x magnification field of view), the co-localization of B7-H3 and CD39 was quantified using a scoring system based on the percentage of double positive area, ranging from 0 to 12. A score of 0 indicates no co-localization expression, while scores of 1-4 represent low co-localization expression, 5-8 indicate moderate co-localization expression, and 8-12 denote strong co-localization expression. For the purpose of this study, moderate and strong co-localization expressions were considered as positive B7-H3 and CD39 co-localization. Additionally, CD8 + + + Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad prism 9.0 and SPSS software. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of death. It should be emphasized that OS was recorded in only 198 patients. The chi-square test was used to analyze the correlation between categorical variables. Correlations between variables were analyzed using Spearman rank correlation analysis. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox proportional risk models were used for univariate and multivariate analyses. P Results B7-H3 and CD39 Expression at Different Pathological Stages of Precancerous Diseases of the Stomach To investigate the expression and correlation of B7-H3 and CD39 in gastric cancer tissues, we first examined the expression levels of these two markers in gastric cancer tissues and non-neoplastic control specimens.

While both molecules showed limited expression in gastric precancerous lesions, their coordinated upregulation peaked in GC tissues, suggesting a stage-specific synergy during malignant transformation. Multiplex immunohistochemistry confirmed that B7-H3 and CD39 colocalized in tumor and stromal compartments, yet exhibited distinct cellular tropism: B7-H3 was predominantly expressed in tumor and stromal cells, whereas CD39 additionally marked immune infiltrates. This tumor-enriched co-expression pattern implies a potential functional crosstalk between B7-H3 and CD39 in GC progression, challenging the conventional focus on their isolated roles in tumor biology. While previous studies have predominantly examined the individual roles of B7-H3 or CD39 in tumor biology, our findings based on data from 268 GC patients suggest that there may be a clinically relevant functional interplay between these two molecules. CD39 primarily functions to hydrolyze Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) into adenosine, which has dual effects: inhibiting the activity of T cells, Natural Killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs) via A2A and A2B receptors, while simultaneously enhancing the function of regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and M2 macrophages, thereby facilitating tumor immune evasion.  24  25 Beyond their immunosuppressive roles, B7-H3 and CD39 intersect in various oncogenic signaling pathways. B7-H3 activates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and drives tumor migration, invasion, and metastasis. 26 27 28 30  9 31 32 33 34 14 35 These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting B7-H3 and CD39 through dual CAR-T cell therapies or bispecific antibodies. Such strategies could inhibit immune escape mechanisms, remodel the metabolic properties of the TME, and enhance the efficacy of antitumor immunity.

These findings provide a foundation for further exploration of their roles in tumor immunity and potential as therapeutic targets. Dual-targeting strategies that disrupt the interplay between B7-H3 and CD39 could reshape the TME, enhance immune recognition, and improve therapeutic outcomes in gastric cancer. Conclusion The present study observed that the expression of the immune-checkpoint molecules B7-H3 and CD39 increased progressively across the gastric carcinogenesis sequence, with the highest levels detected in established GC. Co-localization of these molecules was found to be associated with larger tumor volume, more advanced stage, deeper invasion, lymph-node involvement, distant metastasis, and reduced overall survival. These findings suggest this co-localization pattern may have potential as both a prognostic biomarker and a possible dual-target (B7-H3-CD39) for immunotherapy consideration. Multivariate analysis indicated this co-localization might serve as an independent prognostic biomarker.
