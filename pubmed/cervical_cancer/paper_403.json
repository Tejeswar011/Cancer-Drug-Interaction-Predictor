Materials and methods The research was conducted as a comparative descriptive and cross-sectional study with a total of 202 women, consisting of 100 with gynecological cancer and 102 without. The data were obtained through face-to-face interview techniques using a personal information form created by the researcher, the Marital Satisfaction Scale, the Spousal Support Scale, and the Quality of Life Scale (Short Form Health Survey- SF 36). Results The average age of women with gynecological cancer was 50.76 ± 8.75 years, the duration since diagnosis was 27.6 months, 42% had endometrial cancer, and 48% were at stage I. Quality of life scores measured with SF-36 were significantly lower in women with gynecologic cancer in all subscales except mental health (p values ​​ranged from 0.001 to 0.050). Spouse support scale in the appraisal support sub-dimension scores were also significantly lower in women with cancer ( p p p Conclusion While quality of life and perceived spousal support decreased in women with gynecological cancer, no significant difference was observed in total marital satisfaction scores. It is anticipated that the traumatic effects caused by gynecological cancer in women will decrease with the care and biopsychosocial support of health professionals.

Method Type of research This research was conducted using a cross-sectional, descriptive-comparative methodology. Population and sample The population of the study consisted of all women aged 18 and over who applied to the Gynecological Oncology Clinic of a City Hospital in Istanbul between May 2022 and December 2022. The number of women to be included in the study was calculated using the G*Power 3.1 program. In calculating the sample size, it was determined that a total of 176 women (with gynecological cancer diagnosis = 88, without gynecological cancer diagnosis = 88) should be reached, with a 95% confidence interval, 5% significance level and 0.50 effect size. Considering that there may be a 10–20% data loss in the study, it was planned to include 104 women in the gynecological cancer diagnosis group (with cancer of the endometrium, ovary, cervix, vulva and vagina) and 104 in the group without gynecological cancer diagnosis, a total of 208 women, and the study was completed with 202 women (with gynecological cancer diagnosis = 100, without gynecological cancer diagnosis = 102). The gynecological cancer group consisted of women aged 18 and over who had been diagnosed with gynecological cancer and were undergoing treatment, were married, were not receiving hormone replacement therapy during menopause, had no psychiatric symptoms or diagnoses related to this issue, had no diagnosis of intellectual disability, dementia, or other organic disorders, had no communication problems, and agreed to participate in the study. The group of women without gynecological cancer consisted of women who were relatives of patients visiting the gynecology outpatient clinic of the hospital where the study was conducted during data collection, did not show signs of psychiatric illness, were married, and agreed to participate in the study. Data collection tools In light of the literature review, data were obtained using the Personal Information Form, Marital Satisfaction Scale, Spousal Support Scale, and Quality of Life Scale (36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36)) created by the researchers. Personal information form This form, created by researchers, collects sociodemographic characteristics (age, education, employment and economic status, family type, etc.), obstetric and gynecological characteristics (number of pregnancies, age at first birth, number and type of births, sexual activity, age and type of menopause, etc.), gynecological cancer characteristics (type and stage of gynecological cancer, time of diagnosis, treatment administered for gynecological cancer, family history of gynecological cancer, etc.) [ 17 20 Marital satisfaction scale The scale was developed by Celik and Yazgan Inanç (2009) and consists of three subscales: family, sexuality, and self. Each item in the scale is a five-point (1–5 points) Likert type, with a minimum score of 13 and a maximum score of 65. A high score indicates good marital satisfaction [ 21 21 Spousal support scale The scale developed by Yıldırım (2004) consists of a total of 27 items and four subscales: emotional support, instrumental and informational support, appraisal support, and social support. Each item in the scale is a three-point Likert type, and the total score that can be obtained varies between 27 and 81. The high score means that spousal support is high [ 22 Quality of life scale (36-Item short form survey (SF-36)) The Turkish validity and reliability study of the scale developed by Ware in 1987 was conducted by Kocyigit et al. (1996). The scale has eight subscales and consists of a total of 36 items. There is no total score for the scale. Evaluation is made based on the total score of the subscales.The total score that can be obtained from each subscale varies between 0 and 100, and an increase in the score indicates an increase in the quality of life. In the study conducted by Kocyigit et al. (1996), it was found that Cronbach Alpha values ​​for each subscale were between 0.73 and 0.76 [ 23 Data collection During the data collection, a suitable physical environment was provided in the outpatient clinic where the study was conducted to have a comfortable and effective interview. During the implementation of the surveys, the information in the “Voluntary Consent Form” was read to the women who agreed to participate in the study, and their verbal and written consents were obtained. The interviews were conducted face-to-face, respecting the privacy of the participants. Each interview lasted an average of 15–20 min. Data analysis The data obtained as a result of the study were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) for Windows 22.0 package program. Descriptive data in the study were expressed as a number, percentage, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum value. Chi-square analysis was performed to compare categorical data. Kurtosis and Skewness values ​​were examined to determine whether the data obtained from the research showed a normal distribution. Since the data showed a normal distribution, independent groups t-test, One-way Anova analysis of variance, post-hoc: Tukey, and Least Significant Difference (LSD) analysis were used in the analysis. In the study, the degree of statistical significance was accepted as p Results In this study, it was found that the mean age of women with gynecological cancer (with cancer of the endometrium, ovary, cervix, vulva and vagina) was 50.76 ± 8.75 years, the duration of marriage was 30.48 ± 10.48 years, and the mean duration of education was 8.99 ± 4.24 years. It was found that the rate of working women without gynecological cancer was significantly higher than those with cancer ( p p p p When the distribution of gynecological cancers according to stage was examined, it was found that the highest rate in stages I and II was in endometrial cancer, while the most common gynecological cancer types in stage III were cervical and ovarian cancer. In stage IV, the highest rates were found in cervical, endometrial, and ovarian cancer, respectively. The duration of gynecological cancer diagnosis was determined to be 27.60 ± 33.31 months.

On the other hand, women who reported receiving social support during and after treatment were found to have significantly lower scores on the pain subscale of the SF-36 Quality of Life Scale. Discussion In this comparative-descriptive and cross-sectional study, when women with and without gynecologic cancer were evaluated according to their sociodemographic characteristics, it was found that the proportion of working women, those without social security and those living in the district were significantly higher in women without gynecologic cancer compared to those with cancer. When these data are analyzed specifically, employment status is one of the most important determinants of socioeconomic status and is a factor that plays a role in ensuring and maintaining the well-being of individuals in all areas of their lives. Socioeconomic level, which is related to employment status, is a situation that prevents individuals from accessing health services as well as maintaining their level of health [ 24 25 26 27 9 28 Cancer is a difficult life experience that tends to progress and spread, whose treatment can be performed in specialized health centers, and whose treatment and care practices are costly [ 29 9 30 As a result of the study, it was observed that marital satisfaction and spousal support decreased in women with gynecologic cancer and their quality of life was negatively affected. There are many factors that predict married couples’ marital life and the conflicts and problems they experience in marriage. Some of these factors are employment status, income level and socioeconomic level, which are determinants of these factors. It is argued that low socioeconomic level has negative effects on women’s healthy lifestyle behaviors, and that the increasing economic pressure caused by low income level leads to increased stress levels and depression in women and negatively affects their mental health. All these effects also affect women’s marital satisfaction. Jackson et al. (2016) reported that low socioeconomic level is a serious obstacle to meeting the basic needs of couples, causing conflicts between spouses, decreasing emotional intimacy and satisfaction, and thus negatively affecting marital satisfaction [ 31 32 33 34 35 Gynecological cancer diagnosis and treatment, particularly involving the loss of female reproductive organs such as the uterus, can adversely affect women’s physical, psychological, and sexual health. These impacts may in turn disrupt familial roles and diminish marital satisfaction [ 4 6 8 36 37 In the study, women’s sexual function was not directly assessed using a measurement tool (e.g., FSFI) but was considered as a dimension affecting satisfaction in communication between spouses. It was found that the total scores on the marital satisfaction scale were lower in women with gynecological cancer than in women without gynecological cancer. In the study of Membrilla-Beltran et al. (2023), it was found that women with gynecological cancer experienced more sexual dysfunction [ 38 39 40 8 32 41 42 Spousal support, which positively affects marital satisfaction, defines the social support that the couple provides to each other in the marital relationship. It has been reported that women with gynecological cancer need support from individuals in their social circle in the management of symptoms resulting from treatment and in the adaptation to the post-treatment period [ 10 43 44 12 45 46 46 The treatment method administered according to the type of gynecological cancer is an important factor in shaping the adaptation process during or after treatment and is a variable related to social support. In the study, no difference was found in marital adjustment and spousal support levels among women with gynecological cancer who received surgery alone, surgery + chemotherapy, surgery + chemotherapy + radiotherapy, or chemotherapy + radiotherapy. When the level of spousal support was evaluated in women without gynecologic cancer, spousal support scale scores were found to be high in the studies of Dincer (2022) and Yuksekal and Yurdakul (2021) [ 11 47 46 A meta-analysis conducted on women with gynecological cancers such as breast, endometrial, cervical, and ovarian cancers shows that the relationship between marital status and social support has significant effects on diagnosis and survival rates [ 14 48 49 All physical, psychological, and social changes experienced throughout the process negatively affect women’s quality of life. In our study, it was concluded that the quality of life of women in the early stages of cancer was higher than that of women with advanced cancer; there was no significant difference in quality of life scores according to surgical and chemotherapy status, but women who underwent radiotherapy had lower general health perception scores. Studies by Huang et al. (2017), Pasek et al. (2021), Karatasli et al. (2021), and Araya et al. (2020) concluded that women with gynecological cancer have a low quality of life [ 19 35 50 51 46 52 9 53 27 54 9 In addition to cancer-related characteristics, social support from family is important for women to cope with the devastating effects of cancer during diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation. In this study, it was observed that women who reported receiving social support had lower scores on the physical pain subscale. Studies conducted by Cakir and Nazik (2022) and Caliskan et al. (2015) indicate a direct and positive relationship between social support and quality of life [ 9 55 The findings of the study revealed that women diagnosed with gynecologic cancer experienced a decrease in marital satisfaction and spousal support during diagnosis, treatment and post-treatment processes, and accordingly, their quality of life was negatively affected. This situation shows that women’s need for care and support provided by health professionals increases during these processes. In this context, the importance of the responsibilities of nurses, who provide the closest care service to individuals and are one of the main members of the primary health care team, increases. It is of great importance that health professionals and care providers involved in the diagnosis, treatment, care and rehabilitation processes of women diagnosed with gynecologic cancer have knowledge about individual and disease-specific factors affecting women’s quality of life and sexual health. In addition, the level of knowledge and awareness of these professionals in providing counseling on sexuality and sexual life for women and their partners should be increased. Considering the negative effects of gynecologic cancer on marital satisfaction and spouse/social support levels, raising awareness of women, their spouses and caregivers about sexual life and social support should be considered as an important part of holistic care. In conclusion, effective care and biopsychosocial support provided by health professionals can reduce the traumatic effects of gynecologic cancer on women. Limitations There are several limitations to this study. One of the limitations of this study is that the study could not be conducted in a multicenter. Another limitation is that the accuracy of the data is proportional to the statements of the participants and the cause and effect relationship could not be clearly demonstrated due to the cross-sectional, comparative and descriptive nature of the study. Lastly, the generalizability of the findings is limited to women with gynecological cancer who sought care at the hospital where the study was conducted. Therefore, future research employing a multicenter, longitudinal design with larger and more heterogeneous populations is recommended to strengthen the generalizability and external validity of the results. Conclusions As a result of this study, it was observed that there was a decrease in the quality of life and spousal support of women with gynaecological cancer, but no significant change in their overall marital satisfaction levels. In light of these findings, couples therapy and family counselling services should be provided to patients diagnosed with gynaecological cancer and their spouses to help them cope with the problems they experience in their relationships. These programmes should aim to strengthen communication between spouses and increase mutual understanding and empathy.
