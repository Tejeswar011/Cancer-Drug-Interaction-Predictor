This study used multi-omics data from public databases to assess PTGDS’s expression, mutation, and modification in multiple cancers, integrated single-cell and spatial transcriptomic data to explore its relationship with immune cells, and conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments in breast cancer (BRCA). Results showed that PTGDS is significantly dysregulated in most cancers, with its expression associated with different outcomes depending on cancer type. It correlates with epigenetic and biological functions, and low expression in BRCA indicates poor prognosis. Overexpression of PTGDS can inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion, increase CD8+ T - cell activity, and enhance anti-tumor immunity. Combining it with anti-PD-L1 improves BRCA treatment. PTGDS is a potential prognostic biomarker and a novel immunotherapy target for BRCA.

We also performed a multi-omics pan-cancer analysis to clarify the associations between this gene, clinical characteristics, and the variability observed across different omics layers. Moreover, we explored the potential roles of PTGDS and its influence on immune cell infiltration in various cancers. By analyzing survival data from TCGA and GEO databases, we assessed the prognostic significance of PTGDS concerning tumor prognosis and the response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Our analysis focused on DNA repair, DNA damage response, and the induction of cancer-related immune responses, confirming PTGDS as a biomarker for dendritic cell infiltration via the CIBERSORT algorithm. We conducted in vitro experiments to ascertain the effect of PTGDS on cell proliferation in BRCA cell lines. Our thorough analysis suggests that PTGDS could be a promising predictive biomarker for prognosis and response to tumor immunotherapy. We further investigated the role of PTGDS in BRCA progression. We found that PTGDS inhibited the tumor proliferation capacity of breast cancer cells by activating CD8+ T cell activity. PD-L1 blocking combined with PTGDS analogs is highly effective in treating BRCA. Therefore, this is a promising new BRCA combination treatment strategy. Results Expression patterns and prognostic analysis of PTGDS in human cancers This study first systematically explored the correlation between PTGDS and various diseases, revealing that PTGDS is closely related to the occurrence and development of tumors, mainly showing a significant association with breast cancer (Fig. 1a 1b 1c 1d 1e 1f Fig. 1 Differential expression of PTGDS and prediction of cancer survival. a b c d e f p p p p Copy number variation and single nucleotide variation analysis of PTGDS in pan-cancer CNV (Copy Number Variation) and SNV (Single Nucleotide Variation) are two common types of genomic variations that hold significant importance in genetic and medical research. To investigate whether the PTGDS gene undergoes alterations at the genomic level, we systematically analyzed the CNV and SNV characteristics of PTGDS in pan-cancer. The results showed that PTGDS has a high mutation frequency in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), OV, endometrial cancer, renal cancer, and cutaneous melanoma (Fig. 2a 2c 2d 2e 2f Fig. 2 PTGDS is associated with genomic instability in cancer. a b c d e f DNA damage repair, cell stemness, and methylation analysis of PTGDS in pan-cancer The stability of the cancer genome relies on various DNA repair mechanisms, including DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and homologous recombination repair (HRR). These repair mechanisms are crucial in maintaining cancer cells’ stemness and genomic integrity. To comprehensively understand the function of PTGDS in cancer, we systematically analyzed the correlation between PTGDS and key functions such as DNA damage repair, cell stemness, and methylation in 12 human cancers. Comprehensive analysis showed that PTGDS expression was significantly negatively correlated with the primary functional states in 12 cancers, with only LUAD showing a positive correlation with various functions (Fig. 3a 3b 1a 3c 3d 3e 3f Fig. 3 PTGDS is involved in cancer DNA repair, stemness, and epigenetic regulation. a b c d e f p p p p Functional mechanisms of PTGDS in cancer and interaction analysis of co-expressed genes We conducted a series of functional enrichment analyses to deeply explore the specific mechanisms by which PTGDS functions in cancer and its interactions with co-expressed genes. First, using the String web tool, we identified the top 10 proteins interacting with PTGDS (Fig. 4a 4c 4b 4d 4e Fig. 4 PTGDS is involved in cancer immune-related pathways. a b c d e Predictive potential of PTGDS in cancer immunotherapy response Stromal Score, Immune Score, and ESTIMATE Score are calculation methods based on gene expression data used to quantify the proportion of stromal cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. These scoring systems are critical in tumor research and clinical applications, especially in assessing the tumor microenvironment, predicting prognosis, and guiding immunotherapy. To explore the immunological role of PTGDS in the tumor microenvironment, we evaluated the ESTIMATE scores of PTGDS in different cancer types. The results showed that in most cancers, PTGDS was significantly positively correlated with ESTIMATE Score and Immune Score, including lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), BLCA, TGCT, UVM, colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), BRCA, and neuroblastoma (NB) (Fig. 5a 5b 5c 5d 5e 5f Fig. 5 PTGDS is negatively correlated with immune infiltration and cytokine interactions. a b c d e f p p p p Correlation analysis of PTGDS with immune cell infiltration and spatial expression patterns To deeply explore the role of PTGDS in tumor immunity, we systematically analyzed its correlation with immune cell infiltration. Using the CIBERSORT algorithm, we identified the correlation between 22 types of immune cells and PTGDS. The results showed that in most cancers, PTGDS was significantly positively correlated with B cells and CD8+ T cells, while it was negatively correlated with dendritic cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils (Fig. 6a 6b 6c 6d 6e Fig. 6 PTGDS is a biomarker for dendritic cell infiltration in pan-cancer. a b c d e p p p p Correlation analysis of PTGDS with T cells in pan-cancer To further explore the regulatory role of PTGDS in tumor immunity, we analyzed its relationship with dendritic cells. We systematically studied its correlation with NK cells, regulatory T cells (Treg cells), and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) infiltration. The results showed that in breast cancer, PTGDS was significantly positively correlated with T cells and CAFs, a phenomenon also observed in other tumors (Fig. 7a 7b 7c 7d Fig. 7 PTGDS is associated with NK cells, Treg, CAF infiltration, and CD8+ T cell activation. a b c d PTGDS as a predictive biomarker for cancer treatment response and screening of potential targeted drugs To explore whether PTGDS can predict cancer treatment responses, we used the ROCplotter database to analyze the relationship between PTGDS expression and treatment outcomes in three cancers: BRCA, OV, and COAD. The results showed that in OV and COAD, PTGDS expression levels were relatively higher in non-responders to Docetaxel, Avastin, or Fluoropyrimidines monotherapy. In BRCA, PTGDS expression was significantly higher in responders to Tamoxifen treatment. It showed an upward trend in responders to Anthracycline and Lxabepilone treatment, with pathological complete response (pCR) AUC values of 0.7, 0.605, and 0.706, respectively (Fig. 8a 8b 8c 8d Fig. 8 PTGDS predicts treatment response and docking with PTGDS-targeted drugs. a b c d PTGDS overexpression inhibits cell viability in BRCA cells To further validate the effect of PTGDS on the proliferation capacity of tumor cells, we also performed colony formation assays (Fig. 9a 9b 9c 9d 9e 9f 1b 9g Fig. 9 Experiments in breast cancer cell lines after PTGDS overexpression. a b c d e f g h p p p p PTGDS overexpression enhances CD8+ T cell infiltration and improves the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 antibody (αPD-L1 Ab) treatment To examine the tumor suppressive effect of PTGDS in vivo, we established a stable PTGDS-overexpressing murine breast cancer cell line, 4T1. We inoculated the stable cell line into immunocompetent BALB/c mice to generate subcutaneous xenografts and treated them with either αPD-L1 Ab or IgG isotype control (Fig. 10a 10b–d 10e–g Fig. 10 PTGDS overexpression enhances the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 treatment in vivo in BC. a b c d e g p p p p Discussion Aberrantly expressed products can develop sequentially into cancer, with these oncogenic products arising from genomic alterations, transcriptional abnormalities, post-translational modifications, or epigenetic regulation of specific genes. These changes can influence patient prognosis through various mechanisms 15 18 5 7 19 Previous studies have less frequently revealed the role of PTGDS in cancer immunity. Intriguingly, we found that PTGDS exhibits both pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic roles, and this functional duality may arise from its spatiotemporal-specific responses to the tumor microenvironment and cell types. In pro-cancer mechanisms, PTGDS drives cell proliferation and induces chemotherapy resistance (such as enhancing doxorubicin resistance) via the MYH9-mediated Wnt-β-catenin-STAT3 signaling axis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) 20 21 22 We discovered a surprisingly strong correlation between IL4, a Th2 cytokine, and PTGDS across 40 types of cancer. Research indicates that dendritic cells boost tumor antigen uptake by producing IL12, while IL4 suppresses IL12 upregulation, impacting DCs’ ability to bind antigens 23 25 Our research has deepened the understanding of PTGDS, not only revealing its pivotal role in maintaining genetic stability but also uncovering its potential in predicting the prognosis of various cancers and their response to immunotherapy. Through functional experiments in BRCA, we have confirmed the significant role of PTGDS, which may provide a direction for the development of new oncological treatment strategies. Nevertheless, our research has certain limitations and requires further exploration and validation through additional mechanism experiments and clinical trials to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms of PTGDS mediated tumorigenesis and immune therapy functions through different DC subtypes. Although PTGDS holds potential as both a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in cancer, its clinical translation faces three major challenges: (1) Spatiotemporal heterogeneity of PTGDS expression requires systematic resolution through spatial transcriptomics to delineate tissue-specific regulatory networks, alongside the establishment of cross-cancer expression atlases; (2) Insufficient cancer adaptation of targeted delivery systems: Due to the poor barrier penetration ability of inhibitors such as AT56 in solid tumors (such as glioma and renal cancer), their efficacy is limited, and they face issues of protease degradation and rapid clearance in hematological tumors. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop nanocarriers to achieve transmembrane delivery and tumor microenvironment specific release; (3) Lack of dynamic monitoring standards based on PTGDS: for example, lymphoma requires monitoring of PTGDS mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the peripheral blood, while solid tumors require assessment of PTGDS expression heterogeneity within the tumor in conjunction with radiomics. But we believe that the future endeavors will enhance our comprehension of the role of PTGDS and its potential as a target for cancer therapy. In conclusion, we conducted a multi-omics analysis of PTGDS across various cancers and recognized it as a potential prognostic biomarker. High expression of PTGDS is associated with activation of immune cells, especially CD8+ T cells. Overexpression of PTGDS can enhance the infiltration of CD8+ T cells and improve the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target. Methods Data access and procession The UCSC Xena platform was utilized to access databases from TCGA (which includes 33 types of cancer) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, comprising 54 standard tissue samples. Any cancer type that had fewer than three samples was excluded from the analysis. A log2 transformation of (transcripts per million (TPM) + 1) was applied to normalize the transcriptional data. PTGDS protein sequences in FASTA format were sourced from the NCBI protein database. The single-cell sequencing datasets of BRCA ( GSE114725 GSE114724 GSE97168 GSE131907 GSE146771 GSE139555 GSE144735 GSE132465 GSE111014 GSE112271 GSE98638 GSE140228 GSE141946 Analyses of PTGDS concerning cancer-associated genomic alterations and antigen correlations The Cancer Types Summary module on cBioPortal was used to evaluate the frequencies of three types of genomic alterations—mutations, amplifications, and deep deletions—across different cancers 26 The examination of PTGDS’s relationship with DNA mismatch repair, cancer stemness, and epigenetic modifications The correlation between PTGDS expression in different cancers and the functional status of 12 cancers was visualized. To further show the correlation between DNA repair and PTGDS expression in cancer, we selected four cancer types to be visualized by scatter plots. Use of Sangerbox to express the correlation between cancer stem cells and PTGDS expression. The connection between PTGDS promoter methylation and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL), as well as patient survival, is outlined in the TIDE methylation module. Additionally, heat maps were created to illustrate the relationship between PTGDS and 44 modifier genes, including N1-methyladenosine (m1A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) 27 29 The PTGDS interaction network and functional enrichment analyses The current protein-protein interaction networks for PTGDS that have been experimentally validated were explored using the online tool String 30 31 32 p 33 Microenvironment analysis of PTGDS in pan-cancer This analysis was accomplished using Expression Data (ESTIMATE) to calculate stromal and immune scores, utilizing the R package “ESTIMATE” (version 1.0.13). We obtained immune checkpoint markers from previous studies, analyzed their correlation with PTGDS, analyzed the expression correlation of PTGDS with immune isoforms, and compared the expression levels of these isoforms in pan-cancers in the isoforms module of the tumor-immune system interaction portal TISDB 34 35 36 The CIBERSORT algorithm calculated the immune cell infiltration correlation of PTGDS. Ten different algorithms were used to correlate dendritic cells with PTGDS using TIMER 2.0. In addition, spatial expression levels and overlap of PTGDS and dendritic cell markers CD86 and CD40 in colorectal and prostate cancers were analyzed using the SpatialDB online tool, a spatially disaggregated transcriptome database. To achieve single-cell resolution, we analyzed PTGDS expression across different cell subtypes in pan-cancer using single-cell datasets sourced from GEO and the Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub (TISCH) 37 Immune infiltration analysis of PTGDS in pan-cancer environment TIMER2.0 effectively showcased the interrelationships between PTGDS expression and various immune cell types, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), NK cells, and CD8+ T cells, utilizing diverse immunological algorithms 38 Single-cell transcriptome analysis The computational pipeline was implemented in the R statistical environment (v4.1.1). Single-cell transcriptomic profiles were processed through the Seurat analytical framework (v4.2) with the following optimizations: Cellular entries exhibiting either insufficient gene representation (<300 detected genes) or excessive transcriptional activity (>7500 genes) were excluded, along with cells displaying mitochondrial gene contribution exceeding 25% of total UMIs. Prior to dimensional reduction, we systematically filtered mitochondrial-encoded genes, ribosomal protein transcripts, and hemoglobin subunits from the expression matrix 39 We used canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to correct for batch effects across datasets 40 41 43 Spatial transcriptome analysis ST data were analyzed with Seurat package (version 4.2) using similar method as scRNA-seq 39 Assessment of therapeutic responses targeting PTGDS, along with compounds and molecular docking studies This online tool (ROC Plotter) analyses transcriptome data from four cancer types to relate gene expression to treatment response. The “Query” tool from cMAP was utilized to identify compounds that target PTGDS, resulting in a heatmap showcasing the top 30 compounds linked to differentially expressed gene markers associated with anti-PTGDS activity. Furthermore, the relationship between PTGDS and drug sensitivity was confirmed using RNAactDrug, which serves as a comprehensive resource for drug sensitivity and RNA molecular correlations, selecting drugs with an FDR < 0.05 44 Cell transfection and RT-PCR The breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, HCC1806, JIMT-1, SK-BR-3, and 4T1 were acquired from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai, China. These cells were grown in a DMEM medium with the addition of 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were seeded at a density of 50% in 6-well plates and transfected with negative control (Vector) and overexpression plasmids. Lipofectamine 3000 was used for all transfections. RT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green Master Mix (Q111-02, Vazyme), with mRNA expression levels normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels. The 2 −ΔΔCT 1 . Multiplex immunohistochemical (mIHC) and Western blot (WB) analysis In this study, mIHC was performed using a multiple immunofluorescence kit (Aifang, Hunan, China), following the manufacturer’s guidelines. Total proteins were isolated using RIPA buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes. After blocking with 5% milk, the membranes were incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4 °C, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Details about the antibodies used can be found in Supplementary Table 2 2 . Animal model In the xenograft model, we used 4-week-old female BALB/c mice, which were divided into four groups. A total of 2 × 10 6 P99145 Flow cytometry analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in BALB/c mice Post-treatment, tumors were harvested from the mice in each treatment group. The tissues were mechanically dissociated into single-cell suspensions using PBS, followed by enzymatic digestion with 5 mg ml –1 3 . Statistical analysis All data processing, statistical evaluations, and graphical representations were conducted using R software (version 4.2.0). To assess and compare overall survival (OS) across different subtypes, Kaplan–Meier survival analysis combined with log-rank tests was utilized. For continuous variables, differences between two groups were analyzed using either the Wilcoxon rank-sum test or Student’s t p p Supplementary information  Supplementary Information Publisher’s note These authors contributed equally: Jiajin Li, Zheng Qu, Dacheng Zhu, Ye Lu These authors jointly supervised this work: Pengpeng Zhang, Yiqin Xia, Shengbin Pei.
