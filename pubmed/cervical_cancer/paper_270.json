Highlights • Glioblastoma (GBM) brain tumor initiating cells (BTIC) were tested for FLASH-RT effect in patient-derived xenograft (PDX). • Identification of equipotency of FLASH-RT and CONV-RT protons in BTIC-compliant orthotopic GBM PDX model. • Identification of normal brain tissue sparing using FLASH-RT compared to CONV-RT. Ultra-high dose rate (FLASH-RT) and conventional proton beam radiotherapy to intracranial glioblastoma PDX were compared for tumor control and normal tissue toxicity via DNA and RNA damage response markers. Both conventional and FLASH radiotherapy yielded similar survival benefits; however, conventional radiotherapy resulted in greater normal tissue DNA and RNA damage.

XD456 cells were infected with serum-free luciferase lentivirus vector pGreenFire1-CMV (System Biosciences, Catalog #TR011PA-1) prepared using CSC293T cells as previously described [ [18] [19] [20] + 21 Animal experiments Twenty-eight four-week-old female athymic nude mice (nu/nu) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Procedures were performed under IACUC-21935 approval. Orthotopic injections were performed as before [ 22 23 + 4 Irradiation device and treatment administration To address limitations of the Varian ProBeam’s research transmission chamber in accurately assigning clinically calibrated monitor units (MUs) at FLASH dose rates, a calibration procedure was performed before each irradiation session. A relationship between the transmission ion chamber response and the physical dose output was established for a range of output currents (10nA to 90nA). This was achieved by positioning a PPC05 parallel-plate ionization chamber (IBA, Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium) at isocenter under standard clinical calibration conditions. A FLASH scaling factor was then determined by delivering a 10 cm x 10 cm uniform spot field at both clinical and FLASH dose rates. This factor allowed us to correlate requested MUs with delivered MUs for the rates used throughout the experiment. Following calibration, irradiation plans were generated and uploaded to the Varian Racehorse software, a treatment planning and delivery system, in the form of ASCII files. Prior to delivery for each mouse plan, a single spot at clinical dose rates was delivered, followed by a single spot delivered at FLASH dose rates using the equivalent MU from the prior established relationship to verify equivalent dose to the ion chamber. Since the dose varies greatly across the spot profile, the central axis (peak) dose was chosen as the point to map dose to MU. All reported doses therefore are at the center of the spot and falloff on a semi-Guassian with a FWHM of 7 mm. During delivery, the ion chamber was placed behind the mouse on the central axis and dose was recorded for delivery. The time of delivery for each spot was provided by Varian internal log file analysis software. Animals were separated into two cohorts (cohort 1, n = 15 and cohort 2, n = 13) based on tumor volume from BLI and were anesthetized with 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine. Animals were then either administered CONV-RT dose rate or FLASH-RT dose rate for a single total dose administration of 10 Gy. Animals were monitored for 30 min post-injection. Cohort 2 was treated one week after cohort 1. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) Tumor burden was monitored by BLI 10 days post orthotopic injection, and every three days post-treatment for day 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 21, 24, and 27. Mice were imaged using IVIS Lumina III in UAB Small Animal Imaging Facility. Immunocytochemistry Primary antibodies γH2AX (Abcam, Catalog #ab11174) concentration of 1:500 and DNA/RNA Damage (Abcam, Catalog #ab62623) concentration 1:500 was incubated overnight 4 °C. Secondary antibodies Donkey Anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (Abcam, Catalog #ab150076) concentration 1:1000 and Donkey Anti-Mouse 568 (Invitrogen, Catalog #A10037) concentration 1:1000 were incubated for 30 min at room temperate. HOECHST was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with a concentration of 10 mg/mL dilution 1:1000 (ThermoFisher, Catalog #33258). Slides were mounted with Immu-Mount (Epredia, Catalog #9990402). Statistical analysis Animal experiments were conducted in two cohorts (n = 15 and n = 13). Data analysis was performed using Prism 10.4.1 (GraphPad) and the relevant statistical tests are indicated in the respective figure legends. For Kaplan-Meier survival curves, a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) was performed with reported p values. Results FLASH-RT is isoeffective to CONV-RT in GBM PDX Model To assess the difference between CONV and FLASH dose rate effects with proton beams, tumor-bearing mice were irradiated with either pulsed delivery over 5 min (CONV-RT) or FLASH-RT for a single administration of 10 Gy. Both CONV and FLASH groups received a single treatment session utilizing a pre-designed beam trajectory to ensure consistent RT delivery across conditions ( Fig. 1A + Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Supplemental Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 CONV and FLASH RT increases survival and decreases tumor burden compared to no treatment with no significant difference in survival between CONV and FLASH RT. Overall survival was assessed in two independent cohorts following untreated, CONV-RT, or FLASH-RT treated animals ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Decreased Normal Tissue DNA Damage with FLASH-RT Tumor-bearing mice were treated with single 10 Gy dose at either CONV-RT or FLASH-RT dose rate. Tumor burden was measured twenty-four hours prior to treatment ( Fig. 2A Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Supplemental Fig. 2 24 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Supplemental Fig. 3 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 FLASH RT demonstrates decreased cellular damage markers compared to CONV RT. γ γ Discussion Despite promising preclinical and veterinary studies suggesting FLASH-RT could be a potential strategy for treating a variety of tumors including GBM, fundamental questions remain unanswered which may hinder the development and utilization of FLASH-RT. A problem of high importance is the considerable lack of preclinical studies using advanced patient-derived models of cancer. Indeed, there is a concern in the field that if FLASH preferentially protects normal tissue stem cells, then cancer stem cells, which are poorly represented in traditional immortalized cell lines, would be protected as well. Our study represents one of the few investigations to utilize PDX rather than immortalized cell lines to evaluate the FLASH effect [ 25 Limitations of our approach include using the transmission portion of the proton beam rather than the Bragg peak and the use of pulsed-dose proton therapy to achieve “conventional” dose rate. The physical advantage of proton radiation relies on the spread-out Bragg peak used in clinical scenarios though achieving this for FLASH-RT is only beginning to emerge [ [26] [27] [28] [29] Our findings align with those of Montay-Gruell et al. [ 17 In summary, our data support the dual benefit of FLASH-RT in both reducing tumor burden and minimizing normal tissue toxicity. The observed reduction in double-strand break markers in FLASH-RT treated animals provides mechanistic insight into the protective effects on healthy brain tissue.
