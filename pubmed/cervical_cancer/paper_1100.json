We conducted a systematic review to summarize the diagnostic performance achieved by AI‑based colposcopic systems. Methods: Following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, the PubMed database was searched using the search terms ‘artificial intelligence’ and ‘colposcop*’ for articles published between 2019 and 2024. From the initial 43 articles retrieved, 19 studies were selected based on specific inclusion criteria: original research articles, written in the English language, and relevant to CIN or cervical cancer diagnosis. For each, we extracted the sample size, AI architecture (e.g., convolutional neural networks, U-Net/DeepLab V3 + segmentation models, multimodal fusion networks), reference standard, and reported metrics (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve). Results: Across multiple studies, AI systems demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, particularly for early detection of high-risk lesions and classification of cervical abnormalities. Deep-learning models, such as convolutional neural networks, consistently outperformed conventional methods by reducing diagnostic variability and offering robust performance even in low-resource settings. The review also highlights the potential of AI for real-time diagnostics and its capacity to support clinical decision-making via automated systems. Conclusion: AI has the potential to revolutionize cervical cancer diagnosis and management by enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of colposcopic evaluations. However, challenges remain, including the development of standardized datasets, validation in diverse populations, and ethical considerations surrounding data privacy and access to technology. Continued research and development are crucial to harness AI’s global potential to improve patient outcomes.

The World Health Organization recommends regular screening using Papanicolaou (PAP) smear, liquid-based cytology, and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) to detect CIN and early-stage cervical cancer.  5  6  7  8 Colposcopy is a vital diagnostic tool for detecting cervical cancer and has been widely used for detailed visual examination of the cervix and guiding biopsies. It remains the gold standard for identifying high-grade lesions, such as CIN2 and CIN3.  9  10 11 12  13 In recent years, AI and deep-learning (DL) algorithms have demonstrated substantial potential to improve diagnostic accuracy in a variety of medical fields, including cervical cancer detection. By automating image analysis, AI can minimize human error and increase diagnostic consistency. 14 15  16 15 17 The capability of AI to provide real-time analysis of colposcopic images may significantly bolster diagnostic reliability, especially in regions lacking a sufficient number of expert colposcopists.  18 19 20 AI has already seen broad adoption in cervical cancer diagnostics, encompassing area like PAP smear image analysis, 21 22 23 24  25 26 27 Methods Reporting guidelines and protocol This systematic review was conducted and reported following the PRISMA 2020 Statement (see Supplementary File 1 Search strategy A comprehensive literature search was performed using the PubMed database to assess the utility of AI in the systematic diagnosis of cervical diseases. The search combined the MeSH term ‘artificial intelligence’ and the keyword ‘colposcop*’ in all fields, with the publication date limited to articles from 2019 to 2024. This initial query produced 48 articles. Study selection Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were then applied. Articles focusing on diseases outside the cervix or on diagnostic modalities unrelated to colposcopy were removed. Nonoriginal research – such as review articles, commentaries, and editorials – was also excluded. Only studies published in English and original research on AI-driven colposcopy for cervical disease diagnosis were included, resulting in a shortlist of 27 articles. Subsequently, an additional screening eliminated nine studies whose primary investigations centred on other methods (e.g., Pap smear analysis, HPV genotyping) without substantial colposcopy usage, yielding 18 qualifying articles. A supplementary manual search was conducted via Google Scholar to ensure completeness, uncovering one more study that met all inclusion criteria. As a result, the final dataset consisted of 19 articles ( Figure 1 Figure 1. PRISMA flow chart for study selection. This diagram showcases a PRISMA flow chart, detailing the study selection process. Initially, 48 records were identified from PubMed. Following a title and abstract screening, 11 records were excluded, narrowing the pool to 27 full-text articles assessed for eligibility. Nine articles were further excluded for focusing on diagnostic methods unrelated to colposcopy images. Additionally, 1 record was identified through handsearching on Google Scholar. The final count of studies included in the review from databases was 19. Eligible study designs We accepted any primary, human‑subject investigation that reported diagnostic performance for an AI‑based colposcopic system, irrespective of observational design (retrospective cohort, prospective diagnostic‑accuracy study, or case‑control). Randomized trials and purely technical reports lacking a clinical reference standard were excluded. Data extraction For each eligible study, pertinent details were carefully extracted. These details included the author(s) and year of publication, specific evaluation metrics (such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve [AUC]), sample size, population or comparison groups (e.g., control subjects and baseline modalities), and the specific AI models employed (e.g., convolutional neural networks, segmentation networks, or multimodal fusion approaches). This systematic approach facilitated a robust comparison of AI-based diagnostic methods against conventional strategies. Two independent reviewers screened all titles and abstracts and subsequently assessed the full texts. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. The same two reviewers independently extracted study data using a piloted form. Data synthesis and analysis Following data extraction, the studies were thematically categorized in alignment with the review’s focus areas. Those investigating AI applications for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were organized according to their emphasis on early lesion detection, segmentation and biopsy guidance, or prognosis and lesion severity prediction. Studies on cervical cancer were grouped by advanced lesion detection, real-time decision support, multimodal data integration, and implementations suitable for resource-limited settings. Each thematic group compared reported performance metrics (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, AUC) and methodological approaches (e.g., CNN-based architectures, segmentation algorithms, and cross-modal integrations) to ascertain clinical efficacy and scalability. Observations regarding dataset diversity, external validation requirements, and practical implementation considerations were then synthesized to inform the overarching discussion on how AI can improve colposcopic diagnostics for both CIN and invasive cervical cancer. Because clinical tasks, outcome definitions, and reporting formats were highly heterogeneous, quantitative pooling (meta‑analysis) was not attempted. Instead, results were synthesized narratively and tabulated: Table 1 Supplemental Table 1 Supplemental Table 2 Table 1.

Quality assessment Risk of bias and applicability were appraised with QUADAS‑2. Each domain was rated low, high, or unclear by both reviewers; discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Domain‑level judgements appear in Supplemental Table 2 Results We ultimately included 19 primary studies that evaluated AI-based colposcopic systems ( Table 1 Across all studies, reported sensitivity ranged from 62.1% to 99.7% and specificity from 56.6% to 98.6%, underscoring substantial between‑study heterogeneity. QUADAS‑2 appraisal ( Supplemental Table 2 Supplemental Table1 AI-based diagnostic applications for CIN Because CIN represents a precursor to invasive cervical cancer, timely and accurate diagnosis is paramount. Multiple studies demonstrated that in intense learning models, AI consistently outperforms traditional colposcopic evaluations in detecting and classifying CIN2 + lesions. CerviCARE AI and the CMF-CNN model achieved high sensitivity and specificity, thus reducing false negatives and strengthening overall screening reliability. 35 31  34  35  34 AI-based classification for early lesion detection Despite encouraging results, not all studies achieved uniformly high accuracy, suggesting variability among models and datasets. For instance, Cho et al  33  31 AI-based segmentation and biopsy guidance Beyond classification, segmentation has proven crucial for accurate lesion delineation and guiding biopsies. Several researchers adopted approaches such as GRF-Net  28  32 29 30  36  29 AI-based prognosis and lesion severity prediction Specific investigations focused on predicting lesion severity to facilitate early clinical decision-making. For instance, Chen et al  37  38  39 AI-based diagnostic applications for cervical cancer AI’s transformative impact extends equally to diagnosing and managing invasive cervical cancer. Several studies emphasized advanced lesion detection and real-time therapeutic decision support. Chandran et al  46  42 AI-based advanced lesion detection and real-time decision support Recurrent convolutional neural networks (C-RCNN) have leveraged sequential colposcopic images to enhance diagnostic precision, as illustrated by Yue et al,  45 AI-based multimodal data integration Another subset of research merged different diagnostic inputs (HPV status, cytology, or molecular markers) to enhance overall model performance. Fu et al  43  40 AI-based resource-limited settings and cost-effective solutions Specific AI systems specifically target resource-limited environments, improving accessibility and cost-effectiveness. Asiedu et al  44  41 AI-based comparison between CIN and cervical cancer diagnostics While AI-based approaches for both CIN and cervical cancer share the advantages of improving diagnostic accuracy and minimizing interobserver variability, their clinical aims differ. In CIN-focused studies, classification and segmentation are emphasized to aid early lesion detection and guide biopsies. 29 35 43 46 40 43 Discussion AI and DL techniques are reshaping colposcopic practice by automating image interpretation, reducing inter‑observer variability and – when properly validated – improving diagnostic performance for both premalignant and malignant cervical disease. In this systematic review of 19 studies, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieved median sensitivities and specificities in the low‑to‑mid 90 % range, and several models (e.g. CerviCARE‑AI, CMF‑CNN, Mascarenhas‑CNN) reported sensitivities >98 % for CIN 2 + detection. These figures are encouraging when compared with historical single-expert colposcopic accuracy; however, heterogeneity in study design and outcome definitions precluded a formal meta-analysis comparing AI versus human performance. A key advantage of AI lies in its ability to effectively classify high-grade CIN (CIN2 and CIN3)—lesions known to be precursors to invasive cancer. Tools such as CerviCARE AI and the CMF-CNN showed high sensitivity and specificity for CIN2 + lesions, outperforming conventional colposcopy and cytology-based approaches. This level of precision is vital for the timely recognition of high-risk lesions and subsequent early intervention, which can curtail the incidence of invasive disease. Notably, AI systems’ robust classification of CIN holds substantial promise for detecting precancerous lesions more accurately and improving patient management among those at increased risk.  47 Beyond CIN detection, recent AI-driven methods have shown strong capabilities in identifying invasive cervical cancers. Integrating AI algorithms with colposcopic imaging facilitates early detection of invasive diseases, a critical factor in optimizing patient outcomes through timely treatment.  11 48 50 The importance of combining AI with multimodal data – such as HPV testing and cytology – is also becoming more evident in cervical cancer diagnostics. By merging AI-based image analysis with molecular diagnostics (e.g., HPV DNA testing), clinicians gain a more holistic view of patient risk. This is particularly beneficial in resource-limited settings where standard diagnostic tools may not be readily accessible.  51 Implications for practice and research Before AI‑enabled colposcopy can be adopted routinely, prospective external validation against expert colposcopists and histology is indispensable. Future studies should report image resolution, augmentation details, and complete TP, FP, FN, and TN counts in a standardized format to facilitate meta-analysis. Implementation science must be integrated with algorithm development to address issues of workflow integration, clinician acceptance, and regulatory compliance from the outset. Ethical concerns – including data privacy, algorithmic bias, and equitable access – also require explicit discussion. Importantly, the choice of model architecture carries practical consequences: image‑only systems such as CerviCARE‑AI already achieve high sensitivity with minimal input demands, whereas multimodal fusion models like CMF‑CNN can deliver even higher macro‑AUCs but at the cost of additional HPV or cytology data, greater computational load, and more complex clinical workflows – factors that may limit their feasibility in low‑resource settings. Conversely, models optimized for higher specificity may reduce unnecessary biopsies but risk missing true positives; transparent reporting of these trade‑offs is essential for informed clinical adoption. Strengths and limitations This is the first PRISMA‑conforming synthesis dedicated solely to AI‑based colposcopy. Strengths include duplicate screening and extraction, QUADAS-2 appraisal, and comprehensive tabulation of model-development parameters. Despite the encouraging performance figures reported for AI‑enhanced colposcopy, this review has several significant limitations that temper the generalizability of its conclusions. First, many of the included studies relied on relatively small or demographically homogeneous image sets, raising concerns about external validity and the risk of overfitting. Algorithms trained on constrained datasets may not perform equally well in more diverse real-world populations. Only a minority of papers conducted independent external validation; therefore, the robustness of the high accuracies remains uncertain. Second, our literature search was restricted to PubMed and a supplementary Google Scholar hand‑search; databases such as Embase, Scopus, CNKI, and Web of Science were not queried. Consequently, relevant studies indexed exclusively in those sources could have been missed, introducing potential publication and language bias. Third, while several investigations showcased real-time or low-cost implementations, the practical translation of AI systems into routine clinical practice still must confront data-privacy regulations, algorithmic transparency, regulatory approval, and the need for clinician training and acceptance – issues that were only cursorily addressed in the primary literature. Moreover, most deep-learning models function as ‘black boxes’, offering limited interpretability compared with traditional machine-learning approaches, such as decision trees. This opacity may impede clinician trust and regulatory approval if not mitigated through explainability techniques. Future work should therefore prioritize the creation of large, ethnically diverse, multi‑centre datasets, undertake rigorous external validation, and explore how AI‑enabled colposcopy can be integrated with other diagnostic modalities such as HPV genotyping and cytology; addressing these challenges will be essential to realize the full clinical potential of AI for cervical‑cancer prevention and care. Finally, none of the included studies referenced sufficient emerging AI-ethics frameworks, and most provided scant detail on consent procedures or algorithmic transparency, underscoring the need for more transparent ethical and regulatory reporting before the widespread clinical deployment of AI. Conclusion AI-driven approaches and deep-learning models have shown considerable promise in enhancing the detection and management of CIN and cervical cancer. By automating image analysis and reducing interobserver variability, these technologies can outperform traditional diagnostic methods, facilitating earlier intervention for high-risk lesions. Furthermore, integrating AI with multimodal data – such as HPV testing and cytology – broadens its diagnostic utility, especially in resource-limited settings where standard tools may be scarce. Despite these advances, widespread clinical adoption of AI depends on overcoming key challenges, including the development of large, diverse datasets, rigorous external validation, algorithmic transparency, and the ethical handling of data privacy and equitable access. With continued research and responsible implementation, AI is poised to become a pivotal element of cervical cancer care, enabling more accurate diagnoses and ultimately improving patient outcomes on a global scale.
