Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) inhibitors are promising avenues in cancer immunotherapy. These enzymes are key regulators in the kynurenine pathway. modulating immune responses and enabling tumor immune evasion. By targeting IDO and TDO. Therapeutic approaches aim to restore immune surveillance and enhance antitumor activity. This review examines the mechanisms of IDO/TDO in cancer etiology, their consequences in the tumor microenvironment, and the therapeutic development of inhibitors currently being studied. Among these, medications like Indoximod, Epacadostat, and Navoximod have shown promise in influencing the immune system and slowing tumor progression, while dual inhibitors like HTI-1090 try to address broader metabolic connections. Despite tremendous progress, obstacles like tumor heterogeneity, off-target consequences, and varying patient responses remain. The use of IDO/TDO inhibitors with conventional anticancer medications demonstrates their potential to reshape cancer treatment paradigms, contingent on further research to optimize efficacy and safety.

It functions as a building block for proteins and is essential for the creation of several bioactive compounds necessary for immune system control, brain function and overall health. In addition, it is a precursor for the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, which affect mood regulation and cognitive function and melatonin, a hormone that is essential for controlling sleep cycles ( Kanova and Kohout, 2021 The metabolism of tryptophan made by enzymes such as indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) is an intriguing metabolic pathway with significant implications in a variety of physiological activities. IDO1 is found in multiple tissues and cells, including immune cells, playing an essential role in modulating immune responses and regulating inflammation and immune tolerance ( Ye et al., 2019 Hornyak et al., 2018 Najfeld et al., 1993 Hornyak et al., 2018 On the other hand, TDO functions in the liver, regulating systemic tryptophan levels. While tryptophan can also be metabolized to serotonin via Rafice et al., 2009 Bilir and Sarisozen, 2017 In cancer, IDO and TDO-mediated tryptophan catabolism contributes to immune suppression (detailed further in Mechanisms section) ( Shadboorestan et al., 2023 Sun et al., 2025 Qiao et al., 2025 Dai et al., 2025 Zang and Dorff, 2025 Shadboorestan et al., 2023 It has been demonstrated that inhibiting IDO and TDO may improve antitumor immune response ( Yoshioka et al., 2022 IDO and TDO are important enzymes in the kynurenine pathway, which is highly controlled by many factors. The downstream effects of targeting these enzymes are complex due to dynamic interactions and feedback loops within the kynurenine pathway. Drug development depends on the understanding of this complex regulation of the kynurenine pathway in different tissues and diseases ( Badawy et al., 2023 Dai et al., 2025 Xu et al., 2025 Additionally, tumor microenvironments are heterogeneous, exhibiting differing concentrations of nutrients, oxygen, and immune cell infiltration. IDO/TDO expressions can be altered by these microenvironment factors for the development of targeted therapeutics, comprehending how the dynamic changes in the tumor microenvironment affect immune responses and the effectiveness of IDO/TDO inhibitors ( Rohrig et al., 2015 Dehhaghi et al., 2019 Théate et al., 2015 To effectively address these complexities, a thorough understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing IDO and TDO in both health and disease is essential. Ongoing research is exploring optimal timing, dosing, and combination regimens to maximize the therapeutic potential of these inhibitors. This narrative review aims to provide an updated and comprehensive overview of these aspects. 2 Methods This narrative review is based on a comprehensive literature search. Sources included peer-reviewed articles, clinical trial registries (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov 3 Role of IDO/TDO in cancer 3.1 IDO A key mechanism connecting the immune system to the outside environment is tryptophan–kynurenine metabolism ( Huang et al., 2020 Stone and Williams, 2023 Fallarino et al., 2002 Belladonna et al., 2009 While many studies have investigated IDO1 in the context of cancer, research on IDO2 remains relatively limited. High IDO1 expression has been linked to a bad prognosis for several malignancies ( Weng et al., 2018 Munn and Mellor, 2013 IDO1 contributes to immune suppression by promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. IDO1 first stimulates the production of immunosuppressive APCs by functioning as an intracellular signaling molecule without requiring enzymatic activity ( Weng et al., 2018 Zhang et al., 2018 via + Prendergast et al., 2018 + Munn and Mellor, 2013 Prendergast et al., 2018 Moreover, NK cells and T-cell proliferation in the G1 phase can be inhibited by Trp intake, and certain toxic Kyn metabolites can cause T-cell death and specifically reduce T-helper 17 cells (Th17) ( Zhang et al., 2018 Prendergast et al., 2018 Théate et al., 2015 IDO1 contributes to tumor progression through immune suppression, tolerogenic APC induction, and MDSC-mediated effects, as detailed in the Mechanisms section ( Munn and Mellor, 2013 Lewis-Ballester et al., 2016 Clanchy et al., 2022 Zuo et al., 2014 Pseudomonas Og et al., 2022 Og et al., 2022 3.2 TDO Cancer tissues can express IDO1, TDO, or both. TDO has been shown to have immunomodulatory properties that promote tumor immune resistance and proliferation, therefore, TDO is considered a potential cancer treatment target due to the similar roles of TDO and IDO in regulating the Kyn pathway ( Abdel-Magid, 2017 Cheong and Sun, 2018 Stone and Williams, 2023 TDO can be produced ectopically in a variety of malignancies, aiding immune evasion by generating immunosuppressive kynurenine even while IDO1 is suppressed. This functional redundancy implies that tumors may compensate for IDO1 inhibition by upregufiltration and medication penetration in the tumor microenvironment ( Pilotte et al., 2012 Opitz et al., 2011 Platten et al., 2019 Pilotte et al., 2012 While most clinical efforts have focused on selective IDO1 inhibition, increasing evidence highlights the potential benefits of dual IDO1/TDO inhibitors for overcoming route redundancy. Agents such as HTI-1090 (SHR9146) and M4112 are among the few dual inhibitors that have entered clinical trials; however, their development is still in the early stages. Preclinical candidates like LM10 and 680C91 have shown the ability to inhibit both IDO1 and TDO, which supports increased antitumor immune responses by inhibiting compensatory TDO overexpression seen with IDO1 inhibition alone. Future research should prioritize the development and clinical translation of dual inhibitors, which may address adaptive resistance mechanisms and increase therapeutic efficacy across a wide range of tumor types. 4 Mechanism of action of IDO/TDO in cancer The kynurenine (Kyn) pathway is a metabolic route in which tryptophan is degraded to kynurenine and other downstream metabolites. IDO and TDO enzymes play pivotal and similar roles in converting tryptophan to kynurenine, regulating the first and rate-limiting step of this pathway ( Figure 1 Ye et al., 2019 FIGURE 1 Tryptophan Metabolic Pathways: Tryptophan is primarily metabolized via + Diagram displaying the metabolic pathways of tryptophan, including the kynurenin, serotonin, and indole pathways. The kynurenin pathway contributes ninety to ninety-five percent, producing KYN and ultimately NAD+. The serotonin pathway accounts for one to two percent, leading to serotonin and melatonin. The indole pathway involves four to six percent, forming various indoles and tryptamine. Each pathway shows specific enzymes and compounds involved, with corresponding arrows indicating progression. One of the most widely investigated agents is indoximod, a tryptophan mimetic that reverses immunosuppression by modulating mTORC1 signaling and restoring T cell function ( Fox et al., 2018 Abdel-Magid, 2017 Ye et al., 2019 Thackray et al., 2008 4.1 IDO1 IDO1 is highly expressed in various immune cells, fibroblasts, and tumor cells ( Ye et al., 2019 Albini et al., 2017 Mammoli et al., 2020 Albini et al., 2017 Mammoli et al., 2020 Albini et al., 2017 Mammoli et al., 2020 Abdel-Magid, 2017 Albini et al., 2017 Mammoli et al., 2020 IDO1’s overexpression leads to tryptophan depletion and accumulation of kynurenine metabolites, promoting inflammation and immune suppression by inhibiting effector T cells and NK cells and enhancing Treg and MDSC populations ( Hornyak et al., 2018 Ye et al., 2019 Bilir and Sarisozen, 2017 Ye et al., 2019 Tang et al., 2021 Ye et al., 2019 • mTORC1 - the target of rapamycin-inhibition, which stimulates T-cell apoptosis, inhibition of T-cell proliferation, and APC-mediated inflammation ( Hornyak et al., 2018 • Activation of GCN2 which directly changes DCs to tolerogenic APCs and stimulates tumor-immune inhibitory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-   β Ye et al., 2019 • Activation of AhR through IDO1’s intracellular signaling function which promotes Treg differentiation and drives the promotion of DCs and macrophages to an immunosuppressive phenotype ( Ye et al., 2019 IDO1 also indirectly influences non-IDO1-expressing cells through the kyn pathway metabolites and helps in building immune checkpoints in cancer cells ( Ye et al., 2019  γ  α Bilir and Sarisozen, 2017 4.2 IDO2 In 2007 Metz et al. (2007) Metz et al., 2007 Bilir and Sarisozen, 2017 Metz et al., 2007  γ Li et al., 2021 Platten et al., 2019 Li et al., 2007 Ebokaiwe et al., 2020 4.3 IDO2 and cancer The role of IDO2 has been suggested in many cancers such as non-small cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancers, and cervical cancer. As a result, it is presumed that IDO2 contributes to cancer development, but this relation is still not very well-studied ( Li et al., 2021 . Nevler et al. (2019) Mandarano et al. (2020) IDO2 possesses a role as a regulator of cytokine signalling by using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced endotoxin shock model, Yamamoto et al.

(2012) + + The induction of IDO2 by AhR activation occurs by culturing T-cells with DCs expressing IDO2 (and IDO1), an increase in CD4 + + Trabanelli et al. (2014) Liu et al. (2020) 4.4 TDO TDO is a tetrameric enzyme requiring reduction of its heme prosthetic group from ferric (Fe 3+ 2+ Li et al., 2007 van Baren and Van den Eynde, 2015 Badawy, 2017 TDO has higher substrate specificity than IDO, with a Km of approximately 190 µM for L-tryptophan, allowing it to catabolize tryptophan at concentrations above physiological levels (∼80 µM) Under normal conditions, TDO controls plasma tryptophan levels to maintain homeostasis ( van Baren and Van den Eynde, 2015 TDO is induced in several ways, IL-6 indirectly induces the expression of TDO -and IDO- by upregulating the ISX gene, thus promoting the malignancy of hepatocellular cancer cells, the immunosuppressive PGE2 also induces TDO. L-trp indirectly activates TDO by promoting the production of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) ( Li et al., 2007 The activity of TDO is regulated by several mechanisms, glucocorticoid regulates TDO by the de novo Badawy, 2017 TDO contributes to tumor immune resistance through the accumulation of kynurenine pathway metabolites. These metabolites play both independent and cooperative roles in tumor growth and immune evasion. Due to its higher Km, TDO efficiently produces kynurenine and its derivatives. These derivatives affect tumor progression by inducing CD4 + + Kynurenine and its downstream products act as AhR agonists, fostering immunosuppressive microenvironments. L-kynurenine is particularly toxic to lymphocytes and promotes Treg differentiation. L-hydroxykynurenine inhibits CD4 + Prendergast et al., 2018 Badawy, 2017 4.5 IDO/TDO binding pockets IDO and TDO are heme-containing enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of tryptophan, playing critical roles in immune regulation and cancer progression. The binding pockets and active sites of these enzymes are central to their catalytic efficiency, substrate specificity, and regulation of enzymatic activity. In IDO, the binding pocket is located within a large, hydrophobic cavity that allows for conformational flexibility, enabling the enzyme to bind a variety of substrates and inhibitors ( Lob et al., 2009 F et al., 2007 Pantouris et al., 2014 Sugimoto et al., 2006 Current drug development efforts targeting IDO and TDO has gained significant momentum due to their roles in immune suppression and cancer progression, particularly through the kynurenine pathway. IDO inhibitors, such as epacadostat and navoximod ( Figure 2 Beatty et al., 2017 Long et al., 2019 Long et al., 2019 Zhou et al., 2025 FIGURE 2 Chemical structures of IDO/TDO inhibitors in clinical development. Twelve chemical compounds with their structures or status. Compounds 1 to 5 and 7 to 9 show detailed chemical structures with names like Indoximod and Epacadostat. Compounds 6, 8, and 11 have undisclosed structures. Compounds have statuses such as Ph-I and Ph-II, indicating clinical trial phases. Compound 10 mentions an IDO1-derived peptide vaccine. TDO inhibitors, though less advanced, are also being investigated for modulating systemic tryptophan levels and improving anti-tumor response. Compounds like LM10 and 680C91 have shown promise in preclinical studies by selectively binding to TDO’s rigid active site, offering a complementary approach to IDO inhibition ( Opitz et al., 2011 Labadie et al., 2019 Moreover, integrating predictive biomarkers (e.g., baseline kynurenine/tryptophan ratios, tumor IDO/TDO expression profiles, and immune cell infiltration patterns) may help stratify patients and improve outcomes in future trials. Beyond oncology, these inhibitors are being explored for potential applications in neurodegenerative and autoimmune disorders linked to dysregulated tryptophan metabolism. Despite challenges, ongoing research into the structural and functional nuances of IDO and TDO binding pockets continues to drive innovation in drug design, with the goal of achieving greater selectivity, potency, and clinical success. 5 IDO/TDO inhibitors 5.1 Indoximod (1) Indoximod (1 , Figure 2 ) Fox et al., 2018 Friberg et al., 2002 EFF Prendergast et al., 2017 Prendergast et al., 2014 In phase I trials, it was well-tolerated as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy in studies that established a dose of 1,200 mg/day for ongoing evaluation in multiple Phase II trials ( Soliman et al., 2014 Soliman et al., 2016 Table 1 Jha et al., 2017 Soliman et al., 2018 2, Figure 2 TABLE 1 Summary of IDO/TDO inhibitors.

When used alone, TRAEs were well tolerated up to 700 mg BID. In combination, doses up to 100 mg BID were safe and tolerable, except when combined with ipilimumab, where ≤50 mg BID was acceptable (Beatty et al.). The phase III study combining epacadostat and pembrolizumab demonstrated a safety profile similar to pembrolizumab plus placebo, with no TRAEs leading to death ( Mitchell et al., 2018 6.2 Indoximod Indoximod has shown favorable safety and activity when used with chemotherapy across different types of cancer. The recommended phase II dose is 1,200 mg orally twice daily ( Soliman et al., 2014 Soliman et al., 2016 Johnson et al., 2024 Mariotti et al., 2021 Zakharia et al., 2021 6.3 Navoximod Navoximod demonstrated acceptable tolerability as monotherapy and in combination with atezolizumab, with no grade 4/5 TRAEs reported. In Japanese cohorts, most adverse events were grade 1/2, including fatigue and nausea, with few grade 3 events. Future development should focus on efficacy optimization through patient selection and combination strategies ( Ebata et al., 2020 6.4 PF-06840003 PF-06840003 was assessed in recurrent malignant glioma but was discontinued early due to strategic reasons despite demonstrating acceptable safety at lower doses. In a phase I study of patients with recurrent malignant glioma, PF-06840003 was generally well tolerated up to 500 mg BID. No treatment-related deaths were reported, though liver enzyme elevations (AST and ALT) were noted at higher doses ( Reardon et al., 2020 6.5 KHK2455 KHK2455 combined with mogamulizumab showed an acceptable safety profile in phase 1 clinical trials, with most patients experiencing grade 1–3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), primarily fatigue, diarrhea, and rash. Only one dose-limiting toxicity was reported, and no treatment-related deaths occurred ( Sahebjam et al., 2020b . 6.6 LY3381916 LY3381916 was tolerable as monotherapy up to 240 mg daily. However, in combination with PD-L1 inhibitors in triple-negative breast cancer, high rates of grade 3 liver toxicity (35.7%) were observed, leading to early termination of some study arms ( Kotecki et al., 2021 6.7 HTI-1090 HTI-1090 (SHR9146) has shown favorable safety in early-phase studies, with most adverse events being grade 1–2 (e.g., fatigue, decreased appetite, rash). No treatment-related deaths have been reported, and it remains a promising dual IDO/TDO inhibitor under further evaluation. 6.8 M4112 M4112 was generally well tolerated in early-phase studies, with no major safety concerns. However, pharmacodynamic failure to adequately suppress kynurenine limited clinical progress and led to early study discontinuation ( Naing et al., 2020 6.9 LPM3480226 LPM3480226 has shown preliminary tolerability in ongoing phase I trials. Further data from ongoing phase I trials are awaited to fully establish its safety and potential combination strategies ( ClinicalTrials, 2019a 6.10 DN1406131 DN1406131 is a novel dual IDO/TDO inhibitor currently in first-in-human phase I trials. Preliminary reports suggest acceptable safety, with commonly reported adverse events including fatigue, nausea, decreased appetite, and vomiting. No severe adverse events or treatment-related deaths have been reported to date. 6.11 NLG802 NLG802, an oral prodrug of indoximod, has shown good tolerability in early-phase trials, with commonly reported adverse events including nausea (33%), fatigue (25%), diarrhea (20%), and decreased appetite (17%). No treatment-related deaths were reported, supporting its further investigation as an improved delivery form of indoximod ( NewLink et al., 2020 Mautino et al., 2017 6.12 Linrodostat (BMS-986205) Linrodostat, used alone or with nivolumab, was generally well tolerated, with common adverse events including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pruritus, and liver enzyme elevations. Grade 3 or higher TRAEs were relatively infrequent. No treatment-related deaths were reported, and the combination showed promising safety in solid tumors ( SITC, 2017 Balog et al., 2021 Luke et al., 2019 7 Effective IDO/TDO drug candidates in cancer treatments 7.1 IDO1 and colorectal cancer (CRC) Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer death and the third most commonly diagnosed cancer globally ( Peng et al., 2022 Sung et al., 2021 + Siegel et al., 2020 Fusobacterium Ala, 2021 Han et al., 2021 Bishnupuri et al., 2019 via Xue et al., 2018 7.2 IDO1 and breast cancer Breast cancer (BC) remains the most common cancer among women worldwide and is responsible for the highest female cancer mortality ( Wilkinson and Gathani, 2022 Luo et al., 2018 Yu et al., 2011 Song et al., 2011 Yu et al., 2013 Wei et al., 2018 Furthermore, IDO1 expression is inversely related to estrogen receptor α (ERα) expression. Studies suggest that ER-positive tumors show reduced IDO1 levels due to promoter methylation mechanisms facilitated by ERα ( Dewi et al., 2017 7.3 IDO1 and melanoma IDO1 overexpression in melanoma aids immune evasion, correlates with Breslow thickness, and predicts poor prognosis ( Lynch et al., 2021 Weinlich et al., 2007 Slingluff et al., 2018 7.4 IDO and gastric cancer Gastric cancer ranks third globally in cancer mortality. IDO1 expression correlates with lymphocyte exclusion, poor survival, and chemoresistance ( Lian et al., 2012 Nishi et al., 2018 Kim et al., 2016 Miyanokoshi et al., 2018 7.5 IDO and pancreatic cancer IDO1 activity in pancreatic cancer supports profound immunosuppression by promoting Trp catabolism and Kyn production ( Liang et al., 2021 Newman et al., 2021 7.6 IDO1 and endometrial carcinomas Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most common gynecological malignancy in Europe. High IDO1 expression is linked to Treg infiltration and immune evasion, correlating with poor prognosis. Frequent co-expression of PD-L1 and IDO1 suggests a cooperative mechanism in immune suppression and a potential dual target for immunotherapy ( Tumeh et al., 2014 Sloan et al., 2017 Liu et al., 2015 Mills et al., 2018 7.7 IDO1 and esophageal cancer (EC) Esophageal carcinoma shows elevated IDO1 expression, which promotes tumor cell proliferation and migration via Harada et al., 2020 Yao et al., 2023 Dufour et al., 2002 Tokunaga et al., 2018 Rosenberg et al., 2018 Cui et al., 2018 7.8 IDO1 and thyroid carcinoma Thyroid carcinoma exhibits high IDO1 expression, driven by BRAF mutations and RET/PTC rearrangements ( La Vecchia et al., 2015 In vitro Moretti et al., 2014 Collectively, these findings highlight IDO1 as a multifaceted therapeutic target across diverse malignancies, warranting further clinical exploration of selective and combination approaches. 8 Challenges and future directions Despite promising preclinical and early clinical outcomes, various difficulties have hampered the use of IDO and TDO inhibitors in clinical practice. A key impediment has been the lack of strong predictive indicators to identify individuals who would benefit the most from these treatments. Despite encouraging previous studies, Epacadostat failed in the Phase III ECHO-301 study, emphasizing the significance of patient classification and a full understanding of the tumor microenvironment. Tumor heterogeneity, both within and between tumours, exacerbates treatment results. IDO and TDO expression levels can vary greatly between cancer types and among tumor subregions. The dynamic and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, driven by nutritional depletion, cytokine gradients, and metabolic interactions, has a substantial impact on the efficacy of these inhibitors. Furthermore, recent research indicates that microbiome-derived metabolites may influence tryptophan metabolism and immunological responses, adding another degree of complexity. Furthermore, the functional redundancy and potential compensation between IDO1 and TDO2 strengthen the case for dual inhibition techniques. While most previous attempts have focused on IDO1, data suggests that TDO2 can compensate for IDO1 inhibition, promoting the development of dual inhibitors such as HTI-1090 and M4112. Future research should focus on incorporating comprehensive biomarker studies, such as metabolic signatures, immunological profiling, and microbiome assessments, into clinical trial designs. Combination therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy are promising techniques for increasing efficacy and overcoming adaptive resistance. Systems biology and computational modeling approaches may potentially be useful in guiding individualized treatment options and optimizing medication combinations. Addressing these difficulties is critical to realizing IDO and TDO inhibitors’ full potential as breakthrough cancer immunotherapy drugs. Furthermore, more investigation of IDO/TDO expression heterogeneity across different tumor types and microenvironments is required to improve patient selection and response prediction. Integrating knowledge of microbial interactions with tryptophan metabolism could help explain individual variability in treatment outcomes. Furthermore, using systems biology and computational modeling could provide comprehensive insights into pathway dynamics and reveal novel vulnerabilities for targeted therapy. Thus, a multifaceted strategy combining molecular insights, precision medicine tools, and innovative trial designs will be key to overcoming current barriers. 9 Conclusion IDO and TDO inhibitors offer a compelling strategy to overcome tumor-induced immunosuppression and enhance antitumor immunity. Agents like Indoximod have demonstrated encouraging clinical safety profiles and the ability to enhance T cell activation, while Epacadostat and other IDO1-selective inhibitors showed promise but highlighted the importance of patient selection and combination strategies. Dual inhibitors, such as HTI-1090, present a potential approach to address redundancy in the kynurenine pathway, yet they face challenges in achieving effective systemic suppression without off-target metabolic effects. Future research should focus on refining biomarker-driven patient stratification, integrating microbiome interactions, and optimizing combination regimens with immune checkpoint inhibitors or targeted therapies. Additionally, exploring the tumor microenvironment heterogeneity, addressing tumor-specific metabolic dependencies, and minimizing systemic immune-related adverse events will be crucial for maximizing therapeutic success. As these avenues are further developed, IDO and TDO inhibitors are poised to reshape cancer immunotherapy paradigms, potentially transforming patient outcomes and broadening the scope of immunologically targetable tumors.
