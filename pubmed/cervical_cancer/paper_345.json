Topological indices play a vital role in predicting the biological and physicochemical properties of chemical compounds by deriving them from the molecular structure using specific rules. Given the growing prevalence of keloid cases, there is an increasing need for safer and more effective drugs. This study investigates 12 keloid drugs by applying the QSPR technique with respect to their physicochemical properties. The drugs are ranked using the AHP with specific criteria, allowing for the identification of the most effective drug combinations to help in the development of improved treatments for keloids. From the analysis, it is observed that the most effective and suitable drug is Doxorubicin while the least effective drug is 5-Fluorouracil.

This may also occur on pathological scars during plastic surgery when the change occurs after tissue injury heals. It causes extreme discomfort, swelling, itching, characterized by pain when the skin surface is thicker than the regular skin. Keloids frequently occur on the chest, upper arms, earlobe, belly, shoulder, back and the joints, while it can occur anywhere on the body. They are aggressive exophytic growth that expands into the surrounding skin with high chances of recurrence post therapy. For keloid research, there is a lack in the number of studies on human skin and animals, making it a challenging issue. Lab-based (in vitro) culture studies focusing on keloid derived fibroblasts have been very useful compared to studying keloids in live animals. A major challenge is that these patient-derived fibroblasts are often scarce as they are repeatedly grown and divided in the lab which loses its original characteristics due to ageing. This makes it difficult to conduct long-term studies 1 1  Fig. 1 Sample keloid scars. Due to its unpredictable nature, keloid formation is a clinical challenge, and it has high rate of recurrence even after the treatment. Significant disparities are found in epidemiological studies of keloid prevalence which suggests a strong genetic influence. It reveals from the studies that people with darker skin tones are at higher risk, especially in African and Asian countries. It is evident from the studies that the prevalence rate in black populations is 2.4%, 1.1% in Asians while 0.4% in Caucasians. This percentage varies drastically from UK at 0.09% to Congo at 16%. Another factor is also age, as it is commonly seen in the people between 10 and 30 years. In China, the family members of affected individuals have shown high incidence of keloids based on first, second and third degree relatives. Also, it is more common in females, although the reasons are still unclear. There are other factors that are linked to keloid which includes hypertension, Vitamin D deficiency, and atopic dermatitis. Treatment for keloid includes radiation therapy, laser therapy, cryotherapy, and several intralesional injections apart from topical corticosteroids and silicone dressings. Although, they reduce symptoms and scar size but has potential side effects 2 Skin could heal wounds that take four main stages namely haemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. The most significant role in the wound healing process is played by dermal fibroblasts in which collagens are produced by the cells to regulate the ECM remodeling. Hypertrophic scars are formed when there is an excess collection of collagens while healing of wound. Unlike keloids, hypertrophic scars are confined to the wound and the scars left would be smaller and show wavy or spiral pattern in a specific direction. Over time, hypertrophic scars become smaller and reduce while keloids are different which grows or remains for longer time. Sometimes, keloids are classified as benign fibro-proliferative skin tumors 3 4 Impact of drugs in the treatment of different diseases Substances that alter the physiology or psychology of an organism upon consumption are referred to as drugs. Some people use drugs for medicinal reasons, while others do it for fun. It is possible to treat multiple diseases with a single drug. Several authors studied about drugs and its uses. Yeo et al. 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Bogari et al. 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 The present study considered the above 12 drugs in the treatment of keloid scars. Significance of MCDM MCDM techniques have proven useful in many fields, including drug design, materials science, molecular structure optimization, and evaluation. It is crucial in the evaluation and selection of the best option among alternatives involving multiple criteria. Several researchers actively worked on various drugs using MCDM techniques mostly (TOPSIS, SAW, QSPR) in the prediction of best drug for different diseases like multiple sclerosis, anti-psychotic, and eye disorder etc., listed few 25 27 Significance of AHP To structure complex decisions, Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) technique, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used. AHP helps in providing a systematic and logical approach to breakdown a complex decision problem using criteria and alternatives. It permits the decision makers to consider both tangible and intangible criteria in the decision-making process. It is as flexible as it can be applied in different fields like engineering, healthcare, management and many more. AHP allows assigning weights based on the importance of the criteria which helps in reducing bias in the process of decision making. Consistency check ratio helps in measuring consistency of judgements ensuring the decision being valid. Finally, it provides ranks for alternative to make it easier for justifying the best choice. Dominico et al. 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 Procedure to calculate the rank using analytic hierarchy process Analytic Hierarchy Process is a methodological framework for decision-making by organizing intricate issues, quantifying subjective assessments, and maintaining consistency. The step-by-step procedure is listed here: Articulate the purpose of the decision unequivocally. Ascertain the elements that will affect the decision-making process. Determine the options that are accessible. Evaluate each criterion in relation to others utilizing Saaty’s scale 37 Assess the relative significance of each criterion. Evaluate alternatives according to the specified criteria. Consolidate the findings to identify the optimal alternative. Guarantee the comparisons are uniform. The step-by-step process is illustrated in Fig. 2  Fig. 2 Step by step process in analytic hierarchy process. There are various studies that are carried out on QSPR approach on several ailments. This article focuses on the drugs used in the treatment of Keloid using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), making it a novel study as there are no articles on keloid using this approach till date. Twelve keloid drugs are explored to rank the most predictive drug, through three physical chemical properties such as non-hydrogen atom count (heavy atom count), molecular weight, and complexity. Material’s approach The combination of mathematics and chemistry gives rise to a branch of science called chemical graph theory. In line with the concepts of graph theory, atoms are depicted as nodes and chemical bonds as edges in the representation of molecular structures. In the present study, the structure of a drug for keloid is considered as a graph, J = (V(J), E(J)) where V(J), the vertex set, represents an atom and E(J), the edge set represents the chemical bond between atoms(vertices). All graphs considered are simple and connected. The degree of a (atom) vertex is defined by the number of (bonds) edges that connect it 38 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym}

Results and discussion In the present study, the goal is finding the optimal drug for keloid among the considered drugs namely Betamethasone, Doxorubicin, Fluorouracil, Hydrocortisone, Imiquimod, Mitomycin, Retinoic Acid, Tamoxifen, Triamcinolone Acetonide, Tranilast, Verapamil and Zidovudine. Molecular structures, physicochemical properties of the drugs are identified using PubChem and ChemSrc. The number of atoms in a molecule that are not hydrogen atoms is referred as Non-Hydrogen Atom Count or Heavy Atom Count. This property is used in drug discovery and ligand efficiency calculations; it is used to describe the size of a molecule. The process of calculating mass of a substance is important in chemistry which is referred to as molecular weight.

It entails developing mathematical models that relate physical, chemical, or biological properties to molecular descriptors like size, shape, electrical characteristics, and functional groups. The impact of molecular descriptors on the predicted property of interest is referred to as the beneficiary and non-beneficiary criteria in QSPR (Quantitative Structure–Property Relationship) analysis. Beneficiary Criteria are characteristics that have a positive effect on the target attribute. Based on this concept, the high correlation is identified (shown in Table 4 5 6 7 7 Table 4 Physico-chemical properties V/S coefficient of correlation of topological indices.

Fig. 10 Rank comparison chart. Conclusion This study explores the impact of the physicochemical properties of keloid drugs through topological indices. The 12 drugs targeted for keloid treatment were selected using the highly effective MCDM method known as AHP. The evaluations performed using QSPR modeling, which considered properties such as non-hydrogen atom count (heavy atom count), molecular weight, and complexity, play a crucial role in shaping the background for AHP. Pharmacological studies based on this approach reveal that these three variables significantly influence the drug dosages. The correlation coefficients, which reflect the relationship between the selected degree-based topological indices and the physicochemical properties of each drug, were analyzed to identify the most relevant properties, such as non-hydrogen atom count (heavy atom count), molecular weight, and complexity, based on the highest correlation values. The 12 keloid drugs were ranked using the AHP technique based on these three properties. The AHP results show that Doxorubicin is the optimal drug for all three properties, while 5-Fluorouracil is ranked as the least optimal. However, the rankings for the three properties remain consistent, with the exception of complexity, where the 4th and 5th positions are swapped. Limitations The limitations of this study arise when a drug used for a specific ailment is upgraded to a more effective version. Such advancements enhance the drug’s performance, necessitating fresh investigations and performance evaluations of the improved formulation. This study focuses on the currently available drugs for Keloid treatment and provides a ranking based on their properties. Among the analyzed drugs, Doxorubicin ranks the highest, while 5-Fluorouracil ranks the lowest within the selected group.
