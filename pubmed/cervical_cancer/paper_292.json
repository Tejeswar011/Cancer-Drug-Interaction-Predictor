This study explores the molecular impact of cisplatin, Actemra (tocilizumab), remdesivir, and SARS-CoV-2 infection on colorectal cancer (CRC) SW-480 cells using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Differential gene expression analysis revealed treatment-specific transcriptional changes. Cisplatin led to the downregulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and focal adhesion, while remdesivir upregulated chromatin remodeling pathways.

Despite advances in targeted therapies and immunotherapies, resistance to treatment and tumor relapse remain major clinical hurdles ( 1 2 A key molecular link between CRC and COVID-19 lies in the shared expression of viral entry receptors in tumor tissues. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) are both overexpressed in colorectal tumors and have been identified as functional entry points for SARS-CoV-2 ( 3 4 5 6 7 The immunological overlap between CRC and COVID-19 is another layer of complexity. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- α 8 9 10 Given these shared molecular and immunological pathways, there is a pressing need to evaluate how anticancer and antiviral therapies interact at the transcriptomic level. Cisplatin, for example, exerts its cytotoxic effect through DNA crosslinking and apoptosis induction but is susceptible to resistance mechanisms mediated by cytokines such as IL-17. Actemra (tocilizumab), an IL-6 receptor antagonist used to manage cytokine storm in COVID-19, may modulate tumor-promoting inflammatory pathways, but its impact on CRC-specific targets like CD147 is poorly understood ( 10 12 13 15 To date, few studies have explored how SARS-CoV-2 infection influences drug responses in CRC cells, or how antiviral and anti-inflammatory agents affect cancer-related gene expression. Addressing this gap is crucial for developing safe and effective treatment regimens for CRC patients affected by COVID-19 or similar viral infections. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the transcriptomic changes in CRC SW-480 cells following treatment with cisplatin, Actemra, and remdesivir, both in the presence and absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. By integrating RNA sequencing with protein validation and cytotoxicity assays, we seek to identify key pathways and molecular targets such as ACE2, CD147, and IL-17 that are jointly modulated by these agents. Our findings may inform the development of personalized therapeutic strategies that simultaneously address drug resistance, viral susceptibility, and inflammation in CRC patients. 2 Methods 2.1 Cell culture SW-480 human colorectal cancer cells (ATCC ® 2.2 Treatment and SARS-CoV-2 infection Cells were treated with cisplatin (15.6–500 μg/mL, Sigma-Aldrich), remdesivir (62.5–2,000 μg/mL, Gilead Sciences), and Actemra (tocilizumab, 62.5–2,000 μg/mL, Roche) for 24–48 h, with durations optimized based on preliminary MTT cytotoxicity assays and literature ( 1 2 Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 1 ACE2 expression in colorectal cancer cells treated with varying doses of cisplatin. The concentration of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2, μg/μL) was measured in SW-480 colorectal cancer cells after treatment with increasing doses of cisplatin (15.6 to 500 μg/μL) compared to the no-treatment control (NT). A dose-dependent increase in ACE2 levels was observed, peaking at 250 μg/μL. At the highest dose (500 μg/μL), ACE2 expression plateaued with no further significant increase. Data represent mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) from three independent replicates. Bar chart showing mean concentration of ACE2 in micrograms per microliter across different treatments. Bars, in orange, represent various concentrations of cisplatin (CIS) and no treatment (NT). Concentrations range from CIS 15.6 to 500 micrograms per microliter, alongside NT. Error bars indicate the standard error of the mean. Figure 2 Distribution of gene types in the RNA-Seq dataset. This bar chart illustrates the classification of gene types based on RNA-Seq annotation. The x-axis displays the number of genes on a logarithmic scale, while the y-axis lists the gene categories. Protein-coding genes constitute the largest group (19,608), followed by pseudogenes (14,860) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs, 14,110). Additional categories include miscellaneous RNA (misc_RNA), small nuclear RNA (snRNA), microRNA (miRNA), small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). A subset of genes categorized as unknown or potential artifacts is also included. Bar chart titled “Gene Count by Transcript Biotype (log scale)” shows various RNA types on the y-axis, including Coding, Pseudogene, and lncRNA. The x-axis displays the number of genes. The chart highlights Coding (19,608 genes), Pseudogene (14,860), and lncRNA (14,110) as the most prevalent biotypes, with others like scRNA and vault_RNA showing only one gene each. 2.3 RNA extraction and sequencing Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol™ Reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA purity and integrity were assessed using a NanoDrop™ spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher, A260/A280 ≥ 1.8) and Agilent 2,100 Bioanalyzer (RIN ≥ 8.0). mRNA was enriched via poly-A selection and fragmented at 94°C for 8 min. First and second strand cDNA synthesis was performed using random hexamers, followed by adapter ligation and PCR amplification (12 cycles) with KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (Roche). Libraries were constructed using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit and sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6,000 platform (paired-end, 150 bp reads, minimum 30 million reads per sample) ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Distribution of normalized gene expression across treatment groups. The boxplot illustrates the distribution of transformed gene expression values for individual samples, grouped by treatment condition: Control (Cnt, red), Treatment 1 (Trt1, blue), Treatment 2 (Trt2, green), and Treatment 3 (Trt3, purple). Median expression levels are consistent across all groups, indicating effective normalization of the dataset. Outliers at the upper range reflect genes with unusually high expression in specific samples. Box plot chart titled “Distribution of Transformed Data” displaying transformed expression levels for different groupings: Cnt (red), Trt1 (blue), Trt2 (green), and Trt3 (purple). Each category shows variability, median levels, and outliers. 2.4 RNA-seq data analysis RNA-Seq data quality control was performed using FASTQC (v0.11.9) to assess read quality metrics, including per-base sequence quality and adapter content. Reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic (v0.39) to remove adapters and low-quality bases (Phred score < 20). Reads were aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38, Ensembl release 104) using STAR aligner (v2.7.9a) with default parameters. Gene-level counts were quantified using FeatureCounts (v2.0.1) with gene annotations from Gencode v38. Differential expression analysis was conducted with DESeq2 (v1.38.0) in R (v4.2.0), applying thresholds of |log₂FC| > 1 and adjusted p Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 4 Volcano plot of differentially expressed genes in treated colorectal cancer cells.

Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed distinct clustering of samples by treatment group ( Figure 5 Figure 6 CD147 IL-17 Figure 6 Hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles across treatment groups. The heatmap and accompanying dendrogram illustrate hierarchical clustering of gene expression data from SW-480 colorectal cancer cells subjected to different treatments. Clustering was performed using Pearson correlation and average linkage methods. Replicates within each group—Control (Cnt1–3), Treatment 1 (Trt1), Treatment 2 (Trt2), and Treatment 3 (Trt3)—cluster tightly together, indicating high intra-group consistency. Distinct separation between treatment groups reflects treatment-specific transcriptional responses, highlighting the differential impact of each intervention on gene expression patterns.

To address concerns regarding the interpretation of Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses, we clarify that these analyses indicate significant overrepresentation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in specific pathways, such as focal adhesion, lipid metabolism, and IL-17 signaling, rather than direct upregulation or downregulation of pathway activity. To infer the directionality of pathway regulation, we integrated Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and functional assays, including ELISA, as detailed below. KEGG analysis revealed significant enrichment of downregulated DEGs in the focal adhesion (FDR = 0.003) and lipid metabolism (FDR = 0.012) pathways in cisplatin-treated cells, driven by genes such as FASN p ACSL4 p Table 2 Figure 8 FASN p Figure 10 16 17 Actemra, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, demonstrated enrichment of downregulated DEGs in IL-17 signaling (FDR = 0.007), driven by genes such as IL-6 p IL-23 p Table 2 p Figure 9 18 CD147 p Figure 9 12 Remdesivir treatment induced the most extensive transcriptomic changes, with 2,010 DEGs significantly enriched in DNA replication pathways (FDR = 0.001), driven by upregulated genes such as HIST1H2BK p TOP2A p Table 2 Figure 8 19 ACE2 p Figure 11 3 TNF-α p 20 The dual role of CD147 p 8 p CD147 11 β 15 While GO and KEGG analyses effectively identify pathways enriched with DEGs, they do not directly confirm pathway activity, a limitation we addressed using GSEA and functional assays to infer directionality, as evidenced by NES values and ELISA results. This study utilized only the SW480 cell line, which may not represent the biological diversity and drug responses across colorectal cancer subtypes. Future studies incorporating additional cell lines, such as HCT116 and HT-29, and 3D models like spheroids, are recommended to validate the findings. We plan to include these additional colorectal cancer cell lines in future investigations to assess a broader range of drug responses and gene expression profiles, including ACE2 and TMPRSS2, enhancing the generalizability of the results and supporting the hypotheses presented. However, the in vitro in vivo This study highlights CD147 IL-17 ACE2 β 21 We believe these revisions, by acknowledging the current limitation of using a single cell line and proposing future studies with diverse cell lines, address the reviewer’s concern and lay the groundwork for more comprehensive research. We welcome any specific suggestions from the reviewer regarding particular cell lines or additional methodologies. 5 Conclusion This study demonstrates that RNA-Seq is a powerful tool for dissecting the interplay between CRC therapeutics and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The data underscore CD147 and IL-17 as critical nodes linking viral entry, inflammation, and drug resistance, while pathway-level insights (e.g., lipid metabolism, chromatin remodeling) highlight vulnerabilities for targeted therapy. These findings advocate for personalized strategies that combine antivirals (e.g., remdesivir) with cytokine inhibitors (e.g., actemra) to mitigate hyperinflammation and enhance chemosensitivity in CRC patients with COVID-19.
