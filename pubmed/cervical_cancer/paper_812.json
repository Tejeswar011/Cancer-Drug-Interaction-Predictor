Introduction Immunosuppressive factors within the tumor microenvironment hinder effective antitumor immune responses and limit the efficacy of current immunotherapies. Immunomodulators offer an alternative by activating immune effectors. Proteases from various sources used as cancer therapy adjuvants have shown promise in inhibiting tumor growth. Our previous work showed that the bacterial metalloprotease arazyme has a strong in vivo antimetastatic effect in the B16F10-Nex2 murine melanoma model. Interestingly, heat-inactivated arazyme also exhibited antitumor properties dependent on an intact adaptive immune response, highlighting its immunomodulatory role. To assess whether this effect is unique to arazyme, we examined another bacterial metalloprotease, Oligopeptidase A (OpdA). Methods OpdA was produced and purified. Endotoxin levels were measured. C57BL/6 mice received intravenous B16F10-Nex2 cells, followed by treatments with either active or heat-inactivated OpdA. Pulmonary nodules were counted. Immune cells involved in the response were characterized using FACS and depletion experiments. Cytokines were measured by ELISA and intracellular cytokine analysis. OpdA receptor activation was studied in bone marrow-derived cells from knockout and wild-type mice using inhibitors. Results Heat-inactivated OpdA significantly reduced metastasis, dependent on tumor-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and IFN-γ, both locally and systemically, with decreased IL-10 levels suggesting a proinflammatory environment. Treatment increased secretion of nitric oxide, IL-12p40, and TNF-α from bone marrow cells via enzymatic activity, involving MyD88/TRIF and MAPK pathways. Conclusion: OpdA shows potential as a tumor vaccine adjuvant, promoting antigen presentation and tumor-specific immune responses.

It has proven resistant to chemotherapy, with some countries experiencing an annual growth rate of 3 to 7% ( 1 2 The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a dynamic and intricate ecosystem where tumor cells interact with various immune and stromal cells. As tumors grow, the TME transitions from an initial pro-inflammatory, immune-activating phase to a later immunosuppressive state characterized by metabolic alterations and hypoxia. This change highlights the dual roles of key antitumor immune cells—such as T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells—which can either hinder or promote tumor growth depending conditions ( 3 In recent years, immunomodulators have created new opportunities for cancer treatment. They boost the immune system’s ability to eliminate tumor cells by enhancing their interaction with standard cancer therapies. Immunomodulators are generally divided into categories such as checkpoint inhibitors, cytokines, agonists, or adjuvants ( 4 Immunomodulators can activate key pathways of innate immunity, thereby enhancing a more effective adaptive immune response ( 5 6 Dendritic cells (DCs) are highly effective antigen-presenting cells, known for their ability to stimulate T cell immunity through TCD4 + + 7 9 10 12 13 Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogens through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and endogenous danger signals, also known as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). By activating innate immunity, TLRs trigger the adaptive immune response. This has led to the idea that TLR ligands could be useful components in cancer vaccines ( 14 The use of adjuvants has become especially important in antitumor vaccines because tumors often express “altered self” antigens that generally trigger a weaker immune response than pathogen antigens. Furthermore, immunoadjuvants that work well in pathogen vaccines may not be as effective in cancer vaccines ( 15 5 Each TLR detects specific patterns; TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) recognizes microbial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are part of the cell wall in gram-negative bacteria, as well as damage-associated molecules like heat shock proteins and high mobility group proteins, including HMGB1 and HMGN1 (High mobility group box 1 and High Mobility Group Nucleosome Binding Domain 1, respectively) ( 16 17 TLR4 activation by LPS starts when LPS binds to the LPS-binding protein (LBP). This enables LPS monomers to transfer to CD14, which is found in serum or on cell surfaces. Next, LPS is handed off to the accessory protein MD-2, forming the TLR4/MD-2 complex that promotes dimerization. This dimer then recruits two pairs of adapter proteins: TIRAP/MyD88 (myeloid differentiation factor 88) and TRAM/TRIF (the adapter containing the TIR domain that induces Interferon β). MyD88 helps recruit IRAK4 and IRAK2 (or IRAK1) kinases, which activate NF-kB and MAP kinase signaling pathways, leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6. Meanwhile, TRIF initiates a signaling cascade that activates IRF3, promoting the expression of IFN (type I interferon), IL-10, and RANTES ( 16 18 LPS enhances macrophage and monocyte activation by rapidly phosphorylating tyrosines, including key tyrosine kinase members like p53/56lyn and p58/64c-fgr, as well as both typical (PKCβ) and atypical (PKCζ) protein kinase C isoforms. These signals activate the MAPK pathway, which involves MAPK, MAPK kinase (MAPKK), and MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK). In human monocytic cells, LPS strongly activates all three components of this pathway ( 19 Therefore, TLR4-ligands used as adjuvants in antitumor vaccines show great promise. MPLA (Monophosphoryl lipid A), a safer form of LPS, activates antigen-presenting cells (APCs), especially dendritic cells (DCs), by engaging TLR4. This activation boosts co-stimulatory molecule expression, promotes a Th1 immune response, and enhances IL-12 production ( 20 21 22 Various proteases from different sources have shown promising results as therapeutic adjuvants in cancer treatment by inhibiting tumor growth. Notable examples include serine protease gingipains ( 23 24 25 26 27 28 Our previous study showed that intravenous injection of B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells in mice, combined with intraperitoneal arazyme treatment, resulted in a significant reduction of lung nodules.

To determine whether the antitumor response triggered by inactive OpdA depends on a functional adaptive immune system, immunodeficient mice (NSG) were injected with B16F10-Nex2 cells and treated with inactive OpdA. The antitumor effect of inactive OpdA was lost in these mice; in fact, the control and treated groups had a similar number of lung nodules (  Figure 1B  Figure 1C To assess how key effectors in the adaptive immune system contribute to the protective anti-tumor response triggered by OpdA, we used genetically modified animals lacking IFN-γ and performed in vivo + +  Figure 1D  Figures 1E and F We also measured the levels of IFN-γ and IL-10 in the lung homogenates and serum of mice treated with OpdA.

BMDCs exposed to either active or inactive OpdA produced NO, especially when IFN-γ was present, although this was less effective than LPS stimulation (  Figure 4A  Figure 4B  Figure 4C  Figure 4D Figure 4 BMDCs are activated by either active or heat-inactivated OpdA.

In a BMDC activation assay, we measured endotoxin levels in wells containing LPS, OpdA, or both, using a Limulus amebocyte  Figure 5 Figure 5 Effect of different concentrations of OpdA and LPS on the production of NO, IL-12p40, and TNF-α by BMDCs.

Data are represented as means with error bars, and significance is indicated by asterisks.   Figure 5 Another potential scenario involves a synergistic effect between LPS and OpdA. To evaluate this, BMDCs were stimulated with 25 μg/mL of either active or heat-inactivated OpdA along with increasing concentrations of LPS (from 0.1 to 5 EU/mL). Results showed that none of the tested LPS concentrations increased the production of NO, IL-12p40, or TNF-α, thereby ruling out the possibility of a synergistic interaction between LPS and OpdA (  Figure 5 These results support our previous findings, indicating that although the recombinant OpdA preparation contains low levels of contaminating endotoxin residues, these are not responsible for the immunomodulatory effect of OpdA on antigen-presenting cells. TLR4 is required for the activation of BMDCs by OpdA For OpdA to effectively activate antigen-presenting cells, recognition is essential, so we assessed the role of TLRs. The results showed that BMDCs from TLR4 -/-  Figure 6A -/-  Supplementary Figure 4A Figure 6 Active and heat-inactivated OpdA activate BMDCs through TLR4.

Graphs indicate higher cytokine levels under specific treatments, especially in C57BL/6 compared to TLR4KO and CLI-095. Error bars represent variability, and asterisks denote statistical significance. Furthermore, BMDCs from C57BL/6 mice were pre-treated for one hour with CLI-095, a cyclohexane derivative that inhibits the TLR4 intracellular domain, and then exposed to either active or heat-inactivated OpdA. With this inhibitor present, the production of NO, IL-12p40, and TNF-α was completely suppressed (  Figure 4B  Supplementary Figure 4B In conclusion, the findings suggest that TLR4 is involved in activating BMDCs through OpdA. OpdA signaling pathway involves MyD88 and TRIF To investigate the signaling pathway responsible for the downstream activation of TLR4 by OpdA, the MyD88 and TRIF proteins were analyzed.

Panel C presents bar graphs comparing the number of lung nodules and the weight of lungs in MyD88KO mice between control and inactive OpdA groups. Data are shown with error bars, and significance is indicated by asterisks. Additionally, BMDCs derived from C57Bl/6 mice underwent a 1-hour pre-incubation with the MyD88 inhibitory peptide (Pepinh-MyD), which disrupts MyD88 homodimerization, and the TRIF inhibitory peptide (Pepinh-TRIF), which hinders TLR-TRIF interaction, before being stimulated with heat-inactivated OpdA. As expected, the levels of NO, IL-12p40, and TNF-α were reduced due to the presence of the inhibitory peptides (  Figure 7B The antitumor effect of OpdA was not observed in vivo -/-  Figure 7C in vitro In conclusion, the results show that MyD88 and TRIF molecules are essential for activating BMDCs by OpdA. The proteins in the MAPK signaling pathway play a role in the activation of BMDCs The MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways are essential for the development and function of dendritic cells. This pathway includes several proteins, such as p38, JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases), and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases) ( 42 43  Figure 8 Figure 8 The role of proteins in the MAPK signaling pathway in activating BMDCs via active or heat-inactivated OpdA.

The bars compare effects without inhibitors and with JNK, p38, and MAP inhibitors. Statistical significance is indicated by asterisks. These results suggest that proteins associated with the MAPK pathway contribute to the activation of BMDCs by OpdA. Discussion Certain prokaryotic proteinases show immunomodulatory effects that are independent of their ability to hydrolyze proteins, although the exact mechanisms are still unclear. The heat-inactivated Sspa Subtilisin-like protease, a key virulence factor of Streptococcus suis 44 Porphyromonas gingivalis 45 Moreover, metalloproteases from various sources have been studied as alternative therapies for tumors, showing effective results, although their mechanisms of action are still partly unclear. Bothropoidin, a eukaryotic metalloprotease from snake venom, showed in vitro 46 in vitro in vivo 47 Our laboratory’s previous findings showed that the bacterial metalloprotease arazyme has an antitumor effect. The active protease significantly reduced the number of metastatic lung nodules in the B16F10-Nex2 melanoma mouse model. In vitro in vitro in vivo in vivo 30 We also discovered that heat-inactivated arazyme triggers an antitumor response in the B16F10-Nex2 melanoma mouse model, depending on a functioning adaptive immune system. This response is based on IFN-γ secretion and CD8 + 31 We hypothesized that the antitumor and immunomodulatory effects might not be unique to bacterial arazyme. To investigate this, the current study examined the antitumor and immunomodulatory effects, along with the mechanism, of a distinct prokaryotic metalloprotease called Oligopeptidase A, found in Salmonella typhimurium Escherichia coli in vitro To identify the local and systemic immune effectors involved in the immunomodulatory property of OpdA, we analyzed the production of IFN-γ and IL-10 in mice treated with active and inactivated protease at the lung metastatic site, in serum, and by tumor-specific T lymphocytes in splenocyte and lymph node cell populations after ex vivo IFN-γ is a multifunctional cytokine known for its potent antiviral, antitumor, and immunomodulatory effects.

In contrast, the inactivated OpdA-treated group had a slight rise in the ratio, but this difference was not statistically significant. Only mice treated with active OpdA demonstrated an elevated IFN-γ/IL-10 ratio in serum, while none of the OpdA-treated groups showed a substantial increase in IL-10 levels.

Dendritic cells (DCs) play a vital role in linking the innate and adaptive immune responses by recognizing bacterial and viral components through Toll-like receptors (TLRs) ( 52 53 54 55 Our findings showed that OpdA boosts BMDC activation through TLR4, involving MyD88 and TRIF, as demonstrated by the lack of activation in TLR4 -/- -/- -/- TLRs are a group of transmembrane proteins that detect microbial and viral elements ( 52 55 56 The effectiveness of TLR4 agonists as immunoadjuvants has been thoroughly evaluated.

To rule this out, we performed experiments with polymyxin B, which inhibits the biological effects of LPS, and treated OpdA with proteinase K, which selectively cleaves OpdA without affecting LPS. In the polymyxin B experiments, we observed a partial reduction in BMDC activation, suggesting low-dose endotoxin presence in the sample. However, when OpdA was degraded with proteinase K, BMDC stimulation was not observed, indicating that the main effect is from OpdA rather than contaminants. Additionally, activating BMDCs with LPS at concentrations equivalent to the endotoxin levels measured in the OpdA preparation (via the LAL assay) was ineffective, and no synergistic effect between OpdA and LPS was detected. The involvement of proteins from the MAPK signaling pathway in producing IL-12p40, TNF-α, and NO by OpdA-activated BMDCs was also demonstrated. Using specific inhibitors for JNK, p38, and MAPK, it was confirmed that OpdA activates BMDCs through this pathway. The MAPK cascade is essential for various cellular functions, including the proliferation and differentiation of immune cells such as dendritic cells, as well as the regulation and expression of proinflammatory cytokines like IL-12, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 ( 42 62 63 64 Ganoderma atrum 65 45 66 44 We also investigated the role of additional receptors in activating BMDCs by OpdA. Protease-activated receptors (PARs), a type of G-protein-coupled receptor, are found in nearly all cell types, including dendritic cells ( 67 68 69 70 Enterococcus faecalis -/- Recent findings highlight a significant impact of immunotherapies on skeletal muscles. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been linked to immune-related adverse effects on the musculoskeletal system, while adoptive cell immunotherapy can induce cytokine release syndrome, disrupting muscle cell metabolism and function. Tumor vaccines may cause symptoms like muscle fatigue, soreness, and discomfort in some individuals. Changes in the tumor microenvironment also affect skeletal muscle metabolism and function through multiple pathways. Clinical data indicate that about 30–50% of cancer patients experience notable declines in skeletal muscle function after chemotherapy, with higher rates among the elderly and those in poor health. This decline mainly involves muscle mass reduction, primarily due to the direct toxic effects of immunotherapy on muscle tissue, unrelated to tumor response. Loss of muscle mass significantly impairs physical mobility and daily life quality, and may also decrease chemotherapy tolerance, increase drug toxicity, and negatively influence overall survival. Similar effects are observed with chemotherapeutic drugs, raising concerns, especially as combined chemotherapy and immunotherapy become more common in practice ( 71 72 Our current work has not examined the effect of OpdA treatment on mouse muscle cells in vivo In conclusion, our findings show that OpdA can trigger an antitumor response in the B16F10-Nex2 melanoma mouse model, regardless of its enzymatic activity. An immunomodulatory effect on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) was observed, involving TLR4/MyD88/TRIF and members of the MAPK signaling pathway. These results suggest that OpdA could serve as an adjuvant in tumor vaccines, enhancing the antigen-presenting process and strengthening the tumor-specific immune response. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effect identified may extend beyond arazyme and OpdA, possibly indicating that metalloproteinases from other sources could also have immunomodulatory effects, which future research should explore.
