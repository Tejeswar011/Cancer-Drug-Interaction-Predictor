This study aimed to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines by enhancing the efficiency of tumor neoantigen delivery through extracellular vesicles (EVs), thereby promoting stronger dendritic cell (DC) activation and antitumor responses. Methods: A novel DNA vaccine (pCSP) was engineered by fusing tumor-specific neoantigens to the EV-associated protein CD63 and incorporating a SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) fragment to facilitate EV uptake by DCs. The resulting EVs were expected to carry neoantigens into the immunoproteasome for major histocompatibility complex I (MHC-I) presentation. The immunological and antitumor effects of pCSP were assessed through in vitro functional assays and in vivo experiments in a murine pancreatic cancer model. Safety was evaluated through histological and biochemical analyses. Results: In vitro, pCSP significantly promoted EV internalization by DCs by approximately twofold and enhanced their immune activation, as evidenced by elevated cytokine production. In vivo, pCSP markedly suppressed tumor growth with a decrease in volume by over 70% relative to controls, boosted CD8+ T cell responses, and increased immune infiltration into the tumor microenvironment. Safety assessments revealed that while liver/kidney function markers were within physiological ranges, mild inflammatory infiltrates were consistently observed in the lungs, indicating a localized safety concern that warrants further monitoring. Conclusions: The pCSP vaccine enhances the immunogenicity of neoantigen DNA vaccines by improving EV uptake and immune activation in DCs. These findings provide a potential strategy for improving DNA vaccine efficacy in the context of cancer immunotherapy while maintaining acceptable safety. extracellular vesicles CD63 dendritic cell DNA neoantigen vaccine General Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China 31770864 The work was supported by the General Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 31770864). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Therapeutic DNA cancer vaccines are considered a promising strategy for activating the immune system to fight cancer [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 7 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 In past studies, researchers developed DNA vaccines encoding antigens (Ags) fused to CD63, enabling the delivery of Ags into EVs. These vaccines effectively induced Ag-specific T-cell responses—particularly from CD8+ T cells—in mouse tumor models, significantly suppressing tumor growth [ 16 17 18 19 With the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has become widely recognized. Several receptors—including ACE2, NRP1, and L-SIGN—have been shown to bind the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) has been recognized as playing a functional role in COVID-19 and has been shown to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD [ 20 21 22 Some highly mutated cancers, such as melanoma, may be sensitive to monotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors due to their high neoantigen load and abundant tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). In contrast, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a tumor with low immunogenicity, fewer predicted neoantigens, lower immune infiltration, and poor response rates to immune checkpoint inhibitors [ 23 Figure 1 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Somatic Mutation Analysis and Screening The sequencing datasets were sourced from the NCBI SRA database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra 24 25 26 27 28 29 2.2. DNA Vaccine Construction The DNA sequence encoding the tumor neoantigens was ligated to the C-terminal of the full-length CD63 DNA sequence [ 30 18 Figure 2 2.3. Protein Structure Prediction The FASTA file corresponding to the amino acid sequence of the fusion protein was submitted to AlphaFold2 [ 30 https://dtu.biolib.com/DeepTMHMM/ 31 2.4. Cell Culture and Preparation HEK293T cells (Human embryonic kidney 293T cells, RRID: CVCL_0063) were purchased from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, panc02 cells (C57BL/6 mouse pancreatic cancer cells, RRID: CVCL_D627) were obtained from Meixuan Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and DC2.4 cells (C57BL/6 mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, RRID: CVCL_J409) were kindly provided by Wuhan Pricella Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Wuhan, China. HEK293T and Panc02 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Meilumbio, Shanghai, China) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, ExCell, Shanghai, China), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin (Meilumbio, Shanghai, China). DC2.4 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin. All cells were maintained in a 37 °C, 5% CO 2 2.5. EV Isolation and Characterization When HEK293T cells reached approximately 80% confluence, various DNA constructs were transiently transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The cells were then cultured for 48 h in serum-free medium specifically designed for exosomes (Yeasen, Shanghai, China). Cell culture supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 3000× g g 2.6. Western Blotting Forty-eight hours after HEK293T cells were transfected, the transfected cells were harvested, and the culture medium containing the transfected cells was centrifuged at 2000× g g 2.7. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real-Time PCR HEK293T cells were transfected with each DNA construct and cultured for 48 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Novizan, Nanjing, China). According to the manufacturer’s instructions, 1 μg of mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Hifair ® 2.8. DC2.4 Cell Uptake of EVs To study the cellular uptake of EVs, DC2.4 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 5.0 × 10 4 32 2.9. DC2.4 Cell Cytokine Release DC2.4 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at a density of 1 × 10 4 2.10. Spleen Cell Isolation and Cytokine Analysis Plasmids pCS, pP, pCP, and pCSP (100 μg) or an empty plasmid were intramuscularly (i.m.) injected into the tibialis anterior muscle of C57BL/6 mice. Mice were immunized three times with a 7-day interval. Seven days after the final immunization, the mice were euthanized, and their spleen lymphocytes were isolated under sterile conditions to be prepared into single-cell suspensions. A total of 1 × 10 7 2.11. In Vitro Cytotoxicity Assay To assess antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), Panc02 cells were first labeled with 5 μM 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) for 8 min and then co-cultured with activated spleen cells from mice at three different effector-to-target ratios (E/T ratios were 50:1, 25:1, and 12.5:1) at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, adherent cells were collected and stained with propidium iodide (PI, Servicebio, Shanghai, China) in the dark at room temperature for 15 min. The proportion of CFSE+/PI+ cells among CFSE+ cells, determined using flow cytometry, represents the percentage of tumor cells killed by the immune-modulated spleen cells after activation. 2.12. In Vivo Tumor Treatment Strategy C57BL/6 mice (female, 5–6 weeks old) were purchased from SLAC ANIMAL Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and were acclimated for at least one week in the Fudan University School of Pharmacy Animal Center under standard conditions of 23 ± 2 °C and 50% ± 10% relative humidity, before being included in the study. On day 0, after being anesthetized with 3% isoflurane inhalation (R510-22-10, RWD Life Science Co., Ltd., China), 2 × 10 5 3 2 3 2.13. RNAseq After euthanizing the mice in the treatment model, tumors were quickly dissected into small pieces and transferred to RNAlater (Solarbio, Beijing, China) and placed at 4 °C overnight. Total RNA was extracted using TransZol up (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). After RNA extraction, RNA integrity was assessed using 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis or a fragment analyzer, and RNA concentration and purity were determined using a Nanodrop. mRNA was enriched from the samples using magnetic beads with Oligo (dT). Transcriptome libraries were constructed. Quantification was performed using a Qubit 4.0 (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). PE150 sequencing was performed on the Novaseq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and differential expression analysis was conducted using EdgeR. Immune-related gene sets from the InnateDB database were used as references [ 33 2.14. Flow Cytometry Analysis Spleen lymphocytes from tumor-bearing mice were isolated under sterile conditions and prepared into single-cell suspensions. The spleen lymphocytes were stimulated with the neoantigen for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 2.15. In Vivo Safety Evaluation Female C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into groups, with four mice per group. Every 7 days, 100 μg of pCSP, pCP, pP, or physiological saline was administered intramuscularly as a control, with the treatment continuing for 3 weeks. Serum from mice was collected 1 week after the final immunization via tail vein blood collection, with the mice being anesthetized prior to blood collection. After collection, the samples were centrifuged at 4 °C, 3000× rpm for 15 min, and the supernatants were analyzed using an automatic biochemical analyzer (BK-280, BIOBASE, Jinan, China) to measure the expression of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). After blood collection, the mice were euthanized using the same method as described in the previous section. The major organs, including the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, and then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Subsequently, organ sections were scanned and photographed using a slide scanner (VS200, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). 2.16. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 9.5. For analyses involving two groups, t p p p p 3. Results 3.1. Construction of the DNA Vaccine pCSP and Fusion Protein Validation To screen tumor neoantigen sequences specific to Panc02 cells, we used pVACtools to analyze genomic data and predicted 13 candidate mutations, with the corresponding mutated peptides expected to bind C57BL/6 mouse-specific MHC class I (H-2Kb and H-2Db). We integrated these 13 mutation sequences into a multi-epitope antigen sequence and performed codon optimization to obtain the DNA sequences encoding the tumor neoantigens, designed for efficient translation in mice ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 34 Figure 2 3.2. Preparation and Characterization of CSP-Modified EVs To validate that cells transfected with pCSP successfully express the fusion protein, we first measured the mRNA expression levels of key components of CSP—mouse CD63, the neoantigen (ANT), and RBD—after transfection with blank plasmid, pCS, pP, pCP, or pCSP in HEK293T cells. The results showed that mouse CD63 gene expression was detected only in the CS, CP, and CSP groups; expression of the neoantigen fragment ANT was detected only in the CP and CSP groups; RBD expression was detected only in the CS and CSP groups. Given that HEK293T cells are of human origin, we further assessed the mRNA expression levels after transfecting the plasmids into mouse Panc02 cells. The results indicated that mouse CD63 was expressed in all groups, with the expression levels in the CS, CP, and CSP groups being approximately twice those of the blank control and P groups. The expression patterns of ANT and RBD were consistent with those in HEK293T cells ( Figure 3 To facilitate large-scale production of EVs expressing CSP, we transfected the pCSP plasmid into HEK293T cells and cultured them in exosome-specific medium for 48 h. Subsequently, the cell culture supernatants were collected, and EVs were extracted for further experiments. The concentration of the isolated EVs is approximately 7 × 10 7 Figure 3 Figure 3 To confirm whether CSP was successfully incorporated into extracellular vesicles, we performed Western blot analysis of EVs isolated from transfected cells. The results showed significant expression of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, CD63, CD81, and TSG101 proteins in the EVs, while the endoplasmic reticulum marker protein Calnexin was only detected in the cell lysates and not in the EVs, further confirming the high purity and specific composition of the extracted EVs. Moreover, Western blot results also showed specific expression of RBD and CD63 in the EVs, indicating that CSP was successfully packaged into the EVs ( Figure 3 Figure 3 3.3. CSP Modification Enhances EV Targeting to DCs To evaluate whether CSP modification enhanced the targeting and uptake of EVs by DCs, we labeled the extracted EVs with PKH67 dye and co-incubated them with DC2.4 cells to evaluate their uptake using flow cytometry. The results showed that EVs derived from pCS- and pCSP-transfected cells were significantly more efficiently taken up by DC2.4 cells than in the other treatment groups. This indicates that the insertion of SARS-CoV-2 RBD into CD63 significantly enhanced the uptake of EVs by DC2.4 cells ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 3.4. The pCSP Vaccine Enhances In Vitro Cytotoxicity and Immune Cell Activation To evaluate the specific CTL response induced by the pCSP vaccine, we used spleen cells from immunized mice as effectors and Panc02 cells as target cells ( Figure 4 Figure 4 3.5. In Vivo Antitumor Effect of pCSP In the tumor-bearing mouse model, we observed that pP, pCP, and pCSP all suppressed tumor growth compared with the control group, indicating that the neoantigens themselves can elicit antitumor responses in mice. Among these groups, the pCSP vaccine showed the most pronounced inhibitory effect, as evidenced by both tumor volume ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure S2 Figure 5 Figure 5 Heatmap analysis of immune-related genes ( Figure 5 Figure 5 3.6. Safety Evaluation of the pCSP Vaccine To assess the safety of the pCSP vaccine, we evaluated histological changes in the heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, and lungs of mice through H&E staining ( Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 4. Discussion MANAs have significant therapeutic potential in cancer immunotherapy, particularly by inducing cancer-specific CTL responses and neoantigen-specific immune responses. This mechanism has been confirmed in several studies [ 35 36 29 To achieve optimal CTL activity, these antigens need to be selectively presented to APCs—particularly DCs—which is crucial for enhancing antitumor immune responses [ 37 38 39 40 39 41 The addition of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD fragment was intended to enhance the targeted delivery of the neoantigen through its high-affinity binding to DC-SIGN. DC-SIGN is an important C-type lectin receptor on dendritic cells that mediates antigen internalization and facilitates antigen presentation [ 42 43 44 We extracted EVs from pCSP-transfected HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells are commonly used mammalian cell lines due to their high transfection efficiency and robust protein expression capabilities, making them widely applied in EV research. Previous studies have utilized HEK293T cells for the production of EVs for the immunization of mice [ 45 46 47 16 Figure 3 48 DC-SIGN expression was significantly higher in DC2.4 cells, while SIGNR1 expression was higher in RAW264.7 cells ( Figure S1 49 Further in vivo studies demonstrated that the pCSP vaccine significantly inhibited tumor growth in Panc02 tumor-bearing mice, increased the proportion of CD8+ T cells in the spleen, and boosted the secretion of IFN-γ, while also enhancing the immune activity of effector T cells in the tumor microenvironment. We observed a preliminary therapeutic effect in vivo, as pP, pCP, and pCSP all suppressed tumor growth, indicating that neoantigens themselves can trigger antitumor responses in mice. Furthermore, linking CD63 with neoantigens allowed antigen delivery through EVs, thereby enhancing the antitumor effect [ 16 50 51 52 It is known that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), and DC-SIGN-related receptor (DC-SIGNR, also known as L-SIGN) interact with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and serve as the functional receptors for SARS-CoV-2 entry [ 53 54 20 55 56 57 Overall, this proof-of-concept study proposes an innovative DNA vaccine design strategy that achieves the targeting of neoantigens to DCs via EVs through genetic modification of the extracellular domain of CD63. The assembly of the individualized neoantigens and EVs mediated various DC-targeted molecules occurs within the host cell, requiring only modification of the vaccine sequence to enable targeted delivery. Our findings provide new insights to enhance the targeted delivery capability of DNA vaccines and open new avenues for future vaccine design and immunotherapy approaches. This strategy demonstrates significant potential for the immunotherapy of tumors with low immunogenicity, such as pancreatic cancer, and it may facilitate the clinical translation of novel vaccine development technologies. 5. Conclusions This study developed a novel DNA vaccine, pCSP, which utilizes the CD63 protein expressed on extracellular vesicles and enhances dendritic cell uptake through the SARS-CoV-2 RBD fragment. This process improves antigen presentation and CD8+ T cell activation. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the promising antitumor effects of the pCSP vaccine. However, mild liver and kidney dysfunction, as well as localized pulmonary inflammation, were observed. Future efforts should focus on further optimizing the dendritic-cell-targeting domain. In conclusion, this study provides a new approach for the targeted delivery of DNA vaccines in vivo.

After plasmid DNA is transfected into the host cells, the plasmid DNA is expressed within the host cell, producing a fusion protein that contains CD63 and the tumor neoantigen. These proteins are secreted via EVs (such as exosomes) and are delivered to DCs. After the DCs uptake the fusion protein, the tumor neoantigens are processed and presented to CD8+ T cells via MHC-I molecules. The T cell receptors (TCRs) specific to the neoantigens are activated, leading to the clonal expansion of specific CD8+ T cells. The activated T cells migrate to the tumor site, where they recognize and kill tumor cells expressing the corresponding antigens, thereby achieving antitumor immune effects. Created in MedPeer. G.L.
