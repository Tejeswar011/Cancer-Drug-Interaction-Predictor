Among the molecular regulators guiding these fundamental biological decisions, HOX transcription factors and their cofactors, PBX and MEINOX, have emerged as essential regulators that coordinate positional identity and cellular plasticity throughout embryonic development and persistently into adult life[ 1  HOX 2 7 8 9 However, the delicate balance maintained by these transcriptional complexes can become disrupted, potentially leading to pathological conditions characterized by altered cell identity and plasticity, notably in fibrosis and cancer[ 10 HOX-MEINOX 2 11 14 HOX MEINOX HOX AND MEINOX: MOLECULAR FUNCTIONS AND MECHANISMS Homeobox sequences are defined as a highly conserved DNA motif (about 180 base pairs) encoding a 60 amino-acid DNA binding region called homeodomains.

It is well-established that PBX cofactors are essential and constant components required to facilitate the formation of transcriptionally active HOX-PBX-MEINOX trimeric complexes[ 48 30 31 49 50 HOX AND MEINOX: ROLE IN CELLULAR PLASTICITY Positional identity established during embryonic development and maintained throughout adulthood significantly influences cellular plasticity[ 51 53 54 HOX and MEINOX proteins help reconfigure chromatin states and activate lineage-inappropriate genes in response to spatial cues, particularly in embryonic patterning and regenerative contexts. Such a process can be observed in both limb formation and regeneration in axolotl, where positional information driven by HOXA and MEIS expression also drives plastic responses[ 55 56 et al 57 HOX Hoxa9, 10, 11 Hoxd9, 10, 11 During embryogenesis, HOX and MEINOX proteins contribute profoundly to establishing adult stem cell niches and maintaining their long-term integrity. The positional identity encoded by HOX Abd-B Hox 58 et al 59 et al 60 HOX HOX The concept of a “HOX code” is particularly evident in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from different anatomical sources, where unique HOX et al 41 in vitro 41 61 62 63 HOX Additionally, interactions between HOX-MEINOX proteins and their crosstalk with major signaling pathways, including Wnt, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and Notch, are fundamental in mediating cellular plasticity. These delicate frameworks integrate external signals with intrinsic transcriptional programs, fine-tuning the balance between pluripotency and differentiation. For instance, Notch signaling has been shown to drive HOX 64 HOX 65 66 67 et al 68 HOX AND MEINOX IN FIBROSIS Fibrosis is characterized by excessive accumulation and deposition of ECM components, particularly collagen fibers, leading to progressive disruption of normal tissue architecture and functional integrity. This pathological remodeling occurs as a maladaptive response to chronic injury or inflammation, driven by key molecular mechanisms including aberrant ECM remodeling, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and differentiation of fibroblasts into activated myofibroblasts. These processes collectively result in persistent ECM synthesis, increased tissue stiffness, and impaired organ function. Fibrosis is not restricted to a single organ but occurs broadly across diverse tissues such as the liver, lungs, kidneys, heart, and skin. In this context, elucidating the roles of developmental transcription factors, such as HOX proteins and their MEINOX cofactors, is particularly promising given their critical involvement in positional identity and cellular plasticity. To further elaborate on how positional identity and cellular plasticity mechanistically contributes to fibrosis progression, we will discuss these concepts in relation to key molecular mechanisms of fibrosis. Disruption or loss of positional identity can profoundly impact tissue homeostasis, steering cells toward aberrant differentiation pathways and pathological states, such as fibrosis. Through transcriptomic analysis, Forte et al 69 70 71 72 75 76 72 77 79 Complementary to positional identity, cellular plasticity - another critical process influenced by HOX-MEINOX proteins - allows cells to dynamically transition between differentiated and more flexible states, facilitating normal tissue repair and regeneration. However, dysregulated plasticity can initiate maladaptive responses, notably fibrosis, exemplified by excessive activation of EMT and persistent differentiation of fibroblasts or MSCs into contractile myofibroblasts. These maladaptive transitions result in excessive ECM accumulation, increased tissue stiffness, and impaired organ function[ 80 83 84 88 Aberrant HOX et al 79 HOX et al 89 HOX-MEINOX dysregulation also significantly modulates EMT processes. Li et al 90 et al 91 Finally, several HOX and MEINOX proteins play crucial roles in fibroblast-to-myofibroblast differentiation, a hallmark event in fibrosis. Wang et al 92 via 11 93 et al 11 et al 93 PKNOX2 43 94 To enhance our understanding of the mechanistic role of HOX-MEINOX molecules in fibrosis, we will briefly mention significant fibrosis-associated signaling pathways and their mechanistic contributions to fibrosis. TGF-β signaling is known as the central pathway driving fibrosis through fibroblast activation, myofibroblast differentiation, and ECM production[ 95 97 98 99 100 101 102 104 3 et al 105 HOXA11 HOXA11-AS HOXA11 106 via TGFBR1 107 et al 108 HOXB7 HOXB7 HOXB7 e.g., α-SMA 108 HOTAIR HOXC via URI1 12 109 in vitro HOTAIR 109 PRICKLE1 DKK1 via PTBP1 110 111 112 HOXB HOXD TGFBR1 113 via 114 115 116 TGFBR2 117 TGFBR2 6 PTPRJ 6 118 6 1 2 HOX 3 HOX 4 MEINOX Figure 3  HOX-MEINOX molecules’ involvement in fibrosis-related pathways.

Increased HOTTIP acts as a sponge for miR-148a, relieving repression of TGFβ receptor genes. Consequently, TGFBR1/2 levels rise, driving HSC activation and collagen production [ 112 Lung fibrosis Pro-fibrotic Enhances lung fibrosis by regulating the miR-744-5p/PTBP1 signaling axis [ 110  HOXA11-AS Liver fibrosis Pro-fibrotic Upregulated in a mouse model of ischemia/reperfusion-induced liver fibrosis and exacerbates fibrosis via [ 167 Cardiac fibrosis Pro-fibrotic Drives TGFβ1-mediated cardiac fibroblast activation.

Overexpression of miR-10a increased TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling and collagen-I expression, whereas miR-10a inhibition ameliorated liver fibrosis [ 197  miR-10a/b Kidney fibrosis Pro-fibrotic miR-10 family (miR-10a/10b, located in HOX clusters) is aberrantly expressed in chronic kidney disease.

Collectively, these findings emphasize the pivotal roles of HOX-MEINOX transcriptional complexes as central integrators of multiple fibrosis-driving signaling pathways. Through dynamic transcriptional regulation, these complexes mediate crosstalk among critical fibrotic signaling cascades, including TGF-β, Wnt, PDGF, and Notch. For example, HOXB7 exemplifies the direct convergence of TGF-β signaling with Wnt/β-catenin activity, where TGF-β1-induced stabilization of β-catenin results in enhanced HOXB7 108 109 HOX AND MEINOX IN CANCER As previously discussed, HOX and MEINOX molecules play critical roles in the regulation of positional identity and cellular plasticity - fundamental biological concepts necessary for proper development, differentiation, and adult tissue maintenance. When dysregulated, these molecules are capable of profound disruption of tissue homeostasis, thus creating a fertile ground for pathological transformations. In the context of cancer, disruption of cellular plasticity and loss or aberration of positional identity can drive oncogenesis as well as malignant progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Cancer cells often exploit cellular plasticity to dynamically transition between differentiated states and highly plastic, stem-like phenotypes, facilitating adaptation to changing microenvironments and therapeutic challenges. Similarly, the disruption or misinterpretation of positional cues by dysregulated HOX MEINOX 119 HOX and MEINOX proteins can profoundly influence cancer progression through their disruption of positional identity. In normal tissues, positional identity ensures cells differentiate and function correctly within their anatomical context, guided by tightly controlled HOX-MEINOX 38 63 120 121 123 124 et al 125 HOTAIRM1 HOXB-AS1 via 125 HOXC6 HOXC6 126 HOXC6 126 HOXC6 MLH1 126 et al 76 HOX et al 127 et al 127 via HOX-MEINOX Complementary to positional identity, cellular plasticity is also substantially influenced by HOX MEINOX 128 HOX-MEINOX 129 HOX MEINOX 130 132 133 MEIS1 in vitro in vivo 134 HOXA4 HOXA9 135 HOX MEINOX 136 HOX-MEINOX HOXD11 137 138 To further our understanding of how HOX-MEINOX proteins contribute to cancer, we will briefly highlight major cancer-associated signaling pathways and their mechanistic roles in tumor progression. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway promotes tumor growth, metastasis, and stemness through aberrant activation in numerous cancers. Similarly, TGF-β signaling has a dual role, suppressing early-stage tumor development but promoting EMT, invasion, and metastasis in advanced cancers. Notch signaling enhances tumor cell survival, stemness, and metastatic potential, while PDGF signaling strongly drives proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Several recent studies provide critical insights into how HOX-MEINOX proteins regulate these signaling cascades in various cancers, outlined in the following examples.

In PDAC cells, miR-10a-5p enhances migration and invasion and its inhibition reduces metastasis. Notably, retinoic acid receptor antagonists can repress miR-10a, leading to reduced invasion. miR-10a likely exerts its pro-metastatic effect by suppressing HOX e.g., HOXB1 B3 [ 230 HCC Downregulated Tumor suppressor miR-10a plays a context-dependent role in HCC. It is significantly downregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, especially in metastatic tumors. miR-10a-5p acts as a tumor-suppressor miR: Restoring miR-10a-5p inhibits HCC cell migration, invasion, and EMT, both in vitro in vivo [ 143  miR-10b Breast cancer Upregulated Oncogenic miR-10b is significantly overexpressed in metastatic breast cancer cells and was shown to initiate tumor invasion and metastasis.

Higher miR-10b levels associate with metastatic potential. Overexpression of miR-10b enhances HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas inhibition of miR-10b reduces invasiveness.

High miR-196 levels promote cancer cell migration and invasion, contributing to an invasive tumor phenotype. Clinically, elevated miR-196a/b in oral tumors correlates with advanced tumor stage and nodal metastasis. These “metastamiRs” target multiple genes (including HOX [ 151 HCC Upregulated Oncogenic The miR-196a and miR-196b are upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines. High miR-196a/b levels are linked to aggressive tumor features. miR-196a/b act as oncogenic miRNAs by targeting negative regulators of growth. miR-196a/b directly suppresses SOCS2, a tumor suppressor that normally inhibits the JAK/STAT pathway. Consequently, miR-196 overactivity leads to unchecked JAK/STAT signaling and tumor progression. Experimental downregulation of miR-196a or miR-196b was shown to inhibit HCC proliferation and metastasis by de-repressing SOCS2 and dampening JAK/STAT signaling. Clinically, elevated miR-196a is associated with HCC metastasis and poor prognosis [ 150 TNBC: Triple negative breast cancer; lncRNA: Long non-coding RNA; GBM: Glioblastoma; MGMT: O6-methylguanine-methyltransferase; TMZ: Temozolomide; HCC: Hepatocellular carcinoma; TNM: Tumor-node-metastasis; AML: Acute myeloid leukemia; NPM1: Nucleophosmin 1; SCLC: Small cell lung cancer; EZH1: Enhancer of zeste homolog 1; ceRNA: Competitive endogenous RNA; CTHRC1: Collagen triple helix repeat containing-1; TPL2: Tumor progression locus 2; MEK1/2: Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase1/2; ERK1/2: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2; EMT: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; PDAC: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; uPAR: Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor; MMP: Matrix metalloproteinase; OSCC: Oral squamous cell carcinoma; miRNA: MicroRNA; SOCS2: Suppressors of cytokine signaling 2; JAK: Janus kinase; STAT: Signal transducer and activator of the transcription.

Patients with higher MEIS1 experienced significantly longer time-to-progression after ablation. In a rodent HCC model, adding MEIS1 enhanced the tumor-killing effect of radioablation.

The findings discussed here highlight HOX-MEINOX transcriptional networks as essential nodes integrating various oncogenic signaling pathways. Dysregulated HOX-MEINOX complexes modulate the crosstalk between critical cancer-driving signals such as Wnt, TGF-β, Notch, and PDGF, collectively influencing tumor progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. For instance, HOXA10 demonstrates direct crosstalk by activating TGF-β signaling pathways, promoting EMT, while MEIS isoforms facilitate HCC progression through concurrent activation of Wnt/β-catenin and Hippo/Yes-associated protein pathways[ 136 141 140 CROSSROADS OF FIBROSIS AND CANCER: A SHARED MECHANISTIC PERSPECTIVE THROUGH FIBROSIS-DRIVEN CANCERS Fibrosis and cancer are increasingly recognized as interconnected pathological processes, sharing common molecular mechanisms and frequently existing as sequential or overlapping disease states. Chronic fibrotic conditions such as liver fibrosis, IPF, and primary myelofibrosis significantly heighten the risk for developing HCC, lung cancer, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), respectively. Central to the transition from chronic fibrosis to malignant transformation across these diverse tissues stand three fundamental mechanistic drivers: Loss of positional identity, altered cellular plasticity, and extensive ECM remodeling. Critically, these processes are tightly regulated by developmental transcription factors, particularly HOX proteins and their MEINOX cofactors, whose aberrant expression profoundly disrupts tissue homeostasis. This section will discuss how HOX-MEINOX dysregulation may partake in cancer initiation or suppression at fibrotic sites, by separately examining the roles of positional identity disruption and cellular plasticity alterations, exemplifying each from liver fibrosis, IPF, chronic pancreatitis, and primary myelofibrosis contexts. To briefly illustrate the primary mechanisms linking fibrosis and cancer, we summarize the pathological transitions observed in several fibrosis-associated malignancies. Persistent hepatic inflammation and chronic activation of hepatic stellate cells during liver fibrosis disrupt liver architecture and positional identity, facilitating hepatocyte transformation and development of HCC[ 156 159 160 162 94 163 164 To further elucidate the specific roles of HOX and MEINOX proteins in establishing or disrupting positional identity during the progression from fibrosis to cancer, we will explore relevant common molecular examples across these distinct disease contexts. HOXB13 HOXB13 165 166 HOXA11-AS 167 168 143 144 HOXA5 HOXA5 152 169 PKNOX2 43 170 PKNOX2 PKNOX2 171 THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS As our understanding of HOX and MEINOX biology deepens, the prospect of targeting these pathways for therapeutic benefit becomes increasingly tangible. Therapeutic strategies targeting HOX and MEINOX factors in fibrosis emerge from recent insights, although much work remains to translate them from bench to bedside. Several studies suggest that restoring the expression or function of certain HOX 172 174 HOXA5 via 172 173 e.g., HOXA5 174 HOX 175 108 176 HOX HOX ncRNAs associated with HOX and MEINOX pathways also represent promising therapeutic targets in fibrosis. The HOX-regulated lncRNAs are one example: HOXA5 was recently found to induce the lncRNA dynamin 3 opposite strand (DNM3OS) in lung fibroblasts, which in turn recruits the epigenetic repressor EZH2 to silence tuberous sclerosis complex subunit 2 (TSC2) and drive profibrotic proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation[ 169 i.e., HOTAIR 177 115 etc. in vivo Aberrant expression of HOX and TALE transcription factors in cancer provides opportunities for targeted intervention, albeit ones that demand deeper mechanistic understanding. Many cancers display HOX/MEIS dysregulation, with certain HOX 176 in vitro 178 in vivo 176 178 e.g. HOX HOX 174 179 via 178 e.g. Dysregulated ncRNAs linked to HOX and MEINOX networks in cancer are also attractive targets for therapy. LncRNA HOTAIR, which is transcribed from the HOXC locus, exemplifies this: It is dramatically upregulated in diverse carcinomas and drives EMT and metastasis by reprogramming chromatin (recruiting polycomb repressive complex 2 and silencing differentiation genes)[ 180 181 e.g. HOX HOXD10 HOX 182 183 HOXD10 184 HOX 108 HOX HOX The intersection of fibrosis and cancer, where chronic fibrotic injury can lead to or support the development of malignancies, presents a particularly complex scenario for HOX/MEINOX-targeted interventions. As discussed in earlier sections, fibrogenesis and tumorigenesis share common signaling axes (TGF-β, inflammatory cytokines, ECM remodeling) that induce cellular plasticity changes, and HOX transcription factors are deeply involved in orchestrating these changes. In fibrosis-driven cancers, HOX and MEINOX proteins may act as molecular links between the scar microenvironment and nascent tumor cells. For example, in the chronically injured lung (such as in IPF), loss of HOXA5 in alveolar regions leads to excessive Notch signaling and fibrosis[ 169 172 via 152 174 169 via 115 HOXD10 182 185 HOX vice versa HOX e.g. 186 177 vs e.g. Disruption of the posterior prevalence, the developmental hierarchy whereby posterior HOX HOX HOXC8 HOXB13 165 187 HOX HOXA10 HOXA13 HOXB13 HOXD13 HOX HOXB5 HOXB7 HOXC6 142 166 188 190 HOX HOXC4 HOXC6 HOXB13 138 191 HOX HOXA2 HOXA5 192 193 HOX HOXA5 HOXB7 169 175 HOXA5 146 152 HOX HOX CONCLUSION Across fibrosis, cancer, and fibrosis-associated cancers, a unifying theme is the reactivation of developmental gene programs - prominently involving HOX transcription factors, their TALE partners (PBX/MEINOX), and downstream epigenetic regulators - that endow cells with aberrant plasticity. In all these conditions, cells hijack embryonic patterning pathways to attain new identities: Fibroblasts become persistently myofibroblastic, and epithelial cells assume mesenchymal, stem-like traits. HOX and MEINOX proteins emerge as master regulators of these processes, integrating signals from TGF-β, Wnt, Notch, and inflammatory pathways into specific gene expression outputs that drive either fibrosis or malignancy (or both)[ 108 194 via Although this review focuses primarily on the dynamic and disease-specific roles of HOX and MEINOX proteins in fibrosis and cancer, it is crucial to acknowledge that PBX cofactors are indispensable for forming transcriptionally active HOX-PBX-MEINOX complexes. Existing literature highlights the therapeutic potential of disrupting HOX-PBX interactions in cancer biology, yet the comprehensive therapeutic modulation of these complexes will likely require a deeper understanding of PBX’s structural and functional roles across pathological contexts[ 49 50 176  Conflict-of-interest statement:  Provenance and peer review:  Peer-review model:  Specialty type:
