However, little was known about the role of circRNA in the formation of meat quality in pigs. Here, circRNAs were first characterized in muscles with differential meat quality and myofiber composition, longissimus thoracis, and semitendinosus muscles, with RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). A total of 1126 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified. Among them, Circ-06958 is highly expressed in both muscles. Circ-06958 originated from Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 1 ( ACSL1 AK4 AK4 AK4 circRNA miR-31-5p porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells proliferation AK4 meat quality National Natural Science Foundation of China 32472870 Key Research and Development Program of Heilongjiang Province 2022ZX02B10-1 This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32472870) and the Key Research and Development Program of Heilongjiang Province (No. 2022ZX02B10-1). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Pork is the main source of meat for the Chinese people. Its consumption accounts for more than half of the total meat consumption in the Chinese diet. With the improvement of living standards, consumers are paying more attention to meat quality. Meat quality is a complex trait composed of many physicochemical properties including pH, tenderness, flavor, meat color, water holding capacity, and marbling [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Meat quality is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. It is difficult to improve meat quality with conventional cross breeding, feeding, and management, etc. The development of molecular biology techniques provides useful tools for characterizing the hereditary basis of meat quality. Some genetic factors have been involved in meat quality, including protein-encoding genes, noncoding RNA (ncRNA), and epigenetic modification as well. Lnc-ADAMTS9 plays an essential role in myogenesis through the ERK signaling pathway [ 8 9 ACTC1 ACTG2 ACTN2 10 LRP1 11 CircRNA is a special type of ncRNA with a closed-loop structure. Compared with linear RNA, circRNA has no 5′-cap and 3′ poly(A) tail in structure, and less sensitivity to nuclease. CircRNA can impair premature mRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis by interacting with proteins [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 However, this is far from revealing the specific role and underlying mechanisms of circRNA in meat quality. This study was designed to characterize circRNAs associated with differential meat quality and myofiber composition between the longissimus thoracis and semitendinosus based on RNA-seq. The sequences and effects of candidate circRNA on proliferation of muscle cells were then characterized, and a regulatory ceRNA axis was constructed. The results will contribute to revealing the mechanisms through which meat quality generates, and thereafter contribute to controlling meat quality, which will better satisfy consumers. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Nucleic Acid Isolation, RNase R Digestion, cDNA Synthesis, and PCR Min pigs were used here. The pigs were slaughtered strictly according to the Chinese national standard for pig slaughtering (GB/T 17236–2019). Briefly, the individuals were electrically stunned, followed by exsanguination. Muscles were collected immediately after the pigs were slaughtered. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated with normal phenol-chloroform method. That is, the muscle sample was first digested with Proteinase K and SDS, and extracted with phenol-chloroform isopropanol by centrifuge at 12,000× g 2 g Table S1-A 2.2. CircRNAs Characterization We have obtained transcriptome landscape of miRNA, lncRNA, and mRNA in longissimus thoracis and semitendinosus muscles of Min pigs with RNA-seq (CRA020799; https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa 21 p < Based on sequences obtained by RNA-seq, divergent primers across the Back-Splice Site and ordinary convergent primers were designed to characterize Circ-06958 experimentally. Using the two primer pairs, PCR was performed with gDNA and cDNA template, respectively. The products were inserted into pMD-18T vector (Takara, Dalian, China), and sequenced by Genesoul Biol (Harbin, China). 2.3. Plasmids and Oligonucleotide Sequences The full-length sequence of Circ-06958 and the complete coding sequences (CDS) of AK4 were amplified with RT-PCR from cDNA obtained from muscles, respectively, to construct overexpression plasmids. Circ-06958 sequences were inserted into pCD2.1-CIR at enzyme sites Kpn I and Bam HI. The CDS of AK4 AK4 22 Table S1-B AK4 Table S1-C 2.4. Cell Culture and Transfection C2C12 (CRL-1772) and PK15 (CCL-33) cell lines (Genetimes, Shanghai, China) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM)/High Glucose (SEVEN, Beijing, China) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; OPCEL, Inner Mongolia, China) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). The cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 2.5. Cell Counting Kit 8 Assay Cells were inoculated at a density of 2500 for 16 h in 96-well plates. Then, we transfected the overexpression plasmids, or oligonucleotides, into the cells for 24 h, which was designated as 0 h. 10 μL CCK-8 reagent (Cell Counting Kit 8, Beyotime) was added to each well at 0, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h. The optical density (OD) at 450 nm was measured with the Tecan Microplate Reader Infinite F50 (Tean GENios, Mannendorf, Switzerland). 2.6. 5-Ethynyl-2′-Deoxyuridine Incorporation Assay 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining was carried out with BeyoClick™ EdU-555 kit (Beyotime) as described previously [ 23 2.7. Western Blotting Cells were seeded in six-well plates and cultured until reaching approximately 50% confluence, then transfected with an overexpression vector or oligonucleotides. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, total protein was extracted using RIPA buffer (Beyotime) supplemented with a protease inhibitor (Invitrogen) and quantified using the enhanced BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime). A total of 25–30 µg of protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Shanghai, China). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk and incubated with primary antibodies: anti-AK4 (1:500 dilution; Proteintech, Wuhan, China), anti-PCNA (1:5000 dilution; Proteintech), and anti-β-tubulin (1:20,000 dilution; Proteintech). β-tubulin was used as a loading control. Membranes were then probed with goat anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:20,000 dilution; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Protein bands were detected using the Odyssey ® 2.8. Flow Cytometry Analysis Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 1.2 × 10 5 2.9. Dual-Luciferase Reporter Gene Analysis The reporter genes and mimics were co-transfected into PK15 cells. After 48 h post-transfection, the cells were collected, and luciferase activity was analyzed by using the dual-luciferase reporter gene assay kit (Beyotime). The relative luciferase activity was measured as a ratio of Renilla to firefly luciferase value. 2.10. Statistical Analysis All experiments were performed three times, each with triplicates. Statistical analyses were conducted with GraphPad Prism (version 9.5.1; GraphPad, San Deigo, CA, USA), and an unpaired t p < p < 3. Results 3.1. Analysis of Differential circRNA Expression A total of 441 DE circRNAs were identified, including 199 up- and 242 down-regulated in LT compared to ST muscles ( Figure 1 Table S2 Figure 1 https://www.genecards.org Figure 1 Figure 1 3.2. Circ-06958 Identification and Subcellular Localization According to the results of RNA-seq, Circ-06958 was derived from the exon 11–13 of the porcine ACSL1 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Next, RNase R digestion resulted in the disappearance of products amplified with convergent primers, while it had no effect on the amplification of divergent primers ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 3.3. CircRNA-06958 Enhances Cell Proliferation by Promoting Cell Cycle Progression To reveal the role of Circ-06958, plasmids overexpressing Circ-06958 were constructed successfully ( Figure S1a p < Figure 3 p < Figure 3 PCNA) p < CDK4) p < cyclin B p < cyclin D p < Figure 3 p < Figure 3 p < p < Figure 3 Figure S2a Mouse myoblast, C2C12 cells, was then used to validate the promoting effects of Circ-06958 on cell proliferation. As observed in PMSCs, ectopic Circ-06958 could increase the cell viability ( p < Figure 3 p < Figure 3 PCNA p < MKI p < cyclin D p < cyclin B p < Figure 3 p < Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure S2a 3.4. Construction of Regulatory Axis Among CircRNA-06958, miR-31-5p, and AK4 Subcellular localization analysis showed that Circ-06958 might function as ceRNA. To reveal the mechanisms through which Circ-06958 regulates cell proliferation, the miRNA targeted by Circ-06958 was identified. A binding site for miR-31-5p was predicted with the online software circAtlas 3.0 ( https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/circatlas/ https://circinteractome.nia.nih.gov/index.html Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Then, 284 potential target genes of miR-31-5p were predicted by the online software TargetScan ( https://www.targetscan.org/vert_80/ https://www.mirbase.org AK4 Figure 4 Figure 4 AK4 Figure 4 AK4 Figure 4 AK4 3.5. miR-31-5p Inhibits Cell Proliferation by Suppressing Cell Cycle Progression Next, we analyzed the effects of miR-31-5p on cell proliferation. MiR-31-5p mimics reduced the cell viability and the cell number, while the inhibitor increased them, as revealed by CCK-8 and EdU assays, respectively, in all the two cell types ( Figure 5 PCNA CDK4 cyclin B cyclin D Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure S2b 3.6. Circ-06958 Promotes Cell Proliferation by Absorbing miR-31-5p To investigate the relationship between Circ-06958 and miR-31-5p in regulating cell proliferation, we co-transfected Circ-06958 plasmids with miR-31-5p mimics into cells. The CCK-8 and EdU assays showed that miR-31-5p alleviated the promoting effects of miR-31-5p on cell proliferation ( Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure S3 3.7. AK4 Enhances Cell Proliferation by Promoting Cell Cycle Progression To study the function of AK4 in cell proliferation, we successfully obtained plasmid overexpression and siRNA against AK4 ( Figure S1c,d Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure S4 3.8. miR-31-5p Inhibits Cell Proliferation by Silencing AK4 To evaluate whether miR-31-5p was involved in the regulation of cell proliferation by AK4, rescue experiments were performed. We co-transfected cells with miR-31-5p mimics and plasmids overexpressing AK4. The results of CCK-8 and EdU demonstrated that miR-31-5p inhibited the promoting effects of AK4 on cell proliferation in all two cells ( Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure S5 4. Discussion CircRNAs are a kind of RNA that is stable and conserved with covalently closed loop characteristics. They are involved in post-transcriptional control of gene expression via acting as a ceRNA [ 24 25 AK4 Through RNA-seq performed in the longissimus thoracis and semitendinosus muscles, we identified a lot of differentially expressed circRNAs. Among them, Circ-06958 was identified as one of the most important candidates for meat quality, owing to its expression level and the role of the parent gene. The Circ-06958 was then cloned, and the reverse splice site was validated with molecular biology experiments. A series of recent research studies showed that circRNAs could regulate cell proliferation in physiological and pathological processes. For example, Circ_0110940 exerts a pro-proliferative effect in gastric cancer through the miR-1178-3p/ SLC38A6 26 27 28 29 Both muscle fiber composition and muscle development are main factors determining meat quality, and both of them are associated with muscle cell proliferation. Here, we first analyzed the role of Circ-06958 in muscle cell proliferation. It was shown that Circ-06958 increased the proliferation of PMSCs by reducing the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase and promoting cell cycle progression in pigs. Then, mouse C2C12 cells were used to confirm the promoting effects of Circ-06958 on cell proliferation, and consistent results were obtained. The composition of muscle fibers determines the overall biochemical and functional characteristics of muscle tissue, which, in turn, affects its quality as fresh meat [ 30 31 Many studies have found that circRNAs can function as miRNA sponges to alleviate the inhibitory effects of miRNA on mRNAs [ 32 33 34 35 36 miR-31-5p has been demonstrated to have a dual role in cell proliferation. It is down-regulated in gastric cancer and exerts an inhibitory effect by binding to the 3′-UTR of HDAC2 37 38 BAP1 39 AK4 40 AK4 41 42 AK4 43 AK4 44 45 AK4 46 AK4 AK4 Figure 9 AK4 5. Conclusions In summary, we characterized a differentially expressed circRNA, Circ-06958, in porcine longissimus thoracis and semitendinosus muscles based on RNA-seq results, and validated its sequence with molecular biology technology for the first time. Circ-06958 increased proliferation of cells from different tissues and species by promoting cell cycle progression, indicating it is functionally conserved in mammals. Additionally, a regulatory axis Circ-06958/miR-31-5p/AK4 was constructed experimentally. It was revealed that miR-31-5p inhibited cell proliferation, while AK4 promotes cell proliferation, by affecting cell cycle progression. Through rescue experiments, we confirmed that Circ-06958 regulated cell proliferation via the miR-31-5p/AK4 axis. This study will contribute to revealing mechanisms through which a differential phenotype was generated between the two muscles, and to controlling meat quality in pigs.
