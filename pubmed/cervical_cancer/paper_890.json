During cranial development, CNCs migrate before the neural tube is closed, where these migrated cells begin to differentiate into mesenchymal cells and then produce craniofacial structures. Embryonic stage E12.5 is critical for establishing the condensation of CNC-derived mesenchyme cells to form frontal primordia ( 55 56 Nf2 Nf2 Supplemental Figure 2B + Nf2 Figure 2, A and B + + Nf2 Figure 2, A and C Nf2 Figure 2, A and D Nf2 + Nf2 Figure 2E + + Nf2 Figure 2F Nf2 To initiate a normal osteogenesis, Runx2 and Osterix/Sp7, 2 fundamental transcriptional factors, are definitely required for bone ossification ( 57 59 + + Nf2 Figure 2, G + + Nf2-cKO Figure 2, G Nf2 Nf2 Nf2 mediates the synthesis and trafficking of type I collagen in CNC-derived osteoblasts.

All 3 enzymes require ascorbic acid (AA) as a cofactor ( 63 64 65 Nf2 Supplemental Figure 2C Supplemental Figure 2D Figure 3I Figure 3I Supplemental Figure 2G Nf2 Nf2 Figure 3I Supplemental Figure 2G To validate the intracellular type I collagen synthesis, we analyzed intracellular collagen protein and found that the intracellular type I collagen in CNC-derived osteoblasts was higher in the cytoplasm than that in controls after AA treatment for 6 hours, and this trend was significantly higher after AA treatment for 10 hours in Nf2 Figure 3, J and K Nf2 Figure 3, J and K Nf2 plays a crucial role in modulating FGFR1/Akt signaling in CNC-derived osteoblasts.

Our results showed that the activity of type I collagen was substantially declined when the activity of p-Akt was effectively inhibited using Akt inhibitor ( Figure 5F Figure 5G Nf2 Figure 5, H and I Figure 5J Nf2 Nf2 requires Akt-mediated phosphorylation for osteogenic function but not FGFR1 binding. Nf2 protein adopts a tripartite architecture comprising an N-terminal (NTD) FERM (F for 4.1 protein, E for ezrin, R for radixin, and M for moesin) domain, a central helix (α-helical) domain, and a C-terminal domain (CTD), with intramolecular FERM-CTD associations dictating its closed/inactive versus open/active conformations ( 78 34 35 79 80 81 To advance the understanding on the physiological function between Akt and Nf2 in CNC-derived osteoblasts, single-site mutations on Nf2-Ser10, Nf2-Thr230, Nf2-Ser315, and Nf2-Ser518 were constructed, respectively, namely S10A, T230A, S315A, and S518A. Additionally, we constructed constitutive phosphorylation plasmids at Nf2-S10A and Nf2-T230A, namely S10D and T230D. In addition, GFP acts as a negative control, and lentivirus-mediated Nf2 site mutation–overexpressing plasmids were used.

Nf2’s domain-specific phosphorylation creates distinct functional modules: C-terminal S315/S518 mediate FGFR1 binding, while N-terminal T230 phosphorylation by AKT serves as the essential docking interface. This spatial segregation enables Nf2 to simultaneously coordinate FGFR1 signaling and Akt-dependent collagen regulation, with Nf2 ",
