We aimed to create and evaluate a predictive model for the post-paracentesis risk of acquiring AUR. Methods This study included 599 patients undergoing prostate biopsies (April 2020-July 2023) at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, selected based on abnormal digital rectal examination and/or PSA (prostate-specificantigen) > 4 ng/mL. Acute urinary retention (AUR) was defined as the inability to void within 72 hours post-biopsy, requiring catheterization. Patients were randomly divided into training (419 cases) and test (180 cases) sets. Univariate logistic analysis and feature selection Boruta and LASSO (Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) identified predictors, followed by multivariate logistic regression to develop a predictive nomogram for AUR. Internal validation used the test set, with model performance assessed via the c-index, ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis. The nomogram demonstrated strong discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility for AUR risk prediction. Results In 86 patients (14.3%), AUR happened. An examination of multivariate logistic regression revealed six distinct risk variables for AUR. Based on these independent risk factors, a nomogram was constructed. The training and validation groups’ c-indices showed the model’s high accuracy and stability. The calibration curve demonstrates that the corrective effect of the training and verification groups is perfect, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve indicates great identification capacity. DCA (Decision Curve Analysis) curves, or decision curve analysis, demonstrated the model’s significant net therapeutic effect. Discussion The nomogram model created in this work can offer a personalized and intuitive analysis of the risk of AUR and has intense discrimination and accuracy. It can help create efficient preventative measures and identify high-risk populations. acute urinary retention prostate biopsy machine learning predictive model Boruta feature selection The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Patients and methods Study design and participants We conducted a retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients who underwent prostate biopsy in the day ward of the Department of Urology, the First People’s Hospital of Nantong, from April 2020 to July 2023. Abnormal digital rectal examination, high PSA (> 4.0 ng/mL), or positive prostate multiparametric MRI (prostate imaging report and data system ≥ 3) were the inclusion criteria. The following conditions precluded study participation: hypersensitivity to ciprofloxacin, prostate-related surgery within the previous three months, urinary tract infection during biopsy or therapy, and denial of informed written consent. The study excluded patients with a history of urine retention and those with urinary retention during biopsy. Data parameters included patient demographics, PSA readings, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), prostate volume, post-void residual (PVR) volume before biopsy, comorbidities, blood and urine routines, post-void residual (PVR) volume, and histopathological findings. Ethics and informed consent The research adhered to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects gave informed consent, which was approved by the First People’s Hospital Center of Nantong’s Ethics Committee (ethical approval number 2022KT100). Because this study was a retrospective cross-sectional study, informed consent was not required and all subjects included in the study had signed an informed consent form authorizing the use of the information for future scientific research. Retrospective data analysis followed the ethical guidelines applicable at the time of source data collection (Declaration of Helsinki 2013 revision). Data collection and variable definition Demographic information was obtained from electronic medical records, along with PSA values, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), prostate volume, post-void residual (PVR) volume before biopsy, comorbidities, blood and urine routines, routine inflammatory parameters, and post-void residual (PVR) volume. Before being included in the study, a second reviewer verified the chart review data’s accuracy. We used multiple imputation to handle missing values, the number of imputations was 5, and variables with < 5% missing proportion were finally retained; abnormal values (identified by Z-score method, | Z | > 3) were verified, corrected after confirming abnormal values due to measurement error, and the rest retained original data to avoid information loss; normality tests were performed for continuous variables (e.g., prostate volume, IPSS score), and logarithmic transformation was used for non-normally distributed variables (e.g., residual urine volume) to ensure the rationality of model input data. AUR was defined as the inability to void within 72 hours following biopsy, necessitating the implantation of a urinary catheter ( 22 Histopathologic evaluation All biopsies were analyzed by 2 urogenital pathologists (> 10 years’ experience). The location, proportion of cancer tissue per core, and Gleason score (GS), based on the 2005 consensus of the International Society of Uropathology ( 23 PI-RADS score Before having a prostate biopsy, all patients had 3.0 T mpMRIs (no endorectal coils). T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE) are among the scanning techniques used for mpMRI. After DWI data were collected at b-values of 0 and 1500 s/mm 2, ADC maps were produced. Two genitourinary radiologists with at least three years of prostate MRI expertise evaluated the mpMRI, and the PI-RADSv2.1 score was used to record the results. For CSPCa, it is doubtful to originate in PI-RADS 1 (doubtful to occur in CSPCa), PI-RADS 2 (unlikely to happen in CSPCa), and PI-RADS 3 (suspicious for CSPCa); nevertheless, for PI-RADS 4 (high) and PI-RADS 5 (very high) ( 24 25 Statistical analysis The continuous data were evaluated using the Student’s t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test, and the results were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range. Alternatively, categorical data reported as numbers (%) was evaluated using Fisher’s exact or Chi-square tests. We used LASSO regression to reduce the dimension of high-dimensional data and identify the best predictive characteristics and variables of AUR after performing univariate logistic regression analysis of the training group to first screen the factors and determine the risk factors of AUR ( 26 Results Clinical features Between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2023, 599 patients who underwent prostate biopsies in Urology Department Day Ward at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University provided data for our analysis. Of these, 513 cases (85.64%) did not experience postoperative acute urine retention, while 86 (14.36%) experienced it.  Figure 1  Table 1 Figure 1 Research pathway diagram.

Analysis of clinical practicability and rationality of prediction model We employed the incidence of AUR in patients following TP as a state variable and the predicted probability of the calibration plot as a test variable to evaluate the nomogram’s clinical value. As illustrated in  Figure 7 Figure 7 Clinical decision curves for nomogram models. (A) (B) Two line graphs, labeled A and B, show net benefit versus threshold probability.

Both graphs use red lines to represent “Nomo,” gray for “All,” and black for “None.” The x-axes are labeled with threshold probability and cost-benefit ratio. We contrasted the ROC curves of the predicted nomograms with those of models that only used one predictor to provide a more thorough assessment.

Discussion Current studies have mostly focused on the comparison of diagnostic accuracy and complication rates between transperineal and transrectal prostate biopsy in the diagnosis of prostate cancer ( 27 30 13 31 32 14 15 33 34 13 14 35 38 The clinical information and laboratory parameters of 599 patients who had prostate biopsies were reviewed retrospectively. These included easily accessible laboratory and anthropological data, such as age, sex, BMI, prostate-specific antigen, diabetes, and residual urine before biopsy. We determined the independent variables for AUR in TP patients to be body mass index, prostate volume, history of diabetes, constipation, IPSS, and residual urine before biopsy using various statistical techniques. We created a straightforward and precise nomogram, verified it within the model, and demonstrated its clinically solid applicability and efficacy. In 14.3% of our cohort, urinary retention happened. Urinary retention has an incidence ranging from 1.6 to 11.4%, according to the NICE guidelines for transperineal template biopsy of the prostate ( 12 33 34 39 11 In line with our findings, several studies have found a positive correlation between the frequency of urine retention and the number of needle biopsies performed; however, this relationship was not statistically significant ( 33 34 22 7 14 11 40 41 11 42 Existing studies mostly focus on complications after transrectal puncture (TR), there are very few studies on AUR after TP, and most of them are univariate analysis (such as only focusing on prostate volume or number of puncture needles); a few studies involving TP do not establish prediction models and do not include machine learning algorithms to optimize variable screening ( 29 43 44 14 45 46 21 The clinical nomogram of this study integrates biomarkers and clinical characteristics, includes factors such as constipation and BMI in the prediction model of AUR after TP for the first time, and improves the rigor of variable screening through a two-feature selection algorithm to provide a personalized assessment of whether to continue Foley catheter or take additional safety measures to prevent AUR in TP patients. The nomogram constructed in this study is based on six easily accessible clinical measures (body mass index, prostate volume, history of diabetes, constipation, International Prostate Symptom Score, preoperative residual urine volume) that can be directly integrated into the preoperative assessment process of transperineal prostate biopsy (TP). Clinicians achieve precise stratified management by rapidly calculating the patient ‘s acute urinary retention (AUR) risk score: for example, high-risk patients (score > 70%): prophylactic use of alpha-blockers to relax the bladder neck preoperatively, or prolonged monitoring to 72 hours postoperatively, timely detection of signs of urinary retention, and reduction in the risk of complications such as emergency catheterization rate and overdistension of the bladder; for low-risk patients (score < 30%): use a standardized discharge regimen to reduce unnecessary inpatient observation and reduce medical costs while ensuring safety. The current study has some limitations. It is a single-center cross-sectional study with a limited sample size that may introduce selection bias. In addition, we only performed internal validation on nomogram models, and subsequent studies also required external validation. Furthermore, potential influencing factors such as the number of puncture needles and operator experience were not included, and subsequent studies could expand the range of variables. Subsequent studies can be conducted in a large sample, multicenter, prospective study to find more risk factors for AUR complications in TP patients so that relevant measures can be taken early to avoid repeated catheterization and further hospitalization and improve patient discomfort.
