Despite its favorable safety profile, clinical trials have demonstrated antitumor responses in only a small subset of patients. This limited efficacy has been largely attributed to the short plasma half-life of recombinant monomeric soluble TRAIL (rhTRAIL). To enhance its stability and therapeutic potential, researchers have developed modified versions, including an immunoglobulin Fc domain-fused TRAIL (Fc-TRAIL) and a dimeric Fc-fused single-chain variant (Fc-scTRAIL). In this study, we used the SNU-1746 three-dimensional (3D) multicellular layer culture model and a patient-derived colon cancer tumoroid model to evaluate the biological activity of these TRAIL formats (rhTRAIL, Fc-TRAIL, and Fc-scTRAIL). Treatment with rhTRAIL revealed that a longer exposure time (18–24 hours) was required to induce apoptosis in both 3D models, in contrast to monolayer cultures. Among the TRAIL formats, Fc-scTRAIL was the most potent in inducing apoptosis, as confirmed by immunoblotting analyses. Furthermore, artesunate (ART) enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis across all TRAIL formats, with the strongest synergistic effect observed in combination with Fc-scTRAIL. JC-1 staining assays indicated that mitochondrial membrane depolarization (a hallmark of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway) plays a key role in the cell death observed with the combination treatment in tumoroids. These findings provide compelling preclinical evidence supporting the potential of ART and Fc-scTRAIL combination therapy for future clinical evaluation. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript yes pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
