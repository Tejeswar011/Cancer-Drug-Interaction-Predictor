However, many cases of esophageal carcinosarcoma demonstrate lymphatic metastases, which require surgery. Case We describe the case of a 46‐year‐old female patient who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy that revealed a tumor shadow in the middle thoracic esophagus. The patient did not have symptoms such as dysphagia or chest pain. Subsequent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with ultrasound and endoscopic submucosal dissection revealed carcinoma and sarcoma components that allowed the diagnosis of esophageal carcinosarcoma. Lymph node metastases and distant metastases were not observed. Discussion Tumor resection of the center and base of the protruding lesion with a wide margin allows an early and correct diagnosis of typical and atypical esophageal carcinosarcoma cases. Tumor resection with a wide margin can predict metastasis.

The patient was hospitalized for further examination and treatment. On admission, all vital signs, physical findings, blood test results, and physiological function examination results were within the normal ranges. The initial upper gastrointestinal endoscopy examination revealed a white semi‐pedunculated mass 30 cm from the maxillary lateral incisor. A subsequent endoscopy examination indicated an approximately 4‐cm tumor without ulceration. During iodine staining, the mass was observed as an unstained area. Therefore, biopsy was performed. The pathological findings of the biopsy specimens indicated no atypical cells. To determine whether we would be able to perform ESD for this case, we conducted endoscopic ultrasonography, which revealed that the mass was well‐demarcated, hypoechoic, and had an intact muscle layer. Therefore, we decided to perform ESD to histologically diagnose and treat the mass. Gross findings showed that the specimen obtained during ESD was a brown, semi‐pedunculated, 4.4 cm × 1.8 cm, protruding lesion containing hemorrhages (Figure 1 FIGURE 1 (a) The first upper gastrointestinal endoscopy examination after hospitalization revealed a semi‐pedunculated mass with a white coat 30 cm from the maxillary lateral incisor. (b) This mass was observed as a protruding lesion during indigo carmine staining. (c) The endoscopic ultrasonography examination revealed that the mass was well‐demarcated and hypoechoic with an intact muscle layer (blue arrows). (d) Brown, sausage‐shaped, 4.4 cm × 1.8 cm specimen with some hemorrhages obtained during endoscopic submucosal dissection. Histopathology indicated a tumor that infiltrated the submucosal layer with a depth of 1500 μm; however, lymphovascular invasion was not observed. Histopathological findings indicated a negative tumor margin. Atypical cells in the epithelial basement membrane of the tumor were histopathologically similar to those associated with squamous cell carcinoma. The sarcoma component with atypical cells that was considered abnormal mitosis infiltrated the submucosal layer and caused destruction of the muscularis mucosa. Sarcoma cells were composed of oval and occasionally irregularly shaped nuclei and spindle to plump cytoplasm that pathologically represented “spindle and pleomorphic sarcoma.” Trabecular and solitary cancer cell nests infiltrated the interstitial tissue. Multiple areas regarded as microinvasion were observed in this specimen, and we determined that carcinoma components invaded the stroma (shown in the Supporting Information Supporting Information Supporting Information CT evaluations (plain and with contrast) were performed 17 days after ESD and revealed no recurrence, no lymph node metastasis, and no distant metastasis. At 49 days after ESD, the patient underwent thoracoscope‐assisted esophagectomy comprising gastric tube reconstruction via the retrosternal route using hand‐assisted laparoscopy and dissection of the cervical, thoracic, and abdominal lymph nodes. Complications were not observed preoperatively or postoperatively. The histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed no lymph node metastasis, no lymphovascular invasion, and no distant metastasis; additionally, it revealed a negative tumor margin. No other type of cancer was observed. Therefore, the patient was discharged from the hospital. Additional CT evaluations (plain and with contrast) were performed 105 days after surgery and revealed no recurrence, no lymph node metastasis, and no distant metastasis. 3 Discussion Sanada et al. reported 58 cases of esophageal carcinosarcoma between 1995 and 2004 in Japan with T1 ( n n n n 3 A previous analysis of 24 cases of esophageal carcinosarcoma revealed that 41.7% involved a T1 lesion depth and no lymph node metastasis; however, 58.3% of cases involved a T2 or T4 lesion depth, and 33.3% of these cases included lymph node metastases [ 4 5 6 Furthermore, this case featured a sausage‐shaped lesion in the middle esophagus, which is characteristic of esophageal carcinosarcoma. The histopathological findings included carcinoma‐like and sarcoma‐like components with a clear border, and p53 expression was the same in both components. These findings were consistent with the typical histopathological characteristics of esophageal carcinosarcoma, which has epithelial and mesenchymal components [ 7 8 9 9 10 10 In summary, we encountered a rare case that was evaluated using ESD during an early and asymptomatic stage and correctly diagnosed as esophageal carcinosarcoma. To enable the correct diagnosis of esophageal carcinosarcoma using ESD, extensive lesion resection is necessary to obtain a specimen that includes the base and protruding portions of the tumor.
