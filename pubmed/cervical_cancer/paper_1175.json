Results from studies such as DESTINY‐Breast03 [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 Case Report A 45‐year‐old patient with metastatic breast cancer, without prior history of myopathy, underwent modified radical mastectomy for left breast cancer in November 2017 (pT2N1M0, stage IIB). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated estrogen receptor (ER)‐positive, progesterone receptor (PR)‐positive, and HER2‐positive (IHC 3+) status. Postoperatively, she received 4 cycles of epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide, followed by 4 cycles of paclitaxel with trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy. After completing radiotherapy, she continued 1‐year maintenance therapy with trastuzumab plus toremifene, subsequently maintaining toremifene monotherapy for 2 years. From December 2021 to April 2024, she developed metastatic disease in the left supraclavicular lymph nodes followed by left chest wall recurrence. Immunohistochemistry revealed: ER (40%, positive), PR (10%, positive), HER2 (IHC 2+ with negative FISH). Subsequent treatments included: 6 cycles of chemotherapy with carboplatin plus albumin‐bound paclitaxel, endocrine therapy with fulvestrant plus exemestane and goserelin, 8 cycles of chemotherapy with liposomal paclitaxel, maintenance therapy with capecitabine. Drug‐related adverse reactions primarily presented as myelosuppression, which reached grade IV severity at its worst. Creatine kinase (CK) levels remained within normal limits, and no manifestations of myalgia were observed. In May 2024, she developed disease progression with metastasis to the right supraclavicular lymph node and cervical lymph nodes. Immunohistochemistry revealed ER (1%+), PR negative, HER2 (IHC 2+ with negative FISH). The physician initiated chemotherapy with eribulin. However, CA 15‐3 levels continued to rise, and the lymph nodes increased in size compared to previous scans. Consequently, the treatment regimen was changed to trastuzumab deruxtecan (T‐DXd). Prior to T‐DXd initiation, the patient's baseline CK level was 160 U/L. Following the first cycle of T‐DXd (5.4 mg/kg), CK rose significantly to 1755 U/L (Figure 1A 1A 1B 1 FIGURE 1 (A) Longitudinal monitoring of serum CK and LDH levels.

For the second cycle, the T‐DXd dose was reduced to 4.4 mg/kg. One week after administration, the patient developed dysphagia and generalized myalgia, predominantly in the lower limbs (Grade 3 myalgia). CK peaked at 1651 U/L (Figure 1A 1A 1B 2A 2B FIGURE 2 Axial T2‐weighted MRI of the lumbosacral region. (A) High‐signal edema in subcutaneous soft tissues (arrow).

After 8 days of supportive therapy, CK decreased to 539 U/L (Figure 1A 1A 1A 3 Discussion Severe drug‐induced myopathy associated with trastuzumab T‐DXd is systematically reported here for the first time. T‐DXd comprises an anti‐HER2 antibody, cleavable linker, and topoisomerase‐I inhibitor DXd [ 11 6 1 3A 12 13 14 7 15 Mechanism on drug‐induced myopathy propose two primary pathogenic mechanisms: direct myofiber injury (e.g., mitochondrial or cytoskeletal damage) and immunologically mediated myopathy [ 8 16 2 Based on the phenotypic features of myopathy in this case, we performed a literature analysis to investigate the pathogenesis of T‐DXd‐induced myopathy. Current evidence suggests xenobiotic myotoxicity correlates with intracellular generation of superoxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide [ 17 18 19 20 18 19 20 18 19 20 Irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, and its bioactive metabolite SN‐38 promote oxidative stress accumulation and trigger DNA damage in colorectal carcinoma cells [ 21 22 23 24 25 3 26 27 2 Following T‐DXd therapy, this patient developed elevated creatine kinase (CK 1755 U/L) and myalgia progressing to grade III, necessitating urgent therapeutic intervention. Existing evidence indicates that severe drug‐induced myopathy may culminate in rhabdomyolysis. When CK > 1000 U/L, the risk of renal injury significantly increases [ 28 29 Current standard therapeutic approach consists primarily of glucocorticoid‐based immunosuppressive therapy [ 9 10 Integrating the observed biomarker elevations (CK/AST), we pursued an oxidative stress‐driven therapeutic approach for this case. A single‐center prospective randomized controlled trial demonstrated that magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate effectively prevents chemotherapy‐induced liver injury from oxaliplatin and capecitabine/5‐FU, reducing hepatic aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels [ 30 31 32 33 34 35 33 34 34 36 37 The patient's biomarker profile—marked CK/AST elevation with incipient ALT rise—suggests glutathione plus magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate represents a mechanistically rational therapeutic approach with anticipated clinical efficacy. We administered the antioxidant agents glutathione and magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate to the patient, along with hydration and urinary alkalinization using sodium bicarbonate. Urinary alkalinization with sodium bicarbonate was implemented to mitigate the risk of myoglobinuric acute kidney injury (AKI) secondary to potential myoglobin precipitation. Through the supportive regimen, we observed: (1) effective reduction in serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, (2) favorable trends in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values, and (3) alleviation of myalgia. The renal function remained stable within normal limits in this case. Based on these findings, we propose that glutathione and magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate may play a significant role in managing T‐DXd However, a critical caveat emerged: CK rebound occurred after discontinuation of supportive therapy, likely attributable to T‐DXd's prolonged half‐life and tissue retention effects [ 38 3.1 Limitations Statement This single‐center case report has inherent limitations: uncontrolled design prevents confounder adjustment, limited follow‐up precludes long‐term assessment, and small sample size restricts generalizability. Findings should be considered hypothesis‐generating requiring RCT validation. Author Contributions Treatment: Zhen Qiao, LiuDan Li, and Hong Wang. Financial support: LiTong Ye and Zhen Qiao.
