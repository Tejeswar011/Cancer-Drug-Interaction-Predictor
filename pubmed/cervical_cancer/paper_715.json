We evaluated the comparative prognostic performance of two staging systems—the 2009 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system and revised 2023 FIGO classification—to determine their respective abilities to predict patient outcomes across different histological subtypes. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 472 patients with early-stage disease. Our findings demonstrated that the 2023 system exhibited superior prognostic discrimination for nonaggressive histological subtypes, whereas the 2009 system showed better predictive capacity for aggressive tumor types. Additionally, we evaluated a hypothetical modification of the FIGO 2023 staging system, which demonstrated enhanced prediction of disease recurrence in high-risk cases. These results support the implementation of histology-specific staging approaches and highlight the need for further refinement in aggressive tumor stratification.

Introduction The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system serves as the cornerstone for endometrial cancer classification and treatment planning. The 2009 staging system established an anatomically based framework, primarily relying on myometrial invasion depth as the principal staging determinant [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 To address these recognized deficiencies, the FIGO introduced a comprehensive revision of the endometrial cancer staging system in 2023, representing a paradigm shift toward a more biologically informed classification approach [ 5 7 8 5 9 Despite its theoretical advantages, the implementation of the FIGO 2023 system has been the subject of considerable debate [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Given these considerations, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic performance of the FIGO 2023 staging system in a cohort of patients with early-stage endometrial cancer (stages I–II) from a single institution. Through a comparative analysis of survival outcomes between the FIGO 2009 and 2023 systems, we sought to determine whether integrating histological subtypes, LVSI status, and myometrial invasion offers superior prognostic stratification to the traditional anatomy-based approach. Additionally, we explored a potential modification of the FIGO 2023 staging system for aggressive tumors to determine whether further anatomical sub-classification can enhance prognostic discrimination. Our investigation builds upon recent analyses of the FIGO 2023 schema [ 9 19 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Population This retrospective cohort study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, which waived the requirement for informed consent. Between January 2004 and December 2019, we systematically identified 870 patients with suspected endometrial cancer who underwent evaluation and treatment at our institution. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) pathologically confirmed endometrial cancer, (2) availability of complete clinical and histopathological data required for staging assessment, and (3) adequate electronic medical record documentation. Patients were excluded if they lacked sufficient pathological documentation that precluded accurate staging assessments or if they had inconclusive pathological diagnoses (n = 345). After applying these criteria, 525 patients with confirmed endometrial cancer were identified. For this comparative staging analysis, we further restricted the cohort to those with early-stage disease (FIGO 2009 stages I–II), resulting in the exclusion of 53 patients with advanced-stage disease (FIGO 2009 stage III, n = 44; stage IV, n = 9). The final study cohort comprised 472 patients with early-stage endometrial cancer ( Figure 1 2.2. Histopathological Assessment All included patients underwent primary surgical treatment, and histopathological evaluations were performed independently by three board-certified pathologists with subspecialty expertise in gynecological pathology to ensure diagnostic accuracy and consistency. Standardized pathological parameters were systematically evaluated for each case, including myometrial invasion depth (categorized as no invasion, <50% invasion, or ≥50% invasion), histological subtype, presence and extent of LVSI, and cervical stromal invasion (CSI). LVSI was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin staining and classified as present or absent [ 20 2.3. Staging Systems and Data Collection Data of comprehensive demographic and clinicopathological variables, including age, menopausal status, tumor size, and recurrence patterns, were systematically extracted from electronic medical records. All patients were retrospectively restaged according to the FIGO 2009 and 2023 staging criteria to enable a direct comparative analysis. Under the FIGO 2009 system, early-stage endometrial carcinoma is defined purely by tumor extent: Stage I tumors are confined to the uterus (IA for <50% myometrial invasion; IB for ≥50% invasion), and stage II indicates cervical stromal involvement [ 1 5 5 The primary analytical objective of this comparative study was to evaluate the prognostic discriminatory capacity of the histological dichotomous classification, which represents a fundamental modification of the FIGO 2023 system. For this assessment, patients were stratified into the following two histological groups: nonaggressive and aggressive subtypes. This stratification approach enabled an unbiased comparison of the prognostic classification performance between the two staging systems for histologically homogeneous subgroups. As a secondary, exploratory objective, we developed a hypothetical modification of the FIGO 2023 system to investigate potential refinements in the staging of aggressive histological subtypes. This exploratory schema, based on the hypothesis that anatomical progression remains clinically relevant within aggressive histological subtypes, introduced anatomical progression-based substaging for patients with aggressive histological types: stage IC for tumors confined to the endometrium without myometrial invasion, stage IIC1 for tumors with <50% myometrial invasion, stage IIC2 for tumors with >50% myometrial invasion, and stage IIC3 for tumors with CSI. This modified classification system was designed to test the hypothesis that enhanced substaging could improve prognostic stratification within the aggressive tumor subtype category. Of note, this modified schema was entirely hypothetical, does not constitute part of any official FIGO staging system, and was employed exclusively for exploratory analysis in this study. 2.4. Outcome Definitions The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). OS was defined as the time from initial diagnosis to death from any cause or the date of the last clinical follow-up for patients who remain alive. RFS was defined as the time from primary surgery to the first documented recurrence or the last follow-up date for patients without recurrence. Disease recurrence was defined using standardized criteria: biopsy-confirmed disease recurrence or new focal findings on postoperative computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggestive of malignancy, as confirmed by multidisciplinary team review. Patients with postoperative imaging abnormalities confirmed to be pathologically or clinically benign were considered recurrence-free. Recurrence patterns were systematically classified as locoregional or distant recurrence, based on the anatomical site of the first recurrence. Locoregional recurrence was defined as occurrence within the pelvis, such as vaginal and pelvic recurrence involving pelvic lymph nodes and local extension to the rectum and bladder. Distant recurrence included extrapelvic disease, including peritoneal carcinomatosis; omental metastasis; distant metastases to the lung, liver, bone, and brain; and extrapelvic lymph node involvement. 2.5. Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics were calculated to summarize patient and tumor characteristics. Categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages, while continuous variables were reported as means ± standard deviations and medians with interquartile ranges. The primary analytical approach used Kaplan–Meier survival analysis with log-rank testing to evaluate and compare OS and RFS distributions across staging systems and histological subgroups. Survival curves were constructed for each staging system within histological subgroups, and statistical significance was assessed using the log-rank test. To identify independent prognostic factors, we used univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models, stratified by histological aggressiveness. Variables that achieved statistical significance ( p p 3. Results 3.1. Baseline Characteristics A total of 472 patients were enrolled in this study. Table 1 3.2. Survival Outcomes by Histological Subgroup (FIGO 2009 vs. 2023) Comparative survival analyses stratified by histopathological aggressiveness revealed differential prognostic performance between the FIGO staging systems across the nonaggressive and aggressive endometrial cancer subgroups. For patients with nonaggressive histological subtypes, the FIGO 2009 staging system demonstrated significant prognostic discrimination for OS (log-rank p p Figure 2 Conversely, the FIGO 2023 system achieved significant prognostic stratification for both OS and RFS in patients with nonaggressive histological subtypes (log-rank p p Figure 3 For patients with aggressive histological subtypes, the FIGO 2009 staging system maintained significant prognostic discrimination for RFS (log-rank p p Figure 4 In contrast, the FIGO 2023 system demonstrated no significant stratification for either survival endpoint (both p Figure 5 Of note, the hypothetical modification of the FIGO 2023 staging system demonstrated improved discriminatory capacity for RFS (log-rank p p Figure 6 Overall, our findings demonstrate that the relative prognostic performance of the FIGO staging system is dependent on histology. The FIGO 2023 system provides notably improved risk stratification for nonaggressive (low-grade) endometrial cancers but shows substantially diminished prognostic utility for aggressive (high-grade) subtypes. Conversely, the FIGO 2009 system retains some discriminatory capacity for aggressive cancers, particularly regarding recurrence risk. The improved RFS stratification observed with the exploratory FIGO 2023 modification in aggressive cancers warrants further investigation and remains unvalidated. The consistent lack of OS stratification across all staging systems for aggressive histological subtypes highlights the need for additional prognostic factors beyond anatomical staging in this patient population. Among patients with combined subtypes, OS and RFS analyses based on the FIGO 2009 staging system revealed a statistically significant stage-based stratification across stages (both log-rank p Figure 7 The FIGO 2023 staging system demonstrated a statistically significant stage-based stratification for both OS and RFS across stages (both log-rank p Figure 8 3.3. Prognostic Factors Stratified by Histological Subtype (Nonaggressive vs. Aggressive) Table 2 Table 3 p p p Table 2 Regarding the prognostic factors for OS, stratified analysis yielded histology-specific results. For patients with nonaggressive histological subtypes, univariate analysis revealed four significant factors associated with reduced OS: advanced age (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.03–1.12; p p p p p p p p p Table 3 These analyses revealed distinct histology-specific prognostic patterns: nonaggressive endometrial cancers demonstrated sensitivity to both LVSI and patient age for both survival endpoints, while aggressive cancers showed predominant dependence on anatomical extension (CSI) for recurrence risk and patient age for OS. These distinct prognostic factor profiles between the histological subgroups underscore the importance of conducting separate analyses for nonaggressive and aggressive endometrial cancers. 4. Discussion The most significant advancements in the FIGO 2023 staging system for endometrial cancer include the introduction of categorization based on molecular and histopathological data, including distinguishing between nonaggressive and aggressive subtypes, introducing LVSI as a staging criterion, and redefining the absence of myometrial invasion as a distinct prognostic factor [ 10 21 22 23 10 24 10 21 Our comparative analysis revealed differential prognostic performances between the two staging systems across histological subtypes. For nonaggressive tumors, the 2009 FIGO system provided significant prognostic discrimination for OS but not for RFS. Conversely, the FIGO 2023 system achieved a consistent prognostic separation for both endpoints, suggesting improved risk stratification. Intermediate stage categories under the 2023 system showed elevated HR (e.g., IB—HR: 3.30 [95% CI: 0.91–12.00]; IIA—HR: 8.52 [95% CI: 0.85–85.92]), although not all comparisons reached statistical significance. These findings indicate a trend toward better prognostic alignment under the revised framework, even in the absence of strong pairwise significance. These results align with the findings of Matsuo et al., who documented a wider OS difference and clearer outcome separation under the new system as well as with the results of a recent international analysis that demonstrated improved 5-year RFS for stage I patients under the FIGO 2023 [ 9 19 10 25 26 10 21 25 27 28 An additional noteworthy modification of the 2023 FIGO staging system is the subdivision of stage I into IA1 and IA2 based on the presence or absence of myometrial invasion. However, prior studies have reported comparable survival outcomes between patients with the IA1 and IA2 disease subtypes [ 19 In contrast to the improved performance observed in nonaggressive tumors, both staging systems showed notable limitations when applied to aggressive histological subtypes. While FIGO 2009 exhibited significant RFS stratification ( p p p p 18 Multivariate analysis revealed histology-specific prognostic determinants, further supporting the rationale for differentiated staging approaches. Cox regression analysis identified distinct prognostic profiles based on histological findings. For patients with nonaggressive tumors, older age and LVSI independently predicted both OS and RFS, highlighting the sensitivity of low-grade disease outcomes to these pathological variables. Conversely, CSI was the primary predictor of recurrence risk in patients with aggressive tumors, while age was the sole independent factor for OS [ 29 18 30 31 32 33 34 35 Another important consideration is the role of imaging in preoperative staging of the disease. Imaging remains central to treatment planning and surgical decision making. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) and MRI demonstrate comparable diagnostic performance when all patients with endometrial cancer are considered; however, for patients with low-grade tumors, MRI provides superior specificity to TVS [ 36 37 This study has some limitations that warrant consideration. First, its retrospective design precluded the inclusion of molecular classification, a critical component of the FIGO 2023 system. Given that molecular subtypes are crucial for prognosis and treatment planning, their absence may compromise staging accuracy [ 38 5. Conclusions The FIGO 2023 system for endometrial cancer marks a significant advancement over the 2009 classification by incorporating histopathological subtypes and the prognostic significance of LVSI. This integration enhances risk stratification, especially in early-stage disease; however, studies of long-term clinical outcomes are needed to validate this system and support its clinical utility.
