Therefore, we aimed to investigate the influence of the COVID‐19 pandemic on gastric cancer management in Japan using real‐world data from the Tokushukai Real‐World Data project. Methods and Results This retrospective cohort study was conducted across 46 Tokushukai Medical Group hospitals in Japan, identifying patients newly diagnosed with gastric cancer between January 2017 and December 2022. Patients with active double cancers or non‐epithelial tumors were excluded. We used data between January 2017 and March 2020 as the baseline (pre‐COVID‐19 period) to assess the changes in the number of diagnoses, screening detections, disease stage at diagnosis, and prognosis between April 2020 and December 2022 (mid‐COVID‐19 period). This study included 14 125 patients with 14 446 gastric cancer cases. Compared with the pre‐COVID‐19 period, the mid‐COVID‐19 period exhibited a 12% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3%–20%) decrease in screening detections, a 9% (95% CI: 1%–18%) increase in metastatic stage detection, a 14% (95% CI: 7%–20%) decrease in curative surgery, and a 32% (95% CI: 19%–43%) decrease in radiation therapy. The analysis also revealed a 9.4% (95% CI: 2.0%–17.2%) increase in mortality in the mid‐COVID‐19 period compared with the pre‐COVID‐19 period. Conclusion This nationwide, real‐world study provides robust evidence that COVID‐19 has reduced survival rates for Japanese patients with gastric cancer by disrupting diagnosis and treatment. cancer care COVID‐19 gastric cancer real‐world JSPS KAKENHI Grant JP24K13480 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:03.10.2025  R.

In Japan, an analysis of cancer registry data reported a 12%–14% decrease in gastric cancer diagnoses and a 14% decrease in resections by 2020 [ 18 19 20 21 Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on diagnosis, treatment outcomes, and prognosis of Japanese patients with gastric cancer using large‐scale real‐world data from the Tokushukai Medical Database. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Data Source This nationwide Japanese retrospective cohort study was part of the Tokushukai Real‐World Data (TREAD) project [ 22 Eligible patients included those with newly diagnosed gastric cancer at one of the 46 Tokushukai Medical Group hospitals (14 829 beds), identified using data integrated from the electronic medical record system (e‐Karte and Newtons2; Software Service Inc., Osaka, Japan), chemotherapy protocols (srvApmDrop; Software Service Inc., Osaka, Japan), national cancer registry data [ 23 24 25 23 Furthermore, the number of patients with COVID‐19 during the study period (collected via data tracked under the Infectious Diseases Control Law) was aggregated based on reports from the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare to compare the infection status nationwide [ 26 27 26 2.2 Data Collection Demographic data (age, sex, last confirmed survival date, and survival outcomes) were retrieved from medical records. Diagnostic information (diagnosis date, detection process, diagnostic facility, pathology, and stage) and treatment information (surgery, endoscopic procedures, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy) were sourced from hospital‐based cancer registry data. Cancer information is registered in the National Cancer Registry and simultaneously recorded in the Tokushukai Medical Database, which we utilized in this study. Cancer diagnosis dates were defined according to the National Cancer Registry standards: [ 23 28 29 30 Hospitals were classified as high‐volume if they enrolled at least 5% (674 cases) of the total cases and low‐volume if they enrolled fewer than 5% of the cases. Hospital types were categorized as government‐ and prefecture‐designated cancer treatment hospitals and general hospitals. Hospital urbanization was classified into megalopolis, urban, and rural areas based on the data collected by prefecture/secondary medical regions published by the Japan Medical Association Research Institute [ 31 Curative treatment was defined as gastrectomy with lymph node dissection for stage 0–III patients, whereas endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection were considered radical treatments for stage 0–I patients. 2.3 Statistical Analysis Basic statistical analyses were conducted to summarize the distribution of patient background factors. Categorical variables are reported as calculated numbers and proportions, while continuous variables are reported as medians and ranges. Patients with non‐epithelial tumors were excluded from the diagnostic analysis, and those with active double cancers were excluded from the survival analysis. The primary aim of our survival analysis was to describe OS across pandemic phases, rather than to identify independent prognostic factors. Therefore, univariable Cox regression was performed. Adjustment for covariates such as stage or hospital type, which are strongly associated with disease severity and healthcare access, could obscure the effect of the pandemic itself and could lead to overadjustment. For this reason, additional covariate adjustment was not undertaken. The incidence ratio of patients during the pre‐COVID‐19 period (January 2017 to March 2020) and the mid‐COVID‐19 period (April 2020 to December 2022) was calculated for the incidence rate ratio (IRR) analysis. A Poisson regression model was used to analyze the differences between the two periods. Assuming a Poisson distribution for eligible patients, months within each COVID‐19 period (pre‐COVID‐19, mid‐COVID‐19, on‐wave, off‐wave) were treated as constants. The average number of patients per month, reflecting the number of incidences per unit time rather than strictly incidence rates based on person‐years, was assessed as an IRR. Confidence intervals (CIs) and p A survival analysis was performed to compare mortality rates across different COVID‐19 periods. The study included individuals with recorded survival times who did not have concurrent active double cancer between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2022. The endpoint was OS, defined as the time from a diagnosis to death from any cause, with survivors censored at the date of last contact. Notably, as OS captures all‐cause mortality, competing events do not arise. The results of the Kaplan–Meier (KM) curves and univariate Cox regression were considered the primary analyses. KM curves were used to compare the OS between the groups based on COVID‐19 status. Furthermore, COVID‐19 status was used as a prognostic factor in the Cox proportional hazards model. KM estimates were used to calculate mortality rates at 30 days, 90 days, 1 year, and 2 years for each COVID‐19 subgroup for secondary analyses. The CIs for these estimates were calculated using the variance in survival probabilities based on Greenwood's formula. All analyses were conducted using the statistical software R (version 4.0.3, Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Two‐sided statistical tests were conducted, and p 3 Ethics Approval This study was performed in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. This study's approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Tokushukai Medical Group (Approval Number: TGE01427 4 Results The study cohort included 14 125 patients with newly diagnosed gastric cancer between 2017 and 2022, resulting in 14 346 cases when accounting for multiple occurrences (Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Patient flow diagram. 4.1  COVID The status of the COVID‐19 pandemic in Japan is shown in Figure S1 4.2 Patient Characteristics In total, 13 327 patients (13 474 cases) were newly diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma.

A similar comparison of the pre‐COVID‐19, on‐wave, and off‐wave periods is presented in Online Resources 1 and 2. During the on‐wave period, the number of gastric cancer diagnoses, localized cases, curative surgeries, systemic therapy sessions, and radiotherapy decreased significantly. In contrast, during the off‐wave period, gastric cancer diagnoses and localized cases increased, along with the frequency of endoscopic procedures. However, the number of detection screenings, curative surgeries, systemic therapy, and radiotherapy sessions did not return to pre‐COVID‐19 levels. Notably, radiotherapy remained 33% (95% CI: 14%–48%) lower in the mid‐COVID‐19 period than that in the pre‐COVID‐19 period, while metastatic disease detection increased by 20% (95% CI: 8%–32%), even during the off‐wave period. 4.6 Overall Mortality in Gastric Cancer Cases KM curves for mortality in gastric cancer cases ( n 3 p p p 4 FIGURE 3 Kaplan–Meier curves of mortality in gastric adenocarcinoma cases.

In the off‐wave period, a general increase was observed during the pre‐COVID‐19 period. However, the screening, curative surgery, or systemic therapy rates did not recover compared with those in the pre‐COVID‐19 period. Moreover, it may be difficult to make accurate comparisons between the on‐wave and off‐wave periods, as some patients are thought to have been affected by the waves in diagnosis but not in treatment, with other patients straddling both periods. Several studies have investigated the negative impact of COVID‐19 on cancer diagnosis and treatment. An Italian study showed changes in the diagnoses of lung, colorectal, and breast cancers in 2019 before the onset of COVID‐19 compared to those in 2020, when COVID‐19 began. Particularly, the newly diagnosed lung cancer cases showed a decreasing trend [ 11 13 14 17 21 15 The decrease in screening examinations may have influenced the decrease in diagnoses. A French study examining the differences in screening, diagnosis, and treatment between 2019 and 2020 found an 86% decrease in fecal occult blood testing for colorectal cancer and a 100% decrease in mammography for breast cancer screening between April 2019 and April 2020 [ 16 32 32 19 20 18 20 The reduction in screening examinations likely affected the initial staging of cancer diagnoses. An Italian study showed a significant increase in stage IV lung cancer cases [ 12 13 14 20 Additionally, our cohort demonstrated significant reductions in curative surgery and radiotherapy and a non‐significant reduction in systemic therapy during the mid‐COVID‐19 period compared to the pre‐COVID‐19 period, which is consistent with previous studies. A study using the Japanese Cancer Registry reported a 14.1%, 9.2%, and 9.3% statistically significant decrease in resection cases from 2016 to 2019 to 2020 for gastric and colon cancers, respectively [ 19 17 To date, studies on the impact of COVID‐19 on cancer care survival are limited. A United Kingdom population‐based modeling study reported that the COVID‐19 pandemic was predicted to increase breast, colon, and esophageal cancer mortality by 7.9%–9.6%, 15.3%–16.6%, and 5.8%–6.0%, respectively [ 21 33 Consistent with these findings, our real‐world study demonstrated a 9.4% increase in mortality among Japanese patients with gastric cancer during the mid‐COVID‐19 period compared to the pre‐COVID‐19 period. This occurred despite the approval of first‐line combination chemotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor in Japan in November 2021, which reportedly improves survival outcomes. Although the causes of death included both cancer and COVID‐19, our study demonstrated that the decrease in screening diagnoses, increase in distant metastasis cases, and reduction in curative surgeries may have ultimately worsened mortality. Nonetheless, this study had some limitations, such as missing data owing to patient transfers from unregistered hospitals, resulting in incomplete comprehensive treatment history and prognosis information in certain cases. In addition, the short follow‐up period for mid‐COVID cases limits any reference to the impact on long‐term survival. Furthermore, information on COVID‐19 variants and vaccination status at the patient level was not available in our dataset. However, nationwide data exhibit sequential Alpha–Delta–Omicron waves and the progressive rollout of vaccination beginning in 2021 [ 34 However, for the first time, we provide concrete evidence of reduced survival directly caused by COVID‐19, supported by comprehensive data analysis on cancer treatment and survival linked to individual patient records, using the most recent data available up to December 2022. Consequently, further studies extending beyond 2023 are warranted, along with similar analyses for the recommended cancer screenings in Japan, such as those for colorectal and breast cancers. In conclusion, our nationwide real‐world retrospective study demonstrated the significant negative impacts of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of Japanese patients with gastric cancer. The data from this study provide crucial insights into cancer screening and treatment during future pandemics. Consent The authors have nothing to report.
