Introduction Since ancient times, wood mushrooms have served both as a food source and as remedies for conditions such as cancer, inflammation, and immune system disorders—especially within traditional Far Eastern medicine [ 1 2 3 A prominent representative of the group of medicinal mushrooms in Europe is Inonotus obliquus I. obliquus 4 Inonotus nidus-pici Inonotus Quercus cerris 1 1 5 Unlike Chaga, there are almost no data in the literature on phytochemical compounds in I. nidus-pici 1 Therefore, we aimed to investigate the phytochemical composition and potential biological effects (i.e., anti-ulcer and antioxidant activities) of the enriched phenolic extracts from this species. 2. Results The analysis of the phenolic fraction began with the study of its phytochemical composition and the identification of some important phenolic compounds. Furthermore, the phenolic-enriched fraction demonstrated antioxidant effects as well as anti-ulcer potential in experimental animals. 2.1. Spectrophotometric Analysis of Main Phenolic Compounds Initially, the amount of main phenolic compounds in the mushroom-tested sample was measured to focus our attention on the relevant groups of biologically active substances with presumed value. The amount of water-soluble phenolic compounds and tannins was expressed as pyrogallol equivalent (in % dry-weight mass of substances). The I. nidus-pici Figure 1 2.2. HPLC Analysis of Flavonoid and Phenolic Acid Profiles in EPE (Enriched Phenolic Extract) from the Dry-Weight Extract (DWE) Quercetin was better represented as aglycone (15.95 ± 0.05 mg/g DWE), followed by kaempferol (1.67 ± 0.09 mg/g DWE). At the same time, the quantity of the glycosides hesperidin and rutin was significantly lower (0.83 ± 0.03 mg/g DWE and 0.44 ± 0.14 mg/g DWE, respectively). Of the other detected flavonoid compounds, the flavan-3-ol (+)-catechin occurred in higher quantity (9.86 ± 0.15 mg/g DWE), while (−)-epicatechin was not identified in the present analysis. Ten phenolic acids were identified in the enriched phenolic extract (EPE) from the investigated fungus. The highest concentration was established only for rosmarinic acid (6.41 ± 0.08 mg/g DWE) and somewhat for p Table 1 Figure 2 2.3. Antioxidant Capacity of EPE Four in vitro assays ( Table 2 •+ •+ The established high content of some individual phenols may explain the demonstrated powerful antioxidant effect of the extract. 2.4. Macroscopic Evaluation of Gastric Ulcers No gastric ulcers were observed in the control group, while in the Indomethacin group, extensive gastric ulcers were detected. The macroscopic evaluation shows that phenols (in the investigated EPE), isolated from Inonotus nidus-pici The ulcer index (UI) for all groups and the percentage of protection (PP) for pretreated groups (III, IV, and V) were calculated to assess the severity of mucosal lesions. The results are shown in Table 3 2.5. Histological Analysis of Gastric Ulcers Histopathological examination of hematoxylin–eosin-stained longitudinal sections from the control group (Group I) revealed normal gastric histoarchitecture, with intact surface epithelium, well-preserved foveolar and glandular zones, and no evidence of inflammatory infiltrates or hemorrhage. Conversely, gastric sections from the indomethacin-treated group (Group II) demonstrated significant mucosal injury, including widespread epithelial cell degeneration, surface erosions, and focal areas of hemorrhage (deposits of hemosiderin), which are indicative of acute inflammation ( Figure 3 Groups IV and V, pretreated with catechins isolated from Inonotus nidus-pici Figure 4 3. Discussion Most current studies on the species Inonotus nidus-pici 1 Data on phenolic components are available for a related and widely studied species, I. obliquus O 6 7 8 9 10 11 p 6 6 7 7 8 7 9 7 4 7 6 7 11 11 4 In the only study, to date, by Garádi et al. (2021), an antioxidant effect for I. nidus-pici •+ 1 As pointed out above, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and many other phenols were primary contributors to the antioxidant potential of I. obliquus 11 6 7 9 11 A low antioxidant capacity was mentioned for another Inonotus I. hipidus 12 13 The reported antiulcerogenic effects are the first to be measured with an EPE extract from the mushroom in our study, in which methanol was used as the initial extractant. The anti-ulcer activity of I. nidus-pici 14 I. obliquus Ern et al. (2024), in their review article, discussed the effects of the closest fungi relative of the genus Chaga on gastrointestinal problems through various applications [ 11 2 Despite the lack of clear information about the exact mechanism by which various Chaga extracts act on gastrointestinal diseases, and after careful analysis of the available scientific information in the article of Ern et al. (2024), we can infer that this is likely due to some of the following mechanisms [ 11 - Anti-inflammatory effect associated with a reduction in the expression of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) involved in gastrointestinal inflammation. Similar patterns have been observed in colitis, suggesting a role in alleviating conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). - Antioxidant properties due to complexes of terpenoids and phenols, which show significant antioxidant effects. They help reduce oxidative stress and protect the gastrointestinal mucosa from damage. - The anticancer properties of Chaga point to its use in treating cancers, especially colorectal cancer. Compounds such as ergosterol show similar activity, inhibiting the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells and inducing apoptosis. Another ethnopharmacological study demonstrated the antiulcerogenic properties of the other abovementioned species of this genus— Inonotus hispidus 15 As can be seen from the examples supporting our scientific hypothesis, there is a general lack of robust experimental evidence for the potential health benefits of using Inonotus 4. Materials and Methods The examined sterile conks of fungi Inonotus nidus-pici Quercus cerris All used substances in spectrophotometric and HPLC analysis, indomethacin, and famotidine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany). 4.1. Spectrophotometric Analysis 4.1.1. Spectrophotometric Quantification of Total Phenols and Tannins The determination of phenolic metabolites, including total polyphenols and tannins, was performed according to the European Pharmacopoeia 10 [ 16 4.1.2. Spectrophotometric Quantification of Flavonoids The content of the flavonoids was determined spectrophotometrically at 420 nm by creating a complex with AlCl 3 16 4.1.3. Spectrophotometric Quantification of Phenolic Acids The total hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives in the material were determined again according to the European Pharmacopoeia 10 [ 16 4.2. Extraction Method for the Enrichment of Phenolic Extract (EPE) from Substances Dried and ground substances were extracted with methanol in a 1:10 ( w v 17 4.3. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Analysis of Flavonoids and Phenolic Acids from Enriched Phenol Extract (EPE) High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of phenolic acids and flavonoids was performed by using Waters 1525 Binary Pump HPLC systems (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), equipped with a Waters 2484 dual Absorbance Detector (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and a Supelco Discovery HS C18 column (5 μm, 25 cm × 4.6 mm), operated under the control of Breeze 3.30 software. Detailed conditions of HPLC analyses have been reported previously [ 18 4.4. Antioxidant Activity The antioxidant capacity determined from all assays is expressed in millimoles of Trolox equivalent (TE) per gram of dry-weight extract (DWE). A calibration curve was created using Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) in methanol, with concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 mmol. 4.4.1. ABTS Assay The ability of the extracts to scavenge ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) radicals was evaluated following the procedure in [ 19 •+ •+ •+ 4.4.2. DPPH Assay The antioxidant activity of the investigated extracts against DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals was estimated as 0.15 mL of the extract, and 2.85 mL of a freshly prepared 0.1 mmol DPPH solution in methanol was added. After incubating the mixture at 37 °C in darkness for 15 min, absorption was measured at 517 nm, with methanol serving as the reference [ 19 20 4.4.3. CUPRAC Assay The CUPRAC (Cupric Reducing Antioxidant Capacity) assay was conducted according the following procedure: the assay solution was a combination of 1 mL of a 10 mmol CuCl 2 19 21 4.4.4. FRAP Assay The Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) assay was carried out following the following method: the freshly prepared FRAP reagent was by mixing 10 parts of a 0.3 M acetate buffer (pH 3.6), 1 part of a 10 mmol solution of 2,4,6-tripyridyl-s-triazine (TPTZ, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) in 40 mmol HCl (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and 1 part of a 20 mmol FeCl 3 2 19 22 4.5. Animals This study was performed on 30 male Wistar rats weighing 200–220 g. The animals were obtained from the vivarium of the Medical University, Varna, Bulgaria. The animals were housed in stainless steel cages at 23 ± 2 °C in a well-ventilated room on a 12 h light/dark cycle. Rats had free access to standard rat chow and water. The humidity of the room was 50 ± 10%. All experimental procedures were performed between 8 and 10 a.m. The acclimatization of the animals was performed for one week. This study was carried out in accordance with the national requirements for the protection and humane treatment of laboratory animals, complying with Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. The performed experimental procedures were approved by the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency (Document № 175). 4.5.1. Experimental Design Rats were randomly divided into five groups of six animals each (n = 6). All chemicals, as well as EPE isolated from Inonotus nidus-pici 4.5.2. Macroscopic Evaluation of Gastric Ulcers Macroscopic assessment of gastric tissue was performed, and the number of gastric ulcers was determined. The severity of ulcer lesions was assessed through a score, as follows: 0 = no damage; 1 = blood at the lumen; 2 = pinpoint erosions; 3 = one to five small erosions < 2 mm; 4 = more than five small erosions < 2 mm; 5 = one or three large erosions > 2 mm; and 6 = more than three large erosions > 2 mm [ 23 19 24 4.5.3. Histopathological Evaluation of Gastric Mucosal Injury The stomachs of all animals were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, separated into 4 µm thick slices using a rotary microtome, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). A minimum of six fields from each stomach were examined. The severity of gastric injury was determined by an observer blinded to the animal treatment. All sections were evaluated for structural changes under a Leica DM 1000 LED light microscope and a Leica MC170 HD camera & SW Kit (Leica Microsystems AG, Wetzlar, Germany) and were captured at 200× or 400× magnification using the manufacturer’s software. 4.6. Statistical Analysis All results are expressed as the arithmetic mean ± standard deviation (SD). The presented results are averages from two independent experiments carried out in triplicate. Statistical analysis was conducted with GraphPad Prism version 8.0.1 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Differences between groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s multiple comparison post hoc test; Student’s t-test was also used. Values of p 5.
