Therefore, it was urgent to establish effective prognostic models to guide clinical treatment in glioma. Protein lactylation was discovered in various malignant tumor, but only a few studies on glioma focused on protein lactylation. Methods The expression levels of lactylation-related genes were identified from the TCGA database. A lactylation-related prognostic signature was established using various combinations of 10 different excellent machine learning methods. The prognostic value of the signature was assessed and further validated in the CGGA cohorts. Patients were divided into two groups according to the risk score (RS). Independent prognostic value assessment, pathways enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction analysis were conducted. Finally, we verified the functions of C19orf53 through vitro experiments. Results A robust lactylation-related prognostic signature of low-grade glioma (LGG) was established, which was consisted of 14 genes. Patients with higher RS had poorer clinical outcomes in all the cohorts. More immune-related and pro-cancer pathways were enriched in high-RS subgroup. Moreover, the 14 lactylation-related prognostic genes had close interaction relationships, and 11 of them had independent prognostic value. Vitro experiments proved that shRNA-mediated C19orf53 down-regulation impeded the migration and proliferation of LGG cells. Conclusions The lactylation-related prognostic signature exhibited robust predictive efficiency in LGG, providing a new perspective for the prognosis evaluation of LGG patients and the subsequent studies on therapeutic targets.

But due to their high malignant biological behaviors and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, the therapeutic effects were unsatisfactory and the overall prognosis remained poor [ 9 12 Lactate as a product of anaerobic metabolism, significantly enriched in the tumor microenvironment, but its physiological and non-metabolic functions in tumors were still unclear [ 13 14 15 21 19 20 As for gliomas, lactate was a key component of the hypoxic niches within gliomas [ 22 23 24 25 26 27 Therefore, in this study, we constructed a robust lactylation-related prognostic model by integrate existing glioma public data from TCGA and CGGA databases and the published lactate-related gene sets. Our model demonstrated a satisfactory predictive accuracy on the prognosis of LGG patients, providing a direction for future research on protein lactylation in glioma. In addition, our study firstly revealed that C19orf53 can be a high value potential therapy target, whose down-regulation can significantly impede LGG cells migration and proliferation. Materials and methods Data acquisition and processing The glimoa patients’ clinical information and mRNA sequencing data of TCGA-LGG training cohort and TCGA-GBM cohort were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA, https://protal.gdc.cancer.gov/ http://www.cgga.org.cn/ GSE108474 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ https://www.gtexportal.org/ 14 28 29 Samples without detailed survival data and WHO grade were directly omitted. The mRNA sequencing data were standardized using “limma” R package. Genes with an average count value less than 0 were removed, and the data were log2-transformed (value + 1) for further analysis. To explore differentially expressed genes among LGG, GBM and normal brain tissues, we merged the mRNA-sequencing data from TCGA-LGG, TCGA-GBM and GTEx cohorts into a cohort after removing the batch effect using the “sva” R package [ 30 Identification of potential prognostic genes and genes included in machine learning R package “limma v3.40.6” package was used to identified genes that were differentially expressed between normal brain tissue, LGG and GBM, which were considered as the potential prognostic genes of glioma. The criteria for the identification of differentially expressed genes were a false discovery rate < 0.05 and |Fold Change| ≥1.5. Genes, whose expression increased along with the increase of malignant degree of tissues (normal brain tissue - LGG - GBM) were considered as “potential prognostic genes”. The intersection of “potential prognostic genes” and “lactylation-related genes” were chosen for subsequent machine learning. R package “venn” was used for generating venn diagram. K-Means clustering K-means clustering can be used to identify and classify genes with similar expression patterns [ 31 32 Construction and validation of lactylation-related prognostic signature Ten robust machine learning algorithms were chosen for constructing the lactylation-related prognostic signatures for LGG and GBM, respectively, following the methodology provided by representative articles [ 33 34 Kaplan-Meier curves were used to display the differences in overall survival (OS) between the two RS subgroups, and log-rank test were used. The hazard ratio (HR) was employed for evaluating the effect of variable on prognosis. The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted to evaluate the performance of the risk model via R package “timeROC v0.4” and “survival v3.7.0”. Identification of lactylation-related independent prognostic genes Multicollinearity diagnostics was conducted before Multivariate Cox analysis by using R package “car v3.1.3”. If variance inflation factor (VIF) larger than 5 indicated multicollinearity exists [ 35 36 Functional annotation analysis KEGG and GO enrichment analyses were conducted by The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, https://davidbioinformatics.nih.gov https://cn.string-db.org/ Cell culture Human glioma cell lines (Hs683, SW1088, Res186, NCH421K) and normal glial HEB cells were obtained from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Hs683 and SW1088 were chose for subsequent function experiments. Cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO₂. Cells in the logarithmic growth phase at passage 3 were harvested for baseline analysis of C19orf53 expression. Reagents and transfection Lentiviral shRNAs targeting human C19orf53 (sh#1: 5′-GAAGAAGATCGAACATGACGT-3′; sh#2: 5′-CCAGCAATGACCAGGAAGATA-3′) and a scrambled control shRNA (5′-GCAATAGCTAGCATCGTAGAT-3′) were designed and synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Lentiviral transduction was performed using Lipofectamine 3000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with 50 nM shRNA, following the manufacturer’s protocol. Fresh complete medium was replaced 24 h post-transduction. Transduction efficiency was validated through puromycin selection for three weeks (2 µg/mL, 72 h). Knockdown efficiency was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). All procedures complied with Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) guidelines. RNA extraction and qRT-PCR Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (AG, Beijing, China) and treated with DNase I (Evo M-MLV RT PreMix, AG) to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. Reverse transcription was performed using 1 µg of RNA in a 20 µL reaction volume to generate cDNA. qRT-PCR was carried out on a CFX96 Touch system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) under the following cycling conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 30 s. The following primer sequences were used: C19orf53 (Forward: 5′-CCTGGAGATGCTGGAGAAGG-3′, Reverse: 5′-GCTCCTCCAGGTAGTCCTTG-3′) and GAPDH (Forward: 5′-GGAGCGAGATCCCTCCAAAAT-3′, Reverse: 5′-GGCTGTTGTCATACTTCTCATGG-3′). Relative mRNA expression levels were calculated using the 2 − ΔΔCt Cell proliferation assay (CCK-8) Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 10³ cells per well in 96-well plates (Costar, Corning, NY, USA) and incubated for 7 days. At specified time points (Days 1, 2, 3, and 4), 10 µL of CCK-8 solution (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) was added to each well. After 2 h of incubation, the absorbance was measured at 450 nm (with a reference wavelength of 630 nm) using a Synergy H1 microplate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA). Wound healing assay Confluent cell monolayers in 24-well plates (NEST, Wuxi, China) were scratched using a sterile 200 µL pipette tip. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove cellular debris, cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM. Wound closure was monitored at 0 and 48 h using a Nikon TS2R-FL phase-contrast microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) with a 10× objective lens. Statistical analysis Bio-information analyses were performed using R software (version 4.4.0), cytoscape (version 3.7.0) and GSEA software (version 3.0). All experimental data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Pearson’s correlation was used for continuous variables. Statistical significance of experiment was determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test, performed with GraphPad Prism 9.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Acquisition of target genes for machine learning From normal brain tissue to LGG to GBM, the degree of tissue malignancy gradually increased, and the prognosis also gradually deteriorated. Genes, whose expression increased along with the increase of malignant degree of tissues were considered as “potential prognostic genes”. Therefore, we integrated the sample data of normal brain tissue, LGG and GBM in TCGA and GTEx databases for differential expression analysis. By comparing LGG and normal brain tissue, GBM and normal brain tissue, and LGG and GBM, and taking the intersection of the differential expression genes in the three groups of comparisons, we obtained a 2705 biologically meaningful genes with different expression patterns in different tissues (Fig. 1 1 1 1  Fig. 1 A B C D Construction of the lactylation-related prognostic signature The above 41 target genes were incorporated into the model construction by applying different combinations of 10 advanced machine learning algorithms. The result demonstrated that a reliable prognostic model was constructed for LGG using the StepCox[both] + GBM algorithm, which achieved the highest mean C-Index = 0.74 (Fig. 2 2 The predictive capability of lactylation-related prognostic signature To further evaluate the impact of lactylation-related genes on the prognosis of LGG, we divided patients into two groups based on the median RS. Kaplan-Meier curves exhibited that the prognosis of the high-RS subgroup was significantly poorer than that of the low-RS subgroup in all the cohorts, with HRs being 10.24 (5.74–18.29) in TCGA cohort, 4.20 (3.05–5.79) in CGGA1 cohort, 4.58 (2.87–7.30) in CGGA2 cohort and 2.35 (1.47,3.76) in CGGA3 cohort (Fig. 2 2 GSE108474 GSE108474 p  Fig. 2 A B C F G H Potential mechanisms of lactylation-related signature on the prognosis of LGG patients Further analysis revealed that the expression of the genes in lactylation-related signature have positive correlations with each other (Fig. 3 3 3 3  Fig. 3 A B C The independent prognostic effects of genes in lactylation-related prognostic signature Survival heatmap exhibited that the expression levels of genes in signature were positive correlated with the RS, but negative correlated with the prognosis of LGG patients in both TCGA and CGGA cohorts (Fig. 4 p p 4 4 p 4  Fig. 4 A B C D E C19orf53 promotes glioma cell proliferation and migration Because C19orf53 displayed the strongest independent negative prognosis effect on LGG in Multivariate Cox analysis (HR = 2.84, p − 3 5 5 5 5 5  Fig. 5 A B n C D n E F n G H n A B F p p p p Discussion Glioma accounted for about 80% of all malignant brain tumors, and was the leading cause of death in patients with brain tumors [ 10 37 38 Lactic acid, as the primary product of anaerobic metabolism, played an important role in the hypoxic microenvironment [ 39 14 21 40 15 16 41 45 The 14 lactylation-related prognostic genes included in the signature for LGG were MSN, KIF2C, HDAC1, G6PD, RFC4, MNDA, PFN1, LCP1, CALR, HMGA1, ENO1, C19orf53, RPS11 and TP53. GSEA analysis revealed that these genes mainly contributed to carbon metabolism and immune-related pathways, which indicated that the potential mechanism of these lactylation-related genes on the prognosis of LGG patients could through affecting metabolism and immunity. More notably, although PPI network showed close interactions between each gene, multivariate COX analysis revealed that MSN, KIF2C, G6PD, RFC4, MNDA, CALR, HMGA1, ENO1, C19orf53, RPS11 and TP53 were independent prognostic indicators, suggesting that each of them could be a promising therapy target. Currently, only a few studies have found that the above identified genes have adverse effects on cancers through participating in protein lactylation. For instance, it was found that G6PD can be actived and up-regulated by lactylation substrate, resulting in the stimulation of pentose phosphate pathway and cervical cancer progression [ 43 15 46 47 Importantly, previous study has revealed that the expression of C19orf53 mediated excessive cell proliferation, resulting in metabolic imbalance [ 48 In summary, this study constructed a stable and accurate lactylation-related prognostic model from the perspective of bio-informatics, providing a new perspective for the prognosis evaluation of LGG patients and the subsequent studies on therapeutic targets, and also made up for the lack of research on lactylation in glioma. Limitations Although the 10-fold cross-validation were used in model construction process and the external validation further strengthen the mode’s robustness and generalization, the risk of potential overfitting may still exist considering the high AUC values observed in the training cohort (up to 0.95). Besides, the analysis results and conclusion of this study were based on the transcriptome data, and lacking analysis based on the protein level for further validation. In addition, the current research on C19orf53 was very scarce. This experiment only proved that down-regulation of C19orf53 at the mRNA level can interfere with the malignant biological behaviors of LGG cell lines, but the specific mechanism was not explored. Therefore, it was urgent to supplement the follow-up basic experiments. Supplementary Information  Supplementary material 1.
