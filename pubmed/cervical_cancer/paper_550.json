However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. Methods Mendelian randomization analysis was used to identify the causal relationship between EMS and ovarian cancer. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted using the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) dataset, grouping samples based on miR-874 expression. EcoTyper analysis was applied to evaluate tumor microenvironment composition concerning miR-874 expression. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and miWalk target prediction were used to identify key regulatory targets of miR-874. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis and ChIP-Seq data mining further elucidated the role of miR-874 in clear cell ovarian cancer (CCOC) pathogenesis. Results EMS is a key risk factor for CCOC. Multi-datasets analysis revealed that miR-874 down-regulation is closely associated with EMS occurrence, ovarian cancer progression, and patient survival. A total of 194 differentially expressed genes were identified between the high and low miR-874 expression groups, with key genes such as ASB9, TMSB10P1, SMIM24, and PDLIM4 showing significant changes. Functional analysis revealed enrichment in pathways related to mitochondrial function, cell adhesion, proteasomal degradation, and p53 signaling. Survival analysis demonstrated that down-regulation of genes in the high miR-874 group (ZNF623, NDRG1, ZNF7, MTBP, and PHF20L1) was associated with better prognosis, while up-regulation of genes (PDLIM4 and ECRG4) correlated with poorer survival. EcoTyper analysis identified significant tumor microenvironment changes in the high miR-874 group, with an increased abundance of myoepithelial-like (Endothelial.cells.5) and myofibroblast-like (Fibroblasts.1) cells, and reduced levels of migratory-like fibroblasts (Fibroblasts.8), suggesting a more benign tumor phenotype. WGCNA and miWalk analyses indicated that ZNF217 and NDRG1 are potential regulatory targets of miR-874. scRNA-seq data suggested that ZNF217 and NDRG1 are predominantly expressed in ovarian stromal and immune cells. Further, ChIP-Seq data suggest that ZNF217 may bind to the MTBP promoter, which is associated with the stabilization of MDM2, a key negative regulator of p53. We propose a hypothetical miR-874–ZNF217–MTBP–MDM2–p53 regulatory axis that may contribute to the progression of CCOC. Conclusion The down-regulation of miR-874 may be involved in the progression from EMS to CCOC. We propose that miR-874 may act as a tumor suppressor in CCOC, potentially through the miR-874–ZNF217–MTBP–MDM2–p53 regulatory axis. This proposed mechanism warrants further experimental validation. Collectively, these results provide preliminary insights into the molecular pathogenesis of EMS-associated CCOC and may inform future efforts to identify prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.

It is characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterine cavity, which remains responsive to cyclical ovarian hormonal changes [ 1 2 3 Clear cell ovarian carcinoma (CCOC) is a subtype of ovarian cancer that is clinically challenging to treat and associated with a poor prognosis. Its pathogenesis is complex and not yet fully understood [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 In recent years, with the development of genomics, transcriptomics, and big data analysis technologies, the genetic background and molecular mechanisms of many diseases have been studied in unprecedented depth. In particular, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have made significant progress in revealing the genetic factors underlying diseases [ 11 12 14 Blood is considered a fluid environment that reflects the status of various organs in the body, and it plays a crucial role in the occurrence, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of diseases [ 15 16 17 19 20 21 We have identified miR-874 as a potential molecular link in the progression from EMS to CCOC. miR-874, a microRNA known to be dysregulated in various cancers including ovarian cancer, has emerged as a potential contributor to this transformation. Recent studies suggest that miR-874 is down-regulated in ovarian cancer tissues, and its reduced expression may be associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis [ 22 23 In this study, we integrated multiple datasets to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from EMS to CCOC, with a focus on the role of miR-874. Our findings indicate that miR-874 is consistently and significantly down-regulated in both EMS and CCOC, and its reduced expression is associated with poor prognosis. Bioinformatics analysis and preliminary experimental evidence suggest that miR-874 down-regulation is associated with the up-regulation of ZNF217, which in turn may promote MTBP overexpression and enhances MDM2 stability, ultimately suppressing p53 signaling and facilitating tumor progression. These findings offer new insights into the potential mechanistic link between EMS and CCOC and support the hypothesis that the miR-874–ZNF217–MTBP–MDM2–p53 axis may contribute to CCOC pathogenesis. Further in vivo and clinical studies are warranted to validate these mechanisms and to assess the therapeutic potential of miR-874 in improving outcomes for patients with CCOC.

Summary-level genetic association data for EMS were obtained from the ebi-a-GCST90018839 dataset ( n n 12 p − 6 2 28 Differential plasma miRNA and tissue gene expression analysis Differential plasma miRNA expression analysis was performed using GEO2R, an online tool provided by NCBI GEO, to preprocess and normalize the data. GEO2R, which is based on the limma package in R, was used to identify differentially expressed miRNAs between EMS and control samples. Significant miRNAs were defined by an adjusted P-value < 0.05 and a log 2 For differential gene expression analysis in tissue samples, gene expression data were preprocessed by filtering based on mean expression, standard deviation (SD), and coefficient of variation (CV). Genes with a mean expression and CV above the 10th percentile were retained for further analysis. Differential gene expression was assessed using the eBayes method implemented in the R package limma, with significance thresholds set at P 29 Survival analysis Survival analysis was performed using the KMplot web tool ( https://kmplot.com/ 30 31 Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) WGCNA was performed using the R package WGCNA [ 32 33 MiRNA-target gene regulatory network analysis The target genes of miR-874 were predicted using the miWalk web tool [ 34 35 Tumor microenvironment analysis Cellular composition profiles of TCGA samples were obtained using the Ecotyper deconvolution algorithm [ 36 37 38 Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using R software. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Multiple testing corrections were applied where appropriate, using methods such as the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate. Results Bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis confirms EMS as a causal factor for CCOC development We conducted a bidirectional two-sample MR analysis using the EMS dataset (ebi-a-GCST90018839) from the EBI GWAS database as the exposure and the CCOC dataset (ieu-a-1124, n 1 1 1 1 1  Fig. 1 Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis reveals a potential causal relationship between endometriosis (EMS) and clear cell ovarian cancer (CCOC) development by the TwoSampleMR package.

A B C Exploration of the molecular mechanisms of miR-874 in CCOC To investigate the potential mechanisms of miR-874, we performed differential gene expression analysis using the TCGA ovarian cancer dataset. Samples were stratified into high- and low-expression groups based on miR-874 levels, with the low-expression group serving as the control. A total of 194 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (Fig. 4 39 40 4 5 GSE230956  Fig. 4 Transcriptomic differential expression analysis between high and low miR-874 expression in TCGA ovarian cancer tissues. A P B C D E  Fig. 5 Survival analysis of the top 10 differentially expressed genes based on miR-874 high and low expression in TCGA ovarian cancer tissues by KMplot web tool. Eight genes, ZNF623, DRG1, ZNF7, MTBP, PHF20L1, ASB9, PDLIM4, and ECRG4, are associated with survival prognosis. Among them, ZNF623, DRG1, ZNF7, MTBP, and PHF20L1 are down-regulated in tissues with high miR-874 expression, while ASB9, PDLIM4, and ECRG4 are up-regulated The tumor microenvironment is associated with miR-874 expression EcoTyper is an advanced tool used for analyzing transcriptomic data, particularly for deconvoluting the cellular composition and cellular states of complex tissues, including tumors. Using machine learning-based approaches, EcoTyper identifies distinct cell subtypes and their abundance from gene expression data. Given that tumors comprise diverse cell populations, we applied EcoTyper to quantitatively analyze cell type abundance in ovarian cancer tissues (Fig. 6 This analysis revealed three cell subtypes that are associated with high miR-874 expression. Specifically, Endothelial.cells.5 (myoepithelial-like cells) and Fibroblasts.1 (myofibroblast-like cells) were up-regulated in tissues with high miR-874 expression, whereas Fibroblasts.8 (migratory-like cells) was down-regulated (Fig. 7 7  Fig. 6 Tumor microenvironment cell abundance analysis of TCGA ovarian cancer tissue samples by Ecotyper tool. A total of 9 cell types were quantified  Fig. 7 Tumor microenvironment cell abundance difference analysis between high and low expression of miR-874 in TCGA ovarian cancer. A B MiR-874 may inhibit tumorigenesis by targeting ZNF217 To further investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying miR-874 function, we performed WGCNA on the DEGs identified in previous analyses. This analysis suggested a potential regulatory relationship between miR-874 and NDRG1 as well as ZNF217 (Fig. 8 9  Fig. 8 miR-874 may influence the occurrence and development of CCOC by regulating NDRG1 and ZNF217. A 2 B C 2 D E F G H  Fig. 9 miR-874 may influence gene expression by binding to the mRNA of NDRG1 and ZNF217 according to the miRWalk database. A B NDRG1 and ZNF217 are up-regulated in endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer Single-cell analysis revealed that NDRG1 is primarily expressed in ovarian stromal cells (Fig. 10 10 41 42 Protein expression analysis further confirmed that NDRG1 and ZNF217 are up-regulated in EMS-associated ovarian cancer (Fig. 11 43 To explore this regulatory network, ChIP-Seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing) data analysis was performed, revealing that ZNF217 binds to the upstream promoter region of MTBP. As miR-874 is down-regulated in the blood of EMS. We propose a hypothesis that the decrease in ovarian tissue miR-874 levels results in the up-regulation of the transcription factor ZNF217. This further activates the transcription of MTBP, which stabilizes the p53-negative regulator MDM2, leading to decreased p53 signaling pathway activity, inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in ovarian epithelial cells, and promoting the development of CCOC (Fig. 12 12  Fig. 10 Single-cell analysis reveals that the NDRG1 gene is primarily expressed in ovarian stromal cells, while the ZNF217 gene is mainly expressed in ovarian stromal cells, smooth muscle cells, and immune cells according to the Human Protein Atlas database  Fig. 11 According to the Human Protein Atlas database, the expression of NDRG1 and ZNF217 is increased in endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer tissues. Magnification: 100x  Fig. 12 Potential mechanism of miRNA-induced transformation of endometriosis (EMS) into clear cell ovarian cancer (CCOC) Discussion With the rapid development of technologies such as bioinformatics, genomics, and transcriptomics, research on ovarian cancer and endometriosis is gradually evolving toward multidimensional and systematic approaches. This study integrates big data analysis to delineate the underlying mechanisms of ESM transformation to ovarian cancer. We used MR analysis to confirm that EMS is a key predisposing factor for the development of CCOC. Bioinformatics analysis of multiple datasets further revealed that down-regulation of miR-874 is closely associated with EMS occurrence, ovarian cancer progression, and patient survival. In tumor tissues with low miR-874 expression, significant alterations were observed in ZNF217, MTBP, NDRG1, RAD18, and PVT1, all of which are related to the p53 signaling pathway. Furthermore, we explored how miR-874 down-regulation induces ZNF217 up-regulation, which is correlated with MTBP overexpression and increased MDM2 stability, ultimately suppressing p53 signaling activity and promoting tumor progression. Clinical samples confirmed abnormalities in miR-874 associated molecules ZNF217 and NDRG1. These findings provide a scientific basis and novel insights for improving EMS and CCOC prognosis and developing personalized therapeutic strategies. GWAS has identified SNPs associated with ovarian cancer and EMS, providing potential genetic markers for early diagnosis and personalized treatment [ 44 45 Our subsequent bioinformatics analyses of miRNA expression in EMS and ovarian cancer tissues identified miR-874 as a critical modulator in the development of these conditions. Notably, miR-874 was found to be significantly down-regulated in both EMS and CCOC tissues. The expression pattern of miR-874 suggests that its loss may disrupt critical molecular pathways involved in tumor suppression, thereby promoting cancer progression. Our study further demonstrated that miR-874 down-regulation was associated with the up-regulation of key genes such as ZNF217, MTBP, and NDRG1, which are involved in the p53 signaling pathway, a central regulator of cell cycle and apoptosis [ 46 50 GSE230956 The interplay between miR-874 and ZNF217 is particularly noteworthy. As a transcription factor, ZNF217 has been implicated in the regulation of genes related to cell growth and survival [ 43 51 52 Single-cell RNA sequencing and co-expression analyses further elucidated the role of these molecular interactions within the tumor microenvironment. We identified distinct cell subtypes associated with high miR-874 expression, including endothelial cells and fibroblasts, which suggest a potential role for miR-874 in maintaining a more benign tumor phenotype. This finding is consistent with the observation that high miR-874 expression correlates with better patient prognosis. The absence of tissue-level validation is a limitation, and future studies should perform tumor microenvironment profiling using IHC or multiplex immunofluorescence to confirm key cell subsets such as Fibroblasts.1 and immune components in EMS-associated CCOC. The identification of these cell types as potential prognostic markers offers potential avenues for future research focused on cellular compositions within the tumor microenvironment and their role in CCOC progression. Additionally, the down-regulation of miR-874 and subsequent up-regulation of ZNF217 in CCOC suggests that miR-874 acts as a tumor suppressor in EMS-associated ovarian cancer. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of how miR-874 may inhibit tumorigenesis by targeting critical genes involved in COCC development. Our findings not only shed light on the complex molecular mechanisms of EMS-associated CCOC but also highlight miR-874 as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for improving the prognosis of CCOC patients. In conclusion, this study proposes a potential molecular link between EMS and CCOC, highlighting the miR-874-ZNF217-p53 axis as a candidate pathway involved in tumor suppression. While our findings offer preliminary insights that may inform future therapeutic strategies, they are based on bioinformatic analyses of general ovarian cancer datasets and should be considered hypothesis-generating. Further experimental validation in CCOC-specific models is warranted to confirm the relevance and therapeutic potential of the identified mechanisms. Limitations Despite the comprehensive multi-omics analysis and integration of large public datasets, our study has several limitations. First, some of the datasets included relatively small sample sizes, which may introduce sampling bias and limit the generalizability of the findings. The reduced statistical power may also increase the risk of false positives or false negatives in differential gene expression analyses. Second, while we used multiple independent datasets to cross-validate the expression patterns of miR-874 in EMS and CCOC, the regulatory mechanisms and downstream effects were primarily inferred through bioinformatics approaches and lack in vivo or in vitro experimental validation. Third, the proposed miR-874–ZNF217–MTBP–MDM2–p53 axis requires further experimental confirmation to establish a causal relationship. It is important to note that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) used in our analysis were derived from the TCGA ovarian cancer cohort, and therefore, the findings are more broadly representative of ovarian cancer rather than specific to CCOC, which remains to be experimentally validated in future studies. Future work should include experimental approaches such as miRNA manipulation in CCOC cell lines, expression analysis in clinical samples, target verification assays, and immunohistochemistry or multiplex immunofluorescence to validate key cell subtypes. These steps will help to substantiate the molecular mechanisms predicted by our computational analyses. Supplementary Information Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
