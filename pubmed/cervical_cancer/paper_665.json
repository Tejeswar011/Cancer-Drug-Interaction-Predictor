HPV-positive tumours generally tend to have a better prognosis and are driven by oncoproteins E6 and E7. In contrast, HPV-negative tumours typically have a worse prognosis and are often linked to mutations in tumour suppressor genes. HNSCCs exist within a complex environment known as the tumour microenvironment (TME). The TME includes tumour cells, cancer stem cells (CSCs), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), blood vessels, and various signalling molecules. These components support tumour progression, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. Intercellular signalling within the TME—mediated by cytokines such as IL-6, TGF-b, and galectins—further promotes tumour growth and systemic effects like cachexia. Notably, the TME shares features with granulation tissue during wound healing, supporting the concept of cancer as a chronic, non-resolving wound. Effective therapy must target not only tumour cells but also the dynamic TME. head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cancer stroma cancer-associated fibroblast tumour microenvironment immunity therapy IL-6 CAF extracellular matrix National Institute for Cancer Research LX22NPO5102 European Union–Next Generation EU Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic AZV CR NW24-03-00459 Charles University projects COOPERATIO-Onco and -Surgical Disciplines The ELIXIR CZ research infrastructure LM2023055 “Centre for Tumour Ecology–Research of the Cancer Microenvironment Supporting Cancer Growth and Spread” CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_019/0000785 Operational Programme Research, Development and Education This study was supported by the project National Institute for Cancer Research (Programme EXCELES, ID Project No. LX22NPO5102) funded by the European Union–Next Generation EU; the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic project AZV CR NW24-03-00459; and the Charles University projects COOPERATIO-Onco and -Surgical Disciplines.

Introduction Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are the sixth most common cancers worldwide, with 50–70% of cases occurring in men aged 60–70 years. They originate from the squamous cell epithelium in the oral and nasal cavities, pharynx, larynx, and skin [ 1 2 The pathogenesis of HNSCC primarily involves inhibition of tumour suppressor genes or their proteins (tumour suppressor proteins), particularly p53 and pRb. Their inactivation allows cells to bypass cell-cycle checkpoints, which also usually leads to the accumulation of DNA errors or mutations, and ultimately, these cells can undergo malignant transformation. In HPV-positive tumours, p53 (protein p53) and pRb (Retinoblastoma protein) are inhibited by viral oncoproteins E6 and E7. HPV-positive tumours are also linked with an upregulated production of p16 (protein p16), an immunohistochemical marker routinely used to detect HPV infection. Conversely, in HPV-negative tumours, p53 is inactivated by gene mutation, while pRb is inhibited by cyclin D1 or cyclin D2 and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK-)4-6 complexes. HPV-negative tumours often exhibit deletion of the CDKN2A gene, which paradoxically correlates with reduced p16 expression and worse prognosis in comparison to HPV-positive tumours [ 3 Tumours are highly heterogeneous complexes with structures that vary depending on the specific tumour type. Generally, genetically abnormal malignant cells are surrounded by complex environmental components that constitute what is known as the tumour microenvironment (TME). The TME is crucial for cancer cells; for example, it promotes cancer cell proliferation and migration, which may also contribute to metastatic progression. Moreover, this microenvironment consists of cancer cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, endothelial cells, extracellular matrix (ECM), cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and other elements [ 4 5 6 7 8 With respect to the immunological activity estimated by the spatial distribution of T cells observed in solid tumours, three distinct immune phenotypes are currently recognised [ 9 10 + Over the past decade, pioneering immunotherapeutics, such as anti-CTLA4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4) and anti-PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1) antibodies, have dramatically transformed the landscape of oncology. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionised cancer treatment. However, durable responses are achieved only in a subtype of treated patients. Primary or acquired resistance to these treatments is frequently seen. Sadly, even if immune cells seem to be abundant in biopsy, tumours can be or become resistant to ICIs due to upregulation of alternative checkpoints (TIM3 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3), LAG3 (lymphocyte-activation gene 3), and TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains)) and/or by using non-PD-1/CTLA4-mediated inhibitory pathways [ 11 12 In this review, we aim to summarise the immunological factors of TME in HNSCC and elucidate the mechanisms of resistance of these tumours to oncological treatments. Emerging evidence highlights the role of CAFs in orchestrating the immunomodulatory aspects of TMEs, making CAFs the principal contributors to immune evasion and cancer therapy. We believe that research on the TME, and particularly on CAF heterogeneity, may ignite innovative strategies and can even boost the success of existing immunotherapies. 1.1. Tumour Stem Cells Tumour cell heterogeneity is notable even within a single tumour in one patient, mainly due to diverse gene mutations, particularly so-called driver mutations, which are the primary cause of carcinogenesis initiation. Among these cells, there is a subpopulation that exhibits stem-like properties, known as cancer stem cells (CSCs) [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 So what makes CSCs hot, cold, or lethal? Due to their slow population kinetics, CSCs are naturally resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Considering novel immunotherapeutic options, immune evasion is a major obstacle for successful cancer treatment in many patients. Why do even these trendy therapeutic modalities fail? It is well documented that immune privilege is not a general quality of all stem cells [ 21 + 22 23 24 25 Using a model for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), tumours can be effectively challenged by adoptive cytotoxic T cell transfer (ACT)-based immunotherapy [ 26 1.2. Metastasis Metastasis is a key characteristic of malignant tumour progression. It is a highly complex process that typically begins with tumour growth, invasion, remodelling of the extracellular matrix, intravasation, and extravasation and ends with the colonisation of distant tissues by cancer cells. A crucial mechanism enabling cancer cells to migrate during metastasis is epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). Colonisation of distant tissue is facilitated by mesenchymal–epithelial transition (MET) [ 4 Figure 1 27 28 29 30 31 32 Tumour cells that migrate to form metastasis must be able to survive without a connection to the matrix, since in that situation, many cell types undergo anoikis (a specialised form of apoptosis). Anoikis is an important characteristic of nucleated cells (except leucocytes). For instance, CSCs exhibit resistance to anoikis, which enables their survival within the circulatory system. Multiple underlying mechanisms mediate this unique feature [ 33 34 35 Figure 1 During EMT, epithelial cells gain mesenchymal traits. This shift in phenotype can be visualised by co-expression of epithelial markers (e.g., keratins (KRT) in C G B F A D B C E H F G D H A E 36 37 Metastases are one of the main prognostic markers of HNSCC, mainly spreading to the neck lymph nodes. Neck lymph node metastases reduce survival by 50%. Tumour cells can spread via local invasion and via lymphatic or blood vessels. Metastatic spread in HNSCC is supported by many different mechanisms and interlinked signalling cascades, such as cytokine signalling, involving the activation of TGF-β and CXCR4, which ultimately enhance cell migration and invasion, leading to metastasis. TGF-β can trigger EMT and supports the aggressive phenotype of HNSCC. Moreover, TGF-β controls the activity of genes like cadherin-E or vimentin. These genes are involved in adhesion, movement, and invasion. So the influence of TGF-β can generate tumour cells that are highly mobile and capable of spreading to distant parts of the body [ 38 So, what makes metastasis hot, cold, or lethal? There is progressively growing evidence that cancer cells can disseminate from primary lesions much earlier than the classical metastasis models predicted [ 39 35 40 41 If metastasis is not prevented, is there a way to convert its environment into an immunologically “hot” one, with more favourable features for patients? Intralesional interventions for metastases were occasionally used and have proven beneficial in certain patients, even in recent years. Multiple drugs can be injected into metastases, including various chemotherapeutic agents (methotrexate, bleomycin, 5-fluorouracil) [ 42 Surprisingly, there are well documented benefits of intraleasional administration of drugs which are usually not used in cytotoxic chemotherapy. Among those, rose bengal, a water-soluble xanthine dye historically used in ophthalmology, has more recently been identified as a potential anti-neoplastic agent, particularly in melanoma metastasis treatment [ 43 44 45 46 More recently, oncolytic viral therapies became another novel category of non-surgical treatment options available [ 47 48 49 50 51 Intriguingly, intratumoral administration of living bacteria can also help ignite an immune response in metastasis. This concept is nothing new, as it has been studied since the nineteenth century [ 52 53 53 54 55 53 Intralesional interventions can also be combined with radiotherapy. Radiotherapy itself can trigger the so-called abscopal effect, where, in some cases, radiotherapy results in a systemic anticancer response clearing even the non-irradiated metastatic lesions at a distance from the primary site of irradiation [ 56 57 58 + + 59 It was suggested based on genome-wide CRISPR screening in mice that SFRP2 is a potential stromal regulator of the abscopal effect of radioimmunotherapy. SFRP2 exhibits CAF expression and radioimmunotherapy-mediated upregulation in unirradiated tumours. Serum proteomics reveals that irradiated tumour-secreted PAI-1 triggers the fate transition of distant tumour pericyte cells into SFRP2-high CAFs via the LRP1/p65 axis. Pharmacologically blocking SFRP2 or PAI-1 enhances the abscopal effect in humanised patient-derived xenograft models [ 60 However, this is a good example of making the metastasis immunologically “hot” again. Nevertheless, there is an urgent need to acquire more robust data in humans, where the induction of the abscopal effect remains rare and where its mechanisms remain elusive [ 61 2. The Tumour Microenvironment and Its Components The TME comprises cancer cells, including cancer stem cells, alongside immune cells, vasculature, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and the bioactive molecules they secrete ( Figure 2 4 Figure 2 Human squamous cell carcinoma tissue contains several important components, namely malignant epithelial cells and stromal tissue. The extent of tumour stoma can be visualised by, e.g., fibronectin (FN1 in B F J N C G K O D H L P A E I M 14 62 63 2.1. Immune Cells Immune cells often infiltrate tumours, but they rarely eliminate malignant cells. Tumour cells frequently harbour extensive mutations yet often fail to express recognisable surface antigens, allowing them to evade immune detection. Paradoxically, infiltrating leucocytes often even promote tumour progression. A specific example is tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs adopt an M2-like phenotype after being polarised by cells within the tumour ecosystem. They secrete the Interleukins (IL-) IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, TGF-β (Transforming Growth Factor), EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor), and other factors that facilitate tumour growth and cell migration [ 64 65 + + 66 67 68 69 70 71 In the broadest sense, based on immune activity within the TME, we can divide tumours into two groups. The first group consists of so-called hot tumours, characterised by inflammation. These tumours have a high infiltration of immune cells, over-expression of PD-L1, genomic instability, and pre-existing antitumour immune responses. Hot tumours are usually more responsive to immunotherapy, such as ICIs. The opposite group, “cold” tumours, typically show poor response to immunotherapy. This area is particularly promising and may be especially useful in treating malignant tumours [ 72 Nevertheless, the immune infiltrate is much more complex, with striking local intratumoral heterogeneity. This is due to genetic and cellular diversity within the invading immune cells. Importantly, this can be a basis for the failure of immunotherapy and an inferior antitumour immune response [ 73 Thus, it seems evident that simple quantification of CD8 T cells alone cannot determine the competence of these cells to attack tumour cells. Instead, it was suggested that activated tumour-specific tissue resident memory CD8 T cells can be defined by the co-expression of CD103, CD39, and CD8 in colorectal cancer [ 74 + In HNSCCs, combined single-cell RNA sequencing and multiplex immunofluorescence recently identified a new tumour-infiltrating cell (TIL) subtype, CD103 + + + + + + 75 Mutational status should also be considered in immunotherapy outcome prediction. It has been documented that somatic mutation of NFE2L2 leads to Nrf2 activation and radioresistance in HNSCC cells [ 76 77 78 Altogether, the tumour ecosystem’s state must be carefully assessed. The overall evaluation appears to benefit from deep molecular profiling and immune phenotyping, and it must be aligned with patient outcome data in the longer term. Of note, approximately 50% of the TME proteome is differentially expressed between cold and hot regions [ 79 2.2. Cancer Association Fibroblasts (CAFs) Another important component of the TME is CAFs, whose main functions include ECM production, the synthesis of proteases for ECM biodegradation, and the production of various other bioactive cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. They often also express α-SMA (α-smooth muscle actin), which is a key feature of myofibroblasts, one of the subpopulations of these cells ( Figure 3 80 81 82 14 83 Figure 3 Human squamous cell carcinoma tissue and its CAFs ( A E I M B G C K C K F I M O J N D H L P A E I M 7 63 Pericytes in tissues retain characteristics of progenitor cells [ 84 85 86 Regarding the endothelium, an increasing number of studies have also implicated the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) as a principal important topic in cardiac development [ 87 88 81 It has been documented that the EndMT can be a process initiated by activation of endothelial TGF-β signalling. It has been suggested that it leads to a further increase in TGF-β signalling, thus establishing a positive feedback loop with the EndMT, leading to more EndMT [ 89 90 91 92 The hypothesis that CAFs may derive from mesenchymal cells is supported by the fact that CAFs in basal cell carcinomas can further differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, or chondrocytes. This suggests that CAFs are multipotent cells, similar to mesenchymal stem cells [ 93 94 95 96 CAFs are not a homogeneous family; rather, they constitute a broad and functionally diverse group. Myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs) express α-SMA and actively produce ECM. Occasionally, cells that generate ECM are called matrix-producing CAFs (matCAFs). There is no strict boundary between myCAFs and matCAFs. Fibroblasts known as inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) promote inflammation, while antigen-presenting CAFs (apCAFs) are active antigen-presenting cells. A subpopulation of CAFs, characterised by high expression of ID genes, is responsive to TGF-β and potentially serves as a precursor for other CAF subpopulations [ 97 98 99 3 100 101 14 37 102 As already mentioned above, CAFs produce the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tumour. In addition to commonly found molecules such as collagens and fibronectin, the production of tenascin-C is also important and can be found in both the tumour stroma and the healing wound. Among other things, tenascin-C is responsible for stimulating aggressive growth in many types of tumours [ 103 104 105 106 107 Collagens are the most structural ECM components of normal and tumour tissues, including HNSCCs [ 108 109 110 The linearization of collagen can be microscopically visualised as an overall increase in tissue birefringence. Structural patterns of fibrillar collagen organisation are termed “Tumour-Associated Collagen Signatures” and have been used to classify the changes in collagen arrangement that accompany carcinoma progression [ 109 111 112 113 114 115 Fibronectin is a glycoprotein with a multitude of functions in normal tissue and in the tumour stroma. It is not a cancer-specific ECM. However, it has been noted that the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin contains a domain that is rarely found in healthy adults and is almost exclusively expressed by newly formed blood vessels in tumours [ 116 It seems that it is not easy to predict the role of fibronecin in tumours [ 117 118 119 119 Figure 2 120 It has been suggested that, in HNSCC, the oncofoetal form of fibronectin is a major and obligate component of the matrix assembled by stromal fibroblasts. In contrast to earlier views, fibronectin was more recently determined to be an independent unfavourable prognostic marker in HNSCC and other cancer types [ 121 120 Interestingly, the oncofoetal form of fibronectin was demonstrated to be specifically associated with the M2 polarisation of intratumoural macrophages [ 122 123 118 Tenascin C is another large matrix glycoprotein with several alternatively spliced forms and binding partners. Tenascin-C protein synthesis is tightly regulated, with widespread protein distribution in embryonic tissues but restricted distribution of tenascin-C in adult tissues. Tenascin-C is also expressed de novo in adults during wound healing [ 124 125 126 Figure 3 104 + 127 128 129 8 Figure 3 96 + + 130 + + 63 131 In conclusion, CAFs play a critical role in HNSCC pathogenesis (e.g., formation of ECM, angiogenesis, and immune and metabolic reprogramming of the TME, impacting metastasis and therapeutic resistance). They possess many molecules and signalling pathways that could be important targets in future oncological therapy [ 132 98 133 So, what makes CAFs hot, cold, or lethal? Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the overall proportion, phenotype, and distribution of CAFs within the tumour microenvironment are important in determining responses to ICIs [ 134 135 136 137 134 + + + + 138 2.3. Blood Vessels An important part of the TME is also blood vessels, which are formed inside the tumour stroma by a process known as neovascularisation. Neovascularisation and the abundant tumour permeation by capillaries supply nutrients to the tumour. Specifically, targeting new vessels in cancer treatment is one of the most frequently used strategies [ 14 139 Overall, low pO2 (partial oxygen pressure) in the tumour microenvironment prior to initiation of therapy indicates a worse prognosis for patients [ 140 141 142 143 144 There is also evidence acquired in glioblastoma suggesting that hypoxic niches attract and sequester myeloid and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, where they were reprogrammed toward an immunosuppressive state. Mechanistically, it was suggested that chemokine CCL8 and cytokine IL-1β are two hypoxic-niche factors critical for immunosupresive tuning in the tumour mass [ 145 146 Tumours are intrinsically heterogeneous, as stated above. The origin of such remarkable cell state diversity remains poorly understood. It was suggested earlier that clinically relevant phenomena such as primary tumour growth and its consequent metastatic dissemination result from distinct cancer cell subpopulations [ 147 + + 148 Lastly, there is also a specific subset of CAFs residing in the perivascular niche [ 134 149 + + 150 3. Intercellular Signalling in the Tumour Ecosystem In the context of tumourigenesis, cells within the tumour ecosystem produce cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and other molecules, such as TGF-β, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, IL-6 and IL-8, Tumour Necrosis Factor TNF-β, CXCL-1, and VEGF. They promote tumour-stimulating inflammation, tumour cell proliferation and migration, immunosuppression, and metastasis [ 142 Specifically, IL-6 is a crucial component of the TME ( Figure 4 71 151 Figure S1 152 Figure 4 Human squamous cell carcinoma tissue and principal components of the IL-6 signalling cascade. The interleukin IL-6 itself ( A B C D A D 71 As described above, the IL-6 signalling cascade offers several candidate targets for therapeutic interventions. In principle, neutralisation of cytokines (e.g., TNFa) via specific antibodies has proved to be a successful strategy in the management of numerous inflammatory and autoimmune conditions [ 153 During inflammation, IL-6 levels in the circulation rise dramatically from virtually undetectable in healthy individuals to several-fold higher levels in patients who develop fatal sepsis [ 154 However, IL-6 is produced in large quantities by numerous cell types (as evident in Figure 4 155 156 157 However, small-molecule inhibitors targeting JAKs (Janus Activated Kinases), which act downstream of gp130, represent another FDA-approved approach for JAK/STAT inhibition. Such molecules have recently been used in various indications in the clinic to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases [ 158 On the contrary, the humanised monoclonal antibodies to IL-6R have reached clinical use. These antibodies prevent the binding of IL-6 to IL-6R. Tocilizumab and sarilumab were approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [ 155 In cancer, the relative scarcity of IL-6 receptors seems to be critical for the precise regulation of the signalling cascade. The amount of IL-6R present at the cell surface determines the responsiveness of the cell to the cytokine and might therefore be decisive in the development of an inflammatory response. It has been shown that IL-6R and gp130 are constitutively internalised independent of IL-6 [ 159 160 Therefore, new strategies for IL-6 receptor inhibition are in development. For instance, peptides derived from the ABD fragment of streptococcal G protein appear capable of inhibiting both the proliferation and migration of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and melanoma cells [ 161 IL-8 is another potent CXC chemokine family member. Following its binding to the receptor, IL-8 (also known as CXCL8) promotes the proliferation, survival, and metastasis of cancer cells and tumour angiogenesis [ 162 163 Dual targeting can frequently offer significant benefits in oncology. In experiments where IL-6 and IL-8 were inhibited in melanomas, these interleukins were found to be essential for promoting the activity of CAFs. When IL-6 and IL-8 are deficient in the environment, the invasiveness of melanoma cells is suppressed [ 164 165 For example, therapeutic blockade of IL-6 and IL-8 in mice using Tocilizumab (a humanised monoclonal antibody against the α chain of IL-6) and Reparixin (a low-molecular-weight inhibitor of IL-8 signalling) seems to be very effective in suppressing breast cancer metastasis in experiments. Recently, blockade of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors (IL-6R and IL-8R) with a novel bispecific antibody significantly reduced metastatic burden in multiple preclinical mouse models of cancer [ 166 167 Another example is MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor), which is one of the main pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is produced by several cells and acts as an inhibitor of macrophage migration. At the same time, it promotes macrophage activation, stimulates NO and cytokine production (such as TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6), and influences cell proliferation and differentiation, which may also contribute to tumourigenesis and metastasis. Evidence of its role in tumourigenesis is shown by the increased MIF mRNA expression found in lymph node metastases from prostate cancer [ 168 169 170 171 Macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) has become a potentially important factor for targeted cancer therapy. This cytokine is crucial for the differentiation of the monocytic cell line and for encouraging the formation of dense vascular plexuses within tumours. In experiments on murine osteosarcomas, inhibition of M-CSF led to suppression of tumour angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis [ 172 The mentioned systemic therapy using inhibitors of inflammatory molecules causes many side effects. In particular, it adversely affects wound healing, causes immunomodulation, and may lead to further cancer development [ 170 173 174 175 176 CAFs also produce various factors that influence angiogenesis, including VEGFA, TGF-β, HGF, EGF, and FGFs (Fibroblast Growth Factors). One of the most important factors is VEGFA, which is upregulated in most tumours and plays an indispensable role in their stroma. CAFs also express several receptors, such as Platelet-Derived Growth Factor receptor PDGFR-a and PDGFR-b [ 177 178 Endogenous lectins are proteins distinct from immunoglobulins that specifically recognise saccharide motifs. For example, galectins are highly significant in carcinogenesis and exert complex biological effects, one of their primary functions being the ability to interpret the structure of beta-galactosides [ 179 180 181 182 183 184 63 185 186 4. Similarity Between Cancer and Wound Healing Several studies indicate similarities between cancer and wound healing ( Figure 5 187 188 189 190 191 Fibroblast-activating protein alpha (FAP-α) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) are located on the plasma membrane of fibroblasts in abnormally healing wounds or on tumour cell surfaces, where both promote cell invasiveness, tumour growth, and keloid scar formation [ 188 178 Healing is a strictly regulated process that involves four basic phases: hemocoagulation, inflammation, proliferation, and maturation/remodelling [ 71 192 189 193 wounds that never heal 187 157 71 194 Cells that support healing and the migration of other cells are currently a very intriguing topic. For example, a recent study on tadpole tail regeneration in the Xenopus laevis 189 So, what are the hot, cold, and lethal aspects of this wound/cancer parallel? Inflammation is an integral part of the healing process. However, if inflammation exceeds the expected duration for any reason, it can result in poor healing [ 195 196 197 198 199 Porphyromonas gingivalis Fusobacterium nucleatum, 200 201 202 203 Surprisingly, bacterial colonisation is not always associated with activation of the immune response. In triple-negative breast cancer, it has been shown that Fusobacterium nucleatum 204 205 206 207 208 209 However, these results should be interpreted cautiously. Several studies pointed out that depletion of gut microbiota with an antibiotic treatment can compromise the anticancer effect of anti-CTLA-4 therapy in mouse models of sarcoma, melanoma, and colon cancer [ 210 211 212 213 5. Systemic Effects of Tumours The terminal stage of malignant disease is characterised by wasting, cachexia, and psychological changes, including loss of appetite. These life-threatening events seem to be triggered by mediators of cellular communication within the tumour system, particularly a high level of IL-6, which activates STAT3 even in normal cells. This process leads to altered metabolism in white adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and hepatocytes [ 214 Focusing on the brain, an animal experiment showed that IL-6 activates neurons in the area postrema nucleus accumbens 215 216 217 218 192 In humans, mood disorders are associated with chronic low-grade systemic (sterile) inflammation, with increased plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6, which regulate mood behaviour and cognition by influencing neurotransmitter levels [ 219 220 221 222 In many malignant diseases, a broad spectrum of alterations in body metabolism has been documented [ 223 224 225 226 227 228 226 Frequently neglected, adipose tissue is a remarkably metabolically active endocrine organ of the human body. It is also a highly relevant topic in cancer. It is well documented that obesity, the abnormal or excessive expansion of white adipose tissue, is a common root for several malignancies [ 229 230 231 232 Conversely, it is well recognised that exercise can reduce body weight and also reduce obesity-associated cancer risk. Mechanistically, the underlying mechanisms behind the positive effects of exercise remain largely poorly understood, but it was suggested that fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5)/Irisin, a hormone released from exercising muscle, could be responsible for this [ 233 234 235 In a mouse model, it was observed that exposure of tumour-bearing mice to cold conditions markedly inhibited the growth of various types of solid tumours [ 236 236 237 However, there is another aspect of adipose tissue—the end-stage, cachexia [ 238 239 240 241 242 243 6. Conclusions HNSCCs represent a highly heterogeneous group of tumours, both oncologically and biologically, with different etiopathogenesis, often partly based on the presence of HPV infection. HPV-positive tumours tend to have a better prognosis, and their pathogenesis involves the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7. Conversely, HPV-negative tumours usually have a worse prognosis and are often linked to mutations in tumour suppressor genes and reduced p16 expression. These differences significantly influence prognosis and the therapeutic response. A tumour (including HNSCC) is a complex ecosystem comprising tumour and nontumour cells, with mutual regulation distinct from the body’s normal control systems. Besides primary genetic alterations, the TME plays a vital role in tumour development. The TME includes not only tumour cells but also CSCs, CAFs, immune cells, blood vessels, ECM, and signalling molecules. CSCs are a key subpopulation with a high capacity for tissue regeneration—including tumour tissue—along with invasiveness and resistance to therapy. They are likely a major cause of recurrence and metastasis. Understanding tumour evolution requires recognising its Darwinian trajectory, driven by selection pressures within the TME. CAFs play a crucial role in the TME. They are highly heterogeneous and originate from various sources. CAFs can influence the behaviour of surrounding tumour cells and normal cells. They also produce the ECM (e.g., tenascin-C), remodel their environment, and affect angiogenesis and immune responses. Their paracrine effects contribute to tumour progression, EMT, and changes in cell phenotype. The EMT (epithelial–mesenchymal transition) and its reverse process, MET (mesenchymal–epithelial transition), are vital in the migration and colonisation of distant tissues by tumour cells, which is an important aspect of metastasis—a key process in malignant tumours. Some tumour cells may employ alternative migration mechanisms, such as amoeboid movement. It is important to note that CSCs can survive without attachment to the matrix (they are anoikis-resistant). This facilitates the survival of CSCs in circulation and subsequent metastasis formation. Intercellular signalling within the TME is essential for the specific functions of cells and mechanisms of tumourigenesis. Molecules like IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, MIF, or TGF-β are involved in inflammatory, immunoregulatory, and anticancer mechanisms. Cytokines such as IL-6 play a key role in the systemic effects of cancer, including cachexia and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Inhibition of these molecules in preclinical studies shows therapeutic potential; however, transitioning to clinical practice has yet to prove effective. During tumourigenesis and metastasis, immune cells, especially TAMs, support tumour progression. Targeted oncological therapies inhibiting immune checkpoints (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1) appear promising. However, they are only effective in patients with so-called “hot” tumours. Conversely, they tend to be ineffective in cases of “cold” tumours. Blood supply through neovascularisation is essential for tumour growth. It is common for hypoxia zones to form within the tumour. Hypoxia stimulates the expression of specific factors, such as HIF and VEGF, which promote angiogenesis and tumour aggressiveness. Furthermore, a hypoxic environment contributes to a poorer response to therapy. Finally, it is important to note that tumours and wounds share several fundamental similarities—both involve fibroblast activation, ongoing inflammation, granulation tissue formation, and secretion of growth factors. A tumour can be viewed as a state of chronic wound healing that has escaped physiological regulation. Overall, effective oncological therapy should target not only tumour cells but also the dynamic TME, including CAFs, CSCs, immune cells, and intercellular signals. However, achieving this requires a thorough understanding of the patterns of TME function.
