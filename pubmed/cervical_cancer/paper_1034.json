This article examines the historical roots of medical neglect experienced by\nBlack women, focusing on the 18th- and 19th-century British West Indies. During\nthis period, White male physicians constructed racialized and gendered\nframeworks of disease that excluded enslaved Black women from diagnosis, care,\nand medical legitimacy. Positioned not as patients but as reproducers and\nlaborers, their suffering was either pathologized or dismissed. Drawing on\nmedical treatises and plantation manuals, this article argues that enslaved\nBlack women were relegated to a space of medical liminality: recognized as\nreproductive laborers but denied clinical legitimacy or voice. It advances three\nkey arguments. First, it explores how physicians framed Black women as morally\ndeficient and biologically inferior, blaming their behavior for illness. Second,\nit shows how reproductive outcomes like miscarriage and abortion were weaponized\nto portray Black women as lacking maternal instinct. Third, it examines how\nfemale-only diagnoses, such as Chlorosis Enslaved Black Women British West Indies Medical History Colonial Medicine Health Disparities Diagnostic Exclusion Chlorosis Dirt-Eating Pica pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes “Giving birth to my baby, it turned out, was a test for how loud and how often I would\nhave to call out before I was finally heard.” Serena Williams, Elle 1 In 2017, Serena Williams, one of the most recognizable and powerful athletes in the\nworld, nearly died after giving birth. Despite knowing her own medical history and\ncorrectly identifying symptoms of a life-threatening blood clot, hospital staff\nrepeatedly dismissed her concerns. She had to fight to be taken seriously. Williams’s\nstory is not an anomaly. It reflects a broader and enduring pattern: even the\nwealthiest, most visible, and highly educated Black women remain vulnerable to systemic\nmedical neglect. This marginalization has deep historical roots. Black women have been\nmedically underserved for centuries, a reality that extends far beyond the modern\nhealthcare system. Williams’s experience of being dismissed by medical staff reflects a\nbroader and long-standing pattern. For instance, in maternal health, where Black women\nsuffer fatal post-birth complications at significantly higher rates than White women. In\nresponse to these alarming disparities, the US Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention launched the “HEAR HER” campaign, which seeks to raise awareness about urgent\nmaternal warning signs and encourage medical professionals to listen to and act on the\nconcerns of pregnant and postpartum patients of color [ 2 This experience is rooted in a much longer history of racialized and gendered medical\ntreatment. This article examines how these patterns took shape in the 18th- and\n19th-century British West Indies, where enslaved Black women were not only physically\nexploited through forced labor and reproduction, but also silenced and disregarded\nwithin the emerging medical discourse. White male European physicians working on\nplantations consistently cast enslaved Black women as morally corrupt and inherently\ninferior to White women. These physicians further embedded these social prejudices\nthrough the construction of racialized and gendered frameworks of disease that erased\nenslaved Black women from care. As a result, enslaved Black women were relegated to a\nspace of medical liminality. They were not seen as patients, but as reproducers and\nlaborers. Their symptoms were pathologized or ignored, their pain disbelieved, and their\nvoices silenced. They were bodies to be used, not individuals to be heard. To understand the roots of these present-day disparities in Black women’s health, we must\nexamine the historical development of racial and gender bias in Western medicine. These\npatterns were shaped, in part, by medical practices in the 18th- and 19th-century\nBritish West Indies, where the medical treatment of enslaved Black people reflected\nbroader colonial hierarchies of racialized, gendered, and socio-economic\ncontrol. 1 2 3 This article argues that Black women’s medical invisibility today is rooted in historical\npatterns of exclusion embedded in early clinical thinking. Drawing on historical\nanalysis of published medical treatises and plantation manuals, this article traces how\nWhite male physicians shaped a hierarchy of care that routinely excluded enslaved Black\nwomen. First, it explores how these physicians portrayed enslaved Black women as morally\ninferior to White women by depicting them as less chaste, less maternal, and attributed\ntheir increased disease susceptibility to their social behaviors. Second, it examines\nhow stereotypes of moral deficiency were reinforced by promoting the belief that\nenslaved Black women were more likely to induce abortions and lacked maternal\ntenderness. Third, this article examines how the construction of female-specific\ndiseases, such as Chlorosis Of the Whites Plantation physicians constructed these medical distinctions based on deeply entrenched\nassumptions that Black women were biologically different from White European women. Even\nwhen symptoms matched those of White female patients, enslaved Black women were often\ndismissed or given less attention. Instead of receiving comparable care, enslaved Black\nwomen were framed as less delicate, more resilient, and thus more capable of enduring\npain and illness without intervention. The result was a pattern of exclusion and neglect\nthat contributed to the “medical othering” of Black women; a systematic denial of their\nneed for care, based on racialized assumptions about their bodies and capacity for\nsuffering. In doing so, physicians reinforced racialized and gendered distinctions\nbetween White and Black female patients, allocating sympathy, diagnosis, and treatment\naccording to “race” and ideas of femininity rather than medical need. White male physicians working on 18th-century West Indian plantations drew upon deeply\nentrenched social and economic hierarchies to construct medical distinctions that upheld\nracialized and gendered inequality. 4 Constructing the Reproductive Deviance of Enslaved Black Women By the mid-18th century, White male physicians and colonial officials in the British\nWest Indies were actively constructing a racialized narrative of Black women’s\nreproductive health. This narrative framed them as morally deviant, biologically\ndeficient, and thus undeserving of care. Physicians practicing in the West Indies\nwere publishing commentary on perceived racialized health differences. For example,\nJames Grainger, a Scottish-born physician who practiced medicine on the island of\nSt. Christopher [ 3 4 4 4 5 5 Rather than recognizing their own roles, or those of plantation owners and overseers,\nin creating unsafe birthing and recovery environments, prevailing racialized\nhierarchies and medical ideologies led White physicians to attribute high infant\nmortality rates to enslaved mothers, reinforcing racialized stereotypes of maternal\nnegligence and incompetence. Grainger noted that, “their children too more\nfrequently perish, within ten days or a fortnight after their birth, than those of\nwhite people” [ 4 6 Physicians explained high infant mortality rates among enslaved populations by\nblaming enslaved mothers, while ignoring the unsanitary and hazardous conditions of\nplantation childbirth that made newborns particularly vulnerable to infections like\n“locked jaw.” Grainger stated that many newborns died within the first 2 weeks of\nlife, attributing the cause to “the locked jaw, or, as it is called by the West\nIndians, the jaw falling” [ 4 6 Clostridium\ntetani 5 Medical authorities in the West Indies routinely weaponized scientific discourse to\nreinforce racialized and gendered hierarchies, especially in matters of childcare\nand nursing. While enslaved Black women were commonly expected to nurse their own\nchildren or serve as wet nurses for others, White women were explicitly warned\nagainst hiring a “negro or mulatto” nurse. Physicians, such as Robert Thomas, issued\nhighly racialized and gendered warnings, portraying Black women’s bodies as\ninherently diseased and morally suspect, and thus potentially unfit for the intimate\ncare of White infants. Although Thomas acknowledged that “it is a duty incumbent on\nevery mother to suckle her child, provided her health will admit of it, and she has\na plentiful supply of milk,” he admitted that “very few [white] ladies in the\nWest-Indies” did so, believing it “wears out the constitution” [ 6 6 The contrasting medical treatment of pregnant enslaved Black women and White European\nwomen was clearly illustrated in medical literature describing the care needed\nduring pregnancy. In 1803, Dr. Collins published Practical Rules for the\nManagement and Medical Treatment of Negro Slaves, in the Sugar\nColonies 7 Robert Thomas similarly addressed the treatment of pregnant enslaved Black women in\nhis writings. He recommended that once a woman was 3 to 4 months into her pregnancy,\nshe should be “employed in doing some slight work, such as weeding canes, and\npicking small bundles of grass.” By the 7th or 8th month, however, he advised that\n“no duty whatever should be required from them.” Despite this seeming concession,\nThomas’s language reveals a deep mistrust of enslaved women in their final trimester\nof pregnancy. He remarked, “I mention this as an indulgence which ought to be\ngranted to them by way of encouragement to them to go out of their full time, and\nnot from conceiving that moderate exercise is by any means improper for pregnant\nwomen, as I am decidedly of the contrary opinion, being fully sensible, that the\nleading too sedentary a life is often the cause of much mischief to them” [ 6 In contrast, medical treatises from the same period directed at the care of pregnant\nWhite European women reflected a markedly different level of care and concern. For\nexample, the Edinburgh Practice or Physic, Surgery, and Midwifery 8 9 While every precaution was taken to prevent miscarriages in White woman, physicians\nclaimed that Black women intentionally sought to terminate their pregnancies,\nallegedly motivated by the belief that “pregnancy [was] an evil.” By the early\n1800s, the stigma attached to enslaved Black women being careless with their bodies\nand its functions was very common in both medical treatises written by physicians\nwith experience on plantations. Dr. Collins wrote in his plantation manual,\n“Abortions, excited by the art of the negro herself, arise from her considering\npregnancy as an evil, and children as incumbrances” [ 7 Abortion, Maternal Tenderness, and Racialized Disease Categories Robert Thomas’s disease descriptions othered enslaved Black women by casting them as\nmorally deficient and incapable of maternal tenderness, thereby reinforcing their\nexclusion from White feminine norms. His entry on Of the Whites 6 6 In the “Causes” section of the same disease, Thomas continued to racialize the\ndiagnosis by separating the causes he attributed to enslaved Black women and\nso-called “delicate” women. He listed the main causes as, “Every thing that\noccasions a relaxation of the parts…difficult and tedious labours, repeated\nmiscarriages, immoderate flows of the menses…and evacuations of all kinds, are the\ngeneral causes.” Thomas ended this section by specifying that, “Delicate women that\nare of lax fibres, and those who remove from cold climates to become inhabitants of\nwarm ones, are frequently afflicted with the whites” [ 6 6 unintended Delicate intentional Moreover, Thomas presented the illness of “delicate women” as the result of\nenvironmental change (specifically, the transition from cold to warm climates)\nrather than any personal failing. 7 10 Of the Whites Medical discourse during the 18th and 19th centuries deployed the language of\nfemininity to reinforce both racialized and socio-economic hierarchies,\nsystematically excluding enslaved Black women from prevailing ideals of womanhood.\nPhysicians like Thomas held enslaved women responsible for their own illnesses.\nThese conditions were attributed to presumed moral failings and innate biological\ndeficiencies. Central to this exclusion was the construct of “delicacy”— a term\nreserved for middle- to upper-class White women, whose identities were socially and\nmedically framed around fragility, vulnerability, and dependence. These women were\nunderstood to require protection and care, a framing that legitimized extensive\nmedical intervention. In contrast, enslaved Black women were viewed solely through\nthe lens of utility: their bodies were constructed as laboring and reproductive\nmachines, inherently robust, and undeserving of nuanced care or medical sympathy.\nWhile poor White women might be excluded from the category of delicacy due to\nsocio-economic status, Black women were categorically denied access to this\nframework because of deeply embedded assumptions about racialized differences. The\nresult was a medical logic that positioned vulnerability, and therefore eligibility\nfor care, as a privilege of socio-economic and racialized status, one entirely\ninaccessible to Black women. Through this rhetoric, Thomas constructed a medical divide, based on assumptions of\nmorality, between White and Black women, reinforcing broader ideologies of\nracialized and gendered difference and maintaining the social and economic\nstratification of the period. Even under the “Treatment” section of the disease, the\nlanguage Thomas employed clearly referred only to White women. In the final\nparagraph of the section, he wrote, “Women that are afflicted with the Whites should\nnot indulge in an [ sic 6 6 Diagnostic Exclusion and Medical Erasure Medical literature in the West Indies further reinforced racialized and gendered\nhierarchies through the diagnosis and treatment of Chlorosis Obstructed Menses 11 Chlorosis 12 13 In his 1731 medical treatise, De Morbis Cutaneis Chlorosis Scotch 14 In stark contrast to White women, enslaved Black women who exhibited the same\nsymptoms were excluded from diagnoses like Chlorosis Chlorosis 8 Chlorosis Chlorosis dirt-eating 9 Alongside this diagnostic exclusion, physicians and plantation authorities further\ndehumanized enslaved people by relegating behaviors like dirt-eating dirt-eating 5 dirt-eating dirt-eating 10 Many plantation owners and managers in Jamaica saw dirt-eating dirt-eating 15 dirt-eating 11 The “habit” of dirt-eating Cachexia Africana Chlorosis Chlorosis Cachexia\nAfricana Robert Thomas provides a clear example of this exclusion. In his writings, he\nacknowledged that enslaved Black women could present with the classic symptoms\nassociated with Chlorosis Chlorosis Obstructed Menses Chlorosis Chlorosis Of the Whites This exclusion extended beyond diagnostic labels and also revealed the racialized\nlogic of care through the treatment itself. White women presenting with symptoms of Chlorosis dirt-eating 6 dirt-eating Obstructed Menses Chlorosis In his 1809 medical treatise, Thomas explicitly argued that enslaved Black women\ncould not suffer from Chlorosis Cachexia Africana 16 Chlorosis Medical texts further racialized the condition by specifying that Chlorosis Chlorosis 17 Chlorosis The erasure of Black women from Chlorosis treatment Obstructed Menses Contemporary Legacies of Historical Medical Bias The history of medical neglect toward Black women is not confined to the past; it\ncontinues to shape clinical encounters in the present day. The long-standing\nassumptions developed by 18th- and 19th-century White male physicians in the British\nWest Indies (namely, that Black women were biologically different, morally\ndeficient, and more capable of enduring pain) established a framework of “medical\nothering” that persists in today’s healthcare systems. A 2022 study titled “We’re\nNot Taken Seriously” starkly illustrates this enduring legacy: 92% of Black women\nsurveyed reported not being listened to by medical staff, and 94% felt they received\npoorer service than White patients [ 18 18 This article has shown how that marginalization was constructed and reinforced in\nmedical literature and plantation policy: through the systematic exclusion of Black\nwomen from diagnoses like Chlorosis Understanding this historical context is critical. The racialized health disparities\nthat persist today (particularly in Black maternal mortality, reproductive health,\nand diseases like cervical cancer) are not accidental. They are the product of a\nmedical tradition that has long privileged Whiteness as the default for care and\ndiagnosis while rendering Black women medically invisible. The stories of enslaved\nBlack women, their misdiagnoses, and their erasure from medical concern must be\ncentered in our historical narratives if we are to challenge the racial biases that\nstill define medical practice today. Only by acknowledging the deep roots of these\ninjustices can we begin to dismantle them. 1 19 2 20 3 21 4 5 Clostridium tetani 22 6 23 26 7 8 Chlorosis Chlorosis 9 10 dirt-eating 11 geophagy Author Contributions VMR conceptualized the research, conducted the archival analysis, and wrote the\nmanuscript.
