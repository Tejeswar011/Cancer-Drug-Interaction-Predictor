The reduction of beneficial bacteria and the increase of opportunistic pathogens may promote the transformation of benign adenomas into malignant adenocarcinomas ( Wang et al., 2012 Zhang et al., 2018 Fusobacterium nucleatum Warren et al., 2013 Proença et al., 2018 Flanagan et al., 2014 Grivennikov et al., 2012 Yu et al., 2015 The treatment of CRC mainly includes surgical treatment, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, etc ( Argiles et al., 2020 Argiles et al., 2020 Figure 1 Wang Y. et al., 2020 Rauf et al., 2021 Figure 1 Diagram of anti-tumor effect of Berberine. Berberine, a naturally occurring alkaloid with diverse biological activities, has demonstrated remarkable potential in anti-tumor research. This compound effectively suppresses the initiation and progression of various malignancies through complex and interconnected molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways. Its multifaceted actions precisely target multiple critical pathways, such as inhibiting abnormal tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion; promoting tumor cell apoptosis and autophagic cell death; and arresting aberrant cell cycle progression. This orchestrated multi-target synergy establishes berberine as a promising translational candidate in contemporary anti-tumor drug discovery. Diagram of a human body with labeled areas for various cancers, including thyroid, lung, esophageal, liver, pancreatic, gastric, bone, and colon cancer. An inset shows a molecule labeled ”berberine\" connected to actions like inhibiting proliferation, migration, invasion, promoting apoptosis, autophagy, and blocking the cell cycle. In this review, we summarize the sequential effects of BBR on the Fn-induced intestinal adenoma-carcinoma cascade from a dynamic perspective and its regulatory mechanism in the occurrence of CRC for the first time. This study is expected to provide preclinical evidence for the use of BBR in the prevention and treatment of CRC, and the development of related new drugs will further reduce the incidence and mortality of CRC. 2 Intestinal adenoma-carcinoma transformation induced by Fn The formation of CRC is not a sudden event, but a process that goes through normal mucosa, mucosal epithelial hyperplasia, adenomatous polyps, gradually increasing adenomatous polyps, colorectal cancer ( Figure 2 Lucas et al., 2017 Kostic et al., 2013 Kostic et al., 2013 Komiya et al., 2019 Han et al., 2004 Han et al., 2000 Figure 2 The evolution of colorectal adenoma-carcinoma progression. Under the long-term synergistic effects of both intrinsic and extrinsic pathogenic factors, the normal colonic mucosal epithelium initially undergoes atypical hyperplasia, characterized by abnormally accelerated proliferation rates, architectural disorganization, and loss of cellular polarity. With progressive injury accumulation, the mucosal epithelium evolves into precancerous lesions such as tubular adenomas, villous adenomas, or tubulovillous adenomas. During the adenomatous stage, accumulating genetic mutations drive progression from low-grade to high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, marked by significantly enhanced cytological atypia and emerging invasive potential. Upon breaching the basement membrane and infiltrating the submucosa and deeper tissues—concomitant with acquired capabilities for vascular and lymphatic invasion—the adenomatous lesion ultimately completes its malignant transformation into colonic adenocarcinoma. Illustration showing the progression from normal colon tissue through precancerous adenomatous polyps to colorectal cancer stages 0, I/II, and III/IV. Different layers of the colon, including mucosal, submucosal, muscular, and serosal, are labeled on the right. Arrows indicate lymphatic and hematogenous metastasis, with angiogenesis depicted in cancer stages. With the accumulation of Fn, the balance of intestinal microbiota is disrupted, triggering innate immune responses and activating signaling pathways such as janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT), mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB). At the same time, it induces the secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-21, IL-22, IL-24, IL-31 and CD40 ( Kostic et al., 2013 Yu et al., 2015 Han et al., 2000 Cavallucci et al., 2022 Lin et al., 2020 Ternes et al., 2022 Pharmacological studies have shown that BBR can exert anti-Fn effects while preventing and treating CRC through diverse mechanisms or pathways. 3 Stage 1: delaying the Fn 3.1 BBR inhibits the migration of Fn Fn naturally resides in the oral and other mucosal areas of both humans and animals, and plays an essential role in the formation of dental biofilm ( Brennan and Garrett, 2019 Brennan and Garrett, 2019 Komiya et al., 2019 Min/+ Kostic et al., 2013 Kostic et al., 2013 Bullman et al., 2017 Yang and Shamsuddin, 1996 Abed et al., 2016 Fukamachi et al., 2015 Xie et al., 2012 Feng et al., 2018 McCoy et al., 2013 3.2 BBR prevents the intestinal colonization of Fn The adhesion and colonization of bacteria are prerequisites for their functional activity. Upon reaching the intestine, Fn secretes adhesin FadA with starch-like properties. FadA is divided into intact pre-FadA and secreted mature FadA (mFadA), with pre-FadA located in the inner membrane and mFadA secreted outside the bacteria ( Xu et al., 2007 Rubinstein et al., 2013 Han et al., 2005 Palaghia et al., 2016 Rubinstein et al., 2013 Abed et al., 2016 Coppenhagen-Glazer et al., 2015 Sun et al., 1988 Izadparast et al., 2022 Deng et al., 2022 Gu et al., 2011 3.3 BBR regulates the intestinal microbiota imbalance caused by Fn The changes in the gut microbiota are associated with the earliest stages of tumor development ( Sanapareddy et al., 2012 Chen et al., 2013 Yu et al., 2015 Yu et al., 2015 Yu et al., 2015 Xie et al., 2011 Mana et al., 2021 Xie et al., 2011 In summary, BBR effectively impedes the migration and colonization of Fn within the intestine and suppresses Fn-induced dysbiosis through its multi-layered synergistic actions: interception at the source, intestinal clearance, barrier reinforcement, and microbiota modulation. Consequently, BBR exerts a crucial preventive intervention during the early stages of CRC development ( Figure 3 Figure 3 The mechanism underlying Berberine action in stage 1. Berberine can directly kill Fusobacterium nucleatum Diagram illustrating the pathways of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) from the oral cavity to the intestinal cavity. It shows the gastrointestinal and bloodborne pathways, the effect of berberine, epithelial cell interactions, and the impact on gut microbiota balance. Key elements include mucus, crypt cells, beneficial and pathogenic bacteria, and proteins like E-Cadherin and CEACAM1. 4 Stage 2: delaying the Fn-induced intestinal adenoma-carcinoma transformation 4.1 BBR slows down intestinal inflammation Under normal circumstances, the microbiota in the gut is separated from the epithelial tissue by a dense layer of mucus. The presence of this mucus layer allows the body to tolerate foreign antigens, thereby limiting inflammatory reactions. However, with the invasion of Fn into the gut mucus layer, the biofilm it forms can promote chronic mucosal inflammation ( Dejea et al., 2014 Min/+ Kostic et al., 2013 Yu et al., 2015 Wang and Fang, 2023 Fang and Richardson, 2005 Yu et al., 2009 Yu et al., 2015 Yu et al., 2015 4.2 BBR inhibits aberrant crypt foci ACF is a cluster of aberrant glandular structures within the colonic mucosa that forms prior to the development of colon polyps. ACF is considered one of the smallest and earliest histopathological phenomena observable under a microscope during the process of CRC formation and is increasingly recognized as an early indicator of carcinogenesis ( Roncucci et al., 2000 Wang and Fang, 2023 Min/+ Brennan et al., 2021 Yu et al., 2015 Dejea et al., 2014 Rubinstein et al., 2019 MacLeod, 2013 Fukutake et al., 1998 Wu et al., 2012 4.3 BBR reverses adenoma-carcinoma progression Inflammation is a driving factor in the development of colorectal adenoma ( Yan et al., 2022 Huang et al., 2019 McCoy et al., 2013 McCoy et al., 2013 Chen et al., 2013 Mehta et al., 2017 Yan et al., 2022 Chen Y. X. et al., 2020 Min/+ Zhang et al., 2013 Zhang et al., 2012 Collectively, BBR establishes a triple defensive strategy comprising the suppression of the pro-inflammatory microenvironment, blockade of early neoplastic marker (ACF) formation, and delay of adenoma progression. This strategy effectively disrupts the Fn-driven intestinal inflammatory cascade and oncogenic signaling pathways (notably the JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK, and Wnt/β-catenin pathways), thereby providing potent intervention at the critical stage of the colorectal adenoma-carcinoma transition ( Figure 4 Figure 4 The mechanism underlying Berberine action in stage 2. Berberine alleviates intestinal inflammation, inhibits aberrant crypt foci and reverses adenoma progression through multiple pathways, such as reducing the secretion of immune cytokines, blocking the JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways induced by Fn. Illustration of intestinal mucosa showing stages of inflammation, aberrant crypt foci, and adenoma progression. Epithelial and goblet cells are labeled, showing interactions with bacteria and signaling molecules like IL-21, IL-17A, and TNF-alpha. Pathways involving JAK/STAT, MAPK, and Wnt/β-catenin are depicted. Berberine is indicated at the bottom, pointing to its role in influencing these processes. 5 Stage 3: delaying the Fn-associated CRC progression 5.1 BBR inhibits the proliferation and cell cycle progression of CRC cells In CRC, Fn infection can activate the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)/NF-κB signaling pathway, upregulate IL-17F, IL-21, IL-22 and macrophage inflammatory protein-3 alpha (MIP-3a) to promote tumor cell proliferation ( Figure 5 Yang et al., 2017 Han et al., 2005 Han, 2015 Rubinstein et al., 2013 Guo et al., 2013 Rubinstein et al., 2019 Guo et al., 2013 Wu et al., 2012 Wu et al., 2012 Cai et al., 2014 Figure 5 The 3D spatial mechanistic network underlying Berberine's suppression of Fusobacterium nucleatum Flowchart depicting the pathway of berberine from the oral cavity to the intestinal cavity, with effects on inflammation, aberrant crypt foci, adenoma, and carcinoma. It highlights interactions with E-cadherin, Wnt/β-catenin, JAK/STAT, and MAPK/ERK pathways and includes molecular structures. 5.2 BBR inhibits the invasion and metastasis of CRC cells Phenotypic plasticity serves as the basis for local invasion and distant metastasis of CRC. With the accumulation and invasion of Fn in the intestine, vimentin is upregulated while the expression of E-cadherin is reduced ( Chen Y. et al., 2020 Bullman et al., 2017 Wang Q. et al., 2020 Zeuner et al., 2014 Ruan et al., 2017 Gong et al., 2020 Liu et al., 2016 Ni et al., 2022 5.3 BBR inhibits the immune escape and drug resistance of CRC cells Fn can create an immunosuppressive microenvironment in tumors by selectively recruiting Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs), Tumor-Associated Neutrophils (TANs), Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) ( Kostic et al., 2013 Mantovani et al., 2011 Jiang et al., 2023 Gur et al., 2015 Jiang et al., 2023 Lu et al., 2019 Yu et al., 2014 Su et al., 2015 Yu et al., 2014 Piyanuch et al., 2007 Wu et al., 2012 During the advanced stages of CRC development, BBR directly targets tumor cells. Through multiple mechanisms—including blocking oncogenic pathways to inhibit proliferation (core pathway: Wnt/β-catenin), reversing the EMT phenotype to suppress metastasis, and overcoming immune evasion and drug resistance to promote apoptosis—BBR effectively curbs Fn-driven tumor malignant progression, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. 6 Innovation points 6.1 The therapeutic efficacy of BBR is dynamic and involves the entire process Compared to traditional anti-CRC drugs, the therapeutic efficacy of BBR has continuity. Targeting the classic pathogenesis model of colorectal adenoma-carcinoma transformation mediated by Fn, BBR can dynamically intervene in the entire process from a time dimension. From preventing the migration and settlement of Fn from the oral cavity to the intestine, to regulating the imbalance of intestinal flora and inflammation caused by Fn, and then inhibiting the progression of adenomas and adenocarcinomas promoted by Fn, BBR not only coincides with the drug circulation path and bacterial migration path, but also covers multiple stages of CRC from prevention to treatment. In the prevention stage, drugs for chemoprevention of colorectal adenomas include Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), statins, metformin and folic acid, but ideal drugs are still to be discovered due to adverse reactions and uncertain efficacy ( Veettil et al., 2019 Renelus et al., 2021 Soltani et al., 2019 NSAIDs reduce CRC risk by inhibiting COX and suppressing prostaglandin-mediated inflammation ( Ganduri et al., 2022 Sikavi et al., 2024 Han et al., 2023 Hevroni et al., 2020 Higurashi et al., 2016 Lee et al., 2021 In the treatment stage, traditional chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy require new drugs or treatment methods as supplements due to serious side effects or drug resistance that cannot be avoided. Compared to these agents, BBR exhibits a unique advantage characterized by a comprehensive pharmacological profile targeting the entire cascade of CRC development, integrating metabolic, immunological, and microbiota regulatory functions ( Wang X. et al., 2024 Chen Y. X. et al., 2020 Xiong et al., 2022 Chao et al., 2020 Zhang et al., 2019 Future research should prioritize randomized controlled trials evaluating BBR monotherapy for adenoma prevention and the development of precision stratification strategies for its use based on Fn infection status. 6.2 BBR has different spatial levels of action Natural medicines and their derivatives often have complex mechanisms of action. Previous research on their anti-cancer mechanisms has mainly focused on the cellular level, analyzing individual targets or pathways, or constructing a component-target-pathway flat network through network pharmacology to predict and reveal the material basis and mechanism of drug action ( Yuan et al., 2022 Veettil et al., 2019 Bilder et al., 2021 7 Conclusion and prospective The occurrence and development of CRC is a multi-step process caused by genetic and environmental factors, in which the intestinal flora, including Fn, is a special environmental risk factor. Therefore, how to delay or reverse the “normal mucosa-precancerous lesion-CRC” trilogy caused by Fn is the key to preventing and treating CRC. BBR is a major component of many medicinal plants and has long been used in traditional medicine as an over-the-counter drug for treating intestinal infections and diarrhea ( Habtemariam, 2016 Wu et al., 2024 Wang M. et al., 2024 Kang et al., 2024 At present, some anti-tumor drug development targeting BBR is underway ( Table 1 Chen Y. X. et al., 2020 Table 1 Clinical studies related to BBR in Clinicaltrials.gov  NCT Number  Study Title  Conditions  Enrollment  Primary Outcome Measures  Phase  Study Type  Status  First Posted NCT05596214 Combination of Curcumin and Berberine Therapy in the Treatment of Post Acute Diverticulitis Symptomatic Uncomplicated Diverticular Disease (SUDD) Diverticulitis 40 Percentage of patients reaching clinical response after initiation of therapy Phase 2 Interventional Recruiting 27-Oct-22 NCT05014334 Study on The Efficacy and Safety of Berberine-containing Triple Therapy in Helicobacter Pylori Helicobacter Pylori 300 H pylori Phase 4 Interventional Completed 20-Aug-21 NCT04697186 Helicobacter Pylori Dyspepsia, Chronic Gastritis, Gastric Cancer, Helicobacter 524 Helicobacter pylori eradication Phase 4 Interventional Completed 06-Jan-21 NCT04543643 Endoscopic and Microbiological Assessment of the Effect of Carvedilol Combined With Berberine on GOV in Cirrhosis Cirrhosis Due to Hepatitis B, 288 The progression Incidence of esophageal varices Phase 3 Interventional Not yet recruiting 10-Sep-20 NCT03609892 Helicobacter Rescue Therapy With Berberine Plus Amoxicillin Quadruple Therapy vs. Tetracycline Plus Furazolidone Quadruple Therapy Gastric Ulcer, Chronic Gastritis, Gastric Cancer, Helicobacter 658 Helicobacter pylori eradication Phase 4 Interventional Completed 01-Aug-18 NCT03420976 Novel Supplement-based Therapy for the Treatment of Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth Small Intestinal Bacterial 0 Lactulose Breath Test Early Phase 1 Interventional Withdrawn 05-Feb-18 NCT03333265 Primary Chemoprevention of Familial Adenomatous Polyposis With Berberine Hydrochloride Colorectal Adenomas 100 The numbers and diameters of colorectal adenomas Phase 2, Phase 3 Interventional Completed 06-Nov-17 NCT03281096 A Research of Berberine Hydrochloride to Prevent Colorectal Adenomas in Patients With Previous Colorectal Cancer Colorectal Adenomas 1000 The colorectal adenoma incidence rate Phase 2, Phase 3 Interventional Completed 13-Sep-17 NCT03198572 Efficacy and Safety of Berberine in Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis 120 NAFLD activity score Phase 4 Interventional Unknown status 26-Jun-17 NCT02962245 Efficacy of Treatment With Berberine to Maintain Remission in Ulcerative Colitis Ulcerative Colitis 0 Annual Recurrence Rate Phase 4 Interventional Withdrawn 11-Nov-16 NCT02633930 Helicobacter Pylori Eradication With Berberine Quadruple Therapy vs. Clarithromycin Quadruple Therapy Gastritis, Peptic Ulcer, Dyspepsia 566 Helicobacter pylori eradication Phase 4 Interventional Completed 17-Dec-15 NCT02365480 Berberine Chloride in Preventing Colorectal Cancer in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis in Remission Ulcerative Colitis 18 Standard clinical tests Phase 1 Interventional Completed 19-Feb-15 NCT02296021 Helicobacter Pylori Eradication With Berberine Quadruple Therapy vs. Bismuth-containing Quadruple Therapy Gastritis, Peptic Ulcer, Dyspepsia 612 Helicobacter pylori eradication Phase 4 Interventional Completed 20-Nov-14 NCT02226185 Study of Berberine Hydrochloride in Prevention of Colorectal Adenomas Recurrence Colorectal Adenoma 1108 Recurrence rates of colorectal adenoma Phase 2, Phase 3 Interventional Completed 27-Aug-14 NCT00633282 Role of Pioglitazone and Berberine in Treatment of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 184 Improved metabolic parameters Phase 2 Interventional Completed 12-Mar-08 Critically, the current body of clinical evidence supporting BBR for CRC prevention and treatment exhibits notable limitations. First, the vast majority of conducted studies are single-center trials, typically constrained by limited sample sizes and relatively homogeneous patient populations. Second, despite the completion of multiple clinical trials, their final results often lack timely or complete public disclosure. Furthermore, key questions concerning the validation of BBR's mechanism of action in humans, the optimization of dosing regimens, and the synergistic or antagonistic effects when combined with existing standard therapies remain inadequately explored and lack robust supporting data. This article reviews the regulatory mechanisms of BBR in CRC development, which may exert its effects through delaying Fn (Stage 1), reversing Fn-induced intestinal adenoma-carcinoma transition (Stage 2), and remedying Fn-associated CRC (Stage 3). Experimental evidence and clinical studies have shown that BBR can prevent the migration and settlement of Fn in the intestine and regulate the dysbiosis caused by Fn. In the pre-cancerous stage, BBR can slow down intestinal inflammation, inhibit the progression of ACF and adenomas. In the tumor stage, BBR plays a positive role in CRC proliferation, cycle regulation, invasion, metastasis, immune escape, and drug resistance. Among them, the E-cadherin, Wnt/β-catenin, JAK/STAT, and MAPK/ERK pathways may be key to BBR's prevention of Fn-induced CRC. These signaling pathways do not operate in isolation but rather function through intricate crosstalk to collectively mediate BBR's core protective effects against Fn-driven CRC progression across all disease stages, establishing a foundational pathway network spanning the entire pathological continuum. Through this coordinated regulation, BBR exerts sustained efficacy at distinct phases of Fn-driven CRC pathogenesis—from early-phase epithelial barrier impairment and inflammatory activation, through intermediate precancerous lesion progression, to late-stage tumor malignancy. It is worth noting that the human microbiome contains 100 trillion cells, 10 times the number of human cells, and its unique encoded genes are 100 times that of the human genome ( Qin et al., 2010 Janney et al., 2020 Since the microbiome plays an important role in human health, caution should be exercised when dealing with symbiotic bacteria such as Fn, rather than simply seeking to eliminate them. The crude disruption of the symbiotic relationship of co-evolution may have unexpected consequences. For example, Helicobacter pylori Blaser, 1997 2010 In addition, different states of the body may produce different results against the same pathogenic microorganisms. For example, microsatellite instability (MSI) status may affect differential immune responses to Fn. In CRC with high MSI status, Fn presence demonstrates a negative correlation with tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte levels, whereas a positive correlation is observed in patients with low-MSI CRC ( Hamada et al., 2018 Author contributions DB: Writing – original draft.
