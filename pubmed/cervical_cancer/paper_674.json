Characterized by symptoms like erythema, edema, increased temperature, and pain, inflammation plays a central role in the healing process [ 1 4 5 6 7 8 7 9 10 11 12 7 13 14 15 Angiogenesis is associated with Chronic inflammation in various pathological conditions by blood vessel proliferation and enlargement and changes in vessel phenotype. Key pro-inflammatory cytokines—such as TNF-α and IL-1β—are known to induce endothelial proliferation and migration. Another link between inflammation and angiogenesis is provided Inflammatory mediators (e.g., prostaglandins from COX-2 activity) directly upregulate VEGF expression by the prostaglandin E series through COX-2 in several cell types. [ 16 17 20 21 33 17 34 35 In the present study, a molecular hybridization strategy was used to develop novel hybrids of phenoxyacetohydrazide by introducing benzyl and morpholine moieties to enhance their anti-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory activities. These modifications at the structural level were logically developed and implemented in a stepwise manner to enhance drug-like characters such as lipophilicity, receptor affinity, and pharmacokinetic profiles. Directed synthesis of morpholine-substituted compounds was driven by the predicted relationship between structural attributes and improved bioactivity . Materials and methods Chemistry The chemicals used in this study were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was carried out on silica plates backed with aluminum, and the spots were visualized under UV light. Melting points were determined using a Thomas Hoover capillary melting point apparatus equipped with a digital thermometer. Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded using the potassium bromide (KBr) pellet method on an FT-IR Shimadzu 8300 spectrophotometer. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were measured on a Bruker 400 MHz NMR spectrophotometer in DMSO, with chemical shifts reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane as a reference. Mass spectra were obtained using a VG70-70H spectrophotometer, and major fragments are reported with their relative intensities in parentheses. Elemental composition results obtained through X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis were within 0.4% of theoretical values.

Protein structures underwent standard bioinformatics pre-processing, which included the It involved adding missing hydrogen atoms and incomplete residues since these components are very essential in maintaining the protein chain’s structural integrity. Further, specific protonation states were assigned, considering a physiological pH of 7.2, thus enabling more realistic modelling of interactions. A crucial part of the preparation was the removal of all heteroatoms, which could interfere with the docking simulations. The energy minimization and geometry optimization using the CHARMM force field was indispensable. The smart minimizer technique, which combines steepest descent and conjugate gradient algorithms, ensured that the potential energy of the system was reduced while keeping the proteins structurally stable deletion of crystallographic water molecules and energy minimization to yield stable conformations acceptable for docking simulations. Compound 6e 37 38 Ligand preparation The two-dimensional structure of compound 6e was built using ACD/ChemSketch and minimize its free energy of the of ligand was done in Steepest Descent and Conjugate Gradient methods using Discovery Studio 2024 Client Software Inc.) The minimized structure was imported into the MOE software. The two-dimensional structure was then converted to a three-dimensional model, and appropriate protonation states at physiological pH were assigned.

Swiss albino female rats, matured by 150−160 g were housed under standard research Center which to encourage the eating routine of animal food and water which is not obligatory in the complete analysis. The Rats were kept up at the room temperature (27 °C ± 2oC) with excellent ventilation for a 12 h day/night cycle. Swiss albino rats (150 gm. Each) were utilized for the current examination. They were encouraged with a standard pellet diet and for which water was not obligatory. All the animals were acclimatized for things like a multi-week identity before the trial session. All animal experimentation was endorsed by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC), (Approval ID: HU-PHARM-ETHICS-2024–001). College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Hajjah University, Yemen. Efforts were made to minimize animal suffering, including the use of ketamine/xylazine anesthesia for invasive procedures. Humane endpoints were applied, and animals were euthanized by sodium pentobarbital (≥100 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) followed by cervical dislocation, as per ethical guidelines. Determination of the Lethal Dose 50 (LD50) of the 6e-h The acute lethal dose 50 (LD50) toxicity test is performed in rodents as part of the safety assessment of many substances. The LD50 (median lethal dose) test is usually the first test conducted for every chemical before further toxicity tests are carried out. It is used for estimating the potential hazards of chemicals on humans [ 41 11 13 Induction of alkali burn-induced corneal neovascularization. Corneal neovascularization (CNV) was induced through alkali injury following a standard protocol with minor modifications [ 13 Group I Group II Group III 6e An alkali burn was induced in the right eye of animals in Groups II and III after administering general anesthesia via intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (1 ml/kg) and chlorpromazine (1 ml/kg). A 3-mm diameter piece of Whatman filter paper soaked in 4 ml of 1 mol/L NaOH was applied to the center of the cornea for 30 seconds, followed by irrigation of the treated cornea with 60 ml of normal saline. Group II animals were subsequently treated with 1 µg of rVEGF applied to the right eye. The extent of CNV was quantified through photographic documentation 48 hours after the alkali burn and rVEGF treatment. For Group III animals, the alkali-burned cornea was treated with compound 6e 6e 6e Carrageenan-induced Paw Edema in rat Female Swiss albino rats were selected for the study to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of compound 6e 25 Group 1 Group 2 Group 3 Group 4 6e Prior to the experiment, animals in Group 2 were administered saline (5 mL/kg), animals in Group 3 received the positive control indomethacin (10 mg/kg), and animals in Group 4 were treated with compound 6e After this period, animals in the 2, 3 and 4 groups were in intraperitoneal with 100 µl of 2% carrageenan into the right hind paw to induce edema. The right paws of all experimental animals were then observed at different time intervals (2, 3 and 5 hours post-carrageenan injection), and the paw volume was measured using a digital plethysmometer to assess the degree of edema.

Its conformational rigidity might be important for optimal interaction with the target protein(s) involved in the inflammatory response. Also, the benzyl group at the 4-position of the morpholine ring enhances lipophilicity, potentially improving membrane permeability and facilitating interaction with intracellular targets. The aromatic ring also offers the possibility of π-π stacking interactions with target proteins. Moreover, the butanoyl chain introduces flexibility and length between the morpholine core and the fluorophenoxy group. This spacer crucial for achieving the optimal distance and orientation for interaction with the binding site of the target protein. The length of the spacer influences the compound’s ability to reach and interact with specific regions of the target. The fluorophenoxy group introduces several important properties as Increases lipophilicity, potentially improving membrane permeability and bioavailability. So, the fluorine atom which is electron-withdrawing, which may subtly alter the electronic distribution within the molecule, potentially influencing its interaction with target proteins. This affect binding affinity and selectivity. Further, the fluorine substitution can enhance metabolic stability by reducing the susceptibility to enzymatic degradation. This led to a longer half-life and improved efficacy. In contrast, these same substitutions were associated with a higher predicted probability of blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and P-glycoprotein inhibition, both of which may contribute to increased predicted toxicity and a higher likelihood of drug–drug interactions. Additionally, derivatives with multiple rotatable bonds and higher molecular flexibility tended to show reduced Caco-2 permeability and moderate acute toxicity predictions, as indicated in Table 1 6e Fig 1 10.1371/journal.pone.0330731.t001 Table 1 Retrieved from the PDB database are the physiochemical characteristics of 1RV6.

Its molecular refractivity (112.43) and 11 rotatable bonds indicate potential for favorable target interactions. ADMET predictions indicate high human intestinal absorption (HIA + , 0.9475) and blood-brain barrier penetration (BBB + , 0.9113), though the low Caco-2 permeability (0.7022) introduces uncertainty. However, the prediction suggests low Caco-2 permeability (Caco2-, 0.7022 probability), which seems contradictory to the HIA prediction and warrants further investigation. The carcinogenicity prediction is non-required (0.5288 probability), indicating a moderate uncertainty in this aspect. The acute oral toxicity prediction classifies it as class III (0.6673 probability), suggesting moderate toxicity. The predicted LD50 (2.4760 mol/kg in rats) requires careful consideration and experimental validation as shown in Table 5 10.1371/journal.pone.0330731.t005 Table 5 Toxicity profile analysis of compound 6e insights from ADMET “SAR” predictions for safer drug development.
