BV is associated with an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, cervicitis, HIV infection and other obstetric complications like premature rupture of membranes, preterm labour and post-partum endometritis. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of BV among women of childbearing age living with, and without HIV in Nigeria. Methods This was a cross-sectional study conducted among non-pregnant women of childbearing age (18-49 years), living with and without HIV in Lagos, Nigeria. Participants were counselled and informed consent was obtained before vaginal swabs were collected. BV was defined using Amsel’s criteria, which uses 3 out of 4 diagnostic criteria to diagnose BV and Nugent scoring. Data analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 27.0. Results Two hundred and fifty-two (252) women of childbearing age including 198 (78.6%) living with HIV (WLHIV), and 54 (21.4%) without HIV were included in the study. The mean age was 41 ± 6 years with a range from 21 to 49 years. The overall prevalence rate of BV was 36.1%. Prevalence of BV was higher in WLHIV (37.9%) compared to those without HIV (29.6%) although this was not statistically significant (OR = 1.36; 95% CI: 0.67 – 2.79). Prevalence of BV among HIV-positive women with CD4 > 200 cells/mm 3 3 Conclusion The findings of this study indicate that women of reproductive age are equally susceptible to BV irrespective of their HIV status, with multiple sexual partners identified as a significant risk factor. These results underscore the need for targeted public health interventions aimed at reducing the prevalence of BV within this population, thereby reducing the risk of transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted disease among this group.

The study was carried out at the HIV clinic of the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR), Yaba, Lagos State, Nigeria from July to September 2022. Women living with HIV attending the NIMR HIV clinic during the study period who gave their consent were purposively recruited for the study while HIV sero-negative apparently healthy women were recruited during the institutional cervical cancer screening outreach for the comparison group. The comparison group were screened for HIV in accordance with the national testing algorithm using a rapid diagnostic test kit to confirm their negative status before sample collection. All participants provided a written informed consent and were tested for pregnancy before being included to participate in the study. Structured questionnaires were administered to the participants to obtain information on socio-demographics, medical history and risk factors for Bacterial Vaginosis. Microbiology testing was carried out at the Microbiology Department of the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research Yaba, Lagos State. Inclusion criteria required that participants were HIV sero-positive, non-pregnant, non-menopausal women between the ages 18–49 attending the HIV clinic of NIMR or HIV sero-negative, apparently healthy, non-pregnant, not menopausal women between the ages 18–49 recruited from the outreach program. Individuals who were on antibiotics therapy or immunosuppressive drugs, currently pregnant, younger than 18 or older than 49, menopausal and inability to provide informed consent were excluded. Socio-demographic variables Demographic, behavioral and clinical information were collected from all participants via interview using questionnaires including age, marital status, education level, general residential location as well as general medical history. The questionnaire was developed by a multidisciplinary team of professionals comprising microbiologists, social scientists, biostatisticians, and clinicians by reviewing relevant literatures and questionnaires used in similar studies [ 3 13 22 Sample size determination The sample size for this study was determined using BV prevalence of 15.2% from a previous study in Nigeria [ 23 2  Z = Standard normal deviation, usually set at 1.96 at 95% confidence level. P = Estimated BV prevalence. q = (1-p) = the proportion of people without factor under study D = degree of precision (d = 0.05) The non-response rate was set at 20% of the sample size. The incorporation of a 20% attrition rate into the sample size calculation accounts for potential participant non-response during the study. This adjustment ensures that the final sample size remains robust and capable of providing reliable estimates of study outcomes, even in the presence of unforeseen challenges or Limitations. The minimum sample size for this study was therefore 238. Two hundred and fifty-two participants were purposively recruited for this study. The decision to use a higher sample size was further informed by a desire to ensure adequate statistical power for detecting potential differences or associations in the study’s outcomes. Sample collection Vaginal samples were collected from participants by the attending clinician. At the time of the speculum exam, swab samples were taken from the posterior fornix and lateral vaginal wall using PurFlock Ultra Sterile Flocked Swab Applicators with Tips (Fisher Scientific Company, Ottawa, Ontario). The vaginal pH was determined directly with the use of Combi 9 pH sticks placed on the posterior-vaginal fornix, after exposing the cervix with a sterile speculum. Two swab samples were collected, one for Gram stain (Nugent’s) scoring and a back-up sample. Amsel’s criteria This criteria uses 3 out of 4 diagnostic criteria to diagnose BV including thin, whitish discharge, a vaginal pH > 4.5, Whiff test (a fishy odour with the application of potassium hydroxide) and the presence of Clue cells on microscopy [ 24 1 Fig. 1 Gram stain pictures showing A B C Nugent score test for bacterial vaginosis The swab which is cotton-tipped was rolled on a slide and stained for Nugent score test. The Nugent score reflects the relative abundances of three kinds of bacterial cell morphotypes in Gram-stained thick film of vaginal smear viewed under high powered microscope. The appearance of the vaginal smear under the microscope was graded, with presence of large, Gram-positive rods ( Lactobacillus Gardnerella vaginalis Porphyromonas Peptostreptococcus Mobiluncus spp 25 2 Fig. 2 Nugent score grading of participants CD4 count Veinous blood was collected from participants living with HIV to ascertain their current CD4 count using the Sysmex CD4 easy count kit (Sysmex Partec GmbH, Germany). Statistical analysis plan Data was entered into an excel spreadsheet (Microsoft® Excel 365) and cleaned. Thereafter, it was imported into a Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS v27, IBM Corp., Chicago, IL) for analysis. Categorical data were summarized using descriptive statistics including frequencies, mean and standard deviation. Demographic characteristics that were significant for bivariate analysis were further subjected to multivariate analysis to find out factors associated with the study outcome. Comparison between variables was done using Chi-square at a significant level of p Results Two hundred and fifty-two (252) women of childbearing age including 198 (78.6%) WLHIV and 54 (21.4%) HIV sero-negative participants were included in the study. A higher percentage of participants (40.5%) were aged 40–44 years and none of the participants smoked or had a same sex partner. The study participants were of diverse ethnic origin with majority of them (43.7%) from the Southeastern part of the country. The mean age was 41 ± 6 years with a range from 21 to 49 years. In terms of education, over 75% of the participants had at least a secondary level of education with the majority (70.6%) of them married. Over half (61.5%) of the participants still saw their menstrual flow regularly with a couple of them (7.5%) reporting absence of menstruation. The prevalence rate of BV irrespective of HIV status was 36.1% (Fig. 1 1 2 Table 1 Demographics and clinical characteristics of women of childbearing age living with and without HIV ( n Variables

vaginosis (BV) is a common cause of vaginitis, increasing women’s risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV [ 26 26 22 27 28 Adolescent girls and young women from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), aged 15–24, has been known to be at substantial risk of acquiring HIV, accounting for 63% of all new HIV infections in 2021 [ 29 . 30 . 31 . 32 33 12 34 35 36 13 13 37 38 38 The associated risk factors of BV are generally poorly understood, and studies have reported conflicting risk factors. Some of the factors that have been associated with BV included demographic variables, behavioral and clinical characteristics of women [ 4 38 41 42 . 13 43 43 44 . 45 . 46 47 48 49 In this study, women who douched had a 1.7-fold increased risk of having BV than those that do not douche. Vaginal douching involves the process of flushing a product through the vagina by some women, often as an attempt to address vaginal discomfort or discharge [ 38 50 52 8 . 12 A higher prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV) was observed among women aged 20–24 (50%), widowed (60.0%), and divorced women (44.4%). This aligns with the findings by Ranjit et al . 27 . 31 . 53 Low CD4 cell count is an indication of weak immune function which is a key predisposing factor for opportunistic infections in people living with HIV [ 54 3 3 . 12 3 34 3 Limitations This study had some limitations that should be acknowledged. The sample size was limited due to the purposive sampling of patients who presented at the clinic within the study period and thus potentially restricted the generalizability of findings. Also, the control group was not matched to the test group but was instead recruited from a cervical screening outreach program, which may introduce selection bias hence increasing the risks of Type II error. Additionally, response bias remains a concern for most survey studies, as participants may provide socially desirable answers rather than reflecting their actual experiences. To mitigate this, we conducted pre-recruitment discussions, emphasizing the importance of accurate responses and reassuring participants that study findings would be shared with their physicians to support clinical management. This study did not assess an exhaustive list of potential risk factors, which may limit our ability to fully capture all determinants associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV). However, we focused on the most commonly reported and evidence-based risk factors identified in previous literature to ensure relevance and consistency in our analysis. The dichotomous nature of some of the questions may have limited the ability of participants to provide more nuanced insights. However, these questions were in most cases supported with a follow-up question to get more context. Menopausal status among participants was only categorized based on the World Health Organization’s recommended age range (between 45–55 years) for menopause [ 55 Conclusion This study presents the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among women of childbearing age living with, and without HIV providing information on the critical risk factors predisposing this cohort of women to BV. The complexity of these factors highlights the necessity for a comprehensive approach to understanding and managing BV among women of childbearing age. We present evidence to guide the design of interventions for prevention of BV infection in women of childbearing age living with, and without HIV. Targeted screening, educational initiatives on sexual and reproductive health, and awareness programs about the risks associated with douching and other hygiene practices are essential to effectively address BV in this vulnerable group. Tackling these risk factors is crucial, as BV can potentially increase the risk of HIV transmission and other sexually transmitted infections. Supplementary Information  Supplementary Material 1.
