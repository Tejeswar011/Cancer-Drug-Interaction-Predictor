Literature search methodology To ensure comprehensive coverage of relevant studies, a systematic literature search was conducted across two major academic databases: PubMed and Web of Science. The search timeframe was restricted to articles published between January 2015 and April 2025 to focus on recent advancements. Key search terms included combinations of ‘reactive nitrogen species,’ ‘tumor microenvironment,’ ‘carcinogenesis,’ ‘regulatory mechanisms,’ ‘nitric oxide,’ ‘nitrosative stress,’ and ‘tumor progression’ . Additional keywords such as ‘RNS-mediated protein modification’ and ‘tumor microenvironment regulation’ were used to refine results. Inclusion criteria prioritized peer-reviewed original research articles and comprehensive reviews published in English. Exclusion criteria included non-English publications, preprints, commentaries, letters to editors, and articles from journals listed in the academic warning list or not indexed in SCI. This screening process ensured the inclusion of high-quality, methodologically robust literature. 3. RNS overview and production within the tumor microenvironment 3.1. RNS core components and characteristics RNS participate in the regulation of various processes within the tumor microenvironment through dual roles encompassing signal transduction and oxidative/nitrosative damage [ 11 − 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 − 19 20 − − 21 22 Table 1 Table 1. Core Components of RNS in the Tumor Microenvironment: Formation, Properties, and Functions. Component Formation Pathway Half-life Reactivity Functions in the Tumor Microenvironment References NO NOS-catalyzed oxidation of L-arginine (iNOS/eNOS/nNOS) Seconds Low (S-nitrosylation) Signaling (pro-proliferation / angiogenesis); pro-tumorigenic at low concentrations [ 14 23 NO₂ NO auto-oxidation or MPO-catalyzed oxidation Minutes Moderate (tyrosine nitration) Cooperates with ONOO − [ 15 16 ONOO − 1:1 reaction of NO with O₂ − 10–20 ms High (oxidation / nitration) DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, pro-apoptosis / invasion [ 21 22 RNS molecules are characterized by unsaturated electronic structures that confer high chemical reactivity. They can modify biomacromolecules such as proteins (via nitration) and nucleic acids (via oxidation), thus participating in cell signaling and the regulation of cellular functions. Their main features include high reactivity, concentration-dependent bidirectional effects, targeted localization at subcellular sites, properties as signaling molecules, and a dependence on the local microenvironment. 3.1.1. Concentration-dependent bidirectional effects NO at extremely low concentrations can facilitate various physiological processes, including vasodilation, modulation of immune responses, neurotransmission, regulation of apoptosis, reproductive functions, gene transcription, mRNA translation, and post-translational modifications of proteins [ 24 24 25 26 27 27 28 29 − 30 3.1.2. Subcellular targeting and molecular mechanisms RNS can localize to mitochondria, nuclei, and cell membranes, exerting their biological effects. Within mitochondria, complexes I and III of the electron transport chain are the primary sites of superoxide anion (O₂ − − 14 14 − 31 32 33 34 3.1.3. High reactivity RNS are characterized by their unsaturated electronic structures, such as NO and ONOO − − − 35 36 25 37 38 39 40 Moreover, peroxynitrite can target vital mitochondrial components across the matrix, inner and outer membranes, and intermembrane space, compromising mitochondrial function irreversibly. This impairment can inhibit mitochondrial respiration, further exacerbating cellular dysfunction and contributing to pathophysiological conditions associated with high reactivity of RNS [ 41 3.1.4. Signaling molecule properties NO functions as a versatile signaling molecule that modulates cellular activities through both canonical and non-canonical pathways [ 25 42 43 44 44 45 46 Non-canonical NO signaling primarily involves covalent modifications of biomolecules by NO derivatives, such as S-nitrosylation, oxidation, nitration of proteins, and metal nitrosylation [ 47 33 33 48 47 48 3.1.5. Microenvironment dependence NO within the tumor microenvironment is primarily produced by iNOS expressed in immune and tumor cells. The regulation of NO synthesis is influenced by hypoxia and inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). The availability and activity of NO are constrained by metabolic competition within the tumor microenvironment; notably, cancer cells compete for large amounts of L-arginine, which limits substrate availability for endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). This competition results in decreased NO production, contributing to abnormal blood vessel formation and function [ 49 50 Prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) enzymes serve as critical negative regulators of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) [ 51 − − 52 Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), and IFN-γ rapidly upregulate iNOS expression through activating the NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathways. TNF-α and IL-1β predominantly activate NF-κB signaling, whereas IFN-γ enhances iNOS transcription via the JAK-STAT pathway. These signaling cascades increase iNOS transcription efficiency by approximately 5 to 10-fold, leading to elevated production of RNS such as ONOO − 52 53 3.2. Sources of RNS in the tumor microenvironment The tumor metabolic microenvironment (TME) represents a highly intricate and dynamic ecosystem, composed of tumor cells, diverse stromal cell types, and immune cells, including tumor cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), stem cells, epithelial cells, mast cells, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophages [ 54 55 56 57 NO is synthesized endogenously via three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS): neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS or NOS1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOS2), and endothelial nitric oxide synthase [ 58 59 60 61 60 62 63 Table 2 Table 2.

Isoform Mainly Expressed In NO Output Concentration Duration Role in Tumor Microenvironment References iNOS Tumor cells, TAMs Micromolar Hours–days High NO/ONOO − [ 60 61 eNOS Endothelial cells Nanomolar Seconds–minutes Low NO concentration; promotes vascular dilation and angiogenesis [ 60 62 nNOS Neuronal cells Nanomolar Seconds–minutes Localized signaling; linked to neural infiltration in tumors (e.g., pancreatic cancer) [ 63 3.2.1. Autonomous synthesis by tumor cells Tumor cells can autonomously upregulate iNOS, which catalyzes the conversion of L-arginine into NO in the presence of molecular oxygen. The produced NO rapidly reacts with superoxide anion (O₂• − − 64 65 66 Persistent high iNOS expression is maintained through epigenetic modifications such as H3K27 acetylation and promoter demethylation at the iNOS gene, ensuring continued transcription even after hypoxic or inflammatory stimuli subside [ 67 67 67 − Under inflammatory stimuli, cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β bind to their respective receptors, TNFR1 and IL-1R1. This engagement activates downstream signaling cascades, including TRAF-mediated activation of IKKβ, which promotes nuclear translocation of NF-κB, and concurrently stimulates MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways. NF-κB, along with transcription factors like IRF1 and STATs, binds to enhancer regions to markedly increase iNOS transcription, boosting NO synthesis [ 68 69 Furthermore, tumor stem cells tend to co-express arginase-1 (ARG1) and iNOS, often depleting L-arginine by consuming it metabolically, which contributes to immunosuppression within the TME. Tumor cells upregulate ARG1 and iNOS to deplete extracellular L-arginine, causing T cell dysfunction and immune evasion [ 70 71 − − 71 Figure 1 Figure 1. Scheme of HIF-1α- and inflammation-mediated RNS generation in tumor cells. Under hypoxia, stabilized HIF-1α binds ARNT, translocates to the nucleus, and activates iNOS transcription; iNOS then catalyzes NO production, which forms RNS. Under inflammation, factors like TNF-α/IL-1β activate iNOS via NF-κB, further promoting RNS production, enhancing inflammation, and regulating cellular metabolism. 3.2.2. Immune cell-mediated secretion Innate immune cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and neutrophils (TANs), are activated by tumor antigens, which trigger signaling through Toll-like receptors (TLRs). This activation involves the stimulation of NF-κB and MAPK pathways, exemplified by TLR4 recognition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Consequently, these pathways induce the expression of iNOS, leading to the catalytic conversion of L-arginine into substantial quantities of NO and other RNS, such as ONOO − 72 73 74 The regulation of iNOS gene expression primarily involves MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. In the NF-κB pathway, the p65-p50 heterodimer translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, where it promotes iNOS gene transcription [ 75 76 77 78 Figure 2 Table 3 Figure 2. Scheme of immune cell RNS production. Antigen stimulation activates NF-κB (p65/p50) and MAPK pathways via Toll-like receptors (TLR), which further activate transcription factors AP-1 and IRF1. These factors bind the iNOS promoter to drive its transcription/translation; iNOS then catalyzes L-arginine conversion to NO, which reacts with oxygen to form RNS (e.g., peroxynitrite ONOO − Table 3.

Diagnostic probes: Fluorescent probes (e.g., BODIPY for NO, rhodamine for ONOO − RNS serve as both diagnostic biomarkers (e.g., iNOS expression, ONOO − Collectively, the preceding section has established two core foundations of RNS biology in the TME: first, RNS (primarily NO, NO₂, and ONOO − − 79 80 80 4 4. RNS regulates tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, metastasis, and the metabolic microenvironment 4.1. Intervention of tumor cell proliferation NO influences tumor cell proliferation through a bidirectional regulatory mechanism: at low concentrations (≤100 nM), NO activates the PI3 K/Akt and AMPK signaling pathways, enhances cyclin D1 expression, accelerates the G₁/S phase transition, and thereby promotes tumor cell proliferation. Conversely, at high concentrations (≥500 nM), NO induces phosphorylation of p53 and inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complex activities, resulting in cell cycle arrest at the G₁ phase, and may even trigger apoptosis [ 81 82 36 83 84 4.1.1. PI3 K/Akt pathway In tumor cells, the regulation of glycolysis involves several key pathways, notably the PI3 K/Akt pathway and other oncogenic signaling cascades such as Ras, HIF-1, and c-Myc pathways. The PI3 K/Akt pathway is frequently hyperactivated in human cancers [ 14 The modulation of this pathway by NO depends on its concentration: at low NO levels, S-nitrosylation of the catalytic subunit of PI3 K at Cys895 relieves autoinhibition, thereby activating the pathway, which promotes cyclin D1 expression and facilitates the G₁/S cell cycle transition. Conversely, high NO concentrations, via ONOO − 85 Furthermore, the activated PI3 K/Akt pathway enhances glucose uptake by promoting the translocation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) to the plasma membrane, thereby increasing glycolytic flux to meet the energetic demands of proliferating tumor cells [ 64 86 4.1.2. AMPK pathway RNS can nitrate subunits of mitochondrial ATP synthase, such as α, β, γ, and OSCP, leading to reduced ATP synthase activity [ 87 87 88 89 89 + + + 90 91 Within the tumor microenvironment, low NO levels produced by eNOS activate the sGC-CaMKK2-AMPK pathway, suppressing tumor cell proliferation. Conversely, high NO levels or ONOO − 92 Figure 3 Figure 3. RNS-mediated regulation of tumor cell proliferation. RNS regulates tumor cell cycle/proliferation via multiple signaling pathways: Low NO activates the PI3 K/Akt pathway, promoting PIP2-to-PIP3 conversion and Akt activation; this further upregulates Cyclin D1 via mTOR, facilitating G1/S transition. High NO activates the AMPK pathway, where CaMKK-mediated AMPKα-Thr172 activation inhibits G1/S transition, causing cell cycle arrest. NO also inhibits proliferation by phosphorylating p53 and activating CDK inhibitors. 4.2. Regulation of tumor cell apoptosis Depending on the cell type and the concentration of NO, NO can either induce or inhibit apoptosis across various cell populations. Tumor cells often develop tolerance to low concentrations of NO by upregulating anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, whereas immune cells like T lymphocytes tend to be more susceptible to NO-induced apoptosis [ 93 94 − 95 − 94 94 96 97 The regulation of tumor cell apoptosis by RNS exhibits a dual role. On the one hand, ONOO − 98 99 Figure 4 Figure 4. RNS regulation of tumor cell apoptosis. RNS (e.g., peroxynitrite ONOO − NO significantly influences cellular metabolism by modulating mitochondrial function. Cytochrome c oxidase, complex IV of the electron transport chain, accounts for approximately 90% of cellular oxygen consumption [ 100 − 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 In many cancers, the NF-κB transcription factor remains constitutively hyperactivated, leading to the upregulation of numerous downstream anti-apoptotic genes, including XIAP, Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, and YY1. These genes broadly influence tumor cell survival, proliferation, anti-apoptotic capacity, angiogenesis, and metastatic potential [ 107 108 109 110 111 107 112 99 Immune cells can induce necrosis and apoptosis in target tumor cells. Cytotoxic lymphocytes such as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells recognize and bind specific receptors on the surface of tumor cells, become activated, and initiate apoptotic pathways. Post-activation, these effector cells utilize the perforin/granzyme system while secreting molecules like Fas ligand (Fas-L), tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and TNF-α. These molecules bind to their respective receptors on target cells through extrinsic pathways, mediating either necrosis or apoptosis [ 113 110 110 114 NO also influences tumor cell apoptosis by reversing Fas-mediated apoptosis tolerance. Evidence suggests that IFN-γ can restore FasL-driven apoptotic sensitivity in tumor cells by inducing iNOS expression and subsequent NO production [ 115 110 NO also modulates tumor cell resistance to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Constitutive activation of NF-κB is a central mechanism underlying resistance to TNF-α. Unlike TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1), TNF receptor 2 (TNF-R2) preferentially activates NADPH oxidase via TRAF2, leading to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and subsequent NF-κB activation, which inhibits apoptosis [ 116 − 117 Furthermore, NO can overcome TRAIL resistance by upregulating death receptor 5 (DR-5). NO donors such as DETA-NONOate inhibit the repressive binding of YY1 to the DR-5 promoter, leading to increased DR-5 expression and restoring sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis [ 118 112 4.3. Promote tumor invasion and metastasis 4.3.1. Degradation of the basement membrane RNS modulate the cysteine residues of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), transforming these enzymes into potent mediators of tumor invasion. Specifically, ONOO − + 119 120 RNS can further upregulate the transcription of MMP genes, promote increased secretion of MMP proteins, and sustain invasive capabilities. NO enhances MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression while concurrently downregulating tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)−2 and −3, thereby facilitating tumor invasion [ 25 121 − 122 4.3.2. Activation of migration-related signaling pathways Rho family GTPases, including RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, are small molecular switches that regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration, which are essential for tumor cell motility. RNS, particularly NO and ONOO − 123 − 124 125 In addition, RNS upregulate the expression of CXCR4 via an ‘oxidation-phosphorylation-transcription’ pathway [ 126 − 126–128 129 129 130 4.4. Reprogramming the tumor metabolic microenvironment The TME is pivotal in tumor progression and treatment outcomes, significantly influencing tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis [ 131 − 132 133 4.4.1. Regulating carbohydrate metabolism The accumulation of lactate within the tumor microenvironment has been shown to impair the cytokine-producing capacity of tumor-infiltrating T cells and NK cells. This impairment hampers their activation and diminishes their ability to mediate tumor immune surveillance. Additionally, the highly acidic conditions resulting from excess lactate promote immune evasion by recruiting and activating immunosuppressive cell populations, including M2-like macrophages, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) [ 132 14 134 135 Moreover, RNS-dependent regulation of ATP synthase activity also plays a role in tumor metabolic reprogramming. High expression of ATP synthase inhibitory factor 1 (IF1) is characteristic of the Warburg phenotype in tumors, and NO-mediated nitrosylation of IF1 significantly influences its activity, allowing transient restoration of oxidative phosphorylation. Studies demonstrate that tumor cells overexpress IF1 to inhibit ATP synthase, thereby forcing reliance on glycolysis for energy (the Warburg effect) [ 136 137 138 4.4.2. Regulating glutamine metabolism Glutaminase 1 (GLS1) is localized on the outer surface of the mitochondrial inner membrane and functions as the rate-limiting enzyme in glutamine catabolism. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of glutamine into glutamate and ammonia [ 139 139 140 141 − 140 5. RNS modulates signaling pathways that influence the tumor microenvironment, impacting tumor progression and immune responses 5.1. RNS regulates immune-related signaling pathways 5.1.1. Immunosuppression NO plays a critical role in regulating the apoptosis and survival of a broad spectrum of immune cells, including dendritic cells, mast cells, NK cells, macrophages, monocytes, Kupffer cells, microglia, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Its effects are highly dependent on concentration and cellular context. At low concentrations, NO promotes cell survival by activating anti-apoptotic proteins and cGMP signaling pathways. Conversely, at high concentrations, NO induces apoptosis through mitochondrial pathways, activation of caspases, or modulation of signaling loops such as NF-κB, Snail, and YY1 [ 142 143 144 − − 145 146 5.1.2. Immune activation Lck and Syk are key kinases located downstream of the NK cell NKG2D receptor. Their enhanced S-nitrosylation facilitates binding to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), thereby activating the PLCγ2-Ca² + 147 − 147 148 149 − − 150 RNS can also promote the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). Within the tumor microenvironment, the NO-mediated nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) pathway is involved in M1 macrophage polarization. Recent studies indicate that oscillatory versus sustained NF-κB signaling elicits distinct transcriptional responses in mouse macrophages [ 151 − 151 − − 152 153 154 152 154 Figure 5 Figure 5.

Low doses of NO or ONOO − 155 + 156 − 156 + + 157 Enhancement of NO-mediated immunotherapy is a promising strategy, and certain biologics have been shown to elevate NO levels. For instance, antibodies targeting the overexpressed PD-L1 in cancer cells – such as atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab – or antibodies blocking the PD-1 receptor on immune cells including natural killer T cells, dendritic cells, B cells, CD4 + + 158 159 5.2. RNS regulates angiogenesis-related signaling pathways 5.2.1. Pro-angiogenesis NO can serve as the final effector molecule in angiogenesis signaling pathways. For instance, pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF activate protein kinase B (Akt) via VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). With the assistance of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), Akt phosphorylates Ser1177 on eNOS, thereby enhancing NO production [ 160 161–163 164 163 NO also inhibits PHD-containing protein-mediated hydroxylation of HIF-1α, thereby stabilizing HIF-1α under normoxic conditions and upregulating VEGF expression, which further enhances angiogenesis [ 165 166 167 168 The regulatory role of NO in microcirculation is also closely linked to the metabolic adaptations of tumor cells under conditions that threaten their survival [ 169 49 27 165 170 171 Figure 6 Figure 6. RNS-driven angiogenesis mechanism. Under hypoxia, stabilized/activated HIF-1α binds VEGFR2 to promote endothelial cell proliferation/migration. NO activates sGC to produce cGMP, which activates PKG; PKG then promotes eNOS phosphorylation/activation via the Akt-PDK1 pathway, ultimately enhancing NO synthesis. NO further reacts with oxygen to form ONOO − 5.2.2.

Clinical translation applications of RNS-regulated tumor mechanisms 6.1. Development of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers 6.1.1. NO probes Current methodologies for detecting NO encompass a range of techniques, including electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, chemiluminescence, electrochemical assays, and fluorescent probe methodologies. Among these approaches, the fluorescent probe technique has emerged as the most efficacious for detecting NO within biological systems, owing to its superior sensitivity, exceptional selectivity, and user-friendly operational characteristics [ 179 180 − 180 181 + + 181 − − − − 182 6.1.2 Peroxynitrite probe Peroxynitrite (ONOO − − − − 182 − 183 − 184 − − 184 − − 184 − − − − − − − − − − 184 − − − 185 − − − − − 185 − − 6.1.3. Nitroxyl probes Nitroxyl (HNO), the one-electron reduced and protonated derivative of NO, exhibits distinct biological effects compared to NO. Research indicates that under specific conditions, NOS can directly generate HNO, and interconversion between NO and HNO can occur via superoxide dismutase. Due to its high reactivity, nitroxyl spontaneously dimerizes to form nitrous oxide (N₂O) upon dehydration, prompting the development of probes capable of sensitive and selective detection of this RNS [ 182 186 − − − − 186 187 − − − − 187 Table 4 Table 4.

Targeted therapeutic targets and intervention signaling pathways 6.2.1. Inhibition of RNS generation In various cancers – including colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, breast cancer, leukemia, prostate cancer, esophageal cancer, and cervical cancer – elevated expression of iNOS is significantly associated with poor patient survival outcomes [ 188 189 190 191 191 191 191 191 Emerging therapeutic strategies include the development of prodrugs conjugated to antigens, which leverage tumor enzyme activity – such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) – and binding to tumor-specific antigens. Antigen aptamer-labeled NO donors can enhance prostate cancer-specific delivery while minimizing systemic toxicity [ 192 193 6.2.2. Intervention in downstream signaling pathways For signaling pathways regulated by RNS, such as the MAPK and NF-κB pathways, the development of small molecule inhibitors – such as MEK inhibitors – can effectively block abnormal proliferation and metastatic signaling in tumor cells. These inhibitors work synergistically with RNS modulation to enhance therapeutic efficacy. YY1 is a transcriptional repressor that inhibits the expression of PD-L1 by binding to its promoter region. However, S-nitrosylation of YY1 can alleviate this inhibitory effect, thereby enhancing PD-L1 expression and potentially compromising the effectiveness of immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Targeting the S-nitrosylation of YY1 offers a molecular intervention strategy to modulate NO-mediated effects and reverse tumor immune evasion mechanisms [ 194 195 196 197 6.2.3. Latest strategies for optimizing photodynamic therapy (PDT) regimens by combining iNOS/BET inhibitors In addition to traditional approaches targeting RNS generation pathways, recent research has introduced a novel combinatorial strategy involving the use of NOS activity inhibitors, such as GW274150 198 199 Specifically, this strategy simultaneously inhibits iNOS/NO-mediated anti-apoptotic signals and pro-invasive signaling in directly targeted tumor cells, while also impeding the proliferation and migration of adjacent non-irradiated cells that are influenced by NO diffusion. Furthermore, the combined inhibition of iNOS and BET pathways reduces the nitrosylation of ATP synthase, particularly at the Cys251 residue within its α subunit. Attenuating nitrosylation at this site leads to a decreased frequency of PTP opening in mitochondria, resulting in a significant reduction – approximately 40% – in mitochondrial ROS release [ 200 This integrated intervention (iNOS/BET dual inhibition) not only markedly diminishes the risks of tumor recurrence and metastasis following PDT but also establishes a new translational framework for solid tumor combination therapy [ 201 − − 202 − − + − 203 204 To explicitly bridge RNS-mediated molecular mechanisms with ongoing translational efforts, Table 5 Figure 7 Figure 7.

Future perspectives on RNS-targeted cancer therapy 7.1. Core challenges and unmet needs in RNS-targeted therapy Despite significant advancements in unraveling RNS-mediated regulatory networks within the tumor microenvironment (TME) and their initial translational success, such as the development of iNOS inhibitors and NO prodrugs – critical challenges persist that hinder the clinical application of RNS-targeted strategies [ 205 − 206 207 7.2. Priority research directions to address RNS-mediated complexity To overcome the challenges outlined above, future research should focus on three interconnected areas that build on existing insights into RNS biology. First, developing TME-responsive precision targeting systems is essential to tailor RNS modulation to real-time TME conditions – for example, engineering hypoxia-activated iNOS inhibitors that are only activated in hypoxic tumor regions (where iNOS is overexpressed and RNS levels are excessive) or pH-sensitive NO donors that release NO specifically in the acidic TME niches occupied by aggressive tumor cells, which would minimize off-target toxicity to normal tissues while maximizing anti-tumor efficacy [ 208 − 209 210 − 211 7.3. Strategies to accelerate translational progress of RNS-targeted therapies Translating preclinical RNS research into clinical practice requires addressing practical barriers that have slowed the development of other redox-targeted therapies. Optimizing TME-penetrating drug delivery systems is a key first step: developing lipid nanoparticles conjugated to TME-specific ligands (e.g., CXCR4 aptamers or CD44 antibodies) can enhance the accumulation of RNS-targeted agents in tumors, as these ligands bind to receptors overexpressed on tumor cells and stromal cells, improving tissue penetration while reducing systemic toxicity – a strategy that has already shown promise for delivering iNOS inhibitors in preclinical TNBC models [ 212 − 213 214 8. Conclusions Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) form a multidimensional regulatory network in the tumor microenvironment (TME) through three core mechanisms: autonomous generation by tumor cells (via hypoxia/HIF-1α and inflammation/NF-κB-driven iNOS upregulation) and immune cells (e.g., TAMs and TANs via TLR-mediated iNOS activation), intracellular modulation of key tumor cell functions (proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and metabolic reprogramming), and intercellular signaling interactions with immune, stromal, and vascular components. This network is not only central to tumor initiation and progression but also provides a wealth of translational targets, from RNS-specific diagnostic probes (e.g., BODIPY for NO, near-infrared probes for ONOO − Abbreviations The following abbreviations are used in this manuscript:  α-KG α-Ketoglutarate ADCC Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity AIF Apoptosis-Inducing Factor AKT Protein Kinase B AMPK AMP-Activated Protein Kinase ARG1 Arginase-1 ARNT Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator BET Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal Motif CAFs Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts CaM Calmodulin CaMKK2 Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Kinase 2 CDK Cyclin-Dependent Kinase CTLs Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes Cyt c Cytochrome c CTCs Circulating Tumor Cells DR-5 Death Receptor 5 ECM Extracellular Matrix EPCs Endothelial Progenitor Cells EPR Electron Paramagnetic Resonance ESIPT Excited-State Intramolecular Proton Transfer eNOS Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase Fas Fas Cell Surface Death Receptor Fas-L Fas Ligand GEFs Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors GDH Glutamate Dehydrogenase GLUT1 Glucose Transporter 1 GLS1 Glutaminase 1 HIF-α Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 Alpha HK2 Hexokinase 2 HRE Hypoxia-Responsive Elements IF1 ATP Synthase Inhibitory Factor 1 IFN-γ Interferon-Gamma IL-1β Interleukin-1 Beta IL-6 Interleukin-6 IL-12 Interleukin-12 iNOS Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase IRF5 Interferon Regulatory Factor 5 ICT Intramolecular Charge Transfer ITAM Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-Based Activation Motif JAK-STAT Janus Kinase-Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription LPS Lipopolysaccharide MAPK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase MHC-II Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II MMP-2 Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 MMP-9 Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 MMP-13 Matrix Metalloproteinase-13 MDSCs Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells MOMP Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeability MPTP Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore MT1-MMP Membrane-Type 1 Matrix Metalloproteinase mTOR Mammalian Target of Rapamycin mtROS Mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species MPO Myeloperoxidase NF-κB Nuclear Factor Kappa-Light-Chain-Enhancer of Activated B Cells N₂O Nitrous Oxide NK Natural Killer NOS Nitric Oxide Synthase NO Nitric Oxide NO₂ Nitrogen Dioxide NCRs Natural Cytotoxicity Receptors nNOS Neuronal Nitric Oxide Synthase ONOO − Peroxynitrite OVA Ovalbumin OXPHOS Oxidative Phosphorylation PARP Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase PDE Phosphodiesterases PDK1 Phosphoinositide-Dependent Kinase 1 PKC Protein Kinase C PKG cGMP-Dependent Protein Kinase G PHD Prolyl Hydroxylase Domain pDCs Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells PI3K Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase RNS Reactive Nitrogen Species ROCK Rho-Associated Kinase ROS Reactive Oxygen Species sGC Soluble Guanylate Cyclase SNAP S-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillamine STAT1 Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 TCA Tricarboxylic Acid TNF-α Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha TNFR1 Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 1 TNFR2 Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 2 TME Tumor Metabolic Microenvironment TLR Toll-Like Receptor TIMPs Tissue Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases TRAIL Tumor Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand Tregs Regulatory T Cells TAMs Tumor-Associated Macrophages TANs Tumor-Associated Neutrophils VEGF Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor VEGFR2 VEGF Receptor 2 VE-cadherin Vascular Endothelial Cadherin VHL Von Hippel–Lindau Disclosure statement No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).
