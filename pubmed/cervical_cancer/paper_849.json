However, the expression of SERPINB3/4 in the serum of patients with moderate‐to‐severe prurigo nodularis (PN) remains poorly understood. Objective To find a promising biomarker for monitoring the severity and activity of moderate‐to‐severe PN patients. Methods A total of 41 patients with moderate‐to‐severe PN and 20 healthy subjects were included in the study. Enzyme­linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to determine serum SERPINB3/4 expression. Cutaneous SERPINB3/4 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Serum SERPINB3/4 levels were correlated with PN disease severity and activity scores, hematological parameters, and systemic inflammatory markers. Results SERPINB3/4 expression was found to be significantly increased in the serum and lesions of PN in comparison to healthy subjects. In patients with PN, the expression of serum SERPINB3/4 was significantly elevated in subjects with higher investigator global assessment (IGA) scores, while exhibiting a notable decline in patients with higher pruritus numeric rating scale (P‐NRS) scores. Positive correlations were observed between serum SERPINB3/4 levels and peripheral eosinophil count, eosinophil ratio, and eosinophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (ELR) in patients with PN. Conclusion SERPINB3/4 expression was increased in PN sera and lesions. Serum SERPINB3/4 expression was positively correlated with PN severity and peripheral eosinophil‐related parameters, suggesting its potential as a promising biomarker for PN.

The diagnosis of PN was primarily based on three core clinical criteria, as assessed by two independent dermatologists: (1) the presence of firm, nodular lesions; (2) pruritus lasting at least 6 weeks; and (3) history and/or signs of repeated scratching, picking, or rubbing [ 17 2.2 Clinical Assessment Patient clinical data were collected, including demographic data, serum total IgE levels, complete blood count data, investigator's global assessment scores (IGA; range 0–4, 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe) [ 18 19 20 Eosinophil‐, neutrophil‐, monocyte‐, platelet‐ and basophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratios (ELR, NLR, MLR, PLR and BLR), systemic immune‐inflammation index (SII) and pan‐immune‐inflammation value (PIV) were calculated as follows: ELR = eosinophil count/lymphocyte count; NLR = neutrophil count/lymphocyte count; MLR = monocyte count/lymphocyte count; PLR = platelet count/lymphocyte count; BLR = basophil count/lymphocyte count; SII = (neutrophil count × platelet count)/lymphocyte count; PIV = (neutrophil count × platelet count × monocyte count)/lymphocyte count [ 21 22 23 2.3 Enzyme­Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) Serum specimens were collected and stored at −80°C. Concentrations of SERPINB3/4 in serum were measured using a commercially available ELISA with standard kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (ELISA Kit for Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen 1/2 (SCCA1/SCCA2), Cloud‐Clone Corp., China). 2.4 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Paraffin‐embedded tissue sections (5 μm) from cutaneous biopsies were dewaxed and dehydrated with xylene and graded ethanol.

In comparison to the healthy controls (HCs), SERPINB3/4 expression was markedly elevated ( p S1a,b 4 Discussion Our study is the first to reveal the expression of SERPINB3/4 in the serum of patients with moderate‐to‐severe PN and its correlation with type 2 inflammatory markers. In our study, the expression of SERPINB3/4 was significantly increased in the serum of PN patients with an IGA 4 while decreased in severe pruritus. In addition, serum levels of SERPINB3/4 in patients with moderate‐to‐severe PN were positively correlated with peripheral eosinophil counts and the inflammatory indicator ELR, suggesting that SERPINB3/4 may play a role in the inflammatory response underlying PN nodule formation. Originally found to be highly expressed in multiple tumors, SERPINB3/4 was later found to be elevated in the serum of patients with AD and psoriasis as an inflammatory indicator and was thought to be associated with disease activity in AD and psoriasis [ 15 25 26 S2 The histopathological features of PN include abnormal proliferation of the epidermis, dermal fibrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration [ 27 15 28 15 16 16 15 CCL2 CCL5 CCL20 CXCL1 CXCL2 CXCL5 CXCL8 CXCL10 CXCL11 IL1A IL1B IL6 TNF‐α CCL2 CCL5 CXCL2 CXCL10 CXCL11 IL1B IL6 TNF‐α 28 CCL20 CXCL1 CXCL5 CXCL8 CXCL10 CXCL11 IL1A IL1B 16 29 16 CXCL10 CXCL11 IL1B The correlation between SERPINB3/4 and PN severity was observed primarily with IGA and not with PAS. We speculate that IGA captures the extent and intensity of skin lesions, NRS focuses solely on pruritus intensity. SERPINB3/4 may be more closely associated with the structural changes following scratch (e.g., epidermal dysfunction and fibrosis) rather than the sensory component of itch, which aligns with its known involvement in epidermal dysfunction and immune regulation. Future studies should explore the relationship between SERPINB3/4 and other clinical parameters, such as itch mediators (e.g., IL‐31, TSLP) and neuronal activation markers, to better understand its role in pruritus. Assessing the disease activity and severity in PN is vital in preventing nodule formation and providing effective treatment. In addition to the commonly used inflammation indicators CRP and ESR, some emerging inflammatory indicators based on immune cells have a good correlation in the assessment of the disease activity in inflammatory diseases and response to treatment, such as ELR, NLR, SII and PIV [ 30 31 32 33 34 26 35 36 37 While our study provides novel insights into the expression of SERPINB3/4 in moderate‐to‐severe PN and its correlation with type 2 inflammatory markers, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, although we identified correlations between SERPINB3/4 and type 2 inflammatory markers, The underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Second, the sample size in our study was relatively small, which may restrict the generalizability of our findings and reduce the statistical power to identify differences in SERPINB3/4 expression among subgroups. Additionally, the absence of matched skin biopsy samples from patients with the highest serum SERPINB3/4 levels may have limited a thorough analysis of tissue‐specific expression patterns. Finally, the use of promising inflammatory indicators such as ELR, NLR, SII, and PIV, requires further standardization and validation in larger, diverse populations to confirm their reliability and clinical applicability in PN and other inflammatory skin diseases. Future exploration is needed to understand the role of SERPINB3/4 in keratinocyte dysfunction, dermal fibrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration in PN. It is necessary to clarify the regulatory pathways involving Th2, Th17, and Th22 cytokines in PN circulation and lesions and their impact on SERPINB3/4 expression. Comparative analyses between PN, AD and psoriasis could provide insights into the shared and distinct molecular mechanisms of SERPINB3/4 across these conditions. Large‐scale, multicenter studies are essential to validate SERPINB3/4 as a reliable biomarker for assessing PN disease activity and severity. Finally, identifying therapeutic targets within the SERPINB3/4 pathway holds promise for developing novel and effective treatments for PN and related inflammatory skin disorders. 5 Conclusion This first study on SERPINB3/4 expression in moderate‐to‐severe PN patients revealed a notable elevation in SERPINB3/4 levels in both serum and lesions. Serum SERPINB3/4 levels were positively correlated with IGA scores and peripheral eosinophil‐related parameters, suggesting a potential role for SERPINB3/4 in PN pathogenesis. However, further validation in larger cohorts using additional severity measures, such as PAS and quality of life scales, is needed to confirm its utility as a biomarker for PN.
