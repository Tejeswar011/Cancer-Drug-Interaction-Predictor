Treatment for stages I–III typically involves surgical resection, with stage III often requiring adjuvant chemotherapy. In metastatic CRC (stage IV), systemic therapies, including chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or their combinations, are commonly employed 4 5 Since 2004, adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colon cancer has generally included oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine 6 7 8 6 9 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has transformed cancer therapy, with pembrolizumab approved as first-line treatment for the subset of CRC patients whose tumors exhibit microsatellite-instability-high (MSI-H) owing to their elevated mutational burden and neoantigen load 10 11 12 Given the limitations of current CRC therapies—including chemoresistance, immunotherapy resistance, radiotoxicity, and post-surgical complications—there is growing interest in the gut microbiota as a complementary therapeutic target. Rather than acting independently, microbial interventions may enhance the efficacy and reduce the toxicity of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery. For instance, specific gut commensals like Roseburia intestinalis 13 14 Role of gut microbial communities in CRC Extending from the foundational roles of the gut microbiome in maintaining host metabolic, immune, and epithelial homeostasis, accumulating evidence implicates its disruption—termed gut dysbiosis—as a contributing factor in CRC 15 17 18 19 20 Despite these limitations, meta-analyses integrating data across diverse cohorts and methodologies have revealed consistent microbial alterations in CRC 4 Fusobacterium Porphyromonas Parvimonas Peptostreptococcus Faecalibacterium Roseburia 21 22 23 24 Fusobacterium nucleatum Parvimonas micra Porphyromonas gingivalis 25 Fusobacterium 23 21 4 In addition, the gut virome, mycobiome, and archaeome remain underexplored, though emerging evidence suggests roles in tumor immunity and microbial synergy 26 27 Role of specific microorganisms in CRC pathogenesis The connection between specific microorganisms and CRC was first identified over 50 years ago with the discovery that Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus Sgg 28 29 30 31 32 pks⁺ Escherichia coli Fusobacterium nucleatum Bacteroides fragilis 1 4 1 33 34 Fig. 1 Microbiota-associated mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.

Microbiome modulators (MMs), encompassing fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics/prebiotics/synbiotics therapy, live biotherapeutic product (LBP), have emerged as paradigm-shifting adjuvants 110 111 We conducted a comprehensive search of the Trialtrove database ( https://clinicalintelligence.citeline.com 2 Fig. 2 The clinical investigation panorama of microbiome modulators in CRC treatment. A B C D E F To date, 29 trials were conducted to evaluate MMs in CRC, spanning FMT ( n n n S1 2C n n n 2A 2B 2D 2E 2F S1 While the clinical pipeline for MMs in CRC remains predominantly early-phase, selected studies have begun to demonstrate biologically meaningful signals that extend beyond descriptive endpoints. In the RENMIN-215 trial, FMT from healthy donors was combined with the anti-PD-1 antibody tislelizumab and the VEGFR inhibitor fruquintinib in patients with refractory, MSS metastatic CRC. The study reported an objective response rate of 20% and a disease control rate (DCR) of 95%, with a median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 9.6 months and a median overall survival (mOS) of 13.7 months—figures rarely observed in this resistant population 112 113 More broadly, meta-analyses across solid tumors indicate that combining FMT with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) improves objective response rates compared to immunotherapy alone, with pooled ORRs of 43.1% versus 36.9% in early-phase trials 114 115 Despite these promising findings, most MM trials to date have enrolled patients with advanced, heavily pre-treated disease, a context in which microbial dysbiosis and chronic antigenic stimulation may drive CD8⁺ T-cell exhaustion, thereby attenuating the efficacy of microbiome-based interventions 116 Collectively, this analysis delineates the burgeoning clinical investigation landscape of MMs in CRC, with 29 trials evaluating FMT, probiotics/prebiotics, and LBPs. These findings underscore the translational promise of microbiome modulation as a paradigm-shifting adjuvant in CRC. Future efforts should prioritize optimizing optimal MM combination regimens, validating microbiome-based biomarkers, and expanding trials to broader patient cohorts to accelerate clinical translation. Despite its strengths, this study has several limitations. The Trialtrove database, curated by a team of therapeutically focused expert analysts, is widely recognized as a comprehensive and authoritative source of global clinical trial intelligence and has contributed to numerous peer-reviewed publications 117 119 Role of gut microbiota in CRC treatment Therapeutic implications for chemotherapy Increasing research suggests that gut microbiota can influence the anticancer effects of certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as 5-fluorouracil 120 121 122 123 124 Lactobacillus 125 126 127 Bifidobacterium breve L. acidophilus Lactobacillus casei S. thermophilus 128 Lactobacillus acidophilus Lactobacillus paracasei Lactobacillus rhamnosus Bifidobacterium lactis 129 L. rhamnosus 130 Bifidobacterium 131 Bacteroides fragilis 132 133 In addition to boosting antitumor effects, the gut microbiota also impacts the toxicity associated with chemotherapy. A frequent complication for cancer patients undergoing treatment is intestinal mucositis and diarrhea 134 135 136 137 138 Therapeutic implications for immunotherapy Immunotherapy has emerged as a cornerstone in cancer treatment, demonstrating effectiveness across various types of cancer 139 140 141 142 143 145 Akkermansia muciniphila 143 B. fragilis 145 Bifidobacterium spp 146 Eubacterium limosum 147 Faecalibacterium spp 148 Alistipes shahii 122 149 3 Fig. 3 Current strategies leveraging the gut microbiota to enhance responsiveness to ICIs in CRC. These strategies include FMT and emerging approaches such as probiotics, prebiotics, probiotic metabolites, and genetically engineered probiotics, all of which hold great potential in improving patient outcomes. Interestingly, pathobionts that promote CRC may have mixed effects on ICIs. For instance, while F. nucleatum 150 150 151 Prebiotics Higher dietary fiber intake is linked to better responses to ICIs and fewer immune-related adverse events in cancer patients from diverse global cohorts 152 153 154 155 156 Akkermansia muciniphila 157 153 158 Akkermansia muciniphila 159 160 153 161 Probiotics and their products Certain gut bacteria, such as A. muciniphila 143 B. fragilis 145 Bifidobacterium 146 L. rhamnosus GG 162 Lacticaseibacillus paracasei 163 164 C. butyricum P 165 P 166 The optimal dose of probiotics is crucial for treatment efficacy, as an excessive presence of a beneficial bacterial species could disrupt the gut microbiota’s balance and diversity, potentially leading to worse outcomes. A study on NSCLC patients receiving ICB therapy found that while the presence of Akkermansia muciniphila A. muciniphila 167 168 169 164 170 Roseburia intestinalis Anaerostipes caccae 171 Several probiotic-derived therapeutics, informed by an understanding of their active components, are currently being evaluated as adjuvants to ICIs. These include bacterial lysates 172 173 174 175 124 176 177 Genetically engineered probiotics Probiotics engineered with improved functionality could serve as a safe and efficient method for delivering adjuvant therapy. Investigators engineered a Lactobacillus lactis L. lactis E. faecium Enterococcus 175 E. coli 178 179 180 4 Fig. 4 Genetically engineered probiotics for tumor-targeted immunotherapy. Orally delivered Lactobacillus plantarum expressing SagA generates muropeptides that engage macrophage NOD2, activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β release. Concurrently, tumor-colonizing Escherichia coli To evaluate the versatility of probiotic systems in treating immunologically “cold” cancers, researchers have developed engineered probiotics designed for targeted therapy delivery. This approach involves engineering probiotic bacteria to produce and release nanobodies targeting PD-L1 and CTLA-4 directly within tumors, utilizing a controlled lysing release mechanism. In a mouse model of MSS CRC, combining this system with a probiotic-produced cytokine, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, led to improved antitumor effects and increased survival 181 Fecal microbiota transplantation FMT is a clinical approach to modulating the microbiome, which has received FDA approval for treating recurrent C. difficile 182 183 184 185 Initial clinical studies have shown promising results, such as overcoming resistance to anti-PD-1 antibodies in some patients with ICI-refractory metastatic melanoma through FMT from anti-PD-1-responsive donors 186 187 188 In a study by Huang, the combination of FMT and PD-1 inhibitors led to better survival outcomes and tumor control compared to either treatment alone in CRC tumor-bearing mice. The study highlighted that FMT-increased Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Bacteroides fragilis Bacteroides ovatus 184 112 113 NCT04729322 NCT04130763 However, FMT has notable limitations, including safety concerns and challenges related to the generalizability and standardization of microbiota profiles needed for efficacy, both in donors and recipients, which makes it less suitable for widespread use. Since FMT involves transplanting the entire viable gut microbiota from a donor, it carries inherent risks of transmitting known and unknown pathogens. Reported complications include norovirus enteritis, cytomegalovirus reactivation, fungal and parasitic infections, and even the potential horizontal transfer of disease-associated traits such as obesity or metabolic dysfunctions 189 190 E. col i 191 192 Therapeutic implications for radiotherapy Radiotherapy (RT) is a widely used antitumor treatment, with over 50% of newly diagnosed cancer patients with solid tumors undergoing RT at some stage of their treatment 193 194 195 196 197 Proteobacteria Fusobacteria Faecalibacterium Bifidobacterium 198 B. infantis 199 200 Improving the efficacy of radiotherapy Research has shown that oral vancomycin enhances both the direct and abscopal antitumor effects of hypofractionated RT in preclinical models of melanoma and lung/cervical tumors 201 202 Roseburia intestinalis 203 Bacteroides fragilis 204 205 Reducing radiotoxicity Several strategies have been identified to reduce the harmful side effects of RT. A randomized clinical trial demonstrated that the probiotic Streptococcus salivarius 206 207 208 Therapeutic implications for surgical resection Compelling experimental data from rodent studies highlight the vital role of gut microbes in intestinal mucosal vascularization and wound healing 209 210 Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 211 The dynamics of bacterial competition and cooperation within microbial communities can either facilitate or hinder wound healing. For instance, Lactobacillus fermentum Staphylococcus aureus 212 Pseudomonas aeruginosa 213 In a landmark study in 1997, Schardey et al. suggested a potential link between P. aeruginosa and anastomotic leaks, leading to the first randomized double-blind trial that confirmed the involvement of microbes in human anastomotic complications 214 215 216 Comparative analyses of gut microbiota revealed that post-surgery CRC patients (A1) exhibit significant differences in microbial diversity compared to pre-surgery patients (A0) and healthy individuals (H). Specifically, both Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were notably lower in A1 ( P 217 Fusobacterium Granulicatella Gemella 218 In a clinical investigation, Komen et al. developed a rapid screening method for early detection of colorectal anastomotic leaks based on the detection of E. coli Enterococcus faecalis 219 220 221 Conclusion and outlooks Unlike the relatively static human genome, the microbiome demonstrates remarkable plasticity, continually evolving in response to environmental, dietary, and lifestyle factors 222 223 224 225 In CRC, metagenomic sequencing is increasingly employed to characterize tumor-associated microbial communities 45 226 227 228 229 230 231 233 234 235 222 Moreover, to address limitations in low-biomass clinical specimens, a tailored metatranscriptomics workflow has been developed that integrates optimized taxonomic profiling (Kraken 2/Bracken) with functional annotation (HUMAnN 3), enabling accurate detection of microbial species and their expressed pathways even in gastric tissues with a high host RNA background 236 237 The increasing depth and scale of metagenomic and metatranscriptomic datasets can inadvertently amplify artefacts—as exemplified by Parida et al.’s report of extremophilic taxa in breast tumors—prompting rigorous revisions to contamination controls, batch-effect corrections, and validation pipelines 238 239 240 Fusobacterium Peptostreptococcus Parvimonas 241 However, many AI models—despite reported superiority—often show only moderate or unstable predictive power in cancer studies, largely due to overfitting on small cohorts, poor-quality or limited microbiome datasets, and inadequate validation 242 243 244 245 246 Nanotechnology has revolutionized CRC therapy by enabling nanoscale drug delivery systems that overcome poor solubility and stability in the gastrointestinal tract, while enhancing tumor accumulation and minimizing systemic exposure 247 248 247 249 Building on these advances, bioengineered probiotics and prebiotic–nanoparticle composites have been developed to selectively colonize CRC lesions and reshape the microbial ecosystem 133 E. coli Pediococcus pentosaceus 250 251 133 252 In the future, rigorous study designs, standardized multi-omics frameworks, and the innovative integration of spatial omics, artificial intelligence, and microbiome-targeted nanotechnologies will be essential to unravel microbial mechanisms underpinning CRC, thereby accelerating the translation of microbiome insights into precision oncology.
