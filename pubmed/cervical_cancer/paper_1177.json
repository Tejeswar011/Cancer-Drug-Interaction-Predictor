While the oncogenic mechanisms of viral proteins E6 and E7 are well characterized, the broader effects of HPV infection on host transcriptional regulation remain less clearly defined. This study explores the hypothesis that conserved genomic motifs within the HPV genome may act as molecular decoys, sequestering human transcription factors (TFs) and thereby disrupting normal gene regulation in host cells. Such interactions could contribute to oncogenesis by altering the transcriptional landscape and promoting malignant transformation.We conducted a computational analysis of the genomes of high-risk HPV types using MEME-ChIP for de novo motif discovery, followed by Tomtom for identifying matching human TFs. Protein–protein interactions among the predicted TFs were examined using STRING, and biological pathway enrichment was performed with Enrichr. The analysis identified conserved viral motifs with the potential to interact with host transcription factors (TFs), notably those from the FOX, HOX, and NFAT families, as well as various zinc finger proteins. Among these, SMARCA1, DUX4, and CDX1 were not previously associated with HPV-driven cell transformation. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed involvement in several key biological processes, including modulation of Wnt signaling pathways, transcriptional misregulation associated with cancer, and chromatin remodeling. These findings highlight the multifaceted strategies by which HPV may influence host cellular functions and contribute to pathogenesis. In this context, the study underscores the power of in silico approaches for elucidating viral–host interactions and reveals promising therapeutic targets in computationally predicted regulatory network changes.

Introduction Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Papillomaviridae 1 HPV infection is often asymptomatic, but in symptomatic cases, it can cause benign lesions (such as condylomas) or, in the case of high-risk strains, lead to neoplasia. In particular, HPV16 and HPV18 strains are responsible for the majority of cervical cancer cases. Scientific interest in this virus has grown significantly due to its etiological role in several cancer pathologies. HPV is primarily transmitted through sexual contact but can also spread through skin-to-skin contact or contaminated surfaces. Persistent infection with high-risk strains is associated with an increased risk of developing dysplasia and carcinomas. Screening programs, such as the Pap smear and the HPV-DNA test, are essential for early diagnosis and prevention of cervical cancer [ 2 The viral genome consists of approximately 8000 base pairs and includes early (E) and late (L) genes. The early genes ( E1 E2 E4 E5 E6 E7 L1 L2 2 3 In addition to the well-characterized roles of the viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, HPV replication and transcription are intricately regulated through interactions with host chromatin organizers and transcriptional regulators. A central factor in this process is CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor), a key architectural protein that binds specific sites within the HPV genome. CTCF plays a critical role in regulating viral transcription by promoting chromatin looping, which modulates promoter-enhancer interactions and alternative splicing, particularly within the early region of HPV18 [ 4 5 5 Later, a more comprehensive molecular framework was presented, demonstrating how HPV’s replication mechanism incorporates additional chromatin-associated proteins. Histone modifiers such as histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs), as well as chromatin remodelers that influence nucleosome accessibility and placement, are known to interact with HPV in addition to CTCF and cohesins. These relationships affect the epigenetic environment of infected cells as well as transcription and viral genome maintenance, enabling a dynamic and differentiation-dependent control of viral gene expression [ 6 Beyond the replication cycle, HPV-driven oncogenesis is further potentiated by the abduction of host transcription factors that govern cell proliferation, immune response, and survival. Members of the STAT (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription) family, particularly STAT3, have been found constitutively activated in HPV-positive cancers and contribute to both immune evasion and upregulation of viral oncogenes [ 7 8 9 10 Together, these findings highlight the multifaceted strategies employed by HPV to manipulate the host epigenetic and transcriptional machinery, enabling both persistent infection and malignant progression. We present a computational analysis designed to identify potential interactions between human transcription factors (TFs) and the transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that are shared among the major high-risk oncogenic strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) linked to cancer development. Our hypothesis is that the sequestration of these transcription factors by viral TFBSs may disrupt normal host gene expression, resulting in effects similar to a loss of function. This in silico approach, previously applied to other viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and arboviruses, has already proven successful in revealing how viral RNAs can sequester host RNA-binding proteins and TFs, thereby interfering with cellular processes, modulating immune responses, and in some cases opening perspectives for innovative therapeutic strategies, including vaccine development. Applied to HPV, this strategy could provide valuable insights into the mechanisms driving pathogenesis and its associated complications [ 11 12 2. Materials and Methods The analysis pipeline consists of four main stages and is built using various openly available bioinformatics tools. The in silico approach was applied to the genome sequences of the major HPV strains associated with cancer ( Table 1 https://pave.niaid.nih.gov/explore/reference_genomes/human_genomes MEME-ChIP, a tool from the MEME Suite ( http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme-chip −128 −127 13 All identified motifs were used as queries for Tomtom ( http://meme-suite.org/doc/tomtom.html Figure 1 14 Next, we used STRING v11.5 ( https://string-db.org/ 15 Finally, the entire list of TFs was used as input for Enrichr ( https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/ Figure 1 16 viruses-17-01166-t001_Table 1 Table 1 High-risk HPV types included in the analysis, along with their prevalence in cancers, cancer localization, clinical notes, genome access information, and the target of prophylactic vaccinations.

Results The oncogenic transformation driven by high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly HPV16 and HPV18, represents a multifactorial process that extends beyond the classical disruption of cancer suppressors such as p53 and pRb. While the E6 and E7 oncoproteins mediate these canonical interactions (via E6-AP–dependent p53 degradation and E2F release through pRb inactivation), they also orchestrate a pervasive transcriptional reprogramming of host cellular networks [ 18 Table 2 Among the more abundant TFs identified are proteins of the Forkhead Box family (FOX): FOXO4, which is crucial in apoptosis and DNA damage response, is rendered functionally inactive due to the degradation of its primary modulator, p53 [ 19 20 21 22 The Homeobox (HOX) family represents a critical target in the context of viral infections with epithelial tropism, such as HPV. Members including HOXA1, HOXA9, HOXB7, HOXB8, and HOXB13 (key regulators of cellular identity and differentiation along the anteroposterior axis) are frequently dysregulated following the integration of viral DNA into the host genome. This is particularly relevant in basal epithelial cells, where these TFs are actively expressed and where HPV initiates its life cycle by replicating in the host cell nucleus in a differentiation-dependent manner. The resulting disruption of HOX gene expression contributes to a loss of cellular differentiation and promotes uncontrolled proliferation, often leading to aggressive and de-differentiated phenotypes [ 23 24 Within the immune and inflammatory regulatory axis, members of the NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) transcription factor family (particularly NFATC2, NFATC3, and NFATC4) undergo functional repression due to disrupted intracellular calcium signaling observed in HPV-infected epithelial cells. Since NFATs require calcium-dependent dephosphorylation for nuclear translocation, HPV-mediated signaling interference attenuates their transcriptional activity, compromising T cell activation and facilitating viral immune evasion [ 25 26 27 Moreover, persistent expression of E7 induces oxidative stress in infected cells, leading to the aberrant activation of NFE2L2 (also known as Nrf2), a key regulator of antioxidant responses. Under chronic stress conditions, Nrf2 becomes stabilized and accumulates in the nucleus, where it activates a transcriptional program that enhances cytoprotective and anti-apoptotic gene expression. This not only supports the survival of infected cells but also facilitates viral persistence and progression toward malignancy by promoting an environment resistant to immune-mediated clearance and apoptosis [ 28 Beyond the well-characterized transcriptional regulators previously associated with HPV-driven oncogenesis, our analysis identified a cohort of TFs not traditionally linked to HPV-mediated transformation, thereby significantly broadening the scope of the virus’s regulatory disruption. This is particularly relevant given HPV’s epithelial tropism and its unique life cycle, which is tightly linked to the differentiation gradient of stratified squamous epithelium. Interestingly, GLI3, a key effector of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, was found to be downregulated in HPV-infected tissues, suggesting interference with cellular programs involved in tissue patterning, stem cell maintenance, and epithelial homeostasis. Since Hedgehog signaling is known to regulate epithelial regeneration and basal cell proliferation, its disruption could enhance the de-differentiation and proliferative features observed in HPV-related lesions [ 29 Likewise, inhibition of SRY, a master regulator of SOX family members and sex-specific gene expression, was observed across multiple datasets. While SRY itself is not consistently associated with the tumor immune microenvironment, its expression changes may reflect indirect involvement in DNA repair or immune evasion processes, potentially mediated via epigenetic modifications or interaction with other transcriptional regulators. Notably, SOX family members are known to influence stemness and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, both of which are critical in viral persistence and cancer progression [ 30 In parallel, CLOCK, a central regulator of circadian rhythms, appears to be vulnerable to HPV-mediated interference. CLOCK forms the core circadian complex with BMAL1, governing the synchronization of cellular metabolism, immune surveillance, and DNA repair [ 31 31 32 33 In addition, members of the zinc finger (ZNF) transcription factor family, including ZNF250, ZNF394, ZNF816, ZFP42, and ZFP82, exhibited marked transcriptional deregulation in HPV-infected epithelial tissues, suggesting a widespread disruption of DNA-binding fidelity and potential compromise of transcriptional specificity. This is particularly relevant in the context of HPV’s strong epithelial tropism, where infection is initiated in the basal cells of stratified squamous epithelium. These basal cells serve as reservoirs for HPV replication and transformation, given their proliferative capacity and expression of key TFs, including zinc finger proteins [ 34 34 The presented data revealed also alterations in a group of TFs involved in lineage specification, immune regulation, and epithelial tissue identity, including MAF, SOX17, NR1H3, NKX3.2, NKX6.1, ALX1, OSR2, and AIRE. These TFs are integral to the establishment of morphogenetic patterning, maintenance of tissue-specific functions, and immune homeostasis. Their dysregulation in HPV-infected tissues, particularly those of epithelial origin, may reflect a broader viral strategy to disrupt basal epithelial transcriptional programs to favor persistent infection, immune escape, and carcinogenesis. MAF is a critical regulator of terminal differentiation in immune and epithelial lineages, especially Th2 cells and anti-inflammatory pathways. Its repression in HPV-positive cells may impair epithelial maturation and promote an inflammatory environment that supports viral persistence [ 35 36 NR1H3 (LXRα), a nuclear receptor involved in lipid metabolism and immune regulation, modulates macrophage activation and promotes anti-inflammatory responses. HPV-mediated suppression of NR1H3 may thus impair innate immune surveillance in infected epithelia [ 37 38 39 40 41 42 Moreover, downregulation of AIRE expression in HPV-positive lesions may further hinder the immune system’s ability to recognize and respond to infected epithelial cells. By suppressing the expression of TRAs in both central (thymic) and potentially peripheral contexts, HPV may facilitate immunological escape and establish persistent infection, a critical step in its oncogenic progression. These immunomodulatory effects are particularly relevant in stratified squamous epithelia, where HPV replicates in a differentiation-dependent manner and evades immune detection despite ongoing cellular proliferation in the basal and suprabasal layers [ 42 43 As shown in Figure 2 SMARCA1, a core component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, was significantly downregulated following HPV E7 expression. Given SMARCA1’s role in maintaining chromatin accessibility and genomic stability, its suppression may promote epigenetic drift, increased mutation rates, and loss of transcriptional fidelity [ 44 45 46 Enrichr-Based Pathway Enrichment Analysis To better contextualize the scope and functional significance of these TF connections with HPV’s genomes, we performed an enrichment analysis using Enrichr ( https://maayanlab.cloud/Enrichr/ 47 Notably, the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway emerged as significantly enriched, reflecting a potential point of viral interference through HPV16 E6-induced activation of ST6GAL1, a sialyltransferase involved in glycosylation and signal modulation. ST6GAL1 is upregulated in HPV-infected epithelial cells and has been shown to trigger downstream cGMP–PKG signaling, thereby promoting cell survival, migration, and proliferation in cervical epithelial tissues. Given HPV’s epithelial tropism and its life cycle dependency on basal keratinocytes, which support viral replication in the nucleus as they undergo differentiation, modulation of such signaling pathways may represent a broader viral strategy to ensure persistence and oncogenic transformation [ 48 49 Furthermore, perturbation of the cGMP-PKG pathway may interfere with the activity of transcription factors such as NFE2L2 (NRF2) and FOXO4, which play essential roles in oxidative stress response and cell cycle regulation. HPV-mediated suppression of their pro-apoptotic functions could facilitate immune escape and support long-term viral persistence [ 50 51 Surprisingly, the oxytocin signaling pathway, traditionally associated with neuroendocrine regulation, was significantly enriched through its association with MEF2 family transcription factors. This finding suggests that HPV may interfere with the anti-proliferative and differentiation-promoting effects that this pathway exerts in epithelial tissues. MEF2 proteins are not only involved in muscle and neuronal differentiation but also play critical roles in epithelial cell fate and apoptosis. In HPV-infected epithelial cells, particularly within the basal layers where the virus initiates its replication, dysregulation of MEF2 may reflect an adaptive mechanism employed by the virus to subvert host differentiation programs. Converging evidence indicates that MEF2 activity is modulated downstream of HPV oncoproteins via histone modifications, including altered acetylation and chromatin accessibility, potentially mediated by viral interference with histone deacetylases (HDACs) and p300/CBP coactivators. These epigenetic disruptions may suppress MEF2-driven transcription of growth-inhibitory genes, thereby promoting cell survival and proliferation, hallmarks of HPV-mediated transformation [ 52 The Wnt signaling pathway also showed robust enrichment, aligning with the repression of CDX1 (a known antagonist of Wnt) and the activation of forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors, particularly FOXA1 and FOXO4. This transcriptional shift reinforces HPV’s ability to EMT. Given that HPV infects basal epithelial cells, where Wnt signaling regulates self-renewal and differentiation, the virus may exploit this pathway to disrupt epithelial homeostasis and sustain a proliferative, undifferentiated state. Moreover, by repressing CDX1 and modulating FOX TF activity, HPV orchestrates a transcriptional landscape that promotes cellular plasticity, immune evasion, and long-term persistence in host tissues [ 53 54 The KEGG category “Transcriptional Misregulation in Cancer” emerged as one of the top-ranked enriched pathways, reflecting the extensive involvement of deregulated TF families, including HOX, FOX, SOX, and ZNF, in HPV-associated carcinogenesis. These TF families are critical for epithelial lineage commitment, differentiation, and immune regulation, and their perturbation suggests that HPV reprograms host transcriptional networks in basal epithelial cells, thereby supporting viral replication, suppressing apoptosis, and promoting malignant transformation [ 55 56 57 Among the additional significantly enriched pathways, the “Fluid Shear Stress and Atherosclerosis” pathway offers compelling insights into the broader regulatory disruptions induced by HPV infection. While this pathway is traditionally explored in the context of cardiovascular biology, emerging evidence highlights its involvement in cellular responses to oxidative and mechanical stress, which are also relevant in stratified epithelial tissues. Notably, this pathway features key transcription factors such as NFE2L2 and FOXO4, both of which are central regulators of redox homeostasis, apoptosis, and cellular adaptation to biomechanical stimuli [ 58 59 60 The “Cellular Senescence” pathway, a critical safeguard against malignant transformation, was notably impaired in HPV-infected epithelial cells, as indicated by the downregulation of key transcription factors FOXO4 and DUX4. Both factors play essential roles in initiating oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) and halting abnormal cell proliferation. FOXO4, in particular, helps maintain genomic stability and prevents tumorigenesis by promoting cell cycle arrest in response to stress signals, while DUX4 has been implicated in early embryonic transcriptional programs and antiviral defense, including the activation of interferon-stimulated genes [ 61 Furthermore, the enrichment of HBV-related carcinogenic pathways in our analysis revealed overlapping disruptions in TFs such as NFE2L2 and the MEF2 family, suggesting that HPV may share oncogenic mechanisms with other DNA viruses. These findings point to convergent viral strategies that target host transcriptional networks to override tumor suppressive barriers and facilitate oncogenesis [ 62 Finally, the unexpected enrichment of the axon guidance pathway suggests a non-canonical route by which HPV may exert oncogenic effects, specifically through the dysregulation of TFs that are traditionally associated with neurodevelopment and embryonic patterning. Among these, HOX, GLI3, and SOX family members emerged as significantly modulated in HPV-infected epithelial cells. These TFs are essential for maintaining cell polarity, directed migration, and spatial organization during development. In the context of HPV-driven transformation, the alteration of these neurodevelopmental regulators may disrupt normal epithelial identity and structural integrity, EMT, and invasive phenotypes. HOX gene deregulation, for instance, is known to rewire transcriptional landscapes, promoting proliferation, motility, and loss of epithelial differentiation [ 63 64 65 66 These findings suggest that HPV may choose evolutionarily conserved developmental pathways, originally tasked with embryonic tissue patterning, to orchestrate transcriptional reprogramming and microenvironment remodeling in favor of viral persistence and tumor progression. Taken together, these findings suggest that HPV-driven transformation is not limited to a few canonical pathways but instead involves a complex, multi-dimensional reprogramming of host transcriptional networks. The enrichment of previously unrecognized pathways and the identification of novel TF targets highlight the virus’s ability to modify a broad array of regulatory circuits that govern cell fate, differentiation, and structural integrity. This expanded understanding of HPV’s impact on host gene regulation opens new avenues for exploring how viral oncogenesis may operate through mechanisms far beyond those traditionally associated with HPV biology ( Figure 3 4. Discussion High-risk HPV infections, particularly HPV-16 and HPV-18, should no longer be interpreted as isolated molecular accidents but rather as deliberate, systems-level subversions of the host cell’s regulatory architecture. The viral oncoproteins E6 and E7 are not merely pathogenic agents that inactivate cancer suppressors such as p53 and pRb; they act as central orchestrators of a broad transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming effort that redefines the host cellular environment to favor viral persistence and replication. Our findings extend the current understanding of E6/E7 functions by demonstrating that the mere presence of HPV is sufficient to induce widespread dysregulation of host transcriptional networks. Using computational analysis that integrates multiscale transcriptomic data with interaction-based inference, a complex cascade of molecular events has been described as potential consequences of viral infections and transcriptional misregulation of HPV viral DNA. These events could affect both transcription factors directly targeted by the virus and those indirectly influenced through downstream regulatory networks. These include master regulators of cell differentiation (e.g., HOX, CDX1), immune response (e.g., NFATC2/3/4, AIRE, DUX4), metabolic homeostasis and stress adaptation (e.g., CLOCK, NFE2L2), and chromatin remodeling (e.g., SMARCA1). Importantly, these associations are not stochastic; they converge on key processes such as immune evasion, EMT, genomic instability, and erosion of cellular identity. This comprehensive network-based perspective marks a significant shift away from traditional reductionist models that focus on individual viral proteins or isolated pathways. Instead, the findings support viewing HPV as a systems-level disruptor that exploits the complex, emergent properties of transcriptional reprogramming within the host cell. A notable example is the consistent downregulation of DUX4, a double homeobox transcription factor that plays a critical role in zygotic genome activation and in the regulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Its suppression suggests a key mechanism by which HPV may blunt innate immune responses during infection and transformation [ 67 68 Enrichment analysis using Enrichr further substantiates these insights. Beyond expected associations with canonical cancer pathways (e.g., Wnt signaling, transcriptional misregulation in cancer), our results revealed enrichment in unconventional signaling cascades. HPV appears to engage with a broad spectrum of host signaling cascades, including the C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway and the fluid shear stress response, both of which are not conventionally linked to oncogenesis. The CLR pathway plays a pivotal role in innate immune sensing, particularly in the detection of pathogens and the regulation of inflammatory responses, while the fluid shear stress response is primarily involved in mechanotransduction processes that influence vascular homeostasis and cytoskeletal organization [ 69 HPV may use a variety of unconventional signaling systems to avoid immune surveillance, alter host cell stress responses, and create an environment that is conducive to viral persistence and cancerous development, according to the observed enrichment of these pathways. This highlights HPV’s capacity to exploit signaling networks beyond classical oncogenic routes, reinforcing a more complex and nuanced model of viral-driven transformation that extends well beyond traditional cell cycle deregulation and DNA repair inhibition. A particularly striking feature of HPV pathogenesis is the mechanism of host shutoff, a phenomenon that appears paradoxical; while the virus relies on the host’s transcriptional and translational machinery to replicate, it simultaneously suppresses host gene expression to subvert immune responses and shift cellular resources toward viral replication. This selective repression is not indiscriminate but instead represents a finely tuned evolutionary adaptation, allowing HPV to degrade specific host mRNAs or prevent their translation while preserving or even enhancing the expression of cellular factors that facilitate its life cycle [ 70 These mechanistic insights could have important therapeutic implications. The data challenge therapeutic approaches that focus solely on viral oncoproteins such as E6 and E7. Instead, a network-oriented strategy is here proposed, targeting the functional consequences of HPV-induced transcriptional reprogramming. Therapeutic interventions that aim to counteract host molecule dysregulations, e.g., modulate transcription factors (e.g., DUX4, CDX1), stabilize chromatin remodelers (e.g., SMARCA1), or disrupt oncogenic regulatory circuits, may provide lasting outcomes. Similarly, epigenetic modulators, or agents that restore the integrity of transcriptional networks, could potentially achieve greater efficacy than traditional single-target therapies. More broadly, this study highlights the epistemological value of computational modeling in viral oncology. By simulating HPV–host interactions across multiple hierarchical regulatory levels, it becomes possible to characterize not only the direct targets of viral interference but also the underlying principles guiding these perturbations. Rather than acting as a random mutagenic agent, HPV functions as a strategic modulator within a co-evolutionary framework, systematically reshaping host transcriptional programs to create a permissive environment for viral persistence and replication. Decoding this regulatory logic uncovers actionable vulnerabilities and supports a shift toward systems-level therapeutic interventions based on an integrated understanding of host–virus dynamics. 5. Conclusions This study positions HPV infection not as a linear molecular insult but as a multilayered event that simultaneously targets immune surveillance, cell identity, and chromatin dynamics. By employing a computational analytical pipeline, the HPV’s oncogenic potential arose not only from the well-characterized effects of E6 and E7 but also from an intricate connection with transcription factor activity and possible dysregulation. The novelty of this approach lies in its ability to trace both direct and indirect interactions with viral DNA, revealing not just which TFs activity could be altered, but how their collective possible dysregulation could reshape the cellular system. This underscores the importance of interpreting viral carcinogenesis through a network-based, integrative lens capable of capturing the full scope of molecular perturbations. In this context, HPV is not only a biological adversary but also a force that confronts the host cell’s ability to resist various systems. It is now essential to comprehend this complexity to prevent, diagnose, and treat patients successfully. According to this viewpoint, future HPV research and innovative treatments should be built on the integration of systems biology, computational modeling, and transcriptional network analysis.

The workflow is divided into three main steps. Step 1: Genomic sequences from 15 high-risk HPV types (HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, HPV33, HPV35, HPV39, HPV45, HPV51, HPV52, HPV56, HPV58, HPV59, HPV66, and HPV68) were collected and analyzed using the MEME-ChIP tool from the MEME Suite. This tool performs de novo motif discovery to identify overrepresented DNA motifs across the viral sequences. The human genome was used as a reference background to filter out nonspecific motifs. HPV genome sequences are analyzed by MEME to generate motifs, which are carried forward as shown by the dashed blue arrows. Step 2: The top three most statistically significant motifs (based on E-values ranging from 5.7 × 10 −128 −127 Figure 2 Identified transcription factor PPIs (Protein-protein interactions). The diagram displays functional and physical associations among transcription factors predicted to bind motifs discovered in high-risk human papillomavirus genomes. The network was constructed using the STRING database, which integrates evidence from experimental data, computational prediction, and public text collections to infer protein associations. Each node corresponds to a human TF, while colored lines represent different types of functional or physical associations between transcription factors. Each color corresponds to a specific predicted interaction category (e.g., co-expression, co-localization, experimental/biochemical evidence, text-mining associations, database-curated links, or protein homology). Thicker lines indicate stronger confidence scores or higher evidence support for the predicted interaction, whereas thinner lines represent weaker or less-supported associations. The TFs are color-coded and grouped into functional modules, each encircled and labeled based on their predominant biological roles. The network highlights several central hubs, such as MEIS1, MEF2A, MEF2C, and NFATC2, which appear as convergence points between multiple biological processes. Their connectivity suggests a potential regulatory bottleneck that HPV may exploit to manipulate host transcriptional programs, favoring viral persistence, immune evasion, and oncogenesis.
