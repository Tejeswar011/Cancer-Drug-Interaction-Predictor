Introduction Heterocycles constitute a broad class of molecules found in many biologically active compounds in the human body [ 1 2 3 4 5 3 6 7 6 7 3 4 5 6 7 7 The study of heterocycles as inhibitors of human carbonic anhydrase (hCA) activity has emerged as a promising strategy for therapeutic intervention [ 8 9 10 2 3 − 10 11 12 13 14 11 12 13 14 Despite the large number of reviews published in the carbonic anhydrase field in recent years [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 2. Heterocycles Used as Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitory Chemotype Heterocycles as CA inhibitory chemotypes have been extensively used in the last 5–10 years. Particularly, coumarins represent the most commonly adopted scaffold in this field, with the aim of selectively targeting the hCAs IX and XII, mostly involved in the pathogenesis of hypoxic cancer and inflammation. However, as will be discussed in this section, several other heterocycles have been adopted in multitargeting compounds to address the inhibition of CAs, such as sulfocoumarins, pyridylsulfonamides, and tetrazoles. 2.1. (Sulfo)coumarins Are Potent Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors One of the first hybrid heterocycle series against CAs was published by Bua et al. in 2017 [ 21 21 1 5 Table 1 1 2 I 4 5 I 1 5 1 4 5 21 A few years later, in 2020, the same research group proposed a bioisosteric development of the previous series [ 22 Table 1 6 10 22 8 I 6 10 6 9 22 6 9 6 9 6 22 In the same year, Berrino et al. proposed a novel series of coumarins and sulfocoumarins linked to azidothymidine (AZT), the first antiretroviral medication used to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS [ 23 24 11 17 Table 2 23 17 I AAZ 11 17 13 I Derivatives 11 17 12 17 25 12 17 Table 3 12 17 12 17 25 One year later, in 2021, Berrino et al. proposed the first set of CAI hybrids bearing CO-releasing molecules (CORMs) to counteract inflammatory states, such as RA [ 26 18 20 26 18 20 Table 4 18 20 26 In 2023, the same research group proposed an evolution of the previous work [ 26 27 21 25 Table 5 21 25 27 In 2024, Nocentini et al. proposed a series of multitargeting compounds with the aim of inhibiting cancer-associated CAs and stabilizing the G-quadruplex (GQ), which are noncanonical nucleic acid secondary structures recognised as playing major roles in carcinogenesis [ 28 29 26 35 Table 6 28 Table 6 Tel 23 c-Kyt1 c-Myc Table 6 28 c-Kit1 c-Myc Tel 23 c-myc 28 In 2024, Braconi et al. proposed a new series of piperazine derivatives bearing a coumarin scaffold with the aim of obtaining dual inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an ABC transporter [ 30 31 31 36 39 Table 7 36 39 36 39 Table 7 2.2. Other Heterocyclic Pharmacophores as Effective Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitory Chemotypes In the same publication [ 26 20 40 41 26 40 41 Table 8 40 26 40 41 26 One year later, in 2022, Tan et al. designed two tetrazole-based hybrids, 42 43 42 43 Table 9 32 In 2023, Angeli et al. designed and synthesized a large series of pyridylsulfonamides as multitargeting inhibitors of CAs and agonists of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptor [ 33 2+ 34 44 45 Table 10 33 50 45 45 33 3. Chimeric Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Chimeric heterocycle hybrids are a unique class of molecular entities that combine two or more distinct heterocyclic moieties within a single framework. These hybrids are designed to merge the structural and functional attributes of different heterocycles, resulting in novel compounds with enhanced or synergistic biological, chemical, or physical properties. Regarding this subject, Tinivella et al. proposed a chimeric hCA inhibitor class with the aim of targeting breast cancer by inhibiting both hCAs IX and XII and estrogen receptors (ERs) [ 35 36 37 46 48 Table 11 47 35 47 48 46 48 Figure 1 4. Heterocycles Used as Linkers for the Design of Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Using heterocyclic rings as linkers between two pharmacophoric units is a simple and highly versatile synthetic strategy in medicinal chemistry. The availability of robust synthetic protocols, coupled with the rapid and flexible incorporation of nitrogen- or oxygen-containing heterocycles as linkers, enables the efficient generation of pharmacophore hybrids. These heterocycles can contribute to conformational rigidity and overall molecular polarity and direct interactions with biological targets, thereby enhancing binding affinity and selectivity. Furthermore, the modular nature of heterocyclic scaffolds enables variation in both substituents and ring systems, thus facilitating the modification of physicochemical and target interaction properties with minimal synthetic effort. Overall, heterocycles used as linkers offer synthetic accessibility and structural diversity while actively participating in binding mechanisms, making them an ideal platform for dual-pharmacophore drug design [ 38 39 40 In 2020, Elzahhar et al. reported, for the first time, a novel series of multitarget-directed compounds designed to simultaneously inhibit cyclooxygenase-2, 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX), and tumor-associated carbonic anhydrases to develop new anticancer agents [ 41 Table 12 49 60 Table 12 Among them, compounds 57 60 57 59 41 57 50 59 50 57 59 41 The same research group in 2023 further explored the same type of molecular hybrids by applying bioisosteric modifications to celecoxib (compounds 61 70 Table 13 71 80 Table 14 42 43 61 62 70 50 71 75 76 50 42 43 Compounds 61 62 75 76 42 43 Recently, the research group of Sharma employed heterocyclic linkers, specifically triazole-based structures, for the development of novel anticancer agents targeting tumor-associated carbonic anhydrases (hCAs IX and XII) and cathepsin B [ 44 Table 15 87 I AAZ SLC-0111 89 44 In the following year, Sharma and co-workers continued to refine this dual-inhibitor strategy by incorporating a 1,2,4-triazole linker, resulting in the design and synthesis of 22 novel derivatives [ 45 Table 16 102 I 87 −7 45 In 2024, Abbas et al. applied a sugar-tail approach utilizing a 1,2,3-triazole linker to conjugate a benzenesulfonamide moiety with glycosidic fragments, aiming to develop dual inhibitors of tumor-associated carbonic anhydrases (hCAs IX and XII) and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) as novel anticancer agents [ 46 Table 17 SLC-0111 46 These were further screened for antiproliferative activity against various human cancer cell lines, including lung (A549), liver (HepG2), breast (MCF-7), and colorectal (HCT-116) cancer cells. Both compounds showed notable potency against HepG2 cells (IC 50 106 107 50 106 107 50 106 107 106 107 46 Collectively, these studies underscore the critical importance of linker selection in the design of hybrid compounds incorporating two pharmacophores. Beyond controlling spatial orientation and inter-pharmacophore distance, appropriately designed linkers, particularly those incorporating heteroatoms, can directly contribute to target binding. As emphasized throughout this review, heteroatom-rich linkers such as triazoles may expand the interaction landscape via hydrogen bond and polar contacts, thus enhancing both affinity and selectivity of the resulting molecular hybrids. 5. Heterocycles Used as Second Pharmacophores in Multitargeting Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors In the design of dual-target carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs), various heterocyclic scaffolds have been effectively used as secondary pharmacophores to enhance isoform selectivity and biological potency. In 2020, Ceni et al. designed and synthesized a novel series of dual-acting compounds as adenosine A 2A 2A 47 2A Table 18 2A I 114 114 120 47 Molecular docking studies were conducted to elucidate the binding modes of selected derivatives within both targets. Interestingly, although the CAI moiety does not contribute to interactions with the hA 2A 47 These findings highlight the importance of rational design in dual-target agents, where both pharmacophoric units must be considered active contributors to binding. The optimal spatial and electronic complementarity of both moieties is essential to maximize interactions across the distinct binding environments of the two targets. In the field of anticancer drug discovery, Zhang and co-workers developed a series of dual inhibitors targeting both the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and tumor-associated hCA IX by combining quinazoline-based derivatives with benzenesulfonamide moieties [ 48 WT 123 T790M 124 Table 19 124 The antiproliferative activity of the compounds was assessed in vitro against various human cancer cell lines, including epidermoid carcinoma (A431) and non-small cell lung cancer (A549 and H1975). Notably, compound 124 50 50 124 124 WT T790M WT T790M 124 T790M 48 In 2024, Giovannuzzi et al. designed and synthesized a series of dual inhibitors targeting brain hCAs and Monoamine Oxidase B (MAO-B), with the aim of modulating multiple pathological pathways implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and preventing β-amyloid (Aβ-42)-associated neurotoxicity [ 49 Table 20 MTZ AAZ CLO SEL I 49 Encouraged by these findings, the authors expanded the library with a fifth series (Series 5), although no further improvement in inhibitory potency was observed. Nevertheless, the most promising multitarget compounds from the earlier series effectively mitigated Aβ-42-induced toxicity, significantly reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and restoring mitochondrial function in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells [ 49 Gamal and coworkers designed and synthesized a series of benzenesulfonamide–thiazolidinone hybrids as novel multitarget agents for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [ 50 131 133 134 140 134 133 AAZ 144 Table 21 Given the encouraging in vitro results, compound 133 133 50 Furthermore, the antiproliferative activity of the most active hCA IX/XII inhibitors, compounds 140 141 144 144 50 140 50 50 50 In 2024, Bonardi et al. designed and synthesized a novel series of dual-acting antibiotics in response to the growing challenge of antibiotic resistance [ 51 Escherichia coli E. coli Neisseria gonorrhoeae AAZ 145 146 158 148 149 151 146 158 163 Table 22 Since NgCA was identified as the most selectively inhibited bacterial isoform, the authors further investigated the antibacterial activity of the compounds against clinical strains of N. gonorrhoeae 145 161 N. gonorrhoeae 145 161 51 In 2025, Lopez’s research group developed a novel class of sulfonamide–thiosemicarbazone hybrids designed to combine metal chelation and hCA inhibition as a dual approach for anticancer therapy [ 52 Table 23 Within this series of compounds, 166 + + 2+ 3+ 2+ 2+ 166 2+ 166 50 52 In the same year, Elkotamy and co-workers designed and synthesized a series of pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine derivatives bearing zinc-binding groups to achieve dual inhibition of tumor-associated carbonic anhydrase isoforms IX and XII, as well as cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), targeting critical pathways in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [ 53 The synthesized derivatives, reported in Table 24 170 178 180 183 1 2 3 2 3 3 The compounds were subsequently assessed for their cytotoxic effects on NSCLC cell lines. Notably, compounds 170 171 176 181 50 In A549 cells: 1.90 μM ( 170 171 176 181 In NCI-H1734 cells: 5.45 μM ( 170 171 176 181 The same four compounds were further evaluated for CDK4/6 inhibition, revealing preferential activity toward CDK6. Moreover, mechanistic studies demonstrated that the compounds induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase and promoted apoptosis. Compound 171 181 171 50 181 50 53 6. Conclusions The integration of heterocycles into multitarget carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) represents a recent but dynamic and rapidly evolving strategy in drug discovery. Heterocyclic motifs, owing to their inherent versatility, can act as core inhibitory chemotypes, structural linkers, or complementary pharmacophores, thus offering multiple entry points for rational molecular design. By enabling the simultaneous modulation of different biological targets, including multiple hCA isoforms, these compounds address the inherent complexity of multifactorial diseases such as cancer, glaucoma, inflammatory disorders, and neurodegenerative conditions. The multitarget approach is especially helpful for diseases caused by connected biochemical pathways because it can lower the need for many drugs, improve treatment results, and reduce side effects by using one treatment that works on multiple parts. In this context, the use of (sulfo)coumarin cores as CAIs represents the most used strategy to selectively target the cancer-associated hCAs IX and XII, avoiding inhibition of the cytosolic and off-target hCAs I and II. Moreover, many of these (sulfo)coumarin-based hybrids were assessed for their antiproliferative effects, showing favorable results, as demonstrated by derivatives 11 17 25 26 27 20 27 23 27 27 24 28 41 44 46 In general, hybrid and chimeric heterocyclic designs have proven especially valuable, allowing for major physicochemical properties, optimizing binding affinities, and enhancing isoform selectivity. Advances in computational chemistry, high-throughput screening, and structure-guided drug design are now promoting the identification of promising heterocyclic scaffolds, as well as the prediction of off-target interactions and potential toxicity. Accordingly, Tinivella et al. used in silico studies of the ligand-based and structure-based multitarget repurposing strategy to discover new chimeric inhibitors, 46 48 35 Ultimately, the rational exploitation of heterocycles in multitarget paradigms holds the potential to generate next-generation therapeutics with enhanced efficacy and improved patient compliance, thereby paving the way for innovative treatments of complex diseases.
