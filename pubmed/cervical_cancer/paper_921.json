Interestingly, there is increasing evidence that the tumors can dynamically modulate cell fate decisions after ionizing radiation (IR) exposure, which is beneficial for escaping the radiation-induced antitumorigenic cell damaging and immunostimulatory impacts. Consequently, the regulatory network of cell fate determination could be a promising target for enhancing the susceptibility of tumor cells to various radiotherapeutic modalities. In this review, we provide a comprehensive account on the mechanisms of post-radiation cell fate control in tumor cells to escape programmed cell death (PCD) including apoptosis, necrosis, pyroptosis and ferroptosis, while special emphasis is placed on the development of synthetic agents for the therapeutic modulation of post-radiation tumor cell fate decisions to facilitate tumor cell eradication, focusing on their therapeutic utility for amplifying the RT-induced direct tumor cell damage as well as promoting the post-IR antitumor immunity. We envision that these synthetic cell fate regulatory technologies could provide new avenues for improving radiotherapeutic efficacy.

In this review, we first desiccate the cell fate determination mechanisms in tumor cells that govern their pro-survival responses after radiotherapy including apoptosis, necrosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, autophagy and senescence. We then summarize the current progress in the development of synthetic agents for the therapeutic modulation of post-radiation tumor cell fate decisions to amplify the antitumor efficacy by (1) enhancing the RT-induced lethal effects and (2) promoting post-IR antitumor immune responses. A perspective is also included discussing the challenges and potential breakthroughs in cell fate regulatory synthetic drugs for tumor radiosensitization from a translational perspective. We envision that this review could provide new insights into tumorigenesis and progression events while facilitating the development of new auxiliary treatment modalities for enhancing radiotherapeutic efficacy in the clinic. Dynamic cell fate control facilitates tumor cell survival after radiation exposure Clinical evidence collectively demonstrates that RT rarely causes immediate tumor cell death. Instead, radiation exposure would damage key molecular and cellular components in tumor cells that prime them for PCD in the following period 21 22 1 1 Evasion mechanisms of post-IR PCD The tumor inhibition effect of radiotherapy is essentially dependent on the capability of RT to drive tumor cells towards different fates, which are closely linked to the RT-intrinsic cell damage mechanisms. For instance, RT is known to induce pronounced damage to intracellular biomolecules and microstructures as well as perturbate the extracellular compartment, leading to the activation of various intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways 23 24 25 26 27 It is widely accepted that RT-induced apoptosis forms the cornerstone of its antitumor effect, which is directly resulted from the RT-induced cellular stresses including DNA damage, elevated ROS level and death receptor signaling. Nevertheless, tumor cells frequently demonstrated intrinsic apoptosis resistance that constitutes a formidable barrier impairing the anticancer efficacy of radiotherapy. In addition, cancer cells can further alter their cell fate decisions upon radiation exposure to repair radiotherapy-induced cellular damage. Notably, the RT-induced DNA aberrations such as double-stand breaks, single-strand breaks, base/sugar modifications, adducts and crosslinking would initiate a cascade of DNA damage responses 28 29 30 31 32 33 et al. 34 et al. 35 36 37 Necrosis/necroptosis are also major forms of cell death involved in RT-induced tumor inhibition effect, which is the combined results of overwhelming DNA damage under high RT doses and local ischemia due to RT-induced microvessel collapse 38 44 45 47 L 48 49 50 51 52 The RT-induced DNA damage can potently activate various stress sensing cascades to initiate pyroptosis, which is an inflammatory cell death mode characterized by marked inflammasome activation, gasdermin-dependent plasma membrane pore formation and osmotic lysis 53 55 56 57 58 59 et al. 60 et al. N 61 62 63 64 65 The RT-associated radiolysis effect would generate abundant ROS in tumor cells, which would substantially impair the redox homeostasis while promoting the iron-catalyzed peroxidation of membrane lipids, thus compromising the integrity and functions of tumor cell membranes 66 68 69 70 71 72 73 et al. 74 75 77 - 78 79 26 80 81 82 Mgst3 Prdx6 83 84 85 Competing role of autophagy in RT-treated tumor cells: a cell fate choice with both pro-survival and anti-survival functions Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved degradation mechanism with major roles in dictating tumor cell survival and death after radiotherapy 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 et al. 94 1 et al. 95 Nevertheless, it is also worth mentioning that autophagy has complex roles and functions in the post-IR cell fate determination of tumor cells, which may also present anti-tumorigenic properties under certain conditions. Clinical data show that only around 20% of the total tumor cell death after radiotherapy was attributed to RT-induced apoptosis, while autophagy is identified as a major contributor to the RT-induced tumoricidal effects 96 et al. in vitro in vivo 97 98 RT-induced senescence of tumor cells Senescence is a cell fate decision in response to sub-lethal insults and aging, during which various stress factors, especially DNA damage, trigger permanent cell cycle arrest in proliferating cells at G1 or G2 phases 99 100 101 103 INK4a 104 INK4a 105 et al. INK4A 106 In addition to these phenotypical and histological alterations, RT-induced tumor cell senescence also exerts significant impact on the composition and functioning of immune systems in the TME. However, reports thus far on the immunoregulatory effects of radiotherapy-induced tumor cell senescence are still debatable. On one hand, multiple studies suggest that RT-induced tumor cell senescence would contribute to the immunosuppression in the TME to facilitate tumor cell survival while preventing post-IR immunostimulatory effects. Indeed, RT would cause the accumulation of senescent cells in TME, leading to the secretion of abundant SASP factors including interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The presence of excessive pro-inflammatory SASP factors in TME would orchestrate chronic inflammation that is detrimental for both innate and adaptive antitumor immune responses, which would recruit immunosuppressive cells to the TME while impairing antigen presentation and inducing T cell apoptosis 107 109 110 111 112 113 114 Crosstalk of various post-RT cell fate decisions and the therapeutic implications RT elicits a myriad of molecular changes in both tumor cells and TME, which direct tumor cells towards various cell fate decisions while also activating pro-survival responses. Typically, considering the complexity of tumor-radiation interaction as well as the interconnection among different cell fate regulatory pathways, the post-RT cell fate determination is not a simple linear process towards specific decisions but often a mixture of cellular outcomes, and their crosstalk is increasingly recognized as a crucial factor on the robustness of RT efficacy and safety. For instance, the adaptive activation of autophagy in breast cancer cell after radiotherapy could direct them towards a senescent phenotype, thus enhancing the secretion of harmful SASP components to promote tumor proliferation and regeneration. Inhibiting autophagy could switch senescence towards apoptosis, which may not only enhance the direct tumor inhibitory efficacy but also abolish the deleterious SASP-dependent bystander effect to reduce the risk of post-RT relapse 115 116 117 Manipulating cell fate for enhancing RT-mediated tumor cell elimination The insights above collectively demonstrate that modulating the post-IR cell fate decisions holds immense potential for improving the antitumor efficacy of radiotherapy and the therapeutic development in this area is greatly benefited from the advances in synthetic medicinal chemistry. From an overall perspective, these emerging technologies offer novel approaches to alter tumor cell activities after RT to lead them towards or avoid a particular fate, which may not only amplify the direct cellular damage of RT to tumor cells but also harness its immunostimulatory potential to evoke systemic antitumor immune responses for long-lasting protection against tumor relapse and metastasis. Herein, we discuss the general approaches to regulate post-IR tumor cell fate for enhancing the sensitivity of tumors to radiotherapy. Considering the interwoven regulatory networks of various cell fate decisions, the discussions in this chapter are outlined according to the targeted cellular programs (Table 2 Enhancing radiosensitivity by abolishing resistance to RT-induced PCD Disrupting cellular redox homeostasis ROS are highly bioactive substances that may not only evoke direct cellular damage but are also highly involved in multiple cell fate regulatory systems as a signaling factor, presenting a major role in the RT-induced tumor cell death 118 119 Tumor cells are known to undergo boosted biosynthesis of various antioxidants including GSH, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and thioredoxin as a compensatory mechanism to counter RT-induced ROS stress. Rashmi et al. 120 in vivo et al. p 2 121 et al. 122 et al. 2 123 From a biochemical perspective, the rate and efficacy of antioxidant-mediated ROS scavenging are profoundly affected by the catalytic functions of associated antioxidative enzymes, which present crucial roles in both the ROS detoxification reactions as well as the recycling of exhausted substrates. Consequently, deactivating or deleting key enzymes in major antioxidant systems in RT-treated tumor cells could also contribute to the redox dyshomeostasis to shift tumor cell fate towards various forms of PCD. Ye et al. 81 et al. 124 The RT-induced ROS mostly include superoxide anions (O 2 - 2 2 125 126 2 2 2+ 2+ 2+ 2 2 3 127 128 et al. 2 - 3 4 2 - 3 129 Impairing DNA repair activities RT is known to induce various forms of DNA lesions, and failures to repair these lesions would lead to severe consequence including genomic instability and PCD. Double strand break (DSB) is one of the most lethal forms of RT-induced DNA damage, which could activate the DNA damage response in tumor cells to maintain their genomic integrity by harnessing intrinsic DSB repair activities including homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) 130 131 et al. 132 et al. 4 133 134 135 NCT03423628 On the other hand, the ATR inhibitor AZD6738 is typically given through intermittent oral dosing with stand-of-care RT schedules in the Phase I trials for HNSCC treatment, which has an MTD of 240 mg per day for 14 days (NCT02546491, NCT03334617 NCT01390571 NCT01908478 Regulating post-IR cell cycles As already described in previous sections, the post-IR cell cycle arrest is a crucial factor for the spatial coordination of various pro-survival programs such as DNA repair, autophagy and cellular homeostasis. Recent insights reveal that acceleration and deceleration of tumor cell cycles after RT could both promote PCD to enhance the radiotherapeutic efficacy. Manoharan et al. 5 136 5 137 Direct regulation of effector molecules for enacting specific cell fate programs In addition to the indirect tailoring of the cell fate regulatory network, it is also possible to directly target the effector molecules of certain cell fate programs to enforce or evade the corresponding decisions. A major advantage of this strategy is that it could bypass the defective cell fate regulatory networks and thus overcome the potential PCD resistance. For instance, Yazal et al. 138 139 140 Enhancing radiosensitivity by promoting post-IR antitumor immune responses Current insights collectively demonstrate that radiotherapy can not only induce PCD of tumor cells but also modulate the activities of the immune system by altering the immunological traits of TME, offering potential for mounting robust antitumor immune responses to ensure systemic and sustained tumor elimination. Notably, tumor cells are known to escape the recognition and elimination of immune system by (1) eliminating exposure of tumor-associated antigens to reduce immunogenicity and (2) establishing paracrine communication to induce immune cells into immunosuppressive or exhausted phenotypes. From a general perspective, RT could profoundly alter the tumor immune microenvironment and induce both immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive impacts, thus exerting complex influence on the post-RT immune responses 141 142 143 144 145 147 Shifting post-IR tumor cell fate towards immunogenic cell death Cell fate is an integral component of the immunoregulation programs under various physiological and pathological conditions. Indeed, several PCD programs including pyroptosis, necrosis, ferroptosis and autophagy have demonstrated potent immunostimulatory capacities featuring leakage of intracellular contents, release of DAMPs and enhanced secretion of immunostimulatory cytokines and chemokines. It is thus anticipated that shifting the fate of RT-treated tumor cells towards immunogenic cell death could synergize with the TME remodeling effect of radiotherapy for mounting robust antitumor immunity. For instance, the cooperation between pyroptosis/ferroptosis and radiotherapy for stimulating antitumor immunity has been implicated in several recent studies on account of their intrinsic biomembrane-disruptive properties, which may significantly enhance the exposure of tumor-associated antigens and DAMPs to stimulate the adaptive antitumor immune responses 148 150 6 151 4+ Alternatively, Xu et al. 3 4 in situ 152 6 153 Remodeling tumor-immune cell communication The RT-induced cell fate divergence is not only a determining factor of the tumor-intrinsic immunogenicity, but also has profound impacts on tumor-infiltrating immune cells as a whole through establishing a complex intercellular communication network, which significantly contributes to the attenuation of RT-associated immunostimulatory benefits by (1) impairing antigen presentation, (2) inducing T cell exhaustion and (3) recruiting immunosuppressor cells. Consequently, regulating post-IR tumor cell fate decisions to remodel tumor-immune cell communication could a viable approach to start the cancer immune cycle for eliciting robust radiotherapy-augmented antitumor immunity. For instance, several recent studies suggest that lipid peroxides released by ferroptotic tumor cells could be captured by CD36-expressing immune cell populations including dendritic cells, macrophages and cytotoxic T cells and directly elevate the ROS stress in immune cells, which would cause significant mitochondrial damage while driving the immune cell towards ferroptosis and apoptosis, eventually leading to impaired cytotoxic capacity and premature exhaustion of infiltrating T cells (Figure 7 154 156 157 159 7 160 161 162 et al. 7 163 Conclusion and perspectives The rapid advances in the concepts and technologies of radiotherapy have brought renewed hopes for the clinical intervention against a variety of tumor indications. Development of novel radiosensitization strategies is a topic of both scientific and practical interest, which may not only deepen our understanding on various biochemical aspects of radiation-biointeraction but also improve the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy on real life patients. Remarkably, the post-IR cell fate divergence has demonstrated critical importance in determining the radiotherapeutic efficacy and revealed numerous druggable targets for radiosensitization, holding promise to promote tumor cell death and evoke antitumor immune responses. Indeed, cell fate regulatory therapeutics could either be used alone or in conjunction with other clinically tested high Z metal-based radiosensitizing agents and have demonstrated plausible therapeutic benefits in a myriad of preclinical and clinical studies, supporting their translational potential in a clinical context. Notably, nanoradiosensitizers have demonstrated significant promise to address the existing limitations of radio-immunotherapy in the clinic. Integrating high Z metal ions and cell fate regulatory therapeutics into nanosystems of tailored sizes, shapes and surface characteristics could not only reduce their collateral damage through preventing premature leakage and non-specific uptake, but also facilitate the development of multimodal therapies for achieving novel therapeutic synergisms. Remarkably, the high Z metal-enabled radiosensitizing effects allowed adequate inhibition of the tumors at a relatively lower total radiation doses, which is beneficial for ameliorating radiation damages to healthy cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells without impairing the antitumor efficacy, thus showing particular relevance for boosting radio-immunotherapeutic responses 164 165 166 NCT04789486 NCT03308604 NCT04881032 NCT03818386 NCT04899908 NCT01946867 NCT01433068 NCT04484909 NCT02379845 NCT02465593 167 in vivo 2 Several challenges are also noted for the clinical application of those cell fate regulatory radiosensitizing therapeutics. Notably, proper functioning of the cell fate determination programs is crucial for ensuring the correct development and homeostasis maintenance of normal tissues, which involve the participation and precise coordination of those cell fate mediators discussed in previous sections. As current cell fate-targeting therapeutics lack intrinsic cell selectivity to differentiate tumor cells and healthy cells, it is understood that the non-discriminative cell fate modulation would induce unacceptable toxicity. Remarkably, the recent advances in drug delivery nanotechnology offer novel approaches to overcome these pharmacokinetic challenges. Specifically, the nanocarrier systems not only potentiate the targeted delivery of the cell fate-targeting therapeutics to tumor cells, but also allow their spatial-temporally controlled release from the carrier substrate, thus enabling even greater synergism with radiotherapy 168 169 Meanwhile, it is also notable that there is still a significant discrepancy between the experimental results on mouse models and the therapeutic performance on real life patients. Particularly, the impact of radiotherapy on various cell fate programs seems to be highly context-dependent, and alterations in the RT dose, fractionation and radiation types may induce significant changes in the eventual cell fate decisions. For instance, while low-dose radiotherapy is prone to inducing immunosilent apoptosis in tumor cells, it demonstrates significantly higher capacity to repolarize immunosuppressive tumor-associated macrophages into anti-tumorigenic M1 phenotype and thus more favorable for radio-immunotherapy under certain circumstances 170 et al. 171 172 174 Furthermore, tumor heterogeneity is a crucial clinic factor dictating the success of RT on real-life patients. In terms of the molecular and phenotypical heterogeneity, the complex genetic makeup of tumor cells in a tumor may undermine the tumoricidal and immunostimulatory effects of RT at varying degrees. For instance, mutations in key cell fate regulators such as p53 and RAS would cause significant changes in the sensitivity of tumor cells to specific cell death decisions, further promoting post-RT tumor cell survival and regeneration. On the other hand, tumors are highly complex ecosystems with marked microenvironmental heterogeneity, which may also contribute to the radioresistance. Typically, the aberrant metabolism and angiogenesis of solid tumors would establish abundant hypoxic regions throughout the tumor tissues, which not only attenuate the ROS-inducing potential of RT to restrict its cytotoxic effects but also harbor those cancer stem cells with enhanced radioresistance and self-renewal capabilities, thus contributing to the post-RT tumor survival and regrowth. Meanwhile, solid tumors frequently present a highly heterogenous immune cell landscape that may substantially influence the recruitment, activation and expansion of anti-tumorigenic immune cells, further influencing the immunostimulatory potential of RT. In summary, the molecular and histological heterogeneity emerges as a formidable barrier for RT through escaping cell death and limiting the immunostimulatory potential, warranting the development of more personalized RT-sensitizing modalities to improve the treatment outcome.
