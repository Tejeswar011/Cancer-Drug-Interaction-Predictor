SCs are mainly divided into three categories of embryonic SCs, induced pluripotent SCs, and adult SCs based on their sources and characteristics ( 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 in vitro 12 in vitro 13 in vitro in vivo 2 Classification and characteristics of MSCs MSCs are a type of multipotent progenitor cells enabling self-renewal in vitro 10 6 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 32  Figure 1 27  Table 1 Figure 1 Classification and characteristics of commonly applied MSCs. Diagram illustrating the sources and functions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from fat, bone marrow, and umbilical cord. It shows ADSCs, BM-MSCs, and HUC-MSCs' roles in regulating NK cells, organizational repair, hematopoietic support, immune regulation, and secretion of growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines. Pathways like HIF-1 alpha/TGF-beta 1/SMAD are involved in cellular proliferation and migration. The Nrf2/HO-1 pathway activation is linked to pancreatic beta cell injury prevention. Various receptors and pathways related to NK cells are depicted, including NKp30, NKG2D, and CD96. Table 1 Classification and characteristics of commonly applied MSCs.  ADSCs BM-MSCs HUC-MSCs Surface markers CD13, CD90, CD105, and STRO - 1 ( 33 CD90, CD105, CD146, and CD271 ( 34 CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105 ( 35 Treatment characteristics Tissue regeneration ( 36 37 38 39 Organizational repair ( 16 17 18 Immune regulation ( 40 41 Clinical application Skeletal diseases ( 42 38 43 44 45 46 Skeletal diseases ( 47 48 49 50 51 Liver disease ( 52 53 54 55 56 Advantage Rich sources, low ethical controversy, low risk of infection, high proliferation and differentiation ability ( 23 24 Mature research, sufficient sources, low immunogenicity, and few ethical issues ( 57 58 Convenient access, strong proliferation ability, low immunogenicity, and minimal ethical controversy ( 59 3 Application of MSCs from different sources in the treatment of male infertility 3.1 Adipose-derived stem cells The application of ADSCs in the treatment of various diseases has attracted widespread research attention worldwide ( 60  Figure 2 Figure 2 Application of ADSCs in the treatment for male infertility. Diagram illustrating the role of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) in testicular function. The main sections include anti-oxidative stress, antiapoptosis, autocrine growth factors, and hormone regulation. In the anti-oxidative stress area, ADSCs regulate antioxidant enzymes reducing ROS. The antiapoptosis section shows inhibition of apoptosis and germ cell death. The autocrine growth factors area indicates promotion of germ cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and blood-testis barrier repair. Lastly, hormone regulation features microenvironment reconstruction, hormone recovery, and enhancement of sperm production efficiency. It has been reported that chemotherapic agents commonly administrated in cancer treatment could cause toxic damage to the reproductive system, which is inevitable in this process and is also an important factor leading to nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) in the clinical setting ( 61 62 63 5 in vivo 64 65 66 6 67 68 67 In addition to improving chemotherapic agent-induced fertility decline, ADSCs also present with significant therapeutic potential in varicocele-induced male infertility. The impact of varicocele, a common disease that leads to male infertility, is mainly manifested as decreased sperm count, vitality, and reduced proportion of normal sperm morphology ( 69 70 71 6 72 73 74 Testicular torsion is a common clinical emergency that may result in male infertility ( 75 75 4 76 In summary, single-dose injection of ADSCs at a specific quantity into different sites of different experimental subjects can effectively reconstruct the reproductive microenvironment. Its underlying mechanisms may involve the inhibition of oxidative stress response, reduction of testicular tissue cell apoptosis, promotion of BTB repair, regulation of reproductive hormone metabolism, and facilitation of the migration of reproductive cells. All these discoveries may provide innovative therapeutic regimes for various male infertility diseases. 3.2 Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells BM-MSCs have excellent tissue repair and immune regulatory properties, which hence have been widely used in the clinical treatment of various diseases ( 21  Figure 3 Figure 3 Application of BM-MSCs in the treatment of male infertility. Diagram illustrating the effects of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) on sperm cells, highlighting functions like inhibition of oxidative damage and pro-apoptotic proteins, Caspase-3 activation, secretion of regeneration factors like VEGF and SCF, hormone regulation, blood-testis barrier repair, and restoration of sperm count, vitality, and morphology. Arrows indicate the interconnected processes leading to anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptotic effects, secretory regeneration factors, and microenvironment and hormone balance improvements. As a type of stem cells, MSCs also possess the multipotent differentiation potential of stem cells, and exhibit outstanding characteristics in the process of differentiation into germ cells. In a study of NOA treatment, Zhang et al. innovatively combined in vitro in vivo 5 in vivo 77 In the research on male infertility caused by other tumor suppressor drugs, BM-MSCs have also demonstrated excellent therapeutic properties. Among them, cyclophosphamide (CYP) is a potent chemotherapic agent that plays an important role in tumor treatment ( 78 79 6 79 Furthermore, in a completed clinical trial on BM-MSCs ( NCT02025270 6 NCT02414295 Furthermore, multiple experiments have verified the anti-excessive apoptosis effect of BM-MSCs on testicular tissue cells in the treatment of male infertility. Compared with the anti-apoptotic mechanism of ADSCs, BM-MSCs exhibit similar but more diverse anti-apoptotic pathways. For example, Zickri found that the injection of BM-MSCs into the testes could effectively reduce Caspase-3 expression in the spermatogenic epithelium of rats with busulfan-induced oligozoospermia. It could further significantly improved spermatogenic arrest, and reduced numbers of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and sperm cells caused by increased cell apoptosis. Besides, the study also revealed a novel antioxidant mechanism of BM-MSCs. Specifically, BM-MSCs could significantly reduce the protein level ofinducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), an oxidative stress marker, in rat seminiferous epithelium, thereby alleviating oxidative stress damage to testicular tissue ( 80 81 At present, there is a continuous rise i n the incidence of diabetes with the change of lifestyle. The disease may induce male infertility by influencing the hypothalamus pituitary gonad (HPG) axis and inducing oxidative stress in reproductive organs ( 82 83 In recent years, researchers have developed novel cultivation platforms to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of BM-MSCs. For example, Önen et al. developed a pumpless monodimethylsiloxane layered testis-on-chip platform, providing a continuous and stabilized microfluidic flow and real-time cellular paracrine contribution of allogeneic BM-MSCs. Compared with hanging droplets and non-BM-MSCs (controls), this platform could increase T concentration and improve the growth of seminiferous tubules for 42 days, revealing significant advantages in differentiating spermatogonia, VASA (+) total germ cells, meiotic cells (e.g., spermatocytes and sperm cells), and testicular maturation, thereby significantly improving in vitro 84 Therefore, BM-MSCs can exert multiple functional mechanisms such as differentiating into germ cells in vivo 3.3 Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells HUC-MSCs have been demonstrated to enable the secretion of multiple cytokines and differentiation into different types of cells, while significantly reducing the risk of immune rejection and ethical controversies, supporting them an ideal source of cells in regenerative medicine field ( 85 in vivo in vitro  Figure 4 Figure 4 Application of HUC-MSCs in the treatment for male infertility. Diagram illustrating the roles of HUC-MSCs in transforming into germ cells, proliferating and differentiating spermatogonia, and providing anti-inflammatory effects. Processes include morphological recovery of seminiferous tubules, improved testicular microenvironment, and reduction of ROS with neutrophils. Key factors are Oct-4, C-kit, VASA, IL-1β, TNF-α, Selectin-E, IL-10, IL-13, TGF-β1, GCNF, CNTF, and VEGF. In male infertility caused by testicular torsion, administration of 10 ( 7 86 In addition to its therapeutic properties, HUC-MSCs also exhibit the potential of in vivo in vitro in vivo 85 in vitro 87 In summary, HUC-MSCs can also differentiate into germ cells in vitro in vivo 3.4 Other types of mesenchymal stem cells Indeed, ADSCs, BM-MSCs, and HUC-MSCs have shown great potential in the treatment of male infertility caused by various etiologies, and they also exert their therapeutic effects through various pathways and molecular mechanisms. Other types of MSCs have also exhibit strong therapeutic potential, further enriching the application scope and theoretical basis of MSCs in treating male infertility (  Table 2 Table 2 Research methods and therapeutic mechanisms of MSCs in the treatment for male infertility.

According to relevant research results, BR MSCs could enhance insulin level by interacting with insulin receptors, thereby enhancing energy metabolism in kisspeptin neurons, stimulating HPG axis, effectively restoring the serum levels of FSH, LH and total T of diabetic rats, thereby improving diabetes-induced fertility decline ( 102 4 The application of MSC-Exos in male infertility EVs are a group of heterogeneously sized, cell-derived nanoparticles operating as proficient mediators of intercellular communication, which are well-established players in various physiological and pathological processes by transporting bioactive molecules to target cells, providing novel therapeutic strategies for disease treatment ( 109 11 Guo et al. co-cultured bone marrow MSC-derived Exos (BMSC Exos) with CYP-induced testicular tissues in mice. Corresponding results showed that based on the uptake of BMSC Exos, mouse spermatogonia significantly reduced the intracellular phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), AKT, and p38 Mitogen activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) proteins. As a result, such phosphorylation reduction inhibited the activation of p38MAPK/ERK and AKT signaling pathways, promoted the repair of damaged testicular tissue, and effectively treated CYP-induced testicular tissue damage ( 110 111 In the study of testicular injury caused by environmental pollution, MSC Exos also exhibit preferable therapeutic properties. For instance, induced pluripotent SC-derived MSC-derived Exos (iMSC Exos) could significantly increase the expression of GC1 spermatogonia (spg) cells (GC1-SPG), and reduce the number of lesions with H2AX+p53 binding protein 1+ by inhibiting the protein level of phosphorylated gamma-histone H2A. X (γ H2AX), thereby alleviating DNA damage and improving Cd-induced decline in mouse spermatogenic ability. Meanwhile, iMSC Exos could effectively increase the formation of autophagosomes and autolysosomes in mouse germ cell specific protein 1/spermatogenesis associated protein, enhance autophagy flux and reduce P62 protein accumulation, improve Cd-induced autophagy flux deficiency, promote spermatogonial proliferation and differentiation, protect mice from Cd-induced germ cell apoptosis, and cope with the decline in reproductive ability caused by Cd in environmental pollution ( 112 Indeed, bacterial infections of the reproductive organs and tract are regarded as one of the important causes among numerous factors contributing to male infertility. Among them, Chlamydia trachomatis 113 Chlamydia trachomatis 114 Chlamydia trachomatis Chlamydia trachomatis Chlamydia trachomatis Chlamydia trachomatis 115 In addition, MSC Exos have shown promising application prospects in sperm storage. Drug therapy-induced gonadal toxicity has been accepted as a major contributor to male infertility for many years ( 116 117 117 118 120 Therefore, by inheriting the therapeutic properties of MSCs in treating male infertility, such as antioxidant effects and anti-apoptosis of testicular tissue cells, MSC-Exos can be used to treat the damage to reproductive organs caused by the use of chemotherapeutic drugs and post-chemotherapeutic drugs. Moreover, MSC-Exos show great potential in addressing the damage to male reproductive organs and tracts caused by bacterial infections, as well as in sperm storage (  Table 3 Table 3 The application of MSC-Exos in male infertility.

Therefore, there are a limited number of SC therapies that have been clinically validated and successfully applied ( 121 123 124 125 In addition, the clinical application of MSCs has been restricted greatly owing to the disadvantages of high preparation cost, complex preparation technology, and relatively underdeveloped preparation system, making it difficult to achieve mass production of products and relative uniformity in quality. Taking BM-MSCs as an example, there is an extremely small number of BM-MSCs that can be extracted from the bone marrow. Their preparation involves multiple steps such as in vitro 126 Despite safer and more reliable therapeutic properties compared to MSCs, MSC Exos may still be accompanied by potential tumor risks, high preparation costs, and incomplete standardization systems, which limit their further clinical applications ( 127 128 129 Meanwhile, even stricter conditions are proposed for the preparation of MSC-Exos. Firstly, in terms of quality control, the lack of standardized protocols for exosome isolation and purification triggers evident variations in product characteristics and therapeutic efficacy. Although ultracentrifugation has been acccepted as the “gold standard” for exosome isolation, several issues remain to be addressed, such as expensive equipment, long processing time (4 – 6 hours), limited recovery rate, and purity problems caused by co-precipitation of other extracellular vesicles and protein complexes ( 127 130 In the aspect of research on male infertility treatment, MSCs have made significant achievements in animal experiments, tyet with the absence of relevant human clinical trials due to various factors. Although experiments have shown that human fetal testicular tissue can effectively differentiate into male germ cells when co-cultured with HUC-MSCs in vitro 94 Simultaneously, ethical risks are also issues that need to be emphasized squarely in the application of MSCs for treating male infertility. Therefore, how to establish a correct concept to view the new assisted reproductive models, whether in the clinical trial stage or the application stage, remains an ideological prerequisite affecting their further development. 6 Summary and prospect The present study reviews the latest research progress in the application of MSCs and MSC Exos in the treatment of male infertility induced by external factors, such as chemotherapeutic agent use, diabetes, environmental pollution, and research findings about their abilities of in vivo in vitro  Table 2 Indeed, MSCs have shown broad application prospects in male infertility treatment, but the presence of many challenges may hinder their further clinical translation. The potential tumorigenicity and immune rejection risks of MSCs need to be addressed through stricter safety assessments and quality control systems. Furthermore, the actual clinical application of MSC Exos may be impeded by their high preparation cost and incomplete standardization system, although they exhibit safer and more reliable therapeutic properties compared to MSCs. Noticeably, available data generated from existing research are mostly based on rodent models, with a lack of data from human clinical trial, necessitating further verification on the therapeutic efficacy and safety of MSCs in humans. Simultaneously, further research on the underlying mechanisms is also required given that there is currently a poor understanding of the specific molecular mechanism by which MSCs restore normal sperm production. In response to the above challenges, future research should focus on the establishment of standardized processes for the preparation of MSCs and MSC Exos to ensure their quality stability and clinical application safety; efforts should also be made to explore more efficient and relatively low-cost large-scale production models for MSCs and MSC-Exos; in-depth exploration of the molecular mechanisms underlying the repair of damage to testicular tissues by MSCs and MSC Exos, particularly a systematic identification of key regulatory molecules and signaling pathways through high-throughput sequencing technology and multi-omics analysis; performance of more preclinical studies and early clinical trials to verify the effectiveness and safety of MSCs in treating male infertility; investigation on the combined use of MSCs with existing therapies (e.g., drug therapy, surgical treatment, or assisted reproductive technology) to further improve treatment efficacy; as well as the development of. individualized treatment plans for MSCs targeting specific etiologies to meet the clinical needs of different patients. With the development of biomaterials science, microfluidic technology, and tissue engineering, the construction of MSC-based tissue-engineered testes will also become a research hotspot in the future. It is expected to achieve a complete spermatogenesis process in vitro In conclusion, the emerging MSCs and MSC Exos have shown great potential in the field of male infertility treatment. By addressing existing technological bottlenecks, delving into their functional mechanisms, and conducting standardized clinical trials, MSC therapies are anticipated to become an innovative solution for male infertility, bringing new hope for patients with refractory male infertility. However, to ensure the reliability and safety of MSCs’ therapeutic effects, the translation from basic research to clinical application still requires collaborative efforts from multiple disciplines and centers.
