Whether large-scale changes occurred in clinical practice after this trial is unknown. Methods We performed a retrospective longitudinal cross-sectional analysis using National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data from 2012 to 2019. Our study included hospitalized adults at least 18 years of age diagnosed with MG without an associated thymoma. We used joinpoint regression to analyze annual trends in thymectomy volume and surgical approach (minimally invasive vs trans-sternal) from 2012 to 2019. Using logistic regression models, we examined patient and hospital-level factors that may have influenced whether thymectomy was performed, such as age, sex, race, insurance payor, hospital size and teaching status, and Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. Sampling weights were applied to account for the complex survey design of NIS. Results The total number of thymectomy procedures increased by 69.8% per year (95% CI 40.1–105.8) between 2012 and 2019. Trans-sternal thymectomies increased by 62.8% per year (95% CI 35.8–95.2) and minimally invasive thymectomies by 83.7% per year (95% CI 38.1–144.3). Thymectomies were significantly more likely to occur in 2017–2019 compared with 2012–2016 (OR 1.93, 95% CI 1.62–2.31). In a multivariable regression model, several factors decreased the odds of patients with MG having a thymectomy: older age, Black race (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49–0.77), female (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.63–0.86), and higher Elixhauser Comorbidity Index. Patients in medium (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.30–2.55) or large (OR 2.81, 95% CI 2.07–3.82) size and urban teaching hospitals (OR 6.09, 95% CI 2.65–13.97) were more likely to undergo thymectomy. Discussion Thymectomy is being performed more frequently for non-thymomatous MG, especially after 2016 after publication of a positive phase III clinical trial. There are several disparities in thymectomy utilization that warrant further attention. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
