Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), a common neurological disorder with a high rate of disability, involves complex immunoinflammatory mechanisms, particularly those related to secondary inflammatory injury. Neutrophils, as the earliest subtype of leukocytes recruited after stroke, play a pivotal role in secondary brain injury. Traditionally, neutrophils were thought to mediate tissue damage primarily via phagocytosis, chemotaxis, and degranulation. However, recent studies have shown that neutrophils also contribute to the pathogenesis of intracerebral hemorrhage by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which exacerbate blood-brain barrier disruption, amplify local inflammy -30ation, and promote neuronal injury. This review systematically examines the interactions between the central and peripheral immune systems following ICH. It focuses on the bidirectional regulatory relationship between microglia and neutrophils, and their coordinated roles in inflammation, blood-brain barrier disruption, neurological dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. In addition, this review summarizes recent potential therapeutic strategies targeting the formation and clearance of NETs, including peptidylarginine deiminase 4 inhibitors, reactive oxygen species inhibitors, histone inhibitors, and DNases. These interventions may offer theoretical insights into novel therapeutic targets for mitigating secondary injury following ICH. intracerebral hemorrhage neutrophil extracellular traps microglia central and peripheral immune systems mechanism analysis The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

According to the latest statistics, in 2018, the mortality rate for cerebrovascular diseases in China was 149.49 per 100,000, with 1.57 million deaths ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 ICH, one of the most devastating type of stroke, encompasses parenchymal hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), accounting for 15-30% of all stroke cases ( 7 8 9 13 14 Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), promptly react to injury signals subsequent to ICH. Their activation states and polarization phenotypes play a decisive role in determining the extent of neuroinflammation and subsequent tissue repair ( 15 16 17 18 During the immune response, neutrophils are rapidly recruited and activated, releasing nuclear and granular contents that form extensive web-like DNA structures known as NETs ( 19 21 22 23 24 25 This review systematically summarizes the interactions between the central and peripheral immune systems following ICH. It focuses on the signaling crosstalk and pathological synergy between microglia and neutrophils, particularly the bidirectional regulatory role of neutrophil NETs in this process. By outlining recent advances in this field, we aim to provide a theoretical foundation and reference for understanding the mechanisms of neuroinflammation in ICH, identifying potential biomarkers, and developing targeted therapeutic strategies. 2 Immune response following intracerebral hemorrhage 2.1 Interactions between the central and peripheral immune systems Due to its antigen-induced immune tolerance and the physical isolation provided by the BBB and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier, the CNS has long been considered an immune-privileged site. The presence of peripheral immune components within the central CNS was traditionally considered a pathological feature under healthy conditions. However, research over the past two decades has gradually challenged this view ( 26 27 28  Figure 1 29 31 Figure 1 Bidirectional communication between the central and peripheral immune systems after ICH. Following intracerebral hemorrhage, the central nervous system (CNS) rapidly responds by engaging in bidirectional communication with the peripheral immune system via the autonomic nervous system, neuroendocrine system, andmeningeal lymphatic vasculature, while releasing signaling molecules such as inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Meanwhile, peripheral immune cells infiltrate the CNS through the compromised blood-brain barrier and the choroid plexus, contributing to the local inflammatory response. Diagram illustrating how the central nervous system recruits the peripheral immune system. It details three pathways: autonomic nervous system, hypothalamic-pituitary system, and meningeal-lymphatic system. The autonomic system involves sympathetic and vagus nerves affecting immune cells and inflammatory responses. The hypothalamic-pituitary system releases hormones like oxytocin and steroids, influencing immune cells. The meningeal-lymphatic system depicts cerebrospinal fluid flow aiding solute clearance. Below, pathways of immune cells entering the central nervous system are shown, highlighting blood-brain barrier breakdown and choroid plexus invasion. ICH occurs due to vascular rupture, resulting in hematoma formation within the brain. The primary injury is characterized by mechanical compression of brain tissue, including elevated intracranial pressure and brain herniation. The subsequent detrimental effects are termed secondary brain injury, which encompasses neuroinflammation, cerebral edema, BBB disruption, and other pathological alterations. Inflammation is one of the earliest defense responses following ICH, but it also contributes to the exacerbation of brain injury. Both central nervous system and peripheral immune cells play critical roles in orchestrating the inflammatory response surrounding the hematoma ( 32 33 34 35  Figure 1 The sympathetic nervous system is integral to the stress response after stroke ( 36 37 38 39 41 42 + 43 45 46 48 More profound immune regulation is also mediated by the neuroendocrine system. The hypothalamic-pituitary axis modulates immune responses not only through the release of oxytocin and arginine vasopressin (AVP) ( 49 51 52 53 54 57 53 58 59 The meningeal lymphatic system also plays a critical role in the immune response following stroke ( 60 61 63 60 64 65 66 Peripheral immune cells access the CNS primarily via two routes: the classical BBB pathway and the choroid plexus pathway. In the early phase after injury, immune cells are recruited to the cerebral vasculature and, through interactions with endothelial cells, traverse the BBB into the brain parenchyma via adhesion molecules ( 67 70 71 72 73 74 In summary, stroke-induced peripheral immune responses involve multiple complex mechanisms, including regulation by the autonomic nervous system, neuroendocrine modulation, immune cell trafficking through meningeal lymphatic vessels, and alterations in BBB permeability. This intricate immune process affects not only the acute phase of stroke but may also significantly influence long-term neural repair and recovery. Therefore, a deeper understanding of these mechanisms is essential for the formulation of effective immunomodulatory strategies. 2.2 Immunological functions of microglia in the central nervous system Microglia are among the most important immune cells in the central nervous system, comprising approximately 5% to 10% of the total CNS cell population ( 75 76 77 In healthy brain tissue, microglia exist in a “resting” state, primarily maintaining homeostasis by monitoring the microenvironment and clearing dead cells ( 15 78 79 80 81 82 82 80  Figure 2 Figure 2 Functional changes of microglia in resting and activated states. In healthy brain tissue, microglia exist in a resting state with a ramified morphology. They monitor neuronal activity, clear apoptotic cells, and maintain central nervous system homeostasis. After ICH, microglia are activated by damage-associated molecules such as hemoglobin and iron. They adopt a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and release cytokines, including IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and reactive oxygen species. This contributes to BBB disruption, immune cell infiltration, and neuronal damage. Subsequently, microglia transition to an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, secreting factors such as IL-4 and IL-10. This shift supports blood-brain barrier repair and promotes neurological recovery. Diagram illustrating the functional changes of microglia in resting and activated states. On the left, resting microglia monitor neuronal activity, clear dead cells, and maintain homeostasis, ensuring the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity. On the right, activated microglia release hemoglobin and iron, differentiating into M1 and M2 types. M1 microglia lead to increased BBB permeability and nerve damage with IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 secretion, while M2 microglia promote BBB reconstruction and brain injury repair with IL-4, IL-10 secretion. The image also shows immune cell infiltration and potential brain injury effects. While microglial activation enhances the local immune response, it also exerts neuroprotective effects by phagocytosing damaged cells and cellular debris to clear the injury site ( 83 18 80  Figure 2 In recent years, there has been heightened focus on the functional polarization of microglia following a stroke, especially regarding the equilibrium between their pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory states. Studies have shown that activating signaling pathways such as Nrf2 ( 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 93 94 Although the “microglial polarization” and M1/M2 dichotomy are still widely used in the literature, studies have shown that this model oversimplifies the situation, particularly in in vivo 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 Microglia are crucial in the immune response after a stroke. Adjusting the equilibrium between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory states can effectively alleviate brain injury and promote neural repair. Therefore, developing therapeutic strategies that target microglial function, particularly through the regulation of their activation states, may offer novel approaches for immunotherapy in stroke. 2.3 Neutrophils in intracerebral hemorrhage Neutrophils, the predominant leukocytes in the peripheral immune system, are among the initial cells recruited to the central nervous system after intracerebral hemorrhage ( 33 33 102 103 71 104 As shown in  Figure 3 105 106 107 108 109 112 113 Figure 3 Neutrophil mobilization and neurotoxic mechanisms after intracerebral hemorrhage. After ICH, hemoglobin, iron, and other damage-associated molecules induce endothelial cell activation. This process is accompanied by the upregulation of adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1, which enhances neutrophil adhesion to the endothelium. Subsequently, neutrophils disrupt and traverse the BBB, migrating into the central nervous system. They release pro-inflammatory granules such as neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and lactoferrin. In addition, neutrophils form NETs, which, together with inflammatory mediators such as MMP-9 and IL-6, exacerbate BBB disruption and neuronal injury. Diagram illustrating the inflammatory cascade after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Hemoglobin, iron, and other damage-associated molecules activate endothelial cells, leading to increased expression of adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1 and promoting neutrophil adhesion. Neutrophils infiltrate through the compromised blood-brain barrier, releasing pro-inflammatory granules including neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and lactoferrin. Critically, neutrophils also form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which interact with microglia and inflammatory mediators such as MMP-9 and IL-6. These processes amplify neuroinflammation, exacerbate blood-brain barrier disruption, and contribute to secondary neuronal injury. Neutrophils are considered a key component of the innate immune system’s initial response to microbial invasion ( 114 21 115 116  Figure 3 3 NETs in intracerebral hemorrhage 3.1 Mechanisms of NETs formation and physiological functions 3.1.1 Formation and regulation of NETs Takei was the first to observe that neutrophils can form NETs to kill bacteria ( 117 21 22 118 119 118  Figure 4 Figure 4 Mechanisms of NETs formation in inflammation. Under inflammatory stimulation, neutrophils can form NETs through three distinct mechanisms, contributing to both immune defense and tissue damage: (a) (b) (c) Illustration depicting three types of NETosis: Suicidal, Vital, and Mitochondria, with pathways and timelines. Suicidal NETosis occurs in 2-4 hours, leading to neutrophil death. Vital NETosis happens in 5-60 minutes, resulting in NETs excretion. Mitochondria NETosis occurs in 15 minutes, leading to mitochondrial DNA excretion. Each process involves cellular components and interactions highlighted by arrows and labels. Suicidal NETosis is the earliest identified and most well-characterized form of NET formation. It depends on the activation of NOX and the production of ROS, typically occurring 2 to 4 hours after neutrophil activation. Specifically, stimuli such as phorbol myristate acetate and IL-8 activate Fcγ receptors or Toll-like receptors (TLRs), initiating the Raf–MEK–ERK signaling cascade. This sequentially activates Ras and protein kinase C (PKC), ultimately driving NOX activity and the production of ROS ( 120 121 122 123  Figure 4 However, studies have also shown that neutrophils can rapidly release NETs without undergoing cell death, a process termed “vital NETosis.” This form of NET release, as shown in  Figure 4 124 125 Further studies have identified a third type of NET formation termed “mitochondrial NETosis,” ( 126  Figure 4 126 3.1.2 Physiological functions of NETs As a major effector mechanism of neutrophils, NETs were initially thought to play a key role in host defense, particularly against bacterial and viral infections ( 127 21  Figure 5 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 23 Figure 5 Physiological functions of NETs and their roles in secondary brain injury after ICH.NETs are composed of chromatin, histones, NE, and MPO. On the left, the physiological functions of NETs are shown: (A) (B) (C) (D) (A) (B) (C) (D) Diagram illustrating the dual roles of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs). On the left, physiological functions include forming barriers against pathogens, directly killing microorganisms, degrading cytokines to interfere with neutrophil activation, and executing antibacterial functions by destroying microbial structures. On the right, NETs' role in secondary brain injury involves activating inflammatory pathways, amplifying inflammation leading to neuronal damage, inducing macrophage and microglial polarization, and promoting platelet aggregation causing reperfusion disorders. The diagram is segmented with labeled sections and includes visual representations of microorganisms, pathways, and cellular structures. Notably, under the immunologically active conditions of stroke, NETs exhibit a complex dual role in physiological function ( 17 3.2 NETs-mediated secondary brain injury In recent years, research on NETs has provided novel insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of neutrophils. NETs are web-like structures composed of decondensed chromatin, histones, MPO, NE, and other associated proteins. Their formation process is known as NETosis. Significant accumulation of NETs has been observed in both ICH models and clinical specimens. A postmortem study by Laurent Puy and colleagues was the first to demonstrate the presence of abundant NETs in the human brain following ICH ( 135 136 The formation of NETs depends on the activation of multiple signaling pathways, including NOX2-mediated production of ROS and activation of TLR4 ( 137 138 139 140 141 Although NETs formation plays an important physiological role in acute infection defense, as shown in  Figure 5 102 142 145 146 148 149 150 3.3 Mechanisms of NET-induced programmed cell death in ICH Although NETs contribute to pathogen clearance during stroke, their “double-edged sword” effect in the immune response should not be overlooked. Aberrant activation and excessive formation of NETs, as shown in  Figure 6 151 Figure 6 NETs-driven inflammatory cell death pathways after ICH. NETs play multiple roles in regulating neuronal cell death after ICH. By activating the NLRP3 inflammasome and various signaling pathways, NETs can induce pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and apoptosis, thereby exacerbating secondary brain injury. Diagram illustrating inflammatory responses: inflammasome, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, and apoptosis. The inflammasome panel depicts activation pathways involving TNFR, TLR4, and IL-1R leading to NLRP3 activation. Pyroptosis shows macrophage involvement with PAMPs/DAMPs and release of IL-1β. Ferroptosis illustrates interactions with ROS, cytochrome C, and NETs signaling. Apoptosis features processes including the role of transferrin and inhibition by NETs with involvement of lipoxin A4. Each section highlights specific cellular components and signaling pathways. Histones, MPO, NE, and PAD4, which are abundantly present in NETs, are considered classical DAMPs. These components can be recognized by mononuclear phagocyte lineages in the brain and activate the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway. Multiple studies have confirmed that the lesion area of ICH is often associated with high expression of caspase-1, IL-1β, and MPO ( 152 153 102 151 154  Figure 6 Pyroptosis is a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death that primarily depends on caspase-1, -4, or -5-mediated cleavage of Gasdermin D, which leads to the formation of membrane pores and promotes the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β. Upon sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or DAMPs, NOD-like receptors (NLRs) recruit caspase-1 via the adaptor protein ASC, resulting in caspase-1 oligomerization and the induction of pyroptosis ( 155 156 157 158 159 160 154 161 162 163 164 165 Ferroptosis, a form of programmed cell death characterized by iron dependency and the accumulation of lipid peroxides, has increasingly been recognized as a key contributor following ICH. Studies have shown that ICH-induced neutrophil infiltration reduces the transcription and expression of lactoferrin, thereby weakening its interaction with SLC7A11 and indirectly exacerbating neuronal ferroptosis ( 166 167 168 In addition to pyroptosis and ferroptosis, NETs can also induce neuronal apoptosis. Extracellular histones released from NETs directly disrupt the integrity of the cell membrane, trigger the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores, lead to cytochrome c release and Bax/Bcl-2 imbalance, and ultimately activate the caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathway ( 169 170 4 Regulatory role of microglia in ICH Following ICH, microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, are among the first to be activated. Their functional and phenotypic changes perform a pivotal function in both secondary neuronal injury and tissue repair. Through interactions with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and peripheral immune cells, microglia help establish a complex immunoregulatory network that exerts both detrimental and reparative effects on tissue injury and recovery after ICH. 4.1 Dual roles of microglia in the CNS immune network In the early stages of ICH, components such as hemoglobin and heme rapidly activate microglia via the TLR4, driving their polarization toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype and resulting in the release of large amounts of DAMPs ( 81 82 171 172 171  Figure 7 Figure 7 Microglial interactions with CNS and peripheral immune cells after ICH. In the CNS, microglia interact with astrocytes through multiple signaling pathways to regulate inflammation, glial scar formation, and neural repair. Moreover, microglial polarization influences oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin regeneration. In the periphery, microglia release chemokines to interact with neutrophils, macrophages, natural killer (NK) cells, and T lymphocytes, establishing a complex network of inflammatory amplification and immune regulation. Diagram illustrating the interaction and functions of microglia with various cells in the immune environment. It shows relationships with astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, neutrophils, natural killer cells, monocytes, macrophages, and T cells. The diagram outlines pathways influencing microglial polarization between M1 and M2 states, indicating factors like LTB4, NF-kB, and TGF-beta. Arrows indicate interactions, effects such as inflammation, growth factors, and damage aggravation. Over time, activated microglia progressively shift toward the M2 phenotype, releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β, as well as neurotrophic factors. This phenotypic transition contributes to hematoma clearance, vascular regeneration, and axonal repair, thereby reducing inflammation and improving neurological outcomes. This phenotypic shift is not only influenced by changes in the inflammatory microenvironment but also regulated by signaling pathways such as JAK1/STAT6, Nrf2, and PPARγ. For example, activation of Nrf2 enhances the phagocytic capacity of microglia and increases the expression of neurotrophic factors ( 84 85 86 87 88 173 91 93 89 90 Within the central immune network, interactions between microglia and astrocytes are particularly intimate. A study by Shi et al. demonstrated that IL-15 exacerbates cerebral edema and neuronal injury after ICH by enhancing inflammatory signaling between astrocytes and microglia ( 174 175 176 177 178 179 White matter injury is a common consequence of ICH, characterized by oligodendrocyte death and demyelination. Microglia also play a critical role in both the injury and repair of white matter ( 175 4.2 Crosstalk and reciprocal regulation between microglia and peripheral immune cells In the context of peripheral immune responses, microglia promote the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into brain tissue by releasing chemokines and cytokines, with neutrophils playing a particularly prominent role in secondary brain injury, as shown in  Figure 7 180 181 182 184 185 186 187 188 79 189 In summary, microglia play a central role in regulating central immune responses after ICH through dynamic phenotypic transitions. They not only orchestrate the early inflammatory response but also engage in complex interactions with peripheral immune cells to shape both the pathological progression and repair outcomes. Elucidating the mechanisms by which microglia operate within this complex network, particularly their functional crosstalk with neutrophils, will provide a theoretical basis for developing novel immunotherapeutic strategies and may improve neurological outcomes following ICH. 5 Bidirectional regulation between NETs and microglia: from stroke to neurodegenerative diseases Immune responses triggered by neurological disorders involve not a single immune cell population, but rather a complex network of cellular interactions. Within this network, the bidirectional regulation between NETs and microglia plays a critical role in shaping post-stroke immune responses. The interaction between NETs and microglia not only regulates local immune responses during the acute phase, but may also profoundly influence neurorepair, BBB integrity, and functional recovery in stroke and other neurological disorders. After ICH, microglial phenotypes and functions exhibit significant temporal changes: during the acute phase (within approximately 72 hours), a pro-inflammatory or interferon-responsive phenotype predominates, gradually transitioning to a phenotype characterized by phagocytosis and repair, such as DAM-like ( 18 32 97 190 66 191 192 193 194 192 However, current research on the interactions between NETs and microglia in ICH remains limited. Most available evidence is derived from models of ischemic stroke, TBI, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Despite variations in disease contexts, current studies consistently reveal a highly conserved crosstalk mechanism between NETs and microglia in central inflammatory responses. Therefore, systematically elucidating their synergistic interactions, particularly in the regulation of inflammation, BBB disruption, and neurological dysfunction, will help uncover the key pathological mechanisms underlying secondary neural damage following ICH. As presented in  Table 1 Table 1 Mechanisms of NET–microglia interaction. Functional direction Mechanistic effect Molecular mechanism Ref. Regulation of Secondary Inflammation Microglia recruit neutrophils and induce NETs release. cGAS-STING ( 102 195 NETs induce microglial polarization and pro-inflammatory cytokine release. cGAS-STING, C3aR, TREM1–SYK, HMGB1/JNK/AP1 ( 196 199 BBB Modulation Histones from NETs bind to endothelial cells and disrupt the cytoskeleton. Histone–receptor binding ( 200 201 Degradation of extracellular matrix ERK/MMP9/AQP4 ( 202 203 Regulation of tight junction proteins and vascular remodeling PAD4-STING-IFNβ pathway ( 204 Neurological and Cognitive Regulation NETs-associated cytotoxins induce neuronal apoptosis NETs-associated components ( 205 Secondary inflammation exacerbates neuronal injury and cognitive impairment M1 polarization and NETs interaction ( 206 NETs accumulate in Aβ-rich regions, activate inflammation, and impair synaptic networks NETs-Aβ interaction ( 207 208 5.1 Coordinated regulation of the inflammatory response Inflammation is a principal pathological characteristic of ICH, with secondary inflammatory responses significantly influencing stroke progression, the degree of neuronal damage, and subsequent neurological recovery. Microglia promote the release of NETs, which in turn further activate microglia. Together, they facilitate the recruitment of local immune cells and influence the pathological progression of the disease. As illustrated in  Table 1 209 Existing direct evidence in ICH shows that this bidirectional interaction is rapidly initiated during the acute phase. Hematoma degradation products, DAMPs, and endothelial signals exposed by blood-brain barrier disruption (e.g., ICAM-1, P-selectin) can drive extensive neutrophil infiltration into the brain parenchyma ( 82 102 210 200 210 210 4 7 211 Research on this mechanism is continuously advancing, as shown in  Figure 8 102 212 201 136 213 Figure 8 Mechanism of NET-induced microglial activation and BBB disruption. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) activate microglia through multiple signaling cascades, amplifying neuroinflammatory responses and exacerbating blood-brain barrier disruption. Diagram illustrating the cellular pathways involved in neutrophil recruitment and NET formation due to HMGB1 interaction with TREM1 and LP17. The pathways include JNK and SYK activation leading to NF-kB and proinflammatory factors. Cytosolic DNA activates cGAS generating 2'3'-cGAMP, which stimulates STING activating IRF3 and microglia. Pathways also show ERK involvement in MMP9 activity, disrupting tight junction proteins and causing blood-brain barrier disruption and inhibition of angiogenesis and remodeling through IFNβ expression. Interestingly, the bidirectional interaction between the two is also prominent in studies of other neurological disorders. Studies have found that ginsenoside Rg1-loaded vesicles enhance microglial clearance of neutrophils, significantly reducing NET release and promoting neovascularization and brain tissue repair ( 214 195 215 216 In conclusion, although substantial evidence supports the bidirectional regulation between NETs and microglia in various neurological disorders, relevant studies in ICH remain scarce, particularly clinical research. ICH has a unique pathological context, including hematoma-driven inflammation and iron-mediated toxicity, and its immune regulatory mechanisms may differ significantly from those in ischemic stroke and TBI. Future studies should integrate ICH-specific animal models and clinical samples to further clarify the true role of NETs and microglia interactions in the progression of ICH and their therapeutic potential. Additionally, this inflammation amplification not only affects the release of cytokines but also further disrupts the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier, becoming a key mechanism in post-stroke secondary injury. 5.2 Synergistic disruption of the BBB The BBB is a multilayered structure consisting of brain microvascular endothelial cells, the basement membrane, astrocytic end feet, and tight junction proteins. It serves as a critical defense barrier of the CNS, protecting against the infiltration of exogenous toxins and immune cells. After ICH, the structural integrity of the BBB is rapidly compromised during the acute phase, allowing harmful molecules and peripheral immune cells to enter the brain parenchyma, exacerbating secondary neural damage. Among them, the bidirectional regulation between NETs and microglia is one of the key mechanisms underlying BBB damage. NETs and microglia synergistically contribute to a compound injury pathway affecting the structure and function of the BBB, as shown in  Table 1 217 218 219 220  Figure 8 Research has demonstrated that following ICH, excessive formation of NETs is not merely a reactive product of immune cells and pathological signals, but also contributes to BBB disruption through multiple mechanisms upon recruitment to the central nervous system. Histones released by NETs bind to receptors on the surface of endothelial cells, increasing membrane permeability and disrupting the cytoskeleton, thereby impairing endothelial barrier function ( 196 66 197 136 198 174 199 It is important to note that the role of NETs and microglia in BBB damage is not a unidirectional process. NETs induce microglial inflammatory polarization through the TLR4/RAGE pathway. In turn, microglia stimulate the release of NETs via signaling axes such as the C3aR complement system ( 212 201 201 221 211 However, direct evidence for ICH remains very limited, despite a substantial body of research in ischemic stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. In ischemic stroke, NETs regulate the PAD4-STING-IFNβ pathway, promoting BBB damage and inhibiting neovascularization and vascular remodeling ( 207 222 223 In the immune response, microglia act not only as initiators of inflammatory amplification but also as potential stabilizers that sustain barrier disruption. NETs and microglia engage in bidirectional inflammatory crosstalk, creating a sustained pro-inflammatory positive feedback loop that not only exacerbates local inflammation but also directly accelerates the deterioration of BBB structure and function. This synergistic mechanism has been reported in ischemic stroke, TBI, and various neurodegenerative diseases, but direct evidence in ICH remains limited and mostly confined to animal models. Given the unique pathological context of ICH, such as hematoma-driven inflammation and iron-mediated neurotoxicity, these extrapolated mechanisms may not fully reflect the actual disease progression. Future research must systematically verify the specific role of NETs–microglia interactions in BBB damage and their potential for intervention, using ICH-specific models and clinical samples. 5.3 Regulation of neural injury and cognition NETs and microglia may play a crucial role in neuroinjury and cognitive dysfunction following ICH. Cognitive dysfunction is a key factor in long-term disability and decreased quality of life in ICH survivors, affecting various aspects such as attention, executive function, memory, and information processing speed. In recent years, immune-inflammatory responses, particularly the interaction between NETs and microglia, have been considered one of the key mechanisms driving cognitive decline following ICH. Histones and proteases released from NETs can directly damage neurons, inducing apoptosis and necrosis, and initiating an inflammatory cascade that further exacerbates neuronal loss. Moreover, NETs can further induce M1 polarization of microglia, forming a positive feedback loop between microglia and NETs. Thus, the interaction between NETs and microglia, as shown in  Table 1 Existing animal studies on ICH show that NETs-mediated microglial pro-inflammatory activation is closely associated with early brain injury and poor functional outcomes ( 25 224 113 Due to the limited direct evidence linking ICH to cognitive impairment, some studies have drawn insights from findings in other neurological disorders. In ischemic stroke models, NETs have been found to contribute to delayed neuronal injury ( 108 225 226 203 227 216 228 229 With growing research interest, the interaction between microglia and neutrophils has emerged as a focal point. Neumann et al. were the pioneers in presenting in vivo 108 230 202 231 232 136 195 201 Although studies in ICH models have shown the role of NETs and microglia in neuroinflammation and functional impairment, direct evidence linking them to cognitive function remains lacking. In contrast, diseases like ischemic stroke and AD have provided insights into the underlying mechanisms. However, ICH has a unique pathological context, and extensive in vitro in vivo 6 Therapeutic strategies targeting NETs After ICH Aberrant formation of NETs plays a critical role in secondary inflammation after ICH by amplifying inflammatory signaling, disrupting the BBB, and inducing neuronal cell death. NETs formation is closely associated with PAD4 mediated histone citrullination and ROS production mediated by NADPH oxidase. In addition, NETs are primarily composed of a DNA backbone, histones, MPO, NE, and other cytotoxic proteins and enzymes. Therefore, inhibiting NET formation and promoting NET clearance represent key therapeutic strategies targeting NETs in the context of ICH, as summarized in  Table 2 Table 2 Therapeutic strategies targeting NETs after ICH. Regulatory approach Therapeutic strategy Mechanism of action Drug Ref. Inhibition of NETs Formation PAD4 Inhibition Inhibits PAD4 activity, reduces histone citrullination, and prevents NET release. Cl-amidine, F-amidine, GSK484 ( 233 234 NOX/ROS Inhibition Inhibits ROS production via NOX suppression, thereby reducing NET formation and oxidative stress. Vitamin C, Curcumin, DPI ( 208 235 236 Promotion of NET Clearance NE and MPO Inhibition Inhibits NE and MPO activity, reducing NETs formation and inflammatory responses. Isorhamnetin, Folic Acid, Thiocyanate ( 237 238 Histone Neutralization Reduces NET formation and neuronal death by blocking histone-DNA complexes. Monoclonal antibodies, FSAP ( 169 239 DNA Degradation Degrades NETs by hydrolyzing extracellular DNA and nuclear proteins. DNase I, Recombinant DNase I ( 240 Other Approaches Actin Modulation Modulates actin cytoskeletal remodeling to reduce NET release. MICAL-1 inhibitors ( 241 FH Regulates C3b degradation to inhibit NET release and reduce local inflammation. Soluble Factor H, Immobilized FH ( 242 akebia saponin D Inhibits PAD4 and citrullinated CitH3 expression to reduce NET release. Akebia Saponin D ( 224 6.1 Inhibition of NETs formation 6.1.1 PAD4 inhibitors PAD4 is a crucial enzyme in the synthesis of NETs. It catalyzes histone citrullination, leading to chromatin decondensation and promoting the release of nuclear DNA ( 233 - - 102 Studies have shown that the enzymatic activity of PAD4 is significantly enhanced upon binding to Ca² + 243 244 in vitro 122 186 234 Notably, in addition to conventional small-molecule inhibitors, novel compounds have also been shown to modulate PAD4 activity. Studies have shown that miR-155 enhances PMA-induced PAD4 mRNA expression and promotes NETs formation, whereas its antagonist, antagomiR-155, reduces PAD4 expression, thereby attenuating NETs release and tissue damage ( 204 6.1.2 NOX and ROS inhibitors ROS are key drivers of NETs formation, with NOX being the primary source of ROS production. Following ICH, neutrophils rapidly infiltrate the lesion site. Activation of NOX and the resulting ROS burst not only drive NETs formation but also directly contribute to BBB disruption, neuronal apoptosis, and intensified local oxidative stress. Therefore, regulating the production of ROS and NOX is critical for inhibiting NETs formation. As a classic natural antioxidant, vitamin C not only scavenges ROS but also crosses the BBB in the form of dehydroascorbic acid ( 235 205 245 206 246 247 235 245 248 249 208 As a key enzyme in ROS production, NOX has attracted increasing attention in NETs-targeted therapies. Diphenyleneiodonium, a non-specific NOX inhibitor, significantly reduces NETosis levels ( 236 250 251 252 In summary, interventions targeting the NOX/ROS pathway exert protective effects after ICH by reducing NETs formation, alleviating oxidative stress, stabilizing the BBB, and improving neurological function. These multifaceted benefits provide a strong pharmacological basis and translational potential for NETs-related therapies in ICH. 6.2 Promotion of NETs clearance Current research on NETs formation has made considerable progress; however, most strategies target the early stages of NETs generation and remain insufficient to fully control NETs-mediated chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Therefore, further exploration of mechanisms for clearing established NETs may offer novel therapeutic approaches for targeting NETs-related pathological processes in central nervous system disorders. 6.2.1 NE and MPO inhibitors NE and MPO are not only essential components of NETs but also play critical roles in the inflammatory response ( 8 152 237 238 6.2.2 Histone inhibitors Histones exhibit significant cytotoxicity and, when bound to DNA, form histone-DNA complexes that constitute the structural backbone of NETs. Blocking histone-DNA complexes with monoclonal antibodies effectively inhibits NETs formation and reduces neuronal death. A study by Xu Jun et al. demonstrated that activated protein C can cleave histones and neutralize their cytotoxicity ( 169 in vitro 239 6.2.3 DNases DNase I is frequently employed as the principal enzyme for the degradation of NETs in both animal models and in vitro 136 253 254 240 198 Notably, the monoclonal antibody 2C5 specifically recognizes NETs and may serve as a targeting ligand for diagnostic and therapeutic applications ( 255 256 102 257 To date, no clinical interventions have directly addressed the role of NETs in ICH. Nevertheless, clinical trials of DNase I have been registered in patients with ischemic stroke and have advanced to early exploratory phases ( NCT05203224 NCT05880524 254 258 259 241 242 6.3 Other approaches Studies have shown that actin and associated cytoskeletal proteins are pivotal in regulating the formation of NETs. NETs extrusion is accompanied by local cortical F-actin depolymerization, a process primarily driven by F-actin oxidation mediated by the monooxygenase MICAL-1 and facilitated by the cooperative action of G-actin, binding proteins and gelsolin ( 260 261 262 259 Factor H (FH) is a principal regulator of the alternative complement pathway. Studies have shown that FH not only modulates C3b degradation by colocalizing with CD11b on the neutrophil surface but also plays multiple roles in regulating neutrophil function. Soluble factor H promotes neutrophil migration, whereas immobilized FH induces cell spreading and enhances the release of IL-8. Although factor H alone does not induce NET formation, immobilized FH significantly suppresses NET release and associated ROS production under stimulation with PMA or fibronectin combined with β-glucan, potentially attenuating local inflammation and tissue damage ( 263 In addition, akebia saponin D, a compound isolated from traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to reduce NETs release following ICH by activating the NTSR1/cAMP/PKAc/p-CREB signaling pathway and suppressing the expression of the key NETs enzyme PAD4 and its downstream product citrullinated histone H3. This intervention effectively attenuates brain tissue damage and the release of proinflammatory cytokines ( 224 in vitro 264 222 6.4 Challenges in clinical translation Currently, immunomodulatory strategies for hemorrhagic stroke are being investigated at multiple levels. Clinical studies have shown that immunoregulatory agents exhibit therapeutic potential in animal models. For instance, fingolimod has been reported to improve neurological recovery in SAH models by inhibiting neutrophil adhesion to the vascular endothelium ( 265 266 267 268 First, the limited permeability of the BBB is one of the primary obstacles. Although localized BBB disruption occurs in the early phase after ICH, overall permeability remains low. Moreover, BBB integrity exhibits high temporal variability across different time windows, substantially affecting both the efficacy and safety of therapeutic agents ( 269 270 271 127 66 66 Notably, most current studies on NETs remain confined to in vitro 190 in vivo 272 7 Perspectives and conclusion Secondary inflammatory responses following ICH are a key mechanism driving ongoing brain tissue damage and functional impairment. Central nervous system injury signals to the periphery via the autonomic nervous system, neuroendocrine pathways, and meningeal lymphatic vessels. This activates the peripheral immune system and promotes the infiltration of neutrophils and other immune cells into the CNS through a disrupted BBB or cerebrospinal fluid pathways. Among these processes, the bidirectional interaction between NETs and microglia plays a central role in amplifying immune responses, disrupting the BBB, and contributing to neuronal injury. Central nervous system injury also signals to the periphery via the autonomic nervous system, neuroendocrine pathways, and meningeal lymphatic vessels. These signals activate the peripheral immune system and promote the infiltration of neutrophils and other immune cells into the CNS through a disrupted BBB or cerebrospinal fluid pathways. Through the release of inflammatory mediators, coordinated activation of signaling pathways, and indirect modulation of astrocytes and other immune effector cells, NETs and microglia establish a self-amplifying and reciprocal network of immune-mediated damage that not only exacerbates brain injury but also impedes post-stroke cognitive recovery. Therefore, the NETs-microglia axis may represent a critical therapeutic target for secondary neuroinflammation following ICH, with substantial potential for clinical translation. Although basic research has made notable progress in NETs-targeted therapies, clinical translation still faces three major challenges. First, limited BBB permeability hampers the effective delivery of most NETs inhibitors or degrading enzymes to the lesion sites within the CNS, thereby reducing their therapeutic efficacy. Second, immune defense functions must be balanced, as NETs play a vital physiological role in host antimicrobial defense. Excessive inhibition may increase the risk of infection or even promote tumorigenesis. Third, the optimal therapeutic time window remains unclear. The function of NETs varies dynamically across different phases of intracerebral hemorrhage, and the lack of systematic research to define the best intervention timing introduces additional risks and uncertainties. Future research should focus on stratified identification of NETs-related pathways and improved precision in target selection. It is essential to develop therapeutic strategies capable of crossing the BBB and maintaining immune homeostasis while enabling controllable modulation of central inflammatory injury. Such approaches may offer viable solutions for the precision treatment of secondary neurological damage following intracerebral hemorrhage. Additionally, further exploration of the interaction between NETs and microglia in animal models of aging or common comorbidities, such as metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, is needed. This will help systematically investigate their impact on inflammation progression and neurological recovery, enhancing the translational potential of the research findings.
