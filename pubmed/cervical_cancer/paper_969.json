Objective To develop a practical and cost-effective test to distinguish patients with\nmalignant thyroid nodules eligible for active surveillance from those\nrequiring immediate surgery. Methods This prospective observational study included patients with malignant thyroid\nnodules (3 to 15 mm) who were assigned to either an Active Surveillance\nGroup (n = 30) or a Surgery Group (n = 21) based on the institutional\nprotocol. The Surgery Group was further stratified according to the American\nThyroid Association risk of recurrence/persistence. Preoperative serum\nlevels of miR-146b-5p and miR-204, normalized to miR-16, were analyzed.\nReceiver operating characteristic curves were used to establish cut-off\nvalues to differentiate between low and intermediate/high risk of\nrecurrence/persistence, which were subsequently applied to the Active\nSurveillance Group. Results Patients were initially assigned to the active surveillance (n = 30; 53.5\n± 12.6 years old) or Surgery Group (n = 21; 41.9 ± 7.9 years\nold). The mean follow-up duration for the Active Surveillance Group was 36.4\n± 25.8 months, during which no patients experienced disease\nprogression. Five patients in the Active Surveillance Group were\nsubsequently transitioned to the Surgery Group. Molecular analysis of the\nSurgery Group indicated that upregulation of miR-146b-5p/miR-16 and\ndownregulation of miR-204/miR-16 were significantly associated with\nintermediate/high risk of recurrence/persistence (p = 0.005 and 0.006,\nrespectively). Downregulation of miR-204/miR-16 demonstrated a sensitivity\nof 75% and a negative predictive value of 86.7%. The combination of\nupregulation of miR-146b-5p/miR-16 and downregulation of miR-204/miR-16\nyielded both a specificity and negative predictive value of 100%. Conclusion Decision-making for patients with low-risk papillary thyroid carcinoma\nregarding eligibility for active surveillance can be facilitated through\nserum analysis of miR-204/miR-16 expression, which may be used as a rule-out\ntest. In contrast, combined analysis of miR-146b-5p/miR-16 and\nmiR-204/miR-16 can serve as a rule-in test.

The BRAFV600E mutation, which is the most common\nmutation in PTC, does not appear to be associated with tumor growth or metastasis in\nsmall PTC, as it occurs at a high incidence even in patients without disease\nprogression ( 17 18 17 21 The expression of microRNAs (miRs) is currently the most promising biological marker\nof PTC, although little is known about their value in small PTCs ( 22 23 24 25 24 25 A wide range of miRs are associated with PTC. Overexpression of miR-146b-5p is highly\naccurate in distinguishing benign from malignant thyroid nodules and is frequently\nassociated with invasion, lymph node metastasis, and tumor recurrence, serving as a\nmarker of aggressive PTC behavior ( 22 24 26 27 28 29 miR expression can be evaluated in tissues, fine-needle aspiration cytology material,\nor blood. Analysis of miRs in blood, known as liquid biopsy, appears to be the most\nsuitable method for AS screening. Its primary advantages include the high stability\nof miRNAs in blood and their equivalence to tissue expression, in addition to the\npracticality of sample collection ( 30 33 Therefore, this study aimed to develop a test capable of predicting the behavior of\nlow-risk PTC at diagnosis based on serum miR expression in order to facilitate\ndecision-making regarding the indication for AS. METHODS Study design  Figure 1  Figure 1 Study design. Source: Haugen and cols. ( 12 * Initial evaluation: thyroid ultrasound, measurement of serum\nthyroglobulin, anti-thyroglobulin antibody, thyroid stimulating hormone,\nfree T4, and calcitonin. RLN: recurrent laryngeal nerve; ATA: American Thyroid\nAssociation. Patients who opted for immediate surgery underwent either lobectomy or total\nthyroidectomy, as determined by the attending physician, and were followed up\naccording to ATA guidelines ( 12 The Surgery Group was classified according to the ATA risk of recurrence and/or\npersistence (RRP) as either lowor intermediate/high-risk ( 12 Eligibility criteria Patients were recruited using convenience sampling. Eligible participants were\nconsenting individuals aged ≥ 18 years presenting with a thyroid nodule\nmeasuring 3 to 15 mm in maximal diameter, with cytology samples classified as\nBethesda V (suspicious for malignancy) or VI (malignant), treated at the thyroid\nservices of one public hospital ( Irmandade da Santa Casa de\nMisericórdia de São Paulo Hospital Samaritano-Higienópolis de São\nPaulo A Beneficência Portuguesa de São\nPaulo Variables The clinical variables evaluated were age, sex, and history of neoplasms or\nthyroid diseases. The ultrasonographic characteristics of the nodules assessed\nincluded size, echogenicity, composition, shape, margins, echogenic foci 34 12 Cervical ultrasound To minimize inter-observer variability, all ultrasound examinations were\nconducted by a single examiner at each of the three institutions. Any uncertain\nfindings were discussed among the three sonographers until a consensus was\nreached. miRs selection The panel consisted of miR-146b-5p, miR-204, and miR-16. For miR selection, we\naimed to include one miR with high expression associated with poor prognosis and\nanother whose low expression is linked to unfavorable outcomes. miR-146b-5p is\nthe most extensively studied miR in relation to aggressive PTC behavior\n( 22 24 26 27 35 28 29 21 30 36 Molecular analysis Peripheral venous blood (4 mL) was collected in ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid\n(EDTA) tubes for serum miRNA analysis from both the AS and surgery groups at the\nbeginning of the study, prior to any surgical intervention. The samples were\ncentrifuged within 60 minutes of collection at 1,900 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 °C\nto obtain serum, which was then stored at -80 °C. RNA extraction was performed\nusing the miRNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen, Germany), as outlined by the manufacturer.\nThe quantity and integrity of the extracted RNA were evaluated using a NanoDrop\n2000 (Thermo Scientific, USA). Samples with a 260:280 ratio of 1.4 were\nconsidered to have satisfactory purity. Approximately 400 ng of RNA was\nconverted to 30 µL of cDNA using the miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen,\nGermany). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (7500, Applied Biosystems, USA) was performed\nusing commercially available Qiagen custom primers for miR-146b-5p, miR-204, and\nmiR-16, as well as the miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, USA). For each\nassay, 1.5 µL of cDNA was used. The real-time polymerase chain reaction\nconditions consisted of 40 cycles: 15 minutes at 95 °C for activation, 15\nseconds at 94 °C for denaturation, 30 seconds at 55 °C for annealing, and 34\nseconds at 70 °C for extension, followed by a melting curve. Each reaction was\nconducted in duplicate. Cycle threshold values above 40 were considered\nnon-significant and excluded. Cost estimates The costs for molecular analysis were limited to direct variables (costs of\nreagents and controls) and indirect laboratory running costs (disinfection,\nerror corrections, and repetitions). Investment costs, such as laboratory space,\nequipment, training, quality assurance, accreditation, and labor expenses were\nnot included. Statistical analysis We used IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software (version\n20.0) and MedCalc Online (version 22.012). Chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests\nwere used for categorical variables, while Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests\nwere applied to continuous variables. Relative quantification of the molecular\ndata was performed using the delta cycle threshold method. The cut-off value for\nmiR expression was determined using the ROC curve, considering the best value of\nthe Youden index capable of differentiating RRP into low or intermediate/high\nrisk. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. We used G*Power software\n(version 3.1.9.7) to calculate the statistical power for the analyzed study\nsample. The cut-off values for miRs established in the Surgery Group were used\nto classify the AS Group. Based on these cut-off points, two test models were\ndeveloped: a high-sensitivity test and a high-specificity test. Ethics and informed consent Written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to enrollment.\nAdditionally, the study was approved by the research ethics committees of Irmandade da Santa Casa de Misericórdia de São\nPaulo A\nBeneficência Portuguesa de São Paulo Hospital Samaritano - Higienópolis de\nSão Paulo RESULTS Sample description Of the 51 patients, 21 (41.2%) underwent surgery at diagnosis, while 30 (58.8%)\ncomprised the AS Group. During follow-up, five patients (16.6%) transitioned\nfrom the AS Group to the Surgery Group. Molecular analysis could not be\nperformed in seven patients in the AS Group due to logistical reasons; however,\nthese patients remained in the study, except for one patient who died of\nunrelated causes.

Results expressed as n (%). Regarding indications for surgery at the time of diagnosis, six patients were\nreferred for surgery because ultrasound assessment showed contact with the\nanterior thyroid capsule, and two were referred due to contact with the\nposterior capsule. Anatomopathological results did not confirm extrathyroidal\ninvasion in any of these cases. One patient was referred for surgery based on\nsuspected extrathyroidal invasion of the perithyroidal muscles on ultrasound and\nindeed presented with macroscopic extrathyroidal invasion. Among the five\npatients who transitioned from AS to surgery, two cases were due to suspected\ninvasion of the anterior thyroid capsule, which was not confirmed later, and one\nwas due to suspected invasion of the posterior capsule, which was confirmed\npostoperatively. Regarding patient preference, five patients opted for surgery at diagnosis, while\nanother five chose to switch to surgery at a later stage. Compared to those who\nremained in AS, the patients who either preferred or switched to surgery were\nyounger, with mean ages of 54.1 ± 12.8 and 40.3 ± 6 years,\nrespectively (p < 0.001). Active Surveillance Group The mean follow-up duration in the AS Group was 36.4 ± 25.8 months,\nwhereas the mean time before migration to surgery was 22.2 ± 12.2 months.\nThe size of the nodules remained stable over time, with no patient demonstrating\nsignificant nodule growth. Nodule volume showed greater fluctuation compared to\ndiameter, albeit tended to decrease by the end of the follow-up period. No cases\nof lymph node or distant metastases were observed during AS, and one patient\nexhibited an increase in the number of nodules from one to four. Molecular analysis Molecular analysis was conducted in 16 patients classified as low RRP, eight as\nintermediate risk, one as high risk, and in 23 patients from the AS Group.\nmiR-16, used as the reference gene, demonstrated consistent expression levels\namong patients, exhibiting a relatively low standard deviation (mean absolute\ncycle threshold value of 32.35 ± 4.3). A statistically significant difference in miR-204 levels was observed between the\nlow and intermediate/high RRP groups (p = 0.008; Table 3 Figure 2 Table 3 Levels of miR-146b-5p/miR-16 and miR-204/miR-16 according to ultrasound\nand anatomopathological characteristics of patients who underwent\nsurgery Nodule characteristics Median (minimum-maximum) miR-146/miR-16 miR-204/miR-16 Multifocality No 0.088 (0.001-0.485) 0.156 (0-2.274) Yes 0.043 (0.001-24.761) 0.014 (0-0.653) p-value 0.426 0.080 Lymph node metastasis No 0.081 (0.001-24.761) 0.126 (0-2.274) Yes 0.036 (0.036-0.036) 0.053 (0.053-0.053) p-value 0.429 1.000 Composition Solid/almost completely solid 0.08 (0.001-24.761) 0.089 (0-2.274) p-value - - Echogenicity Isoechoic 0.025 (0.001-0.081) 0.337 (0.027-0.441) Hypoechoic 0.088 (0.001-24.761) 0.053 (0-2.274) p-value 0.111 0.747 Shape Wider-than-tall 0.09 (0001-24.761) 0.085 (0-2.274) Taller-than-wide 0047 (0.001-0.155) 0.125 (0-2.007) p-value 0.261 0.440 Margin Smooth/ill-defined 0.084 (0.005-0.198) 0.323 (0.001-2.274) Lobulated/ irregular 0.074 (0.001-24.761) 0.044 (0-2.007) p-value 0.622 0.362 Echogenic foci No 0.088 (0.001-24.761) 0.156 (0.001-2.274) Punctate echogenic foci 0.068 (0.005-0.485) 0.044 (0-2.007) p-value 0.678 0.651 Vascularity Peripheral 0.067 (0.011-0.485) 0.125 (0-2.274) Central 0.068 (0.001-0.093) 0.156 (0.001-1.102) p-value 0.527 0.921 Extrathyroidal invasion No 0.08 (0.001-24.761) 0.048 (0-2.274) Yes 0.095 (0.025-0.485) 0.547 (0.018-1.474) p-value 0.757 0.287 ACR TI-RADS 4 0.051 (0.001-0.107) 0.021 (0.001-0.653) 5 0.086 (0.001-24.761) 0.126 (0-2.274) p-value 0.087 0.217 Anatomopathological\ncharacteristics Median (minimum-maximum) miR-146/miR-16 miR-204/miR-16 Nodule size (mm) < 6 0.09 (0.005-0.376) 0.126 (0.005-2.007) 6-10 0.062 (0.025-0.275) 0.319 (0-1.474) ≥ 11 0.068 (0.001-0.485) 0.02 (0.014-0.027) p-value 0.861 0.649 Histological subtype Classic 0.079 (0.005-0.485) 0.284 (0-2.007) Follicular 0.034 (0.001-0.067) 0.112 (0.027-0.198) Tall cells 0.068 (0.068-0.068) 0.014 (0.014-0.014) p-value 0.454 0.726 Multifocality No 0.083 (0.001-0.376) 0.162 (0.001-2.007) Yes 0.053 (0.025-0.485) 0.044 (0-0.653) p-value 0.449 0.403 Extrathyroidal invasion No 0.067 (0.001-0.275) 0.198 (0-2.007) Yes 0.376 (0.043-0.485) 0.011 (0.005-0.653) p-value 0.191 0.188 Lymph node metastasis No 0.062 (0.001-0.485) 0.162 (0-2.007) Yes 0.096 (0.036-0.275) 0.053 (0.001-1.474) p-value 0.332 0.871 TNM T1AN0 0.057 (0.001-0.376) 0.198 (0-2.007) T1AN1A 0.148 (0.096-0.204) 0.732 (0.001-1.474) T1BN0 0.485 (0.485-0.485) - T1BN1A 0.068 (0.068-0.068) 0.014 (0.014-0.014) T1BN1B 0.036 (0.036-0.036) 0.053 (0.053-0.053) T3BN0 - 0.018 (0.018-0.018) p-value 0.117 0.879 Risk of recurrence and/or\npersistence * Low 0.062 (0.001-0.148) 0.511 (0-2.007) Intermediate/high 0.204 (0.036-0.485) 0.01 (0.001-0.653) p-value 0.106 0.008 * According to the American Thyroid Association risk stratification\nsystem (12).

Test models Based on these cut-off points, two test models were developed.

By applying the first model to patients in the AS Group, we found nine patients\nwith downregulated miR-204/miR-16.

Among these, two were classified as low risk and one as\nintermediate risk ( Table 4 DISCUSSION Differentiating between indolent and aggressive tumors remains the pivotal challenge\nin implementing AS for thyroid cancer. Existing molecular tests, primarily designed\nto distinguish between benign and malignant thyroid nodules and guide targeted\ntherapies have offered some insights ( 37 13 38 The increased expression of miR-146b in PTC compared to normal tissues has been well\ndocumented and is identified as an indicator of aggressiveness ( 36 39 29 39 40 36 Evidence has suggested that miR-204 is one of the most significantly downregulated\nmiRs in PTC and associated with aggressive histological features ( 41 42 29 We developed two test models: a rule-out test designed to predict tumors with\nindolent behavior, requiring high NPV and sensitivity, and a rule-in test aimed at\nidentifying malignancy, necessitating high PPV and specificity ( 43 44 Regarding indications for AS, age emerged as the sole differing factor between the AS\nand surgery groups. Indications for surgery were significantly more prevalent among\nyounger patients, likely corroborating the findings of Ito and cols. ( 45 46 16 Consistent with existing large AS studies that reported low rates of disease\nprogression in low-risk PTC tumors ( 5 10 14 47 Despite the promising results, this study’s limitations include a relatively small\nsample size, potentially affecting the findings’ generalizability. Future research\ncould benefit from miRNA selection via next-generation sequencing to increase\nrobustness. Another challenge lies in the difficulty of comparing cut-off values\nused in this study with those from other studies due to methodological differences\nin processing and analysis. Additionally, the developed testing models, along with\ntheir cost-effectiveness, require validation in a larger cohort to verify their\nclinical applicability. We propose that analyzing miR-204/miR-16 expression can serve as an exclusion test to\nidentify patients with indolent PTC for AS. Conversely, the combined analysis of\nmiR-146b-5p/miR-16 and miR-204/miR-16 can function as an inclusion test to refer\npatients exhibiting aggressive PTC behavior for surgery. Implementing these tests could significantly impact the management of low-risk tumors\nand reduce the economic burden of thyroid nodules in Brazil ( 48 49 In conclusion, we developed a cost-effective serum test that may assist in clinical\ndecision-making regarding AS eligibility. Nevertheless, it requires further\nvalidation through larger independent cohorts to confirm its clinical utility.
