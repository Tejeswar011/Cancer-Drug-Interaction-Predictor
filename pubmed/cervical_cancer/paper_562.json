This study investigated the effects of Chlorogenic acid (CGA) and VX765 on DON-induced enterohepatic injury. A total of 48 female mice were divided into four groups: control (normal saline), DON (1 mg/kg.bw), CGA (100 mg/kg.bw CGA + 1 mg/kg.bw DON), and VX765 (100 mg/kg.bw VX765 + 1 mg/kg.bw DON). After 28-day gavage period, the results showed that CGA and VX765 reduced DON-induced intestinal barrier damage. Metabolomics data revealed that CGA and VX765 restored cecal microbiota structure and alleviated DON-induced hepatic injury and lipid metabolic disorders by reshaping intestinal microbiota. Retrograde endocannabinoid signaling was identified as a critical pathway for cecal microbial metabolism and hepatic lipid regulation mediated by CGA and VX765.

These findings establish a theoretical foundation for the application of both compounds as nutritional supplements, adjuvant therapeutic agents, and feed additives in mitigating DON-induced toxicity. 1. Introduction Deoxynivalenol (DON), a member of the type B trichothecenes, is commonly found in cereals, feed materials and natural environment [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 With the extensive and in-depth investigation of the animal microbiome, a growing body of research has underscored the existence of a complex, bidirectional relationship between gut microbes and peripheral organs, often termed an “axis” [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 9 17 18 Given the higher detection rate of DON in grain and feed, it is crucial to identify a novel feed additive that can effectively degrade DON and enhance immune function, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of DON on animals and reducing toxin residues. Due to the limitations of traditional physical and chemical methods, nutritional interventions, especially those utilizing plant extracts, have become a significant focus in recent detoxification research [ 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 2. Results 2.1. CGA and VX765 Alleviate DON-Induced Intestinal Barrier Breakdown Histological analysis ( Figure 1 mucin2 MUC2 p zonula occludens protein 1 ZO-1 p occludin p claudin p Figure 1 p p p 2.2. CGA and VX765 Intervene in the Intestinal Flora Disturbance Induced by DON 2bRAD-M sequencing was used to analyze the cecal microbiota in mice, and clean data were deposited in NCBI’s SRA library (PRJNA 1243859). Compared with the control group, the Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices in the DON group were significantly lower, indicating reduced microbial richness and diversity. These reductions were mitigated by CGA and VX765 treatment ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 3 Firmicutes Bacteroidetes Campylobacterota Deferribacterota p Figure 2 Firmicutes Bacteroidetes p Figure 2 Deferribacterota p Pseudomonadota p Figure 2 Petal diagram showed that the DON group had the lowest total number of identified flora compared to the other three groups ( Figure 3 Figure 3 p Figure 3 p Figure 3 Mucispirillum Muribaculum UBA3282 Pelethomonas Eubacterium_J Ventrimonas Dysosmobacter Acutalibacter Eubacterium_J Marseille_P3106 Fimiplasma Figure 3 Figure S2 Figure S3 Mucispirillum Paraprevotella Pelethomonas Ventrimonas Dysosmobacter Actutalibacter In this study, KEGG functional pathways were enriched using PICRUSt2 predictions. Analysis showed that CGA ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 p p Figure 4 p Figure 4 2.3. CGA and VX765 Intervene in the Cecal Fungal Flora Induced by DON This study evaluated the effects of different treatments on cecal fungal flora using 2bRAD-M sequencing. α-diversity analysis showed that fungal diversity in the DON group was significantly higher than that in the control group ( Figure 5 Basidiomycota Figure 5 Puccinia Figure 5 Striiformis Triticina Triticina 2.4. Correlation Analysis of Liver Lipid Metabolism and Cecal Microbiota A total of 6 classes and 10 sub-classes, representing 2339 lipid metabolites, were identified by UPLC-MS/MS in this study ( Figure S4 Figure 6 Figure 6 p Table S3 Figure 6 p Figure 6 Figure 6 Notably, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling functions not only as a key pathway in hepatic lipid metabolism but also influences DON-induced cecal microbiota metabolism. These findings suggest a potential link between gut microbes and liver lipid metabolism. To explore this further, we integrated microbiome and lipid metabolomics data using mixOmics tools, visualized feature screening results, and conducted correlation analysis. At the phylum level ( Figure 7 Pseudomonadota Spirochaetota Bacillota Deferribacterota Spirochaetota Verrucomicrobiota Basidiomycota Spirochaetota Pseudomonadota Cyanobacteriota Bacillota Figure 2 Deferribacterota Pseudomonadota Figure 7 Eubacterium Pelethomonas Mucispirillum Eubacterium Enterobacter Eubacterium Figure 3 Mucispirillum Eubacterium Eubacterium 2.5.

Discussion Most monogastric animals are sensitive to chronic or subchronic exposure to DON 4, and DON can compromise intestinal function by increasing barrier permeability, inducing barrier damage, and altering microbial composition [ 28 29 30 MUC2 ZO-1 occludin claudin In recent years, the rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing technology has provided robust technical support for in-depth investigations into the intestinal microbiome. 2bRAD-M is a microbial diversity analysis method by employing type IIB restriction endonucleases to perform qualitative and semi-quantitative analyses of unique tags generated from microbial genomes after enzymatic digestion [ 31 32 33 34 35 Mucispirillum Paraprevotella 36 Pelethomonas, Ventrimonas, Dysosmobacter, and Acutalibacter 37 38 39 34 40 PICRUSt2 is widely utilized to evaluate functional variations among different samples and groups based on the composition of known microbial gene functions. KEGG enrichment in this study showed that DON exposure significantly activated the phosphatidylinositol and endocannabinoid signaling systems. These pathways have been recently identified as key regulators of lipid metabolism, and their dysregulation is closely associated with metabolic disorders such as obesity, insulin resistance, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [ 41 42 The liver is the primary target organ for the metabolic and toxic effects of DON, which can induce liver damage through oxidative stress and inflammatory responses [ 17 43 44 45 46 Deferribacterota Pseudomonas Mucispirillum Eubacterium Eubacterium By integrating KEGG analysis results with gene association data from the GeneCards database, we identified a strong correlation between DGKA, MAPK1 IMPA CDS2 DGKA NDUFS8 Figure S5A Figure S5B 47 48 49 50 51 The “microbiota-gut-liver axis” represents a highly conserved physiological mechanism in mammals [ 52 53 4.

Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) Staining Following a 24 h rinse with running water, the fixed tissue samples underwent gradient alcohol dehydration, xylene clarification, and paraffin infiltration to prepare histological sections. The sections were dewaxed with xylene and rehydrated using gradient ethanol, then stained with hematoxylin for 5–10 min, lightly rinsed with running water, differentiated with 1% hydrochloric acid in ethanol for a few seconds, and blued using a bluing agent. Subsequently, the sections were stained with eosin for 1–3 min, after which the staining reaction was terminated by rinsing with running water. Finally, the sections were dehydrated using gradient ethanol, cleared with xylene, and mounted with neutral gum. Histological evaluation was conducted under an optical microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). 4.4. qRT-PCR Tissue samples were homogenized with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), followed by chloroform phase separation, isopropanol precipitation, and ethanol washing to remove contaminants. Total RNA was then dissolved in DEPC-treated, RNase-free water. RNA concentration and purity were assessed using a spectrophotometer (DeNovix, Wilmington, DE, USA) based on the A260/A280. Subsequently, RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA following the protocol for Evo M-MLV RT Mix Kit (LongGen, Hangzhou, China). All primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China), with sequences listed in Table 1 ® −ΔΔCt GAPDH 4.5. Western Blotting (WB) The tissue samples were ground and lysed in lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors, and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA method, and a standard curve was generated to determine sample concentrations. Equal amounts of protein (30 μg) were mixed with 5 × SDS loading buffer, denatured at 95 °C for 5 min, and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to a 0.45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) at 200 mA for 90 min. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk at room temperature for 2 h, then incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight. After washing with TBST, the membrane was incubated with HRP-labeled secondary antibody at room temperature for 2 h. Following another wash, the membrane was developed using ECL chemiluminescent reagent and imaged with the Fusion FX7 Vilber Lourmat system (Vilber Lourmat, Marne-la-Vallée, France). Protein bands were quantified using ImageJ software 1.54f (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The expression of the target protein was normalized to β-actin. Detailed information regarding the antibodies is provided in Table S2 4.6. Immunofluorescence (IF) Liver tissue samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned (5 μm) onto poly-L-lysine-coated slides, which were subsequently baked at 60 °C for 30 min. Next, Antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) via heat-mediated methods. Sections were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and permeabilized with 0.1–0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min to facilitate antibody penetration. Blocking was carried out with 5% BSA at room temperature for 1 h to reduce non-specific binding. The primary antibody was applied, and slides were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After PBS washing, the sections were incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (1 μg/mL) for 5–10 min in the dark, followed by PBS rinsing and mounting with an anti-fade medium. Fluorescent images were captured promptly using a confocal fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed for fluorescence intensity and localization with ImageJ software 1.54f (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). 4.7. UPLC-MS/MS The lipid composition of tissue was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by UPLC-MS/MS. Liver samples were thawed at room temperature, weighed, and added to a 2:1 chloroform-methanol mixture containing 0.1 mM BHT. The mixtures were then thoroughly vortexed. After homogenization, ultrasonic-assisted extraction, and centrifugation, a 5 μL aliquot of the supernatant was injected into the UPLC system. The elution program was as follows: 0 min, 30% B; 3 min, 30% B; 5 min, 62% B; 15 min, 82% B; 16.5 min, 99% B; 18 min, 99% B; 18.1 min, 30% B; 22 min, 30% B. After elution, the lipid components were introduced into the mass spectrometer for ionization and detection, with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) data being collected in real time. The lipid types in the sample were identified by matching their retention times and MRM ion pair information against reference standards or databases. A calibration curve was constructed using known concentrations of internal standards to accurately quantify the content of each lipid species in the sample. According to the parent ion and multistage mass spectrometry data of each sample, the original data matrix was systematically constructed. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to evaluate sample stability and distribution based on this matrix, and supervised partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was used to identify metabolic profile differences among groups. 4.8. 2bRAD-M 2bRAD-M technique was employed to assess gut microbiota structure and potential metabolic pathways. Genomic DNA was extracted from cecal microorganisms using the Micro DNA Kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China). DNA was digested with BcgI (NEB, Beijing, China) at 37 °C for 3 h and ligated to library-specific adapters. After PCR amplification and purification, sequencing was performed on the Illumina Nova PE150 platform (Oebiotech, Qingdao, China). A total of 404,199 microbial genomes (bacteria, fungi, and archaea) were obtained from the GTDB and Ensembl databases. Each genome was digested with 16 type 2b restriction enzymes to generate unique species-specific 2bRAD tags, ensuring no overlap within the same taxonomic group. These tags were utilized to build a comprehensive 2bRAD microbial genome database. After quality filtering, all 2bRAD tags were mapped to the database for taxonomic annotation and relative abundance analysis. α-diversity indices (Shannon, chao1, Simpson) were calculated using the R software package (version 4.3.3) [ 54 4.9. Statistical Analysis After pre-processing the data in Excel, one-way ANOVA was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Duncan’s test was used to analyze group differences. Results are presented as mean ± SD, with significance denoted by p p 5. Conclusions In conclusion, DON exposure caused cecal microbiota dysbiosis in mice, disrupted intestinal barrier function, and triggered liver damage and lipid metabolism disorders via the microbiota–gut–liver axis. As nutritional additives, CGA and VX765 alleviated DON-induced enterohepatic injury and lipid metabolic disturbances by modulating the gut microbiota composition and the microbiota–gut–liver axis. Notably, CGA demonstrated a stronger protective effect against DON-induced enterohepatic injury than VX765.
