Prolonged inflammatory signaling leads to the sustained production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), resulting in direct and indirect DNA damage, including base modifications, strand breaks, and DNA cross-linking. Simultaneously, pro-inflammatory mediators such as NF-κB, IL-6, and TNF-α can interfere with DNA repair mechanisms, altering the efficiency of key pathways such as base excision and mismatch repair. Immune cells infiltrating chronically inflamed tissues, including macrophages and neutrophils, further exacerbate genomic instability through ROS/RNS release and cytokine production, creating a tumor-promoting microenvironment. Additionally, chronic inflammation has been implicated in the development of resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy by modulating DNA damage response pathways. Understanding the interplay between inflammation, genomic instability, and therapy resistance provides a framework for novel treatment strategies. Targeting chronic inflammation with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or biological agents such as monoclonal antibodies offers promising avenues for cancer prevention and treatment. Targeting inflammation with NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and monoclonal antibodies shows promise in cancer prevention and therapy, particularly in lung and pancreatic cancer. These agents act by blocking key inflammatory pathways like COX-2, NF-κB, and cytokine signaling.

Introduction Inflammation is a fundamental physiological response to tissue damage resulting from physical injury, trauma, microbial infection, or chemical exposure. Its primary function is to eliminate harmful agents and initiate tissue repair processes [ 1 Inflammation can be classified into two types based on duration: acute, which typically resolves within days to weeks, and chronic, which may persist for months or even years. Acute inflammation is characterized by rapid infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages at the site of injury or infection, enabling pathogen elimination and restoration of homeostasis [ 2 3 Figure 1 Although inflammation is critical for pathogen defense and wound healing, excessive or unresolved inflammatory responses can be detrimental. Chronic inflammation may lead to tissue destruction, fibrosis, and loss of organ function. Importantly, it is also implicated in the initiation and progression of various cancers. Both exogenous and endogenous factors can drive chronic inflammation. Persistent bacterial and viral infections—such as those caused by hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV), Helicobacter pylori 4 Schistosoma Bacteroides 5 Dysregulated immune responses also play a critical role in autoimmune and systemic inflammatory conditions. In diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, immune cells erroneously target self-tissues, triggering chronic joint inflammation. Moreover, inflammation is implicated in neurodegenerative and cardiovascular disorders. In older individuals, chronic immune activation may contribute to diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, and heart failure [ 6 Exposure to specific environmental factors, together with the presence of defined genetic determinants, has been associated with an elevated risk of developing inflammation and tumorigenesis. According to research, reducing the intake of saturated fatty acids in the diet may significantly lower the risk of developing various diseases, including cancer [ 7 8 9 Notably, inflammation is not only a predisposing factor for malignancy but may also arise as a consequence of anticancer therapies. Treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy can promote tissue damage and immunosuppression, creating a pro-tumorigenic environment that facilitates cancer progression and therapeutic resistance. 2. Inflammation-Induced DNA Damage Mechanisms This section outlines the principal mechanisms linking inflammation to DNA damage, focusing on oxidative and nitrosative stress, direct modifications to nucleic acids, and damage mediated by activated immune cells. 2.1. Generation and Physiological Role of Reactive Species Numerous mediators are involved in the inflammatory response, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS), which comprise a wide spectrum of reactive anionic and neutral molecules generated by various cell types throughout the human body [ 10 11 12 13 The major reactive species include superoxide anion (O 2 − 2 2 14 15 Oxidative stress, defined as an imbalance between ROS/RNS production and antioxidant defenses, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s, as well as cardiovascular disorders [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 2.2. Oxidative and Nitrosative Modifications of Nucleic Acids Reactive species are highly reactive due to unpaired electrons, and their accumulation leads to free radical-mediated chain reactions, damaging cellular macromolecules, including DNA [ 21 22 17 23 A prominent example of DNA oxidation is the modification of guanine at the C8 position, resulting in 8-hydroxyguanine (8-oxoG), a commonly used biomarker of oxidative stress [ 24 25 26 26 27 Nitrosative deamination affects both DNA and RNA and involves hydrolysis, enzymatic activity, and nitrosative reactions [ 28 29 2 3 28 28 30 28 Figure 2 2.3. Immune-Mediated Induction of DNA Damage DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) represent a severe form of ROS-induced genomic damage and are characterized by phosphorylation of the histone variant H2A.X. This modification is essential for the activation of ATM-mediated DNA damage checkpoints and for the initiation of DSB repair processes [ 16 Recent studies have demonstrated that effector memory CD4 + 30 31 Table 1 Figure 3 3. Influence of Inflammatory Signaling Pathways on DNA Repair Inflammation plays a pivotal role in modulating the DNA damage response (DDR) and the efficiency of DNA repair mechanisms. This section is divided into three subsections that explore these interactions in detail. An overview of key inflammatory signaling cascades and associated molecules modulating various stages of the DDR is presented in Table 2 Figure 4 3.1. Inflammatory Mediators and the Modulation of DNA Damage Response The DNA damage response (DDR) encompasses a sequence of biochemical events initiated upon DNA damage, including damage detection, cell cycle arrest, activation of repair mechanisms, or apoptosis [ 46 47 48 49 50 Inflammatory signaling pathways become activated shortly after DNA injury. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), such as TLR4, TLR7, and TLR9, along with the cGAS-STING pathway, recognize extracellular DNA [ 43 45 39 40 3.2. Activation of NF-κB Signaling and Its Multifaceted Role in DDR TLR4 activation induces TNF-α production, which subsequently triggers NF-κB activation and its nuclear translocation. This pathway is reinforced by a positive feedback loop, as NF-κB also enhances TNF-α gene expression [ 32 33 44 NF-κB can also be activated independently of canonical DDR signaling, notably through stress-responsive pathways involving p38MAPKα or the transcription factor GATA4 [ 34 34 35 36 37 38 51 iNOS activation contributes to oxidative stress, establishing a second positive feedback loop that further amplifies NF-κB activity and promotes cytochrome c release. HIF-1α supports metabolic adaptation, enhancing the survival capacity of DNA-damaged cells under hypoxic conditions [ 37 3.3. Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype and Cytokine Feedback Loops The senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) comprises a wide range of secreted molecules, including cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6), chemokines, and growth factors such as CXCL-8 (IL-8) [ 41 41 Among SASP factors, IL-6 and IL-8 are particularly pivotal. IL-6 mediates cell cycle arrest by signaling through its receptor and inducing p15INK4B expression, while simultaneously upregulating transcription factors such as PAI-1 and C/EBP, which suppress mitogenic signaling and enhance oxidative stress [ 41 41 IL-6 and IL-8 additionally sustain and amplify SASP signaling cascades initially triggered by IL-1, which activates C/EBPβ and NF-κB, further promoting the expression of SASP components [ 41 42 4. Role of Immune Cells in Promoting Tumorigenesis Chronic inflammation orchestrates multiple stages of tumor development, including initiation, promotion, invasion, and metastasis. Inflammatory cells contribute to these processes through the induction of DNA damage, suppression of DNA repair mechanisms, activation of oncogenic signaling, and remodeling of the tumor microenvironment [ 17 52 53 Figure 5 4.1. Inflammation-Induced Genomic Instability and DNA Repair Suppression The chronic inflammatory microenvironment plays a critical role in various stages of tumor development, including initiation, promotion, and invasion [ 17 52 53 17 52 54 55 56 57 58 A prolonged inflammatory milieu creates a permissive environment for tumor initiation. As mentioned previously, the persistent presence of inflammatory cells contributes to DNA damage both directly, through the action of ROS and RNS via oxidation, nitration, and halogenation, and indirectly through their byproducts. Secreted by macrophages and neutrophils, these reactive species induce various types of genomic alterations, including base pair substitutions, small deletions, strand breaks, and cross-linking [ 17 52 53 59 60 61 62 63 57 63 64 These concepts are well supported in research. Notably, Lin et al. demonstrated a distinct correlation between chronic inflammation, DNA damage, and gastrointestinal tumor development. In one study, the research group observed that dysplasia and precancerous lesions were most commonly found in gastric cardia tissues exhibiting high levels of phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX), a reliable marker for DNA DSBs. Importantly, the strongest γH2AX immunostaining in epithelial cells was observed under conditions of severe chronic inflammation, compared to normal gastric cardia tissues [ 61 61 Beyond inducing DNA damage, chronic inflammation also influences tumor development by disrupting DNA repair mechanisms, such as base excision repair (BER) and mismatch repair (MMR). Chronic inflammatory environments can lead to the suppression of DNA repair genes (MutL homolog 1 (MLH1), MutL homolog 2 (MSH2), MutL homolog 6 (MSH6)) through direct mutations induced by ROS and RNS, epigenetic silencing, or cytokine-mediated repression (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, IL-13) [ 52 53 65 66 67 68 69 70 59 68 69 71 72 4.2. IRAK-1 and NF-κB Signaling in Immune-Mediated Tumor Promotion A growing body of research indicates that interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) signaling may play a significant role in the development and progression of cancer. Helicobacter pylori Typically, NF-κB fosters cell growth and proliferation by enhancing the expression of cellular myelocytomatosis oncogene (c-myc) as well as cyclin proteins such as D1, D2, D3, E, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), all of which are key regulators of the cell cycle progression. Additionally, NF-κB promotes cellular growth by producing several growth factors, including IL-2, IL-6, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and CD40L. Furthermore, NF-κB contributes to the inhibition of apoptosis by regulating anti-apoptotic proteins such as cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAPs), cellular FLICE-like inhibitory proteins (c-FLIP), and various members of the Bcl-2 family. Notably, the activation of NF-κB also enhances angiogenesis within tumors [ 54 62 63 Additional evidence highlighting the significance of IRAK-1 in cancer comes from studies focusing on microRNAs (miRNAs). These small non-coding RNA sequences play crucial roles in regulating cellular mRNA stability, protein expression, proliferation, apoptosis, and cancer metastasis. Notably, research has indicated that the expression of a specific miRNA, miR-146a, is often reduced in metastatic prostate cancers [ 60 4.3. Epigenetic Modifications, EMT, and Pro-Tumor Immune Cells Additionally, chronic inflammation can promote tumorigenesis through epigenetic modifications. Inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β) can alter the activity of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone-modifying enzymes (e.g., disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like, DOT1L), leading to aberrant epigenetic modifications [ 5 66 73 54 55 64 Finally, Greten et al. proposed that chronic inflammation may contribute to tumorigenesis by causing tissue damage and exposing cells to environmental carcinogens, further amplifying the processes described above [ 5 “Tumor promotion” is a broad concept that encompasses the progression of a tumor from a single transformed cell to a growing mass through the expansion of clonal cells, the formation of new blood vessels, and immune evasion [ 5 66 5 65 66 74 75 76 77 78 Furthermore, chronic inflammation stimulates epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), which is a key process during cancer progression and metastasis. EMT results in the reduction in cellular polarity and intercellular adhesions to form a loosely organized cell structure, which provides motility and invasive abilities for tumor cells. It is favorable for the invasion–metastasis cascade at the primary site, intravasation into blood vessels, and translation to distant tissues [ 79 80 81 82 83 65 66 Most research indicates a positive link between chronic inflammation and the development of cancer. However, this pattern may be influenced by publication bias, since studies reporting neutral or negative results are less frequently published. Thus, although current evidence strongly suggests that inflammation promotes tumor growth, further investigations are needed to provide a more balanced perspective and address potential biases. 5. Therapeutic Strategies to Target Chronic Inflammation in Cancer Inflammation plays a fundamental role in carcinogenesis by promoting cellular proliferation and angiogenesis, facilitating metastasis formation, and impairing both the immune response and the efficiency of chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, targeting inflammatory pathways and their mediators has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer prevention and therapy [ 18 84 Figure 6 5.1. Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) NSAIDs exhibit anticancer potential by inhibiting prostaglandin biosynthesis through the blockade of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, particularly COX-2, which is often overexpressed in tumor cells [ 84 85 86 87 Furthermore, NSAIDs may modulate autophagy, a form of programmed cell death, involved in multiple processes that directly contribute to tumorigenesis. They influence signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt/mTOR, MAPK/ERK1/2, P53/DRAM, AMPK/mTOR, Bip/GRP78, CHOP/GADD153, and HGF/MET, and inhibit lysosomal function, leading to p53-dependent cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. NSAIDs have been shown to both activate and inhibit autophagy, with their effects varying depending on the specific tumor context. The precise mechanisms underlying their activity require further investigation [ 88 18 85 89 18 90 18 85 However, the use of NSAIDs is not without risks. Some studies report an association between NSAID use and increased incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and pancreatic cancer [ 85 18 89 5.2. Corticosteroids Corticosteroids are commonly employed to manage adverse effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, yet emerging evidence suggests their potential antitumor properties [ 18 91 Inhaled corticosteroids have been investigated for lung cancer prevention in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a condition characterized by chronic inflammation. Lung cancer occurs more frequently in these patients, progresses more aggressively, and is associated with a poorer prognosis. COPD-associated inflammation shares molecular features with lung cancer, including activation of NF-κB, PI3K, and Wnt pathways. The Wnt pathway, originally identified from Drosophila and murine models, regulates proliferation and survival; its dysregulation contributes to chronic inflammation and cancer. Meta-analyses suggest a trend toward reduced lung cancer mortality among COPD patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids, especially at higher doses. However, clinical trials remain inconclusive, and corticosteroids showed no efficacy in halting bronchial dysplasia progression [ 92 86 93 5.3. Monoclonal Antibodies and Anticytokine Therapies Targeting specific cytokines and inflammatory mediators represents another approach to mitigate tumor-promoting inflammation. Monoclonal antibodies against transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), which may acquire pro-tumorigenic functions during cancer progression, are under investigation. The role of TGF-β varies depending on the stage of the disease. In the early stages of tumorigenesis, it suppresses tumor growth and development, whereas in more advanced stages, it acquires pro-tumorigenic properties, driving uncontrolled proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Aberrant expression of TGF-β has been reported in hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer. Therefore, suppression of TGF-β may potentially enhance the efficacy of anticancer therapies and requires further investigation [ 94 95 96 97 Monoclonal antibodies against IL-6, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, have demonstrated inhibitory effects on multiple myeloma cell proliferation and yielded promising outcomes in prostate and ovarian cancers. Inhibition of the CCL2/CCR2 axis, critical for inflammatory cell recruitment, may also reduce tumor-induced immunosuppression and activate anti-tumor immunity. Particularly, benefits may arise from combining it with checkpoint inhibitors [ 94 95 96 97 94 94 5.4. Challenges and Future Perspectives While anti-inflammatory therapies offer significant potential in cancer management, their effectiveness is modulated by various factors, including tumor type, stage, patient immune status, and treatment duration. Current evidence underscores the importance of combination therapies, integrating anti-inflammatory agents with cytotoxic drugs or immunotherapies. Nonetheless, the lack of large-scale clinical trials and definitive data hampers broad clinical implementation. Personalized treatment approaches, guided by inflammatory biomarkers and genetic profiling, may optimize therapeutic outcomes in the future. Table 3 In conclusion, targeting chronic inflammation represents a compelling strategy in cancer prevention and treatment. While NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and monoclonal antibodies offer potential benefits, further research is essential to confirm their efficacy, minimize risks, and define optimal therapeutic regimens tailored to individual patient profiles. 6. Impact of Chronic Inflammation on Cancer Therapy Resistance Therapeutic resistance, common in oncology and other medical fields, refers to reduced treatment efficacy despite using proven therapies [ 98 99 100 101 102 98 102 103 102 104 105 104 106 Figure 7 6.1. Intrinsic Resistance Mechanisms and Inflammatory Signaling Intrinsic resistance refers to pre-existing cellular features that enable tumor cells to evade treatment from the outset [ 98 102 107 102 104 105 108 109 One example is the p53 pathway, frequently disrupted in cancers. Loss-of-function mutations in p53 lead to heightened NF-κB activity, which stimulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production and the recruitment of tumor-promoting immune cells such as macrophages [ 110 + 111 112 113 111 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 6.2. Extrinsic Resistance and Tumor Microenvironment (TME) Interactions Extrinsic resistance typically emerges following cancer treatment and is predominantly driven by adaptive changes in initially sensitive tumors. These modifications progressively diminish therapeutic efficacy over time [ 104 124 125 126 Other tumor-extrinsic mechanisms of adaptive resistance involve immunosuppressive components of the TME, such as regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and M2-polarized macrophages, all of which can suppress anti-tumor immune responses and compromise the efficacy of immunotherapies [ 127 128 129 130 131 132 6.3. Inflammatory Modulation of Drug Metabolism Inactivation of anticancer drugs represents a major mechanism of therapeutic resistance [ 98 102 15 22 133 Beyond their detoxifying role in xenobiotic metabolism, CYP enzymes are involved in endogenous processes, such as lipid and fatty acid metabolism, thereby contributing to cellular homeostasis [ 133 133 In many advanced malignancies, systemic inflammation alters CYP expression and activity, often with significant pharmacokinetic consequences [ 133 134 134 135 IL-6, for example, activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and modulates CYP gene expression through NF-κB-mediated inhibition of the CYP promoter regions. Additionally, IL-6 can interfere with the pregnane X receptor (PXR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) dimerization via JAK/STAT and RAS pathways, ultimately reducing transcriptional activation required for CYP mRNA synthesis [ 134 6.4. Inflammation-Induced Radioresistance Throughout the course of their illness, nearly half of all cancer patients undergo radiation therapy, which continues to be a critical element of cancer treatment. As a result of its contribution, it has become the primary treatment for cancer for many years [ 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 6.5. Inflammation-Induced Resistance to Immunotherapy Immunotherapy has emerged as one of the most innovative and effective strategies in modern oncology [ 143 143 143 These markers can exhibit a direct effect on many aspects, including inflammation. According to the study, patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors had a higher baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, an inflammatory prognostic indicator, which was linked to a lower objective response rate (ORR), a shorter progression-free-survival (PFS), and a shorter overall survival (OS) [ 144 145 However, despite its clinical success, resistance to immunotherapy remains a considerable challenge. Tumor cells can develop or possess mechanisms of immune evasion, reducing the efficacy of immune-based treatments [ 146 130 147 148 106 Furthermore, multiple intracellular pathways have been implicated in mediating immunotherapy resistance. Among them are aberrations in the MAPK signaling cascade, loss of PTEN expression resulting in PI3K/AKT pathway hyperactivation, and deficiencies in IFN-γ signaling, which can compromise T-cell-mediated responses [ 149 127 149 7. Summary, Future Perspectives, and Alternative Hypotheses Chronic inflammation contributes to both tissue regeneration and disease development by producing mediators that can damage DNA, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, IL-13, and immune cells such as CD4 + The close link between inflammation and carcinogenesis was presented throughout this research paper. Although to fully grasp the complexity of tumorigenesis, it is essential to explore its other prospective causes. Those might include inherited genetic factors. For instance, the enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is crucial for DNA synthesis, methylation, and repair. C677T and A1298C are polymorphic variations in the MTHFR gene. Those variants are proven to decrease the activity of the enzyme, which leads to increased risk of breast cancer and leukemia [ 150 151 The possible cancer contributors also include the genotoxic substances and materials such as HEMA and BPA. 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) is proven to have a pro-apoptotic effect, but is also associated with intracellular ROS accumulation. Breast cancer, prostate cancer, testis cancer, and ovarian cancer are all linked to bisphenol-A (BPA) because of its endocrine-disruptive properties [ 152 153 154 Another trigger of tumorigenesis is the change in human DNA caused by biological factors. A well-known example is cervical cancer evoked by the integration of Human Papillomavirus DNA into human DNA. Nevertheless, the relevance between pathogens and carcinogenesis is generally more intricate. The correlation between periodontitis and the increased risk of head and neck cancer is a fair depiction of that concept. The periodontitis-associated microbiome of the oral cavity induces changes in gene expression regulation, such as downregulation of the p53 pathway. The toxins and metabolites released by bacteria contribute to the genetic damage of epithelial cells. However, the altered microbiome also leads to inflammation, hence supporting the model of inflammation-induced cancer [ 155 156 Due to the inflammation being the main focus of this work, other aspects of cancer therapy resistance were not wildly explored. Nonetheless this topic is multidimensional, as the number of cancer types and treatment options is vast. In order to provide the solution, other possible causes of therapy resistance must be taken into consideration. For instance, some pre-existing genetic mutations might negate the drug’s effectiveness. Cisplatin is proven to be less efficient in gastric cancer therapy if patients have human epidermal growth factor receptor upregulation. Another reason for developing therapy resistance is tumor heterogeneity. For example, in breast cancer, some neoplastic cells have mutations making them therapy resistant. Under pressure generated by the drug, only the resistant cells will survive, leading to the development of the therapy-resistant population. Different explanations of cancer therapy resistance involve mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes. Their ability to modulate apoptosis-related proteins is the cause of 5-FU resistance in gastric cancer cells in the bone marrow microenvironment. The carboplatin resistance of breast cancer is also attributed to MSC-derived exosomes [ 156 157 158 The inflammation was proven to be an influential factor in tumorigenesis and therapy resistance, but not the only one. Considering all of the statements above, the open-minded approach is suggested. 8. Conclusions Chronic inflammation plays a central role in both intrinsic and acquired resistance to cancer therapies. It contributes to drug resistance through genetic and epigenetic changes, modulation of the tumor microenvironment, interference with drug metabolism, and suppression of antitumor immune responses.

Upon activation, they release nitric oxide (NO), tissue-regenerating factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and cytokines including interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-6. Figure 2 Schematic representation of the potential consequences arising from an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and the efficiency of antioxidant defense mechanisms. The generation of key reactive species—including superoxide anion (O 2 − 2 2 Figure 3 The schematic summarizes the multifaceted relationship between chronic inflammation, DNA damage, and carcinogenesis. Persistent external or internal triggers (light pink box)—such as viral infections (e.g., HCV, HBV, HPV), trauma, obesity, and exposure to chemicals or smoking—initiate chronic inflammation (pink box). This leads to increased production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS, red star icon), pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-13, IL-8, blue dots), and activation of key signaling pathways (NF-κB, STAT3, red upward arrows, pink box). These inflammatory mediators contribute to DNA damage. (orange box), including double-strand breaks, base oxidation (e.g., 8-oxoG), nitrosative deamination, and micronucleus formation, resulting in genomic instability. In parallel, DNA repair processes (green box) are influenced by pathways such as TLRs, cGAS-STING, and IL-22/STAT3, which may either restore genome integrity or, if dysregulated, promote senescence and tumor development. Downstream consequences include epigenetic alterations, immune evasion, tumor-promoting microenvironments, and therapy resistance, collectively facilitating carcinogenesis. Figure 4 Schematic representation of the signaling cascade following detection of extracellular DNA. Activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4 pink receptor) induces nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB, violet blue) via tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α, fandango). NF-κB activation leads to upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes Bcl-2-associated protein X (BAX) and tumor protein p53 (TP53) (orange upward arrow), alongside downregulation of the anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) gene (cyan blue downward arrow). Additionally, NF-κB enhances hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α -light blue) expression and stimulates inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS—dusty red) to produce nitric oxide (NO), which forms a positive feedback loop to NF-κB. NF-κB also regulates the transcription of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP—dust pink oval), a collection of cytokines, growth factors, and chemokines, including IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 (CXCL-8). Activation of toll-like receptors 7 (TLR7—blue) and 9 (TLR9—light blue) stimulates interferon type I (INF) expression, which subsequently activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3, dark purple) and induces IL-6 expression. Arrows denote activation, and blunt ends denote inhibition. Figure 5 The schematic illustrates the role of chronic inflammation in driving tumorigenesis and cancer progression. A sustained inflammatory microenvironment promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), induces epigenetic alterations, and causes tissue injury. These processes collectively increase the likelihood of mutations in DNA repair genes, tumor suppressor genes, and oncogenes, leading to genomic instability and tumor initiation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-13, and TNF-α, suppress DNA repair pathways (blunt end), thereby facilitating mutagenesis. Concurrently, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs—light blue), regulatory T cells (Tregs—green), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs—purple) secrete immunosuppressive and pro-tumorigenic cytokines, including IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, TGF-β, and TNF-α. These factors support cancer cell proliferation, inhibit apoptosis, enable immune evasion, and promote neovascularization. Persistent cytokine signaling and immunosuppressive activity collectively foster tumor promotion, progression, and metastasis. Figure 6 A schematic representation of pharmacological strategies targeting chronic inflammation in cancer therapy and prevention, highlighting their mechanisms of action. The illustration includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and monoclonal antibodies that modulate key inflammatory signaling pathways, particularly those involving IL-1, IL-6, and TGF-β. COX-2—cyclo-oxygenase 2, PGE2—prostaglandin E2, PSA—prostate-specific antigen, anti-IL-1—antibody against interleukin-1, anti-IL-6—antibody against interleukin-6, anti-TGF-β—antibody against transforming growth factor beta. Figure 7 Resistance to anticancer therapy arises through mechanisms influenced by the timing of resistance onset, intrinsic properties of cancer cells, and extrinsic factors within the tumor microenvironment. These mechanisms are categorized as intrinsic and extrinsic resistance. The diagram illustrates the key features and processes involved in each of these resistance pathways. pharmaceuticals-18-01406-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Types of inflammation-induced DNA damage, their molecular origin, and biological consequences.
