Materials and methods The study retrospectively Analyzed 173 patients with laNPC treated with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy at Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital between January 2018 and October 2022. The cEBV-DNA levels and tumor volumes were measured. Spearman correlation analysis assessed the relationship between cEBV-DNA clearance time and tumor volume reduction. Group differences were evaluated using t-tests and analysis of variance. Survival outcomes were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models, with statistical significance set at P Results Early clearance of cEBV-DNA was associated with significantly greater tumor volume reduction (nasopharynx: P P P P P P P P P Conclusions In pretreatment EBV-positive laNPC, early clearance of cEBV-DNA predicts better short-term tumor response and superior long-term survival, without exacerbating treatment-related toxicity. Furthermore, smoking, poor tumor response, and lack of targeted or immunotherapy independently correlate with worse prognosis.

This study aims to investigate the association between cEBV-DNA clearance and both short-term and long-term outcomes in laNPC patients, thereby enriching the current treatment evaluation system and providing a more precise and rapid assessment method for clinical practice. By elucidating these relationships, our findings may contribute to optimizing therapeutic strategies and improving patient outcomes in laNPC management. Materials and methods Case selection This retrospective study included patients meeting the following criteria: (1) histologically confirmed, newly diagnosed, stage III-IVA NPC according to the UICC/AJCC 8th edition staging system; (2) cEBV-DNA testing performed before initial treatment and re-evaluated prior to each chemotherapy cycle; (3) treatment with induction chemotherapy (IC) (2–3 cycles of GP [gemcitabine and cisplatin] or TPF [docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil]) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) ± targeted therapy ± adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy); (4) Karnofsky Performance Status score ≥ 80; (5) Patients were required to demonstrate no distant metastases on baseline CT scan before initial treatment; (6) availability of evaluable imaging data (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of the nasopharynx and neck) before initial treatment and after the second cycle of IC; (7) age at diagnosis between 18 and 70 years; and (8) provision of informed consent. Exclusion criteria: (1) absence of cEBV-DNA testing before initial treatment or prior to each chemotherapy cycle, or a negative result in the first test; (2) age < 18 or > 70 years; (3) multiple primary malignancies; (4) pathological types such as metastatic carcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, or neuroendocrine tumors; (5) severe organ dysfunction requiring life-sustaining medications; (6) pregnancy or lactation; and (7) administration of targeted therapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) during IC. From January 2018 to October 2022, a total of 173 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Flowchart of patients included and excluded in this study Treatment regimens IC regimens included: GP (gemcitabine 1000 mg/m² on days 1 and 8; cisplatin 80 mg/m² on day 1) and TPF (docetaxel 60 mg/m² on day 1; cisplatin 60 mg/m² on day 1; fluorouracil 600 mg/m² on days 1–5), administered for 2–3 cycles. Concurrent chemotherapy regimens consisted of cisplatin 100 mg/m² on day 1 or nedaplatin 100 mg/m² on day 1, delivered for 1–3 cycles. The chemotherapy interval was ≥ 21 days, with doses adjusted based on the patient’s body surface area. Pre-treatment measures followed the chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting guidelines. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) was delivered as follows: PGTV (Planning Gross Tumor Volume, including nasopharyngeal tumor and metastatic lymph nodes) received 69.96 Gy in 2.12 Gy per fraction; PCTV1 (Planning Clinical Target Volume 1, high-risk region including subclinical lesions around the primary tumor) received 60.06 Gy in 1.82 Gy per fraction; and PCTV2 (Planning Clinical Target Volume 2, low-risk region including subclinical lesions around CTV1 and the neck lymph node drainage area) received 54.45 Gy in 1.65 Gy per fraction. IMRT was administered 5 days per week for 6–7 weeks. The targeted therapy was nimotuzumab (200 mg weekly during radiotherapy for 6–8 cycles). Adjuvant regimens included metronomic capecitabine (650 mg/m² bid, days 1–14, q3w, initiated ≥ 3 month post-treatment) and PD-1 inhibitors (camrelizumab/sintilimab/tislelizumab 200 mg q3w or toripalimab 240 mg q3w). Circulating Epstein-Barr virus DNA detection Plasma cEBV-DNA was measured at baseline and pre-each-chemotherapy-cycle (21-28 day intervals) during both induction and concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Total DNA was extracted from 500 µL of plasma samples collected from each patient. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to amplify the BamHI-W region of the EBV genome. The detection threshold for cEBV-DNA was > 400 copies/mL. Clearance time (days) was defined as the period between the initial detection and the final measurement demonstrating zero copies of cEBV-DNA. The seronegative conversion rate at the nth IC cycle was determined as the percentage of patients achieving undetectable cEBV-DNA levels after that specific treatment cycle. Tumor volume assessment Tumor volume was measured using the 3D-Slicer software. All patients underwent nasopharyngeal and neck MRI examination after the second cycle of IC (prior to the third cycle). The regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated on MRI-T2-weighted images with the following parameters: Matrix dimensions of 696× 768 × 35 voxels, voxel spacing ranging from (0.3125–0.3255) mm in-plane to (6.000-6.5000) mm through-plane, and volumes calculated using a voxel-counting algorithm with slice thickness of (6.0-6.5) mm and in-plane resolution of (0.3125–0.3255) mm/pixel. ROI-nx included the nasopharyngeal tumor and metastatic retropharyngeal lymph nodes; ROI-nd represented metastatic lymph nodes in the both left and right neck. Patients demonstrating no evidence of cervical lymph node metastasis were assigned an ROI-nd value of 0 and consequently excluded from volumetric analyses of cervical lymph nodes. Basis cranii invasion, if present, was included based on signal changes on MRI-T1-weighted images. ΔROI-nx, ΔROI-L, and ΔROI-R denoted the volume differences between pre-treatment and post-second-cycle IC. ΔROI-nx%, ΔROI-L%, and ΔROI-R% represented the percentage reduction relative to the pre-treatment tumor volume. Two radiation oncologists independently delineated the ROIs, and the final tumor volume was the average of their measurements. A schematic of ROI delineation is shown in Fig. 2  Fig. 2 Representative MRI images of ROI delineation. ( a b Statistical analysis Data were Analyzed using R 4.6.2 and SPSS 25.0. Spearman correlation analysis assessed the relationship between cEBV-DNA clearance time and tumor volume reduction. The t-test and analysis of variance compared tumor volume differences between groups. The chi-square test evaluated toxicity. Survival analysis employed Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models. A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Follow-Up Patients were followed up through outpatient visits, telephone interviews, and other methods. Follow-up assessments included quantitative detection of cEBV-DNA, nasopharyngoscopy, whole-body computed tomography (CT), and MRI of the nasopharynx and neck. The follow-up protocol encompassed disease status, survival status, progression status, and time of death. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the duration from treatment initiation to death from any cause. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from treatment initiation to tumor progression or death. The follow-up period extended until November 10, 2024, with a median follow-up duration of 31 (6–91) months. The final data Analysis was conducted in February 2025. Result Patient characteristic Among the 173 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 131 (75.7%) were male and 42 (24.3%) were female, with a median age of 48 years (range, 22–68). More than one-third of the patients (60/173, 34.7%) had a history of smoking. The majority of patients (93.6%) were diagnosed with non-keratinizing undifferentiated carcinoma. According to the UICC/AJCC 8th edition staging system, 50 patients (28.9%) were classified as stage III, and 123 patients (71.1%) as stage IVA. Eighty-two patients (47.4%) received the GP regimen for IC, while 91 patients (52.6%) received the TPF. Seven patients underwent metronomic adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) with capecitabine, and 73 patients received targeted therapy with nimotuzumab during CCRT phase. ICIs was administered to 29 patients, including 15 who received immunotherapy during both CCRT and AC phases, and 14 who received it only during the AC phase. One patient received both targeted therapy and ICIs during the CCRT phase. The baseline characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1 Correlation analysis Spearman correlation analysis revealed a significant association between cEBV-DNA clearance time and tumor reduction volume. Specifically, patients with faster cEBV-DNA clearance demonstrated more pronounced tumor regression (nasopharyngeal tumor: r P r P r P  Table 1 Baseline characteristics of the 173 patients Characteristic N Proportion Gender Male 131 75.7% Female 42 24.3% Age ≥ 48 89 51.4% < 48 84 49.6% Smoking yes 60 34.7% no 113 65.3% Pathology keratinizing squamous 2 1.2% non-keratinized differentiated 9 5.2% non-keratinized undifferentiated 162 93.6% T stage 1–2 41 23.7% 3–4 132 76.3% N stage 0–1 36 20.8% 2–3 137 79.2% Clinical stage III 50 28.9% IVA 123 71.1% Induction chemotherapy GP 82 47.4% TPF 91 52.6% Other Treatment Adjuvant Chemotherapy 7 4.0% Target therapy 73 42.2% Check Point Inhibitors 29 16.8% Target Therapy and ICIs 1 0.6% EBV-DNA clearance pattern Early seronegative conversion 125 72.3% Late seronegative conversion 31 17.9% Non-Early seronegative conversion 17 9.8% To further validate the clinical significance of EBV clearance, we analyzed the correlations between clearance patterns and both baseline EBV-DNA levels and tumor volume reduction. The results demonstrated no significant association between clearance patterns and baseline EBV-DNA levels ( r r p r p r p 3  Fig. 3 Correlations between the time to cEBV-DNA clearance and the tumor reduction. ( A B Circulating Epstein-Barr virus DNA clearance All enrolled patients exhibited initial cEBV-DNA levels above the detection threshold of 400 copies/mL. Following the first IC cycle, 98 patients (56.6%) achieved cEBV-DNA negativity. An additional 27 patients (15.6%) converted to seronegative status after the second IC cycle. Subsequent treatment cycles resulted in cEBV-DNA clearance in 17 patients (9.8%) and 14 patients (8.1%) after the third and fourth cycles, respectively. Notably, 17 patients (9.8%) maintained detectable cEBV-DNA levels at the last test during treatment within one week prior to radiotherapy completion. The timing of the imaging reassessment, conducted prior to the third cycle of chemotherapy, was established as the cutoff point. Patients who achieved seronegative conversion of cEBV-DNA before the third cycle were categorized into the early seronegative conversion group (ESC group), comprising 125 cases and accounting for 72.3% of the total cohort. Patients who achieved seronegative conversion from the third cycle until the end of CCRT were categorized into the late seronegative conversion group (LSC group) (31 cases, 17.9%). Those with persistently positive cEBV-DNA throughout treatment were termed the non-seronegative conversion group (NSC group) (17 cases, 9.8%). In the ESC group, the clearance time of cEBV-DNA was 33 ± 13 days, with tumor volumes (nasopharyngeal, right and left cervical lymph node) measuring 38.1 ± 30.1 cm³, 19.9 ± 28.0 cm³, and 24.0 ± 30.5 cm³, respectively. Conversely, the LSC group exhibited a clearance time of 99 ± 24 days, with corresponding tumor volume reductions of 30.4 ± 24.8 cm³, 16.2 ± 27.5 cm³, and 12.2 ± 20.7 cm³, respectively. The NSC group demonstrated tumor volumes of 21.1 ± 21.8 cm³, 11.3 ± 16.4 cm³, and 10.2 ± 19.2 cm³, and did not achieve clearance time during treatment. The ESC group demonstrated significantly faster clearance time than the LSC group ( P P P P P 4  Fig. 4 Reduction of tumor volume in ESC, LSC, NSC and NESC Group.

The GP group exhibited progressively increasing negativity rates: 64.6% (53/82) after cycle 1, 81.7% (67/82) after cycle 2, and 91.5% (75/82) after cycle 3. In contrast, the TPF group showed Lower clearance rates: 49.5% (45/91), 63.7% (58/91), and 73.6% (67/91) during the corresponding cycles. Significant intergroup differences were observed at each time point (cycle 1–3: P P P 5  Fig. 5 Dynamics of EBV DNA Clearance During Treatment GP vs. TPF. Cycles 1–2: IC phase; Cycle 3: Additional IC (for patients receiving 3 cycles); Cycle 4: First cycle of concurrent chemoradiotherapy Survival analysis At the final follow-up, the ESC group had 5 cases of local recurrence (1 nasopharyngeal, 4 nodal), 25 with distant metastasis, and 19 NPC-related deaths. In contrast, the NESC group (comprising LSC and NSC subgroups) showed 6 local recurrences (LSC subgroup: 1 nasopharyngeal, 2 nodal, and 1 combined nasopharyngeal/nodal recurrence; NSC subgroup: 1 nodal and 1 combined nasopharyngeal/nodal recurrence), 15 distant metastases (10 LSC, 5 NSC), and 14 NPC-related deaths (10 LSC, 4 NSC).

Based on the median nasopharyngeal tumor reduction rate (ΔROI-nx% = 43%), patients were stratified into high-response (HR, ΔROI-nx% >43%) and low-response (LR, ΔROI-nx% ≤43%) groups.

No grade 5 toxicities or chemotherapy modifications (discontinuation or dose reduction) occurred.

Patients achieving rapid clearance of cEBV-DNA demonstrated greater tumor reduction and improved survival outcomes, without an increase in treatment-related toxicity. These findings establish cEBV-DNA clearance dynamics as a critical biomarker for treatment efficacy and prognostic evaluation in EBV-positive laNPC. Dynamic monitoring of serum tumor markers during anti-tumor therapy facilitates early prediction of tumor status and timely assessment of treatment response [ 17 18 19 21 22 23 Tumor reduction reflects treatment response and predicts therapeutic efficacy. Although RECIST criteria effectively predict outcomes in solid tumors like hepatocellular carcinoma and breast cancer, with complete response and partial response (PR) patients showing better survival than stable disease and progressive disease patients [ 24 25 It is noteworthy that among the seven patients whose tumors enlarged after IC, the cEBV-DNA appeared to be cleared later, including three patients who turned seronegative after the third cycle of chemotherapy and two patients who remained positive throughout the treatment period. These findings corroborate previous report demonstrating correlations between cEBV-DNA levels, tumor burden, and treatment efficacy [ 26 Besides, our study identified smoking and absence of immunotherapy as independent risk factors, contrasting with previous studies emphasizing age and disease stage as primary prognostic indicators [ 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Notably, we identified a weak correlation coefficient between cEBV-DNA clearance time and tumor volume reduction. We posit that this may be influenced by clinical confounding factors, particularly the variability in patients’ adherence to scheduled chemotherapy visits. Consequently, even among subgroups categorized by the same chemotherapy cycle to viral clearance, patients exhibited disparate clearance times, potentially influencing the outcomes. The observed weak correlation coefficients between cEBV-DNA clearance and tumor volume reduction ( r Regarding generalizability, while our cohort was exclusively Asian (consistent with NPC epidemiology), the biological mechanisms linking EBV clearance to treatment response should theoretically apply across populations [ 34 35 This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, its single-center, retrospective, and non-randomized design may introduce selection bias. Second, the manual delineation of ROIs could lead to subjective variability. Third, the inclusion of patients who received additional immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) or targeted therapy during concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) or adjuvant therapy may have confounded the survival outcomes. Additionally, our study relied on the 8th edition of the AJCC/UICC staging system, as the data were collected between 2018 and 2022, prior to the release of the updated 9th edition. While the 8th edition remains well-validated for NPC prognostication, the 9th edition provides refined T/N subclassifications and improved survival discrimination. Therefore, our findings should be interpreted within the context of the 8th edition criteria. To address this, we plan to conduct a re-staging analysis using the 9th edition in future work, and validate or refine our current conclusions in alignment with the latest staging guidelines. Furthermore, multicenter prospective investigations with extended follow-up durations would provide additional validation of these results. In conclusion, early clearance of cEBV-DNA is associated with enhanced tumor response, superior OS, and prolonged PFS, without increased treatment-related toxicity. These findings warrant validation in large-scale multicenter studies with extended follow-up to establish their clinical applicability.
