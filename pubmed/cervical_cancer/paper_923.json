PDT generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby inducing tumor cell death. Stimulation of the interferon gene (STING) activation is highlighted as an immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. However, the role of STING and ROS in cancer therapy remains unclear. We hypothesized that STING regulates ROS generation in PDT, and that STING loss alters ROS homeostasis and causes therapeutic resistance. We established STING knockout (KO) HCT116 cells and compared the therapeutic efficacy of talaporfin sodium (TS)‐PDT in KO and parental cells. Cell death induction was analyzed by 3‐[4,5‐dimethylthiazol‐2‐yl]‐2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. ROS induction was analyzed using 2′,7′‐dichlorofluorescin diacetate assay. STING‐regulated gene activation was assessed by western blotting. Furthermore, the efficacy of STING agonist (2′‐3′‐cyclic GMP–AMP sodium and ADU‐S100) and TS‐PDT combination was assessed in a xenograft tumor model. STING KO suppressed cell death induced by TS‐PDT (IC 50 This study investigates the role of STING in photodynamic therapy (PDT) using talaporfin sodium. STING knockout reduced ROS generation and therapeutic efficacy, while combining a STING agonist with PDT enhanced antitumor effects. These findings suggest that STING regulates ROS homeostasis and can potentiate PDT outcomes. colorectal neoplasms DNA damage phototherapy reactive oxygen species STING protein Japan Society for the Promotion of Science 10.13039/501100001691 20K16997 22K16050 22K20862 23K07358 23K07421 23K15019 Nitto Foundation 206093 Bristol Myers Squibb Foundation 10.13039/100001009 202103 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  Funding: Abbreviations PDT Photodynamic therapy PS photosensitizer ROS reactive oxygen species STING stimulator of interferon genes cGAS cyclic GMP–AMP synthase TS talaporfin sodium DSBs double‐strand breaks MFI Mean Fluorescence Intensity PBS phosphate‐buffered saline NAC n‐acetyl cysteine TCS total comet score IP intraperitoneal injection 1 Introduction The development of noninvasive treatment methods for cancer is desirable in the aging population. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), an anticancer treatment employing a photosensitizer (PS) activated by specific light wavelengths, has attracted considerable attention. It is minimally invasive, as irradiation is limited to the cancer site, and PS predominantly accumulates in tumor cells, thereby reducing systemic toxicity. PDT inhibits tumor growth in various malignancies through three main mechanisms: (1) direct effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS); (2) vascular shutdown leading to tumor infarction; and (3) immune response [ 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 The endoplasmic reticulum‐localized adaptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is a critical regulator of the innate immune response through its ability to sense DNA damage by recognizing cyclic dinucleotides and activating the transcription of interferons and other cytokines [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 + 21 22 23 24 25 12 Therefore, we hypothesized that the addition of a STING agonist to PDT promotes ROS production, leading to effective inhibition of tumor growth. Here, we performed a basic analysis in which the STING pathway regulates ROS production of PDT using talaporfin sodium (TS) as a photosensitizer. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Reagents TS (mono‐ l 20 22 10 2 13 2 2.2 Cell Line and Treatment The human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 (lot no. 3903110.; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA) was cultured in RPMI1640 (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% ampicillin and streptomycin. Cells were cultured in an atmosphere with 5% carbon dioxide (CO 2 2.3  STING KO Gene editing was performed using synthetic sgRNA and Cas9 mRNA transfection in HCT116 cells. Genes were edited using the Edit‐R CRISPR guide RNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA). Cas9 mRNA (# CAS11860 2 2.4 In Vitro PDT Cells were incubated with varying concentrations of TS (depending on the experiment). The cells were washed with phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) to remove free TS and irradiated using a light‐emitting diode system (OptoCode, Tokyo, Japan) at a light energy dose of 16 J/cm 2 2 2.5 Cell Viability Assay Cell viability was assessed using a WST‐8 cell proliferation assay. Cells were seeded in 96‐well culture plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were subjected to in vitro PDT with various TS doses and incubated for 2 h. The cells were then irradiated and incubated with the culture medium for an additional 24 h, followed by incubation with the Cell Counting Kit‐8 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) for 2 h. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (SPECTRA MAX340; Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA, USA). In the cell viability assay with hydrogen peroxide (H 2 2 2 2 50 50 2 2 2.6 Immunofluorescence Analysis of γ‐ H2AX Cells were grown in 8‐well glass slides, incubated with 20 μM of TS for 2 h, and treated with PDT in vitro. The cells were fixed with ethanol and acetone for 12 h after in vitro PDT. Primary antibody against γ‐H2AX [pSer140] (3F2) (1:500 dilution; Novus Biologicals, CO, USA) was used. The secondary antibody used was Alexa Fluor 594 goat antimouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All processes were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. All sections were counterstained with 4′,6‐diamidino‐2‐phenylindole (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Images were obtained using a fluorescence microscope (BZ‐X800; Keyence, Osaka, Japan). Foci were counted manually by categorizing nuclei with > 10 foci of γ‐H2AX as positive. The average number of foci per cell was determined using ImageJ software. Data are obtained from three independent experiments. 2.7 Neutral Comet Assay Neutral comet assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Cells were treated with TS‐PDT (incubated with 20 μM of TS for 12 h and treated with PDT in vitro), trypsinized immediately after TS‐PDT, washed with PBS, and suspended in LM Agarose. Electrophoresis under neutral conditions was conducted at 20 V for 60 min in a Mupid‐2plus System (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) and a PowerPac 200 Electrophoresis Power Supply (Bio‐Rad Laboratories, Berkeley, CA, USA). The data were collected using a fluorescence microscope (BZ‐X800). The comet assay visual score was scored (five classes from class 0 (no DNA damage) to class 4 (maximum DNA damage)). Total comet score (TCS) was calculated according to the formula, TCS = 0( n n n n n n 2.8 Western Blots Cells were seeded and incubated for 24 h. Subsequently, the medium was replaced with fresh medium supplemented with TS. TS was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 15 μmol/L. The intracellular proteins were extracted from cells several hours after TS‐PDT in vitro. Each sample was normalized to an equal protein concentration using a protein assay kit (Bio‐Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The protein samples were then separated on Mini‐PROTEAN TGX gels (Bio‐Rad Laboratories), and the protein bands were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell BioScience, Dassel, Germany). The membrane was incubated with the primary antibodies phosphor Stat1 (Tyr701) (D4A7) (1:1000 dilution; 7649; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA), Stat1 (D1K9Y) (1:1000 dilution; 14,994; Cell Signaling Technology), phosphor TBK1/NAK (Ser172) (D52C2) (1:1000 dilution; 5483; Cell Signaling Technology), TBK1/NAK (E813G) (1:1000 dilution; 38,066; Cell Signaling Technology), ISG15 (22D2) (1:1000 dilution; 2758; Cell Signaling Technology), and STING (D2P2F) (1:1000 dilution; 13,647; Cell Signaling Technology). Thereafter, the membrane was washed extensively and incubated with secondary antirabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (HRP)‐linked antibody (1:5000 dilution; SA00001‐2; Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA). Signals were quantified using the ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA), Image Quant LAS 4000 Mini System (GE Healthcare) and ImageJ software. The membranes were also probed with anti‐β‐actin antibody (1:1000 dilution; 010–27,841; FUJIFILM, Tokyo, Japan) and antimouse IgG HRP‐linked antibody (1:5000 dilution; 7076; Cell Signaling Technology) as internal controls. 2.9  ROS Intracellular ROS accumulation was determined using ROS detection reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were incubated with 20 μM of TS for 2 h and pretreated with PDT in vitro. Cells were then treated with H2DCF‐DA (DCFH‐DA, 2′,7′‐sichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) at 10 μM in PBS for 15 min. Thereafter, the supernatant was replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were incubated for 30 min. The increase in ROS levels was assessed by measuring the fluorescence of 5‐(and‐6)‐carboxy‐2′,7′‐difluorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxy‐H2DFFDA) (492 nm/525 nm: excitation/emission) using FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). A minimum of 10,000 events was recorded for each sample. Data are obtained from three independent experiments. 2.10 Animals and Tumor Models Pathogen‐free female nude mice (BALB/c Slc‐nu/nu), aged 4 weeks and weighing 15–20 g, were obtained from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). The mice were allowed to acclimatize for 2 weeks in the animal facility before initiating any interventions. Xenograft tumor models were established by subcutaneously implanting 1 × 10 6 3 n 2.11 In Vivo PDT TS was administered via the tail vein at a dose of 6.25 μmol/kg. At 2 h after administration, the tumors were irradiated using a 664 nm red laser (OK Fiber Technology, Kyoto, Japan) at a dose of 15 J/cm 2 2 2.12 In Vivo PDT STING KO Xenograft tumor models were established by subcutaneously implanting 1 × 10 6 3 2.13 In Vivo PDT STING Xenograft tumor models were established by subcutaneously implanting 1 × 10 6 3 2.14 Statistical Analysis Quantitative data are presented as means ± standard deviations (SDs) and were analyzed with Welch's t test for comparisons between two groups (Figures S1 2D 2B 4A,B S2 S3 5B,C 6B,C S4A S4B p p 3 Results 3.1  STING TS PDT First, we established STING KO cells from the human colon cancer cell line HCT116 using the CRISPR‐Cas 9 method. KO of STING in HCT116 cells was confirmed using western blot analysis (Figure 1A 50 50 50 50 p 1B S1 FIGURE 1 Effect of photodynamic therapy using talaporfin sodium photodynamic therapy (TS‐PDT) on the viability of stimulation of the interferon gene knockout (STING KO) cells.

(B) The changes in cell viability after TS‐PDT were measured using cell proliferation assays. IC 50 3.2  STING DNA PDT induces cell death by promoting DNA double‐strand breaks (DSBs). We investigated whether STING KO alters the extent of DNA damage by analyzing γ‐H2AX foci, shown to correspond to DNA DSBs. The formation of γ‐H2AX foci increased significantly in parental cells; however, it did not increase in STING KO cells (67.9% vs. 15.9%; * p 2A,B p 2C,D FIGURE 2 Reduction of DNA damage associated with STING loss in TS‐PDT.

The error bars from three independent experiments were analyzed using (B) Holm‐Sidak multiple comparisons test and (D) Welch's t‐test, and set at * p p 3.3 Activation of the STING TS PDT Since DNA damage activates the cGAS–STING pathway, we investigated whether TS‐PDT activates STING and its downstream IFNβ/JAK/STAT signaling. TS‐PDT increased the phosphorylation of TBK1 (P‐TBK1) and STAT1 (P‐STAT1) consistent with the activation of cGAS–STING signaling. The expression of ISG15, one of the IFNβ‐stimulated genes, also increased time‐dependently. By contrast, the expression of proteins related to the cGAS–STING pathway was eliminated under STING deficiency (Figure 3 FIGURE 3 Enhancement of the STING‐dependent signaling by TS‐PDT at the protein level. Immunoblotting of parental and STING KO cells examining baseline and PDT‐induced activation of the STING pathway for STING‐regulated genes. Immunoblotting results are representative of three independent experiments. 3.4  STING ROS TS PDT Considering the downregulation of genes involved in ROS pathways in STING KO cells, we examined whether STING regulates ROS production of TS‐PDT. We measured ROS generation using a DCFDA assay after in vitro TS‐PDT in parental and STING KO cells. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured using a flow cytometer and analyzed with the FlowJo software. STING KO suppressed ROS generation in TS‐PDT cells (MFI parent cells: 4240 [±55.3] vs. STING KO cells: 2234 [±551.9], ** p 4A p S2 FIGURE 4 Alteration of ROS generation in TS‐PDT by STING loss and STING‐dependent regulation of the cellular environment in response to H 2 2 2 2 p p 3.5  STING ROS DNA H 2 2 TS PDT To directly examine the relationship among STING loss, ROS production, and DNA damage of PDT, we treated cells with TS‐PDT in the presence of either the ROS scavenger NAC or H 2 2 2 2 2 2 4B S3 3.6  STING TS PDT To investigate the role of STING in tumor growth, we established a xenograft tumor model by implanting HCT116 parental or STING KO cells (Figure 5A 5B,C FIGURE 5 Suppression of the in vivo efficacy of TS‐PDT by STING loss.

Immunocompromised mice were used to specifically investigate the relationship between STING signaling and ROS production while excluding the confounding effects of host immune responses. First, we established STING KO HCT116 using the CRISPR‐Cas 9 method confirmed by western blot analysis. STING loss reduced the cell‐killing effect of TS‐PDT in vitro as confirmed by MTT assay (Figure 1B 1 2 3 3 4A 2 2 2 38 39 40 41 42 38 43 44 45 46 47 Moreover, our results demonstrate that STING is a regulator of ROS homeostasis and that STING loss leads to enhanced ROS metabolism and therapeutic resistance to DNA‐damaging agents. Our study highlighted the role of STING in regulating the magnitude of PDT‐induced DNA damage (Figure 7 FIGURE 7 Hypothetical model of tumor intrinsic STING loss contributes to treatment resistance of TS‐PDT.
