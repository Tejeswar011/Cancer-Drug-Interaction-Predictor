Ginsenosides, the primary bioactive triterpenoid saponins isolated from the root of Panax ginseng C. A. Mey, have demonstrated potential in combating non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, their efficacy under nutrient-deficient conditions remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of ginsenosides on the growth and death of lung cancer cells under low-nutrient conditions and to explore the underlying mechanisms. A549 cells were divided into two groups: one cultured in 10% serum and another under serum-free conditions, followed by treatment with ginsenosides CK, Rh2(S), and Rg3(S) for 24 h. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were evaluated using a CCK-8 assay, Calcein/PI fluorescence staining, Hoechst 33258 staining, and flow cytometry. Potential targets and signaling pathways of ginsenosides were predicted using network pharmacology and bioinformatics analyses. The mRNA expression of key genes was measured by qRT-PCR, and mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using JC-1 staining. The results showed that ginsenosides induced dose-dependent apoptosis in serum-starved A549 cells. Bioinformatics analysis suggested the involvement of the PI3K/Akt/FoxO signaling pathway, which was supported by decreased Akt mRNA levels and increased FoxO mRNA expression. Furthermore, mRNA levels of Bim, Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and Caspase-9 were significantly upregulated, accompanied by a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. These findings indicate that under serum deprivation, ginsenosides enhance apoptosis in A549 cells, likely through the regulation of the PI3K/Akt/FoxO pathway. ginsenosides lung cancer serum starvation apoptosis proliferation PI3K/Akt/FoxO signaling pathway National Natural Science Foundation of China 82173913 Liaoning Province Education Administration LJ232412026011 Key R&D Projects of Liaoning Province 2024JH2/102600098 2023JH2/101300111 2023JH2/101700074 Dalian High-level Talent Innovation Support Program-Cutting-edge and Leading Talent 2021RD10 Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 044420250061 044420250062 This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82173913), Liaoning Province Education Administration (LJ232412026011), Key R&D Projects of Liaoning Province (2024JH2/102600098, 2023JH2/101300111, and 2023JH2/101700074), and Dalian High-level Talent Innovation Support Program-Cutting-edge and Leading Talent (2021RD10).

Introduction Lung cancer represents a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, characterized by high mortality rates and poor prognoses [ 1 2 3 4 5 Ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Mey) has been utilized for medicinal purposes for centuries in numerous Asian nations, including China, Japan, and South Korea [ 6 Shen Nong’s Herbal Classic 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Insufficient blood supply in solid tumors leads to changes in the intra-tumoral microenvironment, affecting the aggregation of essential nutrients, oxygen, and metabolic byproducts crucial for tumor cell survival [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 In this study, we employed in vitro serum starvation to simulate the nutrient-deprived microenvironment of cancer cells in vivo. We investigated the effects of ginsenosides on the proliferation and apoptosis of NSCLC A549 cells. Concurrently, we employed network pharmacology and bioinformatics approaches to predict potential mechanisms of action and validated signaling pathways associated with nutrient metabolism. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the anti-tumor mechanisms of ginsenosides, providing novel theoretical insights and leads for their development as clinical drugs. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Ginsenoside Inhibits the Proliferation of A549 Cells Under Serum Starvation The experiment comprised two groups: one exposed to 10% serum and another to serum-free conditions, with each group treated with ginsenosides CK, Rh2(S), and Rg3(S) for 24 h on A549 cells. Cell viability was evaluated using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assay, and the results are depicted in Figure 1 Figure 1 50 Figure 2 50 2.2. Ginsenoside Induces the Apoptosis of A549 Cells Under Serum Starvation To further explore the impact of serum starvation on ginsenoside-induced apoptosis in A549 cells, the cells were treated with medium concentrations of ginsenosides for 24 h. Subsequently, cell morphology was characterized using Hoechst 33258 staining, as illustrated in Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure S1A–C Supplementary Materials 2.3. Network Pharmacology Analysis of Ginsenosides To elucidate the mechanism underlying ginsenoside-induced apoptosis in A549 cells under serum starvation conditions, we conducted a network pharmacology analysis. Previous investigations have revealed that ginsenosides CK, Rh2(S), and Rg3(S) undergo oxidative deglycosylation during hepatic metabolism, resulting in metabolites such as monooxygenated ginsenoside Rh2(S), protopanaxadiol-type saponin, and monooxygenated protopanaxadiol [ 15 Table 1 Figure 3 Figure 3 p Figure 3 Figure 3 28 Figure 3 2.4. Bioinformatics Analysis of Ginsenosides The degree of receptor–ligand binding can be assessed by the level of binding energy as observed in molecular docking results. If the binding energy is less than −5.0 kcal·mol −1 Table 2 Figure 4 Figure 4 2.5. Ginsenoside Promotes the Apoptosis of A549 Cells by Regulating Key Molecules in the PI3K/Akt/FoxO Signaling Pathway Under Serum Starvation Validation of the bioinformatics analysis results of ginsenosides was conducted using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) detection technology. A549 cells in both the 10% serum and serum-free groups were treated with moderate concentrations of ginsenosides for 24 h, followed by mRNA expression level measurements of key molecules in the signaling pathway, including PI3K, Akt, and FoxO (refer to Figure 5 Concurrently, changes in the mRNA expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins were examined, including the pro-apoptotic molecules Bcl-2-like protein 11 (Bim), and Caspase family proteins such as Caspase-3, Caspase-8, and Caspase-9 downstream of the PI3K/Akt/FoxO signaling pathway ( Figure 5 2.6. Ginsenosides Decreased the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential of A549 Cells Under Serum Starvation Cell apoptosis typically involves a decrease in mitochondrial membrane permeability [ 29 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 NSCLC represents the most prevalent form of lung cancer, characterized by reported five-year survival rates of merely 16% in advanced stages. Researchers worldwide have devoted substantial efforts to pursue novel, highly efficient, and low-toxicity anti-NSCLC drugs [ 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the targets were predominantly enriched in the PI3K/Akt/FoxO signaling pathway. qRT-PCR experiments revealed decreased mRNA expression of Akt and increased mRNA expression of FoxO under serum starvation conditions induced by ginsenosides. The PI3K/Akt/FoxO signaling pathway, as a central pathway governing cell growth and metabolism, plays a role in modulating various physiological processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and insulin resistance [ 38 39 40 41 42 43 This study hypothesizes that, under serum starvation conditions, ginsenosides inhibit Akt and activate FoxO by regulating the PI3K/Akt/FoxO signaling pathway in A549 cells. The activation of FoxO decreases mitochondrial membrane potential, indirectly influencing the activity of the Caspase protein family. In the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, the heightened permeability of the mitochondrial membrane results in the release of specific proteins (such as cytochrome c) into the cytoplasm, subsequently activating the Caspase protein family and initiating apoptosis [ 44 Figure 7 Indeed, when compared to cell cultures under normal serum conditions, cells subjected to serum starvation display a survival state more closely resembling the actual tumor microenvironment in vivo. The network pharmacology analysis results revealed that G7, G5, and G6 were the top three active ingredients of ginsenosides, all of which are metabolic products of ginsenosides Rg3(S), Rh2(S), and CK in vivo. Our prior studies have demonstrated that these metabolites exhibit stronger anti-tumor activities compared to the parent compounds [ 15 The strong docking scores obtained in this study suggest promising interactions between the compounds and the target of interest. It should be noted, however, that molecular docking is a predictive computational tool and cannot independently confirm actual binding or functional activity in a biological context. While these results provide a supportive in silico model, future experimental validation using techniques such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to quantify binding affinity, together with functional cellular assays, will be essential to unequivocally establish the biological significance of these interactions. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Materials Ginsenosides CK, Rh2(S), and Rg3(S) (purity > 98%) were purchased from Chengdu Must Bio-Technology (Chengdu, China). A549 cells were obtained from the Shanghai Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Science (Shanghai, China). RPMI-1640 medium and penicillin-streptomycin were ordered from Hyclone (Logan, UT, USA). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was ordered from Sorfa (Huzhou, China). Also, 0.25% trypsin−EDTA solution was ordered from Gibco (San Francisco, CA, USA). Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and RNAsimple total RNA kit were ordered from Solarbio (Beijing, China). The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was ordered from APExBIO (Shanghai, China). The calcein/propidium iodide (PI) cell viability/cytotoxicity assay kit, Hoechst 33258 staining kit, Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit, and mitochondrial membrane potential assay kit with J-aggregates (JC-1) were purchased from Beyotime (Shanghai, China). The FastKing RT kit and SYBR Premix Ex Taq were purchased from Tiangen (Beijing, China). 3.2. Culture of A549 Cells A549 lung cancer cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin as a complete growth medium. Cells were incubated in a CO 2 2 3.3. Cell Viability Assay A549 cells were treated with various concentrations of ginsenoside for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and calcein/propidium iodide (PI) cell viability/cytotoxicity assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The results of the CCK-8 assay were determined by measuring the optical density at 450 nm in each well using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). After incubation with the calcein/PI buffer for 30 min, live and dead cells were observed under a fluorescent microscope. 3.4. Hoechst 33258 Staining Detection The detection of apoptosis in A549 cells was performed using Hoechst 33258 staining. A549 cells were incubated with various concentrations of ginsenoside for 24 h, followed by fixation with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, and then stained with Hoechst 33258 for 15 min. Cells with nuclei containing condensed chromatin or fragmented nuclei were identified as apoptotic cells through visualization. 3.5. Flow Cytometry Assays After 24 h of treatment with ginsenosides, A549 cells were stained with the Annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit. Flow cytometry (CytoFLEX, Beckman, CA, USA) was employed to analyze the samples and quantify the percentage of apoptotic cells. 3.6. Bioinformatics Analysis The bioinformatics analysis was conducted according to the protocol outlined by Aqsa Kanwal and colleagues [ 45 http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/ https://www.uniprot.org/ Network pharmacology was utilized to preliminarily predict potential targets, pathways, and mechanisms associated with the anti-NSCLC activity of bioactive components. The GeneCards and DisGeNET databases were employed to identify NSCLC-related genes using the keyword “non-small cell lung cancer,” and cell apoptosis-related genes were selected using the keyword “apoptosis” [ 46 47 48 49 50 Protein–ligand docking was performed using AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2) to predict the predominant binding mode of the ligand with the protein [ 51 3.7. Quantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) The qRT-PCR analysis utilized the CFX96™ real-time system (Bio-Rad, USA). A 20 µL reaction mixture was prepared, comprising 2 µL of template, 0.6 µL of each primer (400 nM final concentration), and 10 µL of 2 × Talent qPCR PreMix (Tiangen, Beijing, China). The PCR protocol followed the manufacturer’s guidelines, starting with an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C and 15 s at 60 °C. Melting curve analysis included 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, and 30 s at 95 °C. Normalization against β-actin mRNA levels enabled relative gene expression quantification using the 2-ΔΔCT method. The primer sequences are provided in Table 3 3.8. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Measurement Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in cells was assessed using a mitochondrial membrane potential detection kit (JC-1) (C2006, Beyotime, Shanghai, China). A549 cells were washed and then incubated with JC-1 working solutions for 30 min at 37 degrees Celsius in the incubator. Additionally, those treated with carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) served as negative controls during MMP evaluation, following the provided instructions. Subsequently, live cells were imaged using a confocal laser scanning microscope (FV3000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) after incubation. Confocal images were rapidly acquired and then quantified for mean fluorescence intensities in arbitrary regions using ImageJ (version 1.52a). 3.9. Statistics and Analysis All experiments in this study were conducted with at least three independent replicates, and data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. The normality (Shapiro–Wilk test) and homoscedasticity (Levene’s test) of data were confirmed prior to analysis. Statistical significance between treatment groups was determined using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons. Significance levels are denoted as follows: * p p p p 4. Conclusions In summary, we assessed the anti-lung cancer activity of ginsenosides under serum starvation conditions and explored their potential mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that ginsenosides inhibited the proliferation of and induced apoptosis in A549 cells under serum deprivation, suggesting potent anti-tumor effects. Mechanistically, our multi-faceted approach indicated that ginsenosides likely regulate the PI3K/Akt/FoxO signaling pathway, as evidenced by inhibited Akt and activated FoxO expression. Nevertheless, a limitation of this study is its reliance on mRNA expression and bioinformatic predictions to infer pathway involvement. Future studies employing pathway-specific inhibitors or genetic approaches are essential to conclusively establish causality. By simulating the nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment in vitro, we provided evidence that ginsenosides may exert enhanced anti-tumor effects under metabolic stress. These findings offer valuable insights for developing ginsenosides as potential clinical therapeutics targeting adverse tumor microenvironments.
