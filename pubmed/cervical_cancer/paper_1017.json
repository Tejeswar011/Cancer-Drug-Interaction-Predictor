Current research indicates that UBD is frequently overexpressed in various malignancies, with its elevated expression closely correlated with disease progression in cancers such as gliomas, colorectal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and breast cancer. In this study, we conducted a pan-cancer analysis of UBD to elucidate its prognostic significance, immunological roles, and potential clinical applications. Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), and tools including Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA2.0), CBio Cancer Genomics Portal (cBioPortal), University of Alabama at Birmingham CANcer data analysis Portal (UALCAN), Sangerbox and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING), we analyzed UBD expression, prognosis, promoter methylation, genetic alterations, immune infiltration, and pathway enrichment. UBD was overexpressed in 29 cancer types, linking it to poor prognosis and higher histological grades. The most common type of genetic variation was gene amplification, and patients with these alterations exhibited significantly reduced overall survival rates. Epigenetically, 16 cancer types showed reduced UBD promoter methylation. UBD expression was significantly correlated with tumor microenvironment features, including immune infiltration, checkpoints, microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and neoantigens (NEO). Pathway analysis implicated UBD in neurodegeneration, proteolysis, and apoptosis. Collectively, our study demonstrates that UBD is a promising prognostic biomarker and a potential predictor of immunotherapy sensitivity in multiple cancer types.

These interactions collectively promote tumor survival, proliferation, invasion, and metastatic potential [ 12 13 14 16 17 18 19 Pan-cancer analysis represents a powerful bioinformatics approach that enables systematic identification of molecular commonalities and divergences across diverse cancer types through integrative multi-omics data analysis [ 20 22 Materials and methods Data acquisition Transcriptomic and clinical data for pan-cancer analysis were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ( https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Genotype-Tissue-Expression-Project http://gepia2.cancer-pku.cn/#index http://vip.sangerbox.com/login.html https://ualcan.path.uab.edu/index.html https://www.cbioportal.org/ https://cn.string-db.org/ https://david.ncifcrf.gov/ This study encompassed 44 different cancer types, including: adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CESC), cholangiocarcinoma (CHOL), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), colorectal adenocarcinoma (COADREAD), lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBC), esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), glioblastoma (GBM), glioma (GBMLGG), brain lower grade glioma (LGG), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), renal chromophobe carcinoma (KICH), renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), pan-kidney cohort (KIPAN), acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), mesothelioma (MESO), ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), Osteosarcoma(Os), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), sarcoma (SARC), skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), metastatic melanoma (SKCM-M), primary melanoma (SKCM-P), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD), stomach and esophageal carcinoma (STES), testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), thyroid carcinoma (THCA), thymoma (THYM), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS), uveal melanoma (UVM), and high-risk Wilms tumor (WT), neuroblastoma (NB). Gene expression analysis To investigate the role of UBD in human cancers, we conducted a systematic analysis of UBD expression using data from TCGA and GTEx projects. Differential mRNA expression of UBD between tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues was analyzed using GEPIA 2.0. To validate these findings, we performed a comprehensive comparative analysis of UBD mRNA expression across pan-cancer tissues and their corresponding normal tissues using the Sangerbox database. Additionally, protein-level expression was assessed using the UALCAN online tool. Analysis of UBD expression in relation to clinico-pathological parameters To evaluate the clinical relevance of UBD expression, we analyzed its correlation with key clinico-pathological parameters (histological grade, clinical stage, and T-stage) using the Sangerbox database. Prior to analysis, we performed the following data preprocessing steps: (1) applied log2(x + 0.001) transformation to all expression values, (2) excluded samples with zero expression levels, and (3) removed cancer types with fewer than three representative samples. We then conducted logistic regression analyses to assess associations between UBD expression levels and various clinical grades/stages, evaluating UBD’s potential clinical significance in cancer progression. Prognostic assessment in pan-cancer To evaluate the prognostic significance of UBD expression across multiple cancer types, we conducted comprehensive survival analyses using TCGA data, employing the SangerBox platform to assess overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) through integrated Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier methods. After excluding samples with zero expression levels or follow-up durations shorter than 30 days, and removing cancer types with fewer than 10 samples, we retained 44 distinct cancer types for final analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using the R survival package (v2.1.6), including univariate Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves analyzed with log-rank tests (significance threshold: p DNA methylation analysis We utilized UALCAN to analyze promoter DNA methylation levels of the UBD gene in both normal tissues and pan-cancer samples. Genetic alteration analysis We analyzed UBD gene mutation frequency, amplification, and other genetic alterations using cBioPortal, with all data sourced from the TCGA Pan-Cancer Atlas Studies. The analysis included genetic alteration data from 2683 samples representing 2565 pan-cancer patients. Investigating tumor immune microenvironment of UBD We systematically analyzed the relationships between UBD expression and immune biomarkers using the Sangerbox database. The TIMER and QUANTISEQ algorithms within the IOBR R package (version 2.1.6) were employed to assess associations between UBD expression levels and tumor immune cell infiltration across multiple tumor types. Using the ESTIMATE algorithm, we calculated immune scores for various tumors and performed Pearson correlation analyses to quantify relationships between UBD expression and both immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint molecule expression. Furthermore, we examined correlations between UBD expression and immunoregulatory genes, including those encoding chemokines, chemokine receptors, immunostimulators, immunoinhibitors, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Correlation analysis of UBD expression with tumor heterogeneity, stemness and gene mutation We conducted Pearson correlation analyses to evaluate associations between UBD expression levels and critical tumor stemness features, focusing on established biomarkers of tumor heterogeneity including tumor purity, microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutational burden (TMB), and neoantigens (NEO). Resulting correlation patterns were visualized using Mutcet2 software and the maftools R package (version 2.8.05). Enrichment analysis of UBD We constructed the PPI network for UBD using the STRING database, setting minimum interaction score set at high confidence (0.700), and a maximum of 50 interactors included. After analyzing available UBD-binding proteins, we identified the top 520 UBD-related target genes through the “Co-expression” module in cBioPortal. Venn diagram analysis revealed 4 common genes between datasets, for which we established correlation with UBD expression using Pearson correlation tests via cBioPortal’s co-expression analysis. Furthermore, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses on 25 genes from STRING datasets, with gene lists obtained from DAVID database and results visualized using Sangerbox. Statistical significance was defined as p Statistical analysis We assessed differential molecular expression between normal and tumor samples from public databases using non-parametric Wilcoxon rank-sum tests based on data distribution characteristics. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD), with all statistical analyses performed using R software (version 2.1.6). Statistical significance was defined as p p p p p Results mRNA and protein expression levels of UBD in human cancers To elucidate UBD’s oncogenic role across malignancies, we performed comprehensive expression analyses using integrated TCGA and GTEx data. Compared with normal tissues, UBD expression was significantly upregulated in most tumor types, including liver, lung, colorectal, esophageal, gastric, kidney, sarcoma, breast, reproductive system, brain, and central nervous system (CNS) tumors (Fig. 1 1 1  Fig. 1 UBD was differentially expressed in tumor and normal tissues. A B C To complement our mRNA findings, we analyzed UBD protein expression using the UALCAN proteomic database, identifying significant upregulation specifically in hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) (Fig. 2 1  Fig. 2 The protein expression of the UBD in tumor and normal tissues, using UALCAN database. CPTAC Relationship of UBD with clinicopathological characteristics We systematically evaluated UBD expression patterns in relation to clinicopathological parameters, including tumor histological grade, clinical stage, and T-stage across multiple tumor types using the Sangerbox database. Our analysis revealed significant associations between UBD expression and tumor histological grade in seven cancer types. In particular, the higher expression levels of UBD were showed in advanced histological grades in GBMLGG, LGG, ESCA, STES, STAD, HNSC, and LIHC (Fig. 3 3 3 3  Fig. 3 The relationship of UBD expression with clinical metrics of various tumors. A B C Prognostic role of UBD in human pan-cancer UBD expression showed significant associations with clinicopathological characteristics across diverse tumor types. To assess its prognostic value, we performed univariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses using the Sangerbox database, evaluating OS and DSS. Cox regression analysis identified high UBD expression as a risk factor for poor OS in seven cancers, including GBMLGG, LGG, KIRP, KIPAN, THYM, UVM and PAAD (Fig. 4 4 4 4  Fig. 4 Univariate COX regression analysis was performed to examine the association of UBD with OS and DSS. A B We further evaluated UBD’s prognostic significance through Kaplan-Meier analysis using the Kaplan-Meier plotter database. The analysis demonstrated that elevated UBD expression correlated with significantly worse OS in GBM, GBMLGG, KIPAN, KIRP, LGG, and UVM (Fig. 5 5 Both Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses consistently demonstrated that elevated UBD expression was significantly associated with poorer prognosis in GBMLGG, KIPAN, KIRP, LGG, and UVM. These findings highlight the critical importance of further investigating UBD’s role across cancer types, given its substantial clinical and scientific implications.  Fig. 5 Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves was conducted to investigate the expression of UBD and its relationship with OS and DSS. A B Genetic alterations and methylation landscapes of UBD in different tumors DNA methylation represents a crucial epigenetic modification implicated in various diseases, with abnormal DNA methylation patterns serving as key biomarkers for cancer initiation and progression [ 23 25 26 27 6 28  Fig. 6 The methylation level of the UBD promoter in 16 types of cancer was downregulated compared with that in normal tissues To explore the frequency and types of UBD genetic alterations in various cancers, we analyzed its mutation status through the cBioPortal database(TCGA, Pan-cancer Atlas). The results demonstrated that UBD expression was altered in 125 samples collected from 2565 patients with different cancer types, accounting for 5% of alterations (Fig. 7 7 7 7 7 7  Fig. 7 Genetic alteration analysis. A B C D E F The relationship between UBD expression levels with tumor immune cell infiltration, the tumor immune infiltration status and tumour purity in pan-cancer datasets The tumor immune microenvironment plays a pivotal role in cancer progression and patient outcomes. To systematically evaluate relationships between UBD expression and immune infiltration patterns, we performed pan-cancer analyses using TIMER and QUANTISEQ algorithms. TIMER analysis demonstrated significant positive correlations between UBD expression and infiltration levels of multiple immune cell types: B cells in 31 cancers, CD4 + T cells in 33 cancers, CD8 + T cells in 25 cancers, neutrophils in 35 cancers, macrophages in 19 cancers and dendritic cells in 34 cancers (Fig. 8 8  Fig. 8 Pan-cancer analysis of the UBD expression and immune cell infiltration. A B The immune score reflects the proportion of infiltrated immune cells within tumor tissues. Using the ESTIMATE algorithm, we calculated immune scores for UBD across 44 cancer types, revealing significant positive correlations between UBD expression and immune scores in 39 malignancies, including GBMLGG, KIPAN, KIRC, BRCA, PRAD, LUAD, LUSC, OV (Fig. 9 2  Fig. 9 Correlation analysis between UBD expression with Immune Score ( A B Tumor purity reflects the proportion of tumor cells in the sample and significantly affects the clinical characteristics, genomic expression and biological characteristics of tumor patients. Our analysis revealed significant negative correlations between UBD expression and tumor purity in KIPAN. Among 11 tumor types (LUAD, BRCA, SARC, KIRP, READ, TGCT, UVM, UCS, BLCA, ACC, and DLBC), UBD expression showed moderate inverse correlations with tumor purity. Additionally, weak negative correlations were observed in 20 other malignancies, including GBM, CESC, COAD, COADREAD, ESCA, STES, STAD, PRAD, UCEC, HNSC, KIRC, LUSC, LIHC, THCA, MESO, PAAD, OV, PCPG, SKCM, KICH (Fig. 9 Elevated UBD expression shows significant positive associations with Immune Score and inverse correlations with tumor purity, indicating increased infiltration of non-tumor components (especially immune cells) in the tumor microenvironment; however, these bioinformatic observations necessitate further experimental validation. Relationship between UBD expression and immunoregulators, immune checkpoint in human pan-cancer The association between UBD expression and immunomodulatory factors is presented in Fig. 10  Fig. 10 Pan-cancer analysis of the correlation between UBD expression and Immunoregulators, immune checkpoint. A B Immune checkpoint molecules (ICPs) serve as primary immunotherapy targets and critically influence tumor immunotherapy responses and immune cell infiltration patterns. Our results demonstrate significant positive correlations between UBD expression and key immune checkpoint markers-including CD274 (PD-L1), CTLA4, SLAMF7, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CD80-across multiple cancer types ( B Correlation between UBD expression and TMB, MSI, and NEO TMB, MSI, and NEO represent key biomarkers of tumor microenvironment immunogenicity and potential predictors of immunotherapy response [ 29 30 11 11 11 11  Fig. 11 Association between UBD expression and various genomic biomarkers in pan-cancers. A B C Functional enrichment analysis of UBD-related genes To investigate UBD’s molecular mechanisms in tumorigenesis, we performed systematic bioinformatics analyses. First, we constructed a PPI network using STRING database, identifying 25 UBD-interacting proteins (Fig. 12 12 12  Fig. 12 Functional enrichment analysis of UBD in pan-cancer. A B C D E H We identified the top 520 UBD co-expressed genes from cBioPortal, which when integrated with STRING data revealed four significantly correlated UBD-associated genes: CXCL9, CXCL10, HLA-F, and PSMB9 (Fig. 12 12 Discussion Cancer research remains a focal point in contemporary medicine. While tumor immunotherapy has achieved remarkable clinical advances in the past decade, its full therapeutic potential remains unrealized [ 31 32 UBD is a ubiquitin-like modifier protein that plays pivotal regulatory roles in diverse biological processes, including: cellular immunity, apoptosis regulation, cell cycle control, transcriptional modulation, signal transduction pathways and inflammatory responses [ 33 19 33 39 40 19 34 9 38 37 35 Accumulating evidence indicates that aberrant expression and dysfunction of UBD are closely associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progression [ 16 16 41 Although our analysis indicates that UBD mRNA upregulation is a common feature across various cancers, its prognostic significance varies significantly. COX regression analysis revealed that elevated UBD expression correlates with poor prognosis in GBMLGG, LGG, KIRP, KIPAN, THYM, and UVM, while demonstrating an association with improved survival outcomes in SKCM, SKCM-M, OV, BLCA, SARC, and HNSC. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that elevated UBD expression was significantly associated with worse prognosis in GBM, GBMLGG, KIPAN, KIRP, LGG, and UVM, consistent with prior research [ 40 Our investigation of the relationship between UBD expression and clinicopathological cancer stages demonstrated that abnormal UBD expression may serve as a potential prognostic predictor. The study revealed significant associations between UBD expression levels and histological grades, clinical stages, and T-stages across multiple tumor types. Notably, increased UBD expression correlated with higher histological grades in seven cancer types. Furthermore, elevated UBD levels showed significant association with advanced clinical stages and T-stages in KIPAN cancers. These results indicate that UBD may serve as a valuable prognostic biomarker and could have important implications for clinical decision-making and personalized treatment strategies in patients with advanced-stage malignancies. Epigenetic modifications refer to heritable changes in gene expression that occur without alterations to the DNA sequence, mediated by environmental and lifestyle factors including diet, toxins, and stress [ 42 43 44 45 48 Our analysis revealed significant downregulation of UBD methylation levels across 16 cancer types, suggesting a potential negative correlation between UBD expression and methylation status. While tumor research has traditionally focused on tumor suppressor gene silencing through promoter hypermethylation [ 49 57 58 59 60 60 61 Genetic alterations represent well-established drivers of tumorigenesis, with copy number variations (CNVs) frequently causing oncogene overexpression in affected genomic regions [ 62 63 Immunotherapy has become increasingly prominent in cancer treatment, with immune cells playing pivotal roles in tumor progression [ 64 19 18 Notably, UBD exhibits particularly strong association with CXCL9 expression, suggesting its potential as a combinatorial immunotherapy target. These findings position UBD as a multifaceted immune regulator and promising therapeutic target, with current research exploring UBD-targeted strategies to develop more precise immunotherapies [ 65 The tumor microenvironment (TME) represents a complex ecosystem comprising diverse cellular components, including: immune cells (T lymphocytes, NK cells, macrophages, dendritic cells), stromal elements (fibroblasts, extracellular matrix), malignant tumor cells. Our study revealed that UBD expression positively correlates with immune cell scores, suggesting its role in promoting immune infiltration. Conversely, UBD expression negatively correlates with tumor purity across multiple cancer types, indicating its potential to enhance tumor heterogeneity and immune cell recruitment, thereby modifying the TME’s immunological landscape. These findings collectively demonstrate UBD’s critical role in shaping the TME by potentially modulating immune evasion mechanisms, stromal-tumor crosstalk, and therapeutic response patterns. Immune checkpoint (ICP) genes play pivotal roles in modulating tumor immune infiltration and response to immunotherapy [ 66 19 Several studies have shown that TMB, MSI, and NEO are very attractive related biomarkers to guide tumor immunotherapy [ 67 68 69 69 To characterize UBD’s biological functions, we performed GO and KEGG pathway analyses of UBD-associated genes. GO analysis identified UBD’s primary involvement in ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism and apoptotic inhibition. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that UBD appears to function through multiple neurodegenerative and proteolytic pathways: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson disease, Prion disease, Alzheimer disease, Proteasome, Spinocerebellar ataxia and Ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. Specifically, UBD inhibits the transcriptional activity of the tumor protein p53 (TP53) and promotes its degradation, thereby accelerating tumor development [ 38 12 37 70 41 Protein-protein interaction network analysis identified CXCL9, CXCL10, HLA-F, PSMB9, and p53 as the most strongly associated partners of UBD. The p53 tumor suppressor serves as a master regulator of apoptosis and gene expression, with established evidence demonstrating UBD-mediated p53 degradation promotes colorectal cancer proliferation [ 38 In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that UBD-associated molecular pathways may serve as valuable biomarkers for precision oncology, potentially guiding the development of more targeted therapeutic strategies for cancer patients. Conclusion Our results revealed that UBD expression was aberrantly upregulated in various cancers and closely associated with tumor prognosis, clinico-pathological stages, gene mutations, methylation patterns in multiple cancers. While these findings position UBD as a promising immunotherapeutic target based on its crucial role in tumor immunity, we acknowledge that these bioinformatics-derived observations require experimental validation. Future research should employ both in vitro and in vivo models to: (1) functionally characterize UBD’s oncogenic mechanisms, (2) elucidate its tumor-specific overexpression patterns, and (3) explore its therapeutic potential - essential steps for developing targeted UBD inhibitors and advancing precision immunotherapy approaches.
