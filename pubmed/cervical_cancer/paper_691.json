Recently, certain genetic changes that play critical roles in the development of CCA have been identified, leading to the development of new targeted therapies. However, how different causes of liver and bile duct diseases, such as hepatitis viruses, cholestatic liver diseases, and parasitic infections like liver flukes, affect the genetic features of CCA is still not fully understood. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on how various underlying conditions influence the molecular characteristics of CCA and its response to treatment. We also highlight the latest advances in precision medicine, including the development of therapies targeting specific gene mutations. Understanding these relationships may help improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of CCA.

Introduction Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) comprises a heterogeneous group of malignancies arising from the bile duct epithelium and accounts for approximately 15% of primary liver cancers [ 1 2 Although its global incidence remains relatively low (fewer than 2 cases per 100,000 people annually), it shows marked geographic variation, with a notably higher incidence in parts of East Asia [ 3 Opisthorchis viverrini Clonorchis sinensis 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 CCA is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage, primarily because of its asymptomatic nature in the early phases and the anatomical complexity of the biliary tree, which hampers early detection. As a result, curative surgical options are often not feasible at the time of diagnosis, and the prognosis of unresectable cases remains poor, with median survival times of around 12 months under standard systemic therapy [ 16 17 18 17 The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has substantially advanced our understanding of CCA molecular heterogeneity. Through comprehensive genomic analyses, various actionable mutations have been identified, including fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusions [ 19 20 21 22 19 In this review, we aim to bridge this critical gap by systematically summarizing the current knowledge on the genomic and molecular landscape of CCA in the context of its diverse etiologies. In doing so, we not only highlight known and emerging associations but also identify areas where evidence is scarce, thereby laying a foundation for future investigations in precision oncology for CCA. This narrative review is based on a comprehensive survey of the relevant literature, drawing on recently published peer-reviewed articles, landmark studies, and authoritative reviews in the field, with particular attention to advances reported in the past decade. 2. Chronic Liver and Biliary Diseases as Etiologic Factors Figure 1 2.1. Environmental and Cholestatic Risk Factors for CCA Risk factors for CCA development include chemical exposure, congenital or acquired biliary obstruction leading to cholangitis, chronic hepatic inflammation, chronic biliary inflammation, and cirrhosis. Occupational and lifestyle-related exposures may also contribute. Exposure to certain chemical and environmental agents, such as 1,2-dichloropropane, dichloromethane [ 22 23 24 Furthermore, infection with liver flukes, such as Clonorchis sinensis Opisthorchis viverrini 25 Fasciola hepatica Fasciola gigantica 26 In the context of chronic cholestasis, a direct association between hemolytic anemia, such as sickle cell anemia or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and the development of CCA has not been established. However, given that these conditions can cause bilirubin stone formation, which in turn may lead to chronic intrahepatic cholestasis, their potential contribution to the risk warrants attention [ 27 2.2. Risks of Developing CCA from Hepatitis Viruses Hepatitis viruses, including HBV and HCV, are recognized risk factors for CCA as well as for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and thyroid cancer. According to a meta-analysis evaluating the risk of CCA, hepatic viruses are associated with an increased risk of CCA, particularly iCCA, with a significant increase in risk demonstrated by an odds ratio of 3.96 for HBV infection and 2.90 for HCV infection [ 28 5 5 According to a study using tumor tissue from patients with iCCA who underwent liver resection, 40.7% of the tissue was positive for HBs antigen in immunohistochemical staining. Furthermore, patients with HBV-positive iCCA had significantly shorter disease-free survival than those with HBV-negative iCCA. Interestingly, the HBV antigen was detected only in fresh iCCA tissues and organoids, but not in bile duct epithelial cells in the portal area. This localization of HBV suggests that HBV-associated iCCA may originate from hepatocytes rather than bile duct epithelial cells [ 29 30 However, evidence regarding the risk of CCA associated with HCV infection, particularly the presence or absence of a history of HCV treatment, is more abundant in Asia. In a large-scale Asian cohort study of 11,892,067 individuals, the cumulative incidence of eCCA was 0.088% in HCV-treated patients, 0.095% in untreated patients, and 0.048% in HCV-uninfected individuals [ 31 32 5 2.3. Risks of Developing CCA with Chronic Cholestatic Liver Diseases Chronic cholestatic liver diseases, exemplified by PSC, contribute to the development of CCA through persistent cholangitis and prolonged bile stasis. PSC is a rare, idiopathic biliary liver disease characterized by chronic inflammation of the major extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts and is one of the most well-known risk factors for CCA. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Practice Guidelines also state that CCA can develop at any time during the course of PSC, with an incidence rate of 1–1.5% per year, and that the cumulative risks of CCA 10, 20, and 30 years after PSC onset are 6%, 14%, and 20%, respectively [ 8 9 33 However, there is insufficient evidence to indicate an increased risk of CCA alone in patients with PBC and underlying bile duct disorders caused by chronic cholangitis or fibrosis. In a Swedish cohort study of 3052 PBC patients followed up for 10 years, the overall cancer incidence rate was 14.3%, compared to 11.8% in the matched control group, with significantly higher risks of gastrointestinal cancer, lung cancer, and lymphoma [ 34 35 Hepatolithiasis is also a recognized risk factor for CCA, accounting for 3–10% of all cases [ 36 36 37 38 1 Furthermore, congenital biliary tract disorders, such as Caroli disease and congenital hepatic fibrosis, are also recognized as risk factors for iCCA. Caroli disease, in particular, is a rare congenital liver disorder characterized by segmental cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, resulting from incomplete remodeling of the ductal plate during embryogenesis [ 39 40 2.4. Risks of Developing CCA with Other Liver Diseases MASLD, formerly termed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is strongly associated with cirrhosis and HCC [ 41 42 43 44 11 45 ALD may promote the development of HCC and CCA through chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. A meta-analysis of seven studies involving 413,483 healthy controls and 8962 patients with CCA showed that patients with ALD had a 3.92-fold higher risk of CCA than the normal control group [ 12 46 3. Common Genomic and Molecular Alterations in CCA Building on the etiological heterogeneity discussed above, we explored how these distinct backgrounds shape the genomic and molecular profiles of CCA, thereby influencing its biological behavior and therapeutic vulnerabilities. The molecular heterogeneity of CCA presents challenges to uniform treatment strategies. The European Society for Medical Oncology guidelines recommend routine genomic profiling before initiating treatment and prioritizing targeted therapy if treatable alterations are present [ 47 Table 1 3.1. Common Genetic Alterations Seen in CCA KRAS plays a central role in mediating upstream to downstream signal transduction and regulates cell differentiation and proliferation by switching between an active GTP-bound form and an inactive GDP-bound form [ 73 74 49 50 48 49 51 52 75 TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene that responds to various cellular stresses such as DNA damage, oncogene expression, and hypoxia, and performs a wide range of functions that suppress cancer, including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, aging, metabolic regulation, and immune responses [ 76 77 78 79 50 53 48 50 52 ARID1A is a chromatin remodeling factor that regulates gene expression by adjusting chromosome structure. It also plays a role in transcriptional control, DNA repair, and cell cycle regulation [ 80 81 50 53 48 82 83 84 85 86 CDKN2A encodes p16INK4a and p14ARF, whereas CDKN2B encodes p15INK4b, which are major regulators of the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint via the CDK4/6–Rb and p53 signaling pathways [ 87 88 89 90 91 50 54 50 52 53 92 EGFR, a member of the ERBB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular proliferation, survival, and differentiation [ 93 94 95 96 55 56 PI3K encodes a lipid kinase that plays a central role in key intracellular signaling pathways linking receptor tyrosine kinases, G-protein-coupled receptors, and oncogenes to essential cellular functions, including proliferation, survival, and metabolism [ 97 3 3 98 99 100 48 57 101 BRAF belongs to the serine/threonine kinase family and encodes a serine/threonine kinase that plays a central role in the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway [ 102 103 104 105 106 4 58 59 Breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) and BRCA2 are critical tumor suppressor genes whose protein products play essential roles in cellular DNA damage response. As key components of the homologous recombination repair pathway, they promote error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks, thereby maintaining genomic stability [ 107 108 60 61 SMAD4 is a central mediator of TGF-β signaling that regulates proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [ 109 110 111 49 112 In addition to well-characterized genomic alterations such as KRAS and TP53, recent pan-cancer analyses have identified aberrant expression of RNA helicases as potential contributors to CCA biology. Notably, DEAD-box RNA helicase 1 (DDX1) has been reported to be highly expressed in CCA, with potential implications for prognosis and immune microenvironment modulation [ 113 3.2. Genetic Abnormalities in CCA as Therapeutic Targets IDH is an enzyme that converts isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate as part of the citric acid cycle and has three subtypes, IDH1, IDH2, and IDH3, depending on the site of action. IDH1 mutations are associated with malignant tumors, disrupt normal metabolic pathways, and lead to abnormal production of carcinogenic metabolites [ 114 53 62 63 115 Abnormal regulation of FGFR signaling is known to cause cancer formation and progression, leading to treatment resistance, and FGFR gene abnormalities have been observed in various cancers. FGFR2 frequently forms fusions with partners such as BicC family RNA-binding protein 1 and transforming acidic coil–coil-containing protein 3 [ 20 116 20 53 64 65 66 67 67 ERBB2, also known as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), is a receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the ERBB family with no known ligands. This protein is activated through homodimerization or heterodimerization with other activated ERBB receptors and induces downstream signal transduction via the MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways [ 117 118 119 48 68 69 70 71 72 120 3.3. Genomic Alterations According to Anatomical Subtypes of CCA Genetic alterations in CCA are closely associated with histopathological subtypes defined by the WHO 2019 classification [ 121 122 123 124 In contrast, large-duct type iCCA, originating from larger intrahepatic bile ducts, is characterized by a higher prevalence of mutations in TP53, KRAS, and several TGF-β pathway-related genes, including SMAD4, TGFBR2, FBXW7, and MYC [ 125 121 4. Genomic and Molecular Alterations by Etiology 4.1. CCA Associated with Chronic Hepatitis Viruses Infection Although the exact frequency is often unknown, differences in genetic alterations associated with CCA by etiology have been reported, as shown in Table 2 28 126 127 Chronic inflammation and fibrosis caused by HBV infection may increase the risk of CCA carcinogenesis, similar to that observed in HCC. In some cases, the distinction between iCCA and HCC is unclear, and differentiation from composite hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma may be difficult. HBV is not only detected in hepatocytes but also in bile duct epithelial cells, suggesting the possibility of direct viral effects. A recent study of 41 iCCA patients, including HBV-positive cases, showed that HBV DNA integration is frequently observed in iCCA tumors and combined hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma, with recurrent insertions identified near oncogenes such as telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), mesenchymal–epithelial transition factor, and ALKBH5 [ 128 129 On the other hand, although HCV infection is an important associated factor of CCA, comprehensive analysis of genetic alterations associated with HCV-related CCA appears to be limited at this time. According to a large-scale observational study in Japan involving 453 patients with CCA, the HCV antibody positivity rate was not high in 24 patients (5.3%). However, FGFR fusions or rearrangements were strongly associated with HCV antibody positivity, with an odds ratio of 9.50 [ 67 cancers-17-03052-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Genetic alterations in CCA by etiology. Etiology Subtype of CCA Sample Size Gene Alterations Reference HBV iCCA 103 patients TP53, IDH1, PTEN, and ARID1A [ 126 HBV iCCA 41 patients TERT [ 128 HCV iCCA and 24 patients FGFR2 [ 67 PSC All 186 patients TP53, KRAS, CDKN2A, SMAD4, and ERBB2 [ 130 Liver Fluke All 8 patients TP53, KRAS, and SMAD4 [ 131 Liver Fluke All 108 patients TP53 [ 132 Liver Fluke All 23 patients ERBB2, TP53 [ 133 Hepatolithiasis iCCA 38 patients KRAS [ 134 HBV: hepatitis B virus, HCV: hepatitis C virus, PSC: primary sclerosing cholangitis, iCCA: intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, TP53: tumor protein 53, IDH1: isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, PTEN: phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10, ARID1A: AT-rich interactive domain 1A, TERT: telomerase reverse transcriptase, FGFR2: fibroblast growth factor receptor 2, KRAS: Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, CDKN2A: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A, SMAD4: SMAD family member 4, ERBB2: Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2. 4.2. CCA Associated with Chronic Cholestatic Liver Diseases Chronic cholestatic liver diseases—including PSC, PBC, hepatolithiasis, congenital hepatic fibrosis, liver fluke infection, and chemical exposure—share common pathogenic mechanisms involving chronic biliary inflammation and prolonged cholestasis, which collectively contribute to cholangiocarcinogenesis. Although the underlying etiologies differ, recent genomic and molecular profiling studies have revealed both shared and distinct alteration patterns depending on the cause. PSC carries a high lifetime risk of CCA and represents a leading cause of mortality in affected patients [ 8 130 135 136 137 In PBC, the causal relationship with CCA remains less well defined, and data on associated genomic alterations are limited. Similarly, congenital hepatic fibrosis—characterized by chronic cholestasis and ductal plate malformation—has been sporadically associated with CCA, but large-scale molecular data are lacking. CCA associated with Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis infections is highly prevalent in Southeast Asia and exhibits a distinct molecular profile. Whole-exome sequencing in 8 patients, including O. viverrini–associated CCA, has revealed frequent mutations in TP53 (44.4%), KRAS (16.7%), and SMAD4 (16.7%) [ 131 132 133 Hepatolithiasis, common in East Asia, causes recurrent cholangitis and chronic bile stasis, predisposing to CCA through cycles of epithelial injury and regeneration. Similarly, chemical exposures, such as 1,2-dichloropropane, dichloromethane, and asbestos, have been linked to CCA development via mechanisms involving oxidative stress, DNA damage, and persistent biliary inflammation. The carcinogenesis of iCCA associated with hepatolithiasis is considered to progress stepwise from biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (BilIN), a precancerous lesion, to invasive CCA [ 134 138 Despite diverse initiating factors, chronic cholestatic conditions converge on common oncogenic pathways, including TP53, KRAS, SMAD4, IDH1/2, and ERBB2 alterations. A unified understanding of these mechanisms provides opportunities for early molecular diagnosis, risk stratification, and targeted therapeutic strategies in CCA associated with chronic cholangiopathy. 4.3. CCA Associated with Other Liver Diseases Regarding MASLD and ALD, which are potential precursors to HCC, cohort studies have suggested that they may increase the risk of developing CCA, but the number of actual cases is limited. Furthermore, these conditions often overlap with other risk factors, limiting the availability of evidence directly applicable to clinical practice. However, data on the genetic alterations associated with CCA progression are insufficient. It should be noted that inconsistencies exist among published studies regarding both the epidemiological associations and the prevalence of genomic alterations. Such discrepancies may be attributable to differences in study design, cohort size, patient demographics, regional etiologies, and methodological approaches, and should be carefully considered when interpreting the available evidence. 5. Implications for Precision Therapy Since the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin has been shown to prolong OS in patients with unresectable CCA [ 18 139 Table 3 In clinical practice, targeted therapies such as FGFR2 and IDH1 inhibitors are typically positioned after failure of standard first-line chemotherapy or chemo-immunotherapy regimens. However, the optimal sequencing of these agents remains unresolved, as no prospective head-to-head studies have directly compared targeted therapy with immunotherapy-based combinations. Current evidence suggests that molecular profiling at diagnosis is essential to identify candidates for targeted therapies early, thereby enabling timely treatment decisions. Ongoing clinical trials are expected to provide further insights into sequencing strategies, including the potential benefits of integrating targeted inhibitors earlier in the treatment course or in combination approaches. 5.1. FGFR2 Mutation-Targeted Therapy In recent years, clinical trials of multiple FGFR inhibitors targeting FGFR mutations in CCA have progressed, and this molecularly targeted therapy has emerged as one of the most significant treatments contributing to improved outcomes in patients with CCA. Pemigatinib was the first FGFR2 inhibitor approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of CCA with FGFR2 fusion/rearrangement positivity and is a selective and potent oral competitive inhibitor of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 [ 140 140 Similarly, infigratinib, another selective FGFR1-3 inhibitor, has also been developed as a therapeutic agent for patients with FGFR mutations. In Phase II trials, infigratinib demonstrated an objective response rate of 23.1% in patients with FGFR2 fusion-positive CCA who had previously received gemcitabine-based therapy, suggesting its potential as an effective treatment [ 147 141 Futibatinib, a next-generation FGFR inhibitor that inhibits FGFR1-4 through covalent binding, has demonstrated strong preclinical activity against acquired resistance alterations associated with antitumor activity and ATP-competitive FGFR inhibitors, making it the most recent and potentially effective drug available [ 148 149 142 5.2. IDH1 Mutation-Targeted Therapy Ivosidenib is a potent, orally administered, targeted IDH1 inhibitor originally developed for patients with IDH1-mutated acute myeloid leukemia [ 150 62 143 5.3. ERBB2 Mutation-Targeted Therapy ERBB2 gene, also known as HER2 gene, is targeted by a combination of anti-HER2 antibody drugs, pertuzumab and trastuzumab, which have demonstrated significant improvements in treatment outcomes in patients with various types of cancer, including HER2-positive breast cancer and gastric cancer [ 151 152 144 145 5.4. Therapies Targeting Other Alterations Although BRAF mutations are less common in CCA than in melanoma or thyroid cancer, they activate the MAPK/ERK and MEK signaling pathways, promoting tumor proliferation and survival, and thus represent promising therapeutic targets. In the ROAR basket trial (a Phase II study), the efficacy of the RAF inhibitor dabrafenib combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib was evaluated in 178 patients with BRAF V600E-mutated solid tumors, including those with refractory CCA [ 153 146 The neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK) gene family encodes TRK receptors and includes three members: NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3. Chimeric fusions involving these genes can serve as actionable targets in certain cancers. These fusions result in ligand-independent constitutive activation of TRK receptors, persistently activating oncogenic pathways such as MAPK, PI3K–AKT, and PLCγ, thereby driving uncontrolled cellular growth and survival [ 154 155 156 157 158 6. Therapeutic Resistance and Future Direction in CCA Despite recent advances in targeted therapies, CCA remains a highly lethal malignancy with limited durable responses. One major clinical challenge is the development of therapeutic resistance—both primary and acquired—driven by underlying molecular heterogeneity and adaptive oncogenic signaling. Resistance to FGFR inhibitors in FGFR2-altered CCA occurs through multiple mechanisms, including on-target alterations and bypass signaling pathways [ 159 149 160 64 Similar to other molecular targeted therapies, tumors treated with mutant IDH inhibitors, such as ivosidenib, eventually develop resistance. While resistance mechanisms to FGFR inhibitors in CCA are well characterized, those related to IDH-targeted therapies remain poorly understood. Insights from acute myeloid leukemia suggest that receptor tyrosine kinase mutations, secondary IDH mutations, and isoform switching (e.g., IDH1 to IDH2) can mediate resistance [ 161 162 Resistance mechanisms to HER2-targeted therapies have been most extensively studied in breast cancer, where key contributors include impaired binding to the HER2 extracellular domain, activating mutations in HER2, overexpression of alternative receptors such as EGFR, HER3, and VEGF, and downstream pathway activation via mutations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR cascade [ 163 164 Resistance to dabrafenib and trametinib in BRAF-mutant melanoma has been widely investigated, revealing diverse mechanisms [ 165 166 167 Understanding and overcoming resistance to molecular targeted therapies in CCA remains a major clinical challenge. Future research should aim to further elucidate both genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of resistance, including epigenetic alterations, adaptive signaling, and tumor microenvironmental factors. In this context, the integration of liquid biopsy technologies, such as circulating tumor DNA and cell-free DNA analysis, offers a promising non-invasive approach for real-time monitoring of treatment response and the emergence of resistance alterations. These tools may facilitate early detection of resistance-associated alterations and enable timely therapeutic adjustments. Nevertheless, their clinical application in CCA is limited by variable sensitivity influenced by tumor burden, anatomical site, and technical factors, and should therefore be interpreted in conjunction with tissue-based analyses whenever feasible. Looking ahead, exploratory studies, including those investigating natural compounds with cytotoxic and immunomodulatory effects in preclinical CCA models [ 168 7. Conclusions Large-scale etiology-stratified genomic studies are essential for clarifying how chronic liver and biliary diseases contribute to the pathogenesis and molecular heterogeneity of CCA. While certain etiologies, such as PSC and liver fluke infection, exhibit distinct molecular signatures, many etiologic conditions, including HBV, HCV, MASLD, and ALD, remain insufficiently characterized at the genomic level. Integrating multi-omics data, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics, with real-world clinical outcomes and longitudinal patient cohorts is critical for uncovering clinically meaningful molecular subtypes. In parallel, advances in minimally invasive diagnostic platforms such as liquid biopsy and bile-based molecular testing offer promising tools for early detection and real-time disease monitoring. A deeper understanding of how etiologic factors influence tumor biology will not only refine personalized therapeutic approaches but also enhance risk stratification, surveillance, and preventive strategies tailored to region- and patient-specific contexts. Ultimately, such precision approaches hold the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes in this challenging malignancy.

Chronic viral infections, metabolic and lifestyle-related disorders, liver fluke infections, cholestatic diseases, and chemical exposures shape the molecular heterogeneity of CCA. Cholestatic disease includes primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatolithiasis, and Caroli disease. This diversity in etiology underpins the development of distinct mutational landscapes, which may offer early detection and surveillance, prognostic stratification, and identification of potential targets for precision therapies.
