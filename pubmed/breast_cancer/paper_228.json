One month after completion of maintenance chemotherapy, he developed subcutaneous swelling in the right temporal region and was treated with antibiotics for presumed lymphadenitis. Two months later, he developed a recurrent painless right parietal soft tissue mass that failed to respond to antibiotic therapy. This prompted evaluation by MRI which revealed new enhancing masses in the cerebellum and extracranial soft tissue mass in the right temporal region. He underwent gross total resection of both masses. Pathologic analysis confirmed both masses as recurrent HGG. Molecular markers, however, differed between the 2 sites of recurrence. He proceeded to complete hypofractionated proton therapy at sites of recurrence. Three months later, he was found to have tumor dissemination into the spine and brain for which he received proton therapy to the whole spine and brain.
