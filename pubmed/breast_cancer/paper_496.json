In parallel, blood proteomics, specifically quantitative proteomics, has been a powerful tool for identifying and quantifying protein biomarkers associated with cellular therapies, providing insights into treatment efficacy and toxicity. Both mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics and large-scale affinity-based platforms such as Olink and SomaScan have been increasingly implemented in research and clinical laboratories to identify and quantify candidate biomarkers in the blood. Biomarkers are used for risk stratification, early diagnosis, prognosis, and for treatment response prediction and monitoring in context of treatment efficacy and toxicity. These biomarkers might facilitate timely and selective therapeutic intervention and understand pathogenesis mechanisms of responses and adverse events. They are anticipated to undergo faster transition from bench to bedside soon. This review article summarizes recent technical progresses in clinical proteomics. The review also provides current information on validated biomarkers in the field of cellular therapies. https://doi.org/10.13039/100000054 National Cancer Institute P30CA015704 R01CA168814 Gafken Philip R.

Proteins work as part of major biological processes mediating protein interactions that control signaling pathways, cellular processes, and metabolic systems in health and diseases. Proteins represent intermediate phenotypes for disease and provide insight into how genetic and non-genetic risk factors are mechanistically linked to clinical outcomes. Indeed, many diseases, including cancer, are regulated at the protein level emphasizing the importance of the field of proteomics. Proteomics refers to the large-scale identification and quantification of proteins in biological specimens. Accurate protein identification and quantification are essential for elucidating biological processes underlying health and disease. Contemporary proteome research places strong emphasis on biomarker discovery and validation, aiming to improve early disease diagnosis, stratify susceptibility, predict prognosis, and guide therapeutic decisions. Advances in sample preparation, quantitation strategies, mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation, and data analysis have been instrumental in addressing clinical questions and accelerating the identification of clinically relevant biomarkers. Over the past few decades, MS-based proteomics has enabled the discovery of thousands of candidate biomarkers across a wide range of diseases. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several MS-based in vitro diagnostic assays, including those for pathogen identification, newborn screening, therapeutic drug monitoring, and vitamin D quantification [ 1 Affinity proteomics has emerged as an attractive alternative to MS-based identification of proteins by conducting classical immunoassays at higher throughput and higher sensitivity and in multiplex format. These multianalyte assays rely on advances made in DNA technologies and measure multiple proteins simultaneously in one sample by miniaturizing the assays. The technology implemented by Olink (Uppsala, Sweden) uses proximity extension assays. Detection of a given protein requires binding of two separate antibodies that carry complementary oligonucleotide tags: when two antibodies bind to the target protein, these oligonucleotides can be hybridized and extended by a DNA polymerase. This assay utilizes protein-specific binding properties to generate a readout that relies on DNA concentrations that can be quantify by quantitative PCR [ 2 3 4 This review will first discuss how progresses in MS related technologies, sample preparation methods, labeling reagents, stable isotope labeling reagents, and bioinformatics have led to identification and quantification of several thousand proteins in one experiment with steadily improved sensitivity, resolution and specificity, propelling proteomics into the clinic. Furthermore, large affinity-based methods for plasma biomarkers discovery relying on next-generation proteomics platforms such as Olink and Somascan have been developed in parallel [ 5 Current methods and technologies Mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods The predominant technology for protein biomarker discovery typically involves mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches. While other technologies such as microarray, aptamer, and proximity extension assay technologies are useful for protein biomarker discovery, MS is often favored for multiple reasons. First, MS detects proteins in an unbiased manner with essentially no restrictions on what kinds of proteins that can be detected, and it can detect proteins that are not initially targeted or expected at the beginning of an experiment. Second, MS is very sensitive with it being able to detect proteins at low concentrations, which is critical for potential biomarkers that might be present in trace amounts. Third, the technology can provide quantitative results making it possible to compare protein levels between healthy and diseased states or different conditions. The mass spectrometer hardware itself along with sample preparation and data analysis software are under continuous advancement which further bolsters the technologies application in biomarker discovery. Therefore, the technique is preferred in biomarker discovery for its combined advantages in multiplexing capacity and remarkable analytical specificity and sensitivity. Here, we cover current MS methods and highlight recent developments in the field that are improving the depth and quality of identified biomarker candidates. Sample preparation Blood plasma is an ideal source for potential biomarkers, being the most collected biofluid globally. Blood plasma is relatively easy to collect with blood draws being less invasive than obtaining biopsies from tissues, making it a practical choice for large-scale testing and routine studies. Collection and handling protocols for plasma are well established which maintains consistency and reliability in biomarker discovery experiments. With blood plasma circulating through the bloodstream, it can reflect the overall physiological state of the body, integrating signals from different tissues and organs. While these attributes make blood plasma a powerful source for identifying new diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic biomarkers, MS has historically struggled with obtaining deep proteomic analysis of plasma. Discovery MS-based proteomic analysis of neat plasma is inherently challenging because the most abundant 22 proteins in plasma account for 99% of plasma’s protein content and the range of protein concentrations spans over 10 orders of magnitude [ 6 Magnetic beads Various bead-based approaches have been developed to assist in purifying proteins from various matrices to make them compatible with downstream MS analysis. In the popular SP3 (single pot, solid phase sample preparation) method [ 7 8 9 10 11 Similar to the Seer nanoparticle approach, which enriches low-abundance proteins onto magnetic beads while depleting high-abundance proteins prior to mass spectrometric analysis, the company PreOmics has developed a magnetic bead-based solution called ENRICHplus. This kit is available in formats for 12 or 96 samples and includes reagents for both protein enrichment from plasma and downstream sample preparation steps, including protein reduction and alkylation, enzymatic digestion, and peptide purification. According to PreOmics’ marketing materials, the ENRICHplus workflow enables the identification of over 5,500 protein groups across five plasma samples and using 50 µL of plasma per sample. The protocol is compatible with automation using commercially available liquid handling platforms; however, the cost of the kit translates to approximately $150 per sample for enrichment and preparation. A third bead-based technology called Mag-Net was recently developed for preparing blood plasma samples for mass spectrometry analysis. This method utilizes strong-anion exchange beads for capturing extracellular vesicles (EVs) from plasma, which are membrane-bound particles that include exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, while at the same time minimizing the enrichment of high abundant plasma proteins. Since EVs are actively shed by cells into the bloodstream, they carry molecular cargo that can reflect the physiological or pathological state of their cells of origin. As such, EVs represent a potentially rich source of cell-specific proteins for biomarker discovery and disease profiling. The Mag-Net approach is automatable (the Opentrons OT-2 and ThermoFisher KingFisher liquid handling robots have been used) and initial reports identified over 4000 protein groups from less than 100 µL of plasma [ 12 13 Acid precipitation A much simpler approach that has emerged for depleting high abundance proteins in plasma is the use of strong acids for protein precipitation. Perchloric acid has a limited history of being used to precipitate proteins and peptides, but it was recently applied to depleting proteins in plasma. The approach involved adding perchloric acid to samples to a final concentration of 3.5% and centrifuging samples and collecting the pellet, resulting in a pellet that is significantly (but not fully) depleted of high abundance plasma proteins. This depletion was tested on 3199 plasma samples from 1141 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and had longitudinal plasma samples collected during their hospitalization. A total of 44 plates containing the samples were analyzed resulting in a total of 3198 proteins being identified and averaging 1343 proteins per run. Using reference samples on each plate, the authors noted that there was little to no batch effect across the 44 plates and the cost of the depletion reagent per sample was 2 to 3 cents, making this approach incredibly cost-effective for large-scale biomarker studies using plasma [ 14 Global proteomics Discovery-based global proteomics studies are carried out through a “bottom-up” scheme. Here a sample is subjected to protein isolation followed by digestion with a protease, typically trypsin, into peptides that are analyzed by an analytical configuration that is composed of a liquid chromatography instrument that separates and elutes the peptides directly into a mass spectrometer for detection: this configuration is referred to as LC-MS. The mass spectrometer detects the mass to charge ratio, or m/z, of eluting peptide ion species in an initial round of mass analysis called an MS scan, and the instrument then fragments peptide ion species detected in the MS scan and records the m/z of those fragments in what is called an MS/MS scan. The effort of the mass spectrometer is focused on detecting as many peptide ion species as possible, fragmenting them, and detecting their fragments during the chromatographic elution of the peptides, which is typically on the order of 15 s to 30 s in duration for a single peptide. With mass spectrometer scan rates of about 40 to 200 Hz and analysis times lasting up to two hours in duration, very complex peptide mixtures produce many thousand or even millions of spectra in a single experiment. The resulting spectra are processed through a protein database search algorithm to identify the peptides back to the proteins from which they originated. Additionally, quantitative data are obtained through the data processing resulting in quantitative values that are relative in nature. That is, individual proteins can be quantitatively compared to themselves across samples in a study. Mass spectrometers Although numerous mass spectrometers are commercially available with various types and combinations of mass analyzers, discovery-based biomarker studies have been primarily carried out with orbitrap-based instruments. Hybrid orbitrap instruments consist of an orbitrap mass analyzer coupled with either a quadrupole mass analyzer or an ion trap mass analyzer to create an instrument with two functional mass analyzers. Tribrid orbitrap instruments couple the orbitrap mass analyzer with ion trap and quadrupole mass analyzers to create an instrument with a total of 3 functional mass analyzers. The configuration of these instruments allows for highly coordinated use of the coupled mass analyzers to provide sensitive, high-resolution MS analysis in the orbitrap of peptide ions and high-speed MS/MS analysis of peptide fragment ions in either the orbitrap or ion trap mass analyzers. The orbitrap product line has been expanded by combining the orbitrap mass analyzer with a novel time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzer called Astral (Asymmetric Track Lossless). The Astral analyzer acts as an electrostatic trapping device that uses temporal and spatial focusing of ions across asymmetric ion mirrors with a time-of-flight separation of around 30 m. The Astral achieves a mass resolution of 80,000 (at m/z 524), a scan speed of 200 Hz, and single ion detection sensitivity. As with previous orbitrap instruments, the Astral model is a tribrid design built with orbitrap, quadrupole, and Astral mass analyzers working in a coordinated fashion to optimize the efficient transmission of ions to carry out MS and MS/MS scans [ 15 16 Besides orbitrap-based instrumentation, ion mobility coupled with time-of-flight (TOF) mass analyzers has seen a dramatic growth in popularity for biomarker discovery. The gas-phase separation of ions by ion mobility is carried out by subjecting ions to an electric field that separates them based on their mobility through a gas, such as helium or nitrogen, with the mobility being influenced by the size, shape, and charge of the ion. Ultimately, ion mobility adds an additional dimension of separation to LC-MS, reducing the complexity of ions packets entering the TOF analyzer and increasing the sensitivity of detection. The most notable ion mobility-enabled mass spectrometer used for biomarker discovery is the trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) TOF instrument. The TIMS-TOF utilizes two sequential TIMS regions with the first region used to trap ions and the second region used for ion mobility separation. In general operation, trapped ions from the first region are separated by their ion mobility in the second region and detected by the TOF mass analyzer for a MS scan. Using the MS scan as a guide, ions are selected serially from the second TIMS region for fragmentation, with the fragment ions being detected in the TOF mass analyzer as an MS/MS scan [ 17 Data acquisition methodologies Data-dependent acquisition (DDA) has traditionally been the primary mass spectrometry (MS) strategy employed in discovery-based biomarker research. This approach dynamically selects precursor ions during the initial MS survey scan, where ions are chosen for fragmentation based on their relative intensity (Fig. 1A DIA is a discovery-based mass spectrometry method that systematically fragments all ions within predefined mass-to-charge (m/z) windows, typically ranging from 2 to 20 m/z, across the MS spectrum. These windows are sequentially scanned over a specified m/z range during each cycle, and this process is repeated throughout the duration of the analysis (Fig. 1 18 19 Samples per day Advancements in liquid chromatography instruments have resulted in very stable and reproducible LC-MS analyses. With optimized liquid chromatography systems coupled with mass spectrometers that acquire data at > 100 scans per second, LC-MS run times for obtaining > 8000 proteins quantified in a human sample can occur in less than 10 min. Many MS-based proteomics labs now associate their methods with the number of samples that can be analyzed in a day. For example, they might have methods for 12 samples per day (SPD), 24 SPD, 48 SPD, and higher [ 14 20 21 Multiplexed quantitative proteomics While DIA methods are advancing and gaining more utility, these methods are still somewhat specialized for MS labs. The ability to quantitatively analyze multiple samples simultaneously, or multiplex, by MS-based DDA methods has been an active area of proteomic development for over 20 years. Emerging to the forefront of this development has been a chemical labeling approach called Tandem Mass Tags (TMT). In its current form, TMT is a set of isobaric reagents that allows for multiplexing up to 18 samples in a single batch [ 22 23 Multiplexing with TMT has certain advantages for general proteomics and biomarker discovery experiments. First, multiplexing allows for deep proteomic coverage of up to approximately 8,000 to 12,000 proteins quantified in a single 18plex experiment (e.g. cell lysate, tissue samples), taking approximately 3 days of MS analysis time. From a historical perspective this level of throughput is notable; however, with advanced mass spectrometers that can acquire data at 100 to 300 Hz, this throughput will assuredly increase in the near future. Second, since the samples are prepared simultaneously and mixed together early in the sample preparation scheme, multiplexing minimizes sample handling errors and reduces variability. Third, simultaneous analysis of the multiplexed samples provides higher data quality and more reliable quantification, with fewer missing values amongst the quantification results. Finally, TMT multiplexing does not need to be limited to just 18 samples; if more than 18 samples are part of a study, a common reference sample can be constructed and batches of 17 samples plus one reference sample can be made. The common reference allows for relative quantification across multiple batches, and it also minimizes the variation of the results by allowing for batch effect correction. TMT has proven to be incredibly versatile, with it being applied to cell lines and bacterial lysates, tissues biopsies, organoids, and clinical fluids such as plasma, serum, urine, and cerebral spinal fluid. The robustness of this methodology for biomarker research and molecular tumor characterization has been demonstrated in its use by the National Cancer Institute’s Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (NCI-CPTAC) published studies associated with breast [ 24 25 26 28 29 30 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 Single cell quantitative proteomics Biomarkers identified within the tumor cells themselves and the associated tumor microenvironment (TME) (e.g. fibroblasts, endothelium, and immune cells) provide an invaluable biologic context for the development and evaluation of immunotherapies. Understanding interactions of these cells at the single cell level will provide invaluable insights in the biology of the TME. The analysis of single cells by various biophysical techniques has grown dramatically in the past decade, with next-generation sequencing technology (NGS) being widely used in a high throughput manner to measure gene expression via mRNA abundance. However, there is a low correlation between mRNA abundance and protein abundance [ 39 While the first experiments demonstrating the feasibility of single cell proteomics used standard microfuge tubes and pipettors for liquid dispensing and handling, the development of chip-based methods to contain arrays of samples coupled to sub-microliter robotic liquid handling devices are becoming favored. Chips with hydrophobic surfaces are being designed to focus suspended cells in nanoliter droplets with sample preparation taking place through robotic nanoliter dispensing of reagents directly on to the focused droplet [ 40 41 42 To keep up with sample preparation throughputs, as well as the need to carry out single-cell experiments at levels of over 10,000 cells, MS methods must have compatible throughputs. The recent advances in data independent acquisition methods (as described above) and increased sensitivity and data acquisition speeds of mass spectrometers have reduced LC-MS injection to injection times to as low at 5 min, or 288 samples per day. Even with a 288 samples per day method, approximately 35 days of total MS acquisition time would be required to analyze 10,000 cells. Currently, the primary solution to increasing MS throughput is to utilize chemical-labeling multiplexing technology. Most notable is the tandem mass tag technology which can multiplex 18 samples into a single experiment, with recent advancements in the technology allowing for multiplexing out to 35 samples in a single experiment [ 23 42 In terms of sample preparation, it should be noted that fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is highly suited for isolating single cells and single cell population into 384-well plates and it has been utilized for single cell proteomics [ 43 44 45 46 Proteoforms Proteoforms studies have become a central focus in clinical proteomics to understand diseases and personalized medicine. The term “proteoforms” describes the range of different structures of a protein product of a single gene, including variations in amino acid sequence and post-translational modifications. This variety in protein structure contributes to the biological complexity observed in humans and animals. As the concentration of a particular proteoform increases or decreases in pathogenic states, proteoforms have been used in clinic as biomarkers of diseases. Importantly, within-person reproducibility of proteoforms related to inflammation (i.e. CRP, serum amyloid A, calprotectin (S100A8/9) and renal dysfunction (cystatin C) has been confirmed allowing their use as biomarkers [ 47 Affinity-based methods for plasma biomarkers discovery New technologies based on affinity reagents for capture and detection of specific proteins are receiving increasing attention in plasma proteomics due to their performance characteristics, cost, and usability. Platforms using paired, nucleotide-labeled antibody probes (Olink) and single-strand DNA aptamer reagents with slow off-rate kinetics (SomaScan) can be automated for efficient multiplexing of thousands of proteins at high sample throughput. While these platforms have streamlined workflows as compared to LC-MS/MS–based methods, this comes at the cost of decreased specificity for molecular characterization [ 48 49 52 53 54 Olink The innovation in the technology of the Olink platforms is the Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) which achieve high levels of specificity and detection sensitivity by combining affinity-based proteomics with next-generation sequencing (NGS) readouts. PEA is an immunoassay technology that uses antibodies attached to unique sequences of DNA oligonucleotides (DNA-tags). Each protein in the sample is targeted by two antibodies with complementary DNA sequences. Due to the proximity, when the two antibodies are attached with the target protein, DNA tags are hybridized and extended making a unique DNA barcode for each protein analyzed. This double-stranded DNA is then amplified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and quantified using NGS readout on the Illumina ® ® Somascan SomaScan is a high-throughput, aptamer-based proteomics assay designed for the simultaneous measurement of thousands of proteins with a broad range of endogenous concentrations. In its most current version, the SomaScan assay can measure up to 11000 human proteins simultaneously from a single 55-µL sample of serum, plasma, or other fluid types. It uses SOMAmer ® Although intra and inter coefficient of variations (CVs) are acceptable for each platform, the correlation of these two platforms for the same targets is poor. The Olink platform does correlate well with ELISA for specific targets but somascan does not, at least in the earlier version, which seem to have improve recently with the new iteration [ 53 55 57 1  Table 1 Attributes of plasma proteomics platforms Attributes Tandem Mass spectrometry (MS/MS) Olink Somascan ELISA Analytes measured Peptide MS spectra Pairs of antibodies Aptamer Pairs of antibodies Unspecific binding NA Mitigated by use of two antibodies Possible, needs to be verified on a case-by-case basis NA if single analyte Cross-reactivity NA Mitigated by use of two antibodies Possible, needs to be verified on a case-by-case basis NA if single analyte Interference Possible bias owing to over-representation of peptides from abundant proteins Possible owing to protein interactions Interference with DNA-binding proteins has been reported NA Sample throughput Low, dependent on protocol; future automation of workflows expected High owing to adaptation of workflows and multiplexing High owing to automation of workflow and multiplexing Extremely high (24 to 48 h turnaround), several CLIA clinical test Proteome coverage achievable in high throughput ~ 2,000 ~ 3,000 ~ 11,000 One at a time or low number of analytes in multiplex < 20 Preparation impacting sensitivity Protein depletion, peptide fractionation and selection Selected panels, dilution steps and signal amplification Selected panels, Multiple sample dilution steps Quantification Relative quant with multiplexing reagents or DIA; absolute quant based on peptide standards Quantification dependent on technique and based on full-length standards Quantification based on calibrators Quantification based on standard curve with set protein concentration values Target identification Targeted or based on guidelines defining length and peptide numbers per protein Targeted approach with selected sets of predefined analytes Targeted approach with a predefined list of analytes Highly specific tested for cross-reactivity Data processing after analysis Time demanding and dependent on algorithm Minimal but dependent on technology Standardized process, proprietary Widely available readers, data in few minutes Sustainability MS spectra can be reprocessed using novel or updated databases Continued availability of identical antibodies may become a limitation Unlimited reproducibility of synthetic aptamers Gold standard for CLIA approved clinical test Coverage of protein post-translational modifications Possible using dedicated workflows Possible owing to use of modification-specific reagents Requires generation of modification-specific binders, under development Possible if analyte is a PTM and available kit Coverage of isoforms Possible with appropriate protein database search strategy Not addressed and requires generation of isoform-specific binders and assays Requires isoform-specific binders, some exist NA Accessibility Most common and versatile proteomics technique Growing use of multiplexed systems over classical ELISAs Proprietary technique Gold standard for CLIA approved clinical test Cost Low sample cost but high capital cost and requirement of skilled personnel High Higher Lowest cost per sample Footnotes: MS, mass spectrometry; DIA, data-independent acquisition; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; NA, not applicable; CLIA Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments; PTM, post-translational modifications Systems biology approach for proteomics Understanding organisms at the proteome level will contribute to the development of logic models since proteins are highly modified due to post-translation modifications (PTMs) and therefore noticeably more diverse as compared to the more static genome. Systems biology constitutes a crossover between knowledge-based modeling and omics data-driven approaches. Bioinformatics is a broad multidisciplinary field which is indispensable for systems biology that deals with omics data, mathematical modelling, and network analysis. This is because the dynamic behaviors of biological systems are beyond human intuitive grasp due to the sheer number of components (biomolecules, cells, drugs, and each other) which interact. System-level understanding is only possible through computational models and simulations. However, the current tools for a global proteome analysis via systems biology study can only use information from total quantifiable proteins in any biological system. Furthermore, protein candidates can be further examined using pathway and network analysis that are approaches that find interacting partners or ligands. All the proteins expressed, and associated interactome information, can be used to design a workable model for a biological system and hence can be tested in systematic series of perturbation experiments. Proteogenomics studies Proteomics has been utilized in an integrative approach, combining other omics such as genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics to comprehensively understand biological processes. Rather than investigating isolated parts of genes and proteins in an organism like it is done with the traditional biology method, a system approach characterizes the dynamics and function of a working biological system which could then be tested upon series of classical biological experiments. For example, a recent study looking at the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) proteogenomics data from 1,043 patients across 10 cancer types enabled the construction of a comprehensive landscape of protein and peptide targets for companion diagnostics, drug repurposing, and therapy development [ 58 59 Integrative proteomics in network analysis Network analysis is a method of studying the relationships between the nodes in a network and understanding how the network functions. There is a rapid accumulation of proteomics data in recent years but those are highly variable, with results being sensitive to data preparation methods, sample condition, instrument types, and analytical method. To address this challenge in analysis, several approaches have been developed to incorporate biological function and network topological information to the data. There are four categories of tools available: (1) tools with basic functional information and little topological features such as GO category analysis, (2) tools with rich functional information and little topological features such as GSEA, (3) tools with basic functional information and rich topological features such as Cytoscape, and (4) tools with rich functional information and rich topological features such as PathwayExpress. These tools have been reviewed in [ 60 61 62 Implementation of proteomics for clinical biomarkers NIH and FDA types of biomarker definitions The ‘Biomarkers, EndpointS and other Tools’ (BEST) Resource was established in 2016 by the FDA-NIH joint leadership council to define and outline biomarker roles in biomedical research, clinical practice and pharmaceutical drug development [ 63 2  Table 2 Definitions of types of biomarkers Type of biomarker Definition Diagnostic An assay used to confirm the presence of the disease Risk/Susceptibility An assay that indicates the potential for developing the disease in individuals who do not have clinically apparent disease Prognostic An assay used to identify likelihood of a clinical event, disease recurrence or progression in patients who have the disease Predictive An assay used to identify individuals who are more likely than similar individuals without the biomarker to experience a favorable or unfavorable effect from exposure to a specific medical product (before treatment is received) Response/Pharmacodynamic An assay used to show that a biological response has occurred in an individual who has been exposed to a medical product (after treatment is received) Safety An assay used to indicate the likelihood, presence or extent of toxicity as an adverse effect of a medical intervention Biomarker development framework The development of a biomarker is complicated and involves many steps from discovery to implementation in the routine clinical care of patients. Figure 2 3  Table 3 Biomarker(s) development phases Phase Goal Discovery Identify candidate biomarkers through exploratory studies comparing biological samples from cases and controls patients for a specific disease context. Discovery platforms include MS/MS, Olink or Somascan. Analytical Validation Assess the reliability and accuracy of the methods used to measure the biomarker ensuring the assay provides consistent and accurate results. Clinical Validation Determine the clinical utility and relevance of the biomarker for the specific context and biomarker type. This phase involves large-scale clinical cohorts (retrospective, independent, prospective) to evaluate how well the biomarker performs in a real-world clinical setting. Clinical Application Integrate the validated biomarker into clinical practice using the biomarker to guide patient management. Biomarker Qualification This is a formal regulatory process to recognize the biomarker’s utility for use in specific drug development. This involves demonstrating to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the biomarker’s performance characteristics and establishing its context of use in almost all case associated with a drug. Clinical implementation If the biomarker has been qualified by the FDA, Integrate the qualified biomarker with the specific drug into clinical practice (i.e. PD1 staining with a threshold for a checkpoint inhibitor (still pending). Validated blood proteomics biomarkers for cellular therapies Biomarkers that have the greatest support for their validity for risk, diagnosis, and prognosis prediction for toxicity and efficacy of cellular therapies specifically hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) adoptive cell transfer are summarized in Table 4  Table 4 Validated blood biomarkers for cellular therapies Biomarker discovered Biomarker type Study/Year  n Detection platform Associations/Timepoints Phase Ref.

With over one million transplants performed worldwide, it has paved the way for advancements in stem cell therapies, immune-modulating techniques, and personalized cancer therapeutics such as CART adoptive transfer. Similarly, development of proteomics biomarkers for acute and chronic GVHD, two major complications following HCT have allowed a better understanding of GVHD and pathed the way for biomarkers for other cellular therapies [ 64 65 55 66 67 68 69 56 70 71 72 57 73 de novo 74 75 76 77 Relapse of the primary disease remains the main cause of death post-HCT and monitoring minimal residual disease (MRD) is critical as it has been reviewed recently by Wong and colleagues [ 78 79 62 Biomarkers in CART cells therapies Novel genetically engineered immunotherapies have improved the outcomes for patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. As of 2025, seven FDA-approved CAR-T therapies are available. Utilizing and standardizing biomarkers of toxicity and efficacy of these novel CART cells therapy will allow for better management of side effects and prediction of treatment outcomes. Identifying biomarkers can help predict patient-specific responses to treatment, including the risk of severe side effects like cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity, as well as the likelihood of achieving a complete remission [ 80 82 4 The 3 major toxicities of CART cells therapies are cytokine release syndrome (CRS), Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICAN), and cytopenia. Plasma IL6 has been the most validated cytokine related to CRS/ICAN with high levels at earlier timepoints post-infusion correlated with the worst toxicities. The IL6 clinical assay must be standardized across studies and clinical laboratories [ 81 83 82 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 Reg 98 99 Evaluation of biomarker performance and novel approaches to improve it Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves Sensitivity is the percentage of subject with a disease who are correctly identified by a test; specificity is the percentage of subject without a disease who are correctly excluded by a test. The area under the curve (AUC) of ROC (AUROC) is the most objective metric to evaluate the performance of binary classifiers [ 100 101 102 103 3 Improvement of sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers with machine learning (ML) approaches Machine Learning (ML) techniques adapt to the data to better capture complex nonlinear relationships and interactions between high-dimensional covariates that are difficult to handle with traditional regression. Three broad supervised ML strategies should be considered. Approach (1), which is within the Cox proportional hazards (PH) model framework including Boosting (XGBoost), Group SCAD, and Adaptive Group Lasso [ 104 105 108 109 4 110 111 Clinical implementation Actionable biomarkers are biomarkers for which results of the testing can be used to guide clinical management of disease. As mentioned earlier, it is important to utilize the correct type of biomarker for the outcome in question. In the field of cellular therapies, the intervention is dependent on the time following HCT. Diagnostic biomarkers could for example distinguish patients with GVHD from those without GVHD or with a specific target organ GVHD (i.e. BOS vs. infectious pulmonary). A predictive biomarker for GVHD therapy allows to intensify the treatment in the high-risk patients and decrease immunosuppression in low-risk patients. Response biomarkers enable monitoring of the pharmacodynamic of a specific treatment. In view of the newer prophylaxis that significantly reduce GVHD (i.e. post-cyclophosphamide post-transplant, Orca-T) but currently given to all comers, it will be beneficial (for engraftment, infectious, and GVL outcomes) to target only the higher risk patients. This goal of risk-adapted strategy can be achieved by using a risk biomarker-based preemptive trial focusing on the high risk-patients. Figure 5 Conclusions and future directions Proteomic data at scale have only recently become accessible to large-scale proteogenomic approaches, largely due to previous analytical limitations with MS-approaches specific to the composition of the plasma proteome. Advances in affinity proteomics technologies are rapidly correcting this shortfall, with recent studies reporting the parallel measurement of > 5,000 proteins in > 10,000 blood samples [ 4 112 113 80  Fig. 1 Overview of Mass Spectrometry-based Proteomics Data Acquisition Strategies. A B.  Fig. 2 Framework of Biomarker Development. This workflow outlines the key stages in developing biomarkers that pave the way for precision medicine and disease-modifying treatments (DMTs). It begins by clearly defining the context of use biomarker type  Fig. 3 Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) Curve. AUROC curve is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a biomarker. It represents the False Positive Rate (1-Specificity) on the x-axis versus the True Positive Rate (Sensitivity) for every threshold of the biomarker). An AUC of 0.5 is on the random chance line and an AUC of 1.0 is a perfect test with 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity. The Youden’s index selects as a threshold for the biomarker value that maximizes lift of the ROC curve from the diagonal. Another way to find the optimal threshold is to identify the point on the ROC curve closest to the (0,1) corner (the “perfect” classifier point) which minimizes the Euclidean distance between the curve and (0,1). This point represents a balance between sensitivity and specificity  Fig. 4 Deep Learning Performance Improves with More Data Compared to Traditional Algorithms. This figure illustrates how the performance of different data science algorithms scales with increasing amounts of training data. Deep learning algorithms show a strong positive correlation between data volume and performance, outperforming traditional machine learning methods as dataset size grows. This scalability is a defining advantage of deep learning in data-rich environments  Fig. 5 Implementation To the Clinic. Proposed clinical interventions guided by biomarker type and chronology following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). This approach aims to move towards personalized medicine, where treatment decisions are tailored based on individual patient characteristics and biomarker profiles. Risk biomarker of acute (day 14 post-HCT) or chronic GVHD (day 90 or 100 post-HCT) enable preemptive trials. Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers play a significant role in influencing treatment intensification in high values or rapid immunosuppression taper with low values. Predictive biomarkers allow to identify which patients are most likely to respond to specific therapies and therefore are essential for personalized treatment Publisher’s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.
