A total of 515 potential targets for Siegesbeckiae Herba constituents were predicted using the STP and SEA databases. Simultaneously, 1650 pancreatic cancer associated targets were identified using GeneCards, OMIM, and TTD databases. After calibration and deduplication via the UniProt database, 182 intersection targets were identified using Venny software (Fig. 3 3 17 19 17 16  Fig. 3 Network pharmacology analysis. ( a b c PPI network analysis The 182 overlapping targets were uploaded to the STRING database to construct a PPI network, comprising 144 nodes and 533 edges, with an average node degree of 7.79 (Fig. 3 GO functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis To further elucidate the functional process underlying the anti-pancreatic cancer effects of Siegesbeckiae Herba, GO functional enrichment analysis was performed on the 182 overlapping targets using the Metascape platform.

Lipid rafts are critical microdomains for signal transduction, concentrating receptors and kinases involved in regulating cancer cell proliferation, migration, survival, and apoptosis through pathways like PI3K/AKT 42 43 44 45 Collectively, these findings provide valuable guidance for selecting bioactive constituents and outline future directions for mechanistic and pharmacological validation. Future studies should prioritize chemical synthesis and structural optimization of compound 16 Methods General information Semi-preparative HPLC analyses were performed on Agilent Technologies 1260 Infinity instruments (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) equipped with an Agilent C18 column (250 × 9.4 mm, 5 μm). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-600 spectrometer (600 MHz for ¹H and 150 MHz for ¹³C, Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany), and high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectra (HR-ESI-MS) were acquired using an Agilent 6545 UPLC/Q-TOF mass spectrometer (CA, USA). Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using SpectraMax microplate reader (Shanghai, China). TLC analysis was conducted on silica gel G plates (Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co., Ltd., Qingdao, China). Column chromatography was performed using silica gel (100–200 mesh, 200–300 mesh, Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co., Ltd., Qingdao, China), Sephadex LH-20 (General Electric, MA, USA), and MCI gel CHP20 (Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Deuterated solvents (CDCl 3 d 6 Plant material The dried Siegesbeckiae Herba was purchased from Anhui Yicaokang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Bozhou, Anhui Province, China) and was identified by Dr. Xu, Y.B. (Taizhou University Hospital, Taizhou, China). The voucher specimen (TZZXYY-Xuyubin-2023-02-001) was stored at Taizhou University Hospital. Extraction and isolation The dried Siegesbeckiae Herba (30 kg) was immersed in 75% ethanol at room temperature for 3 days with continuous stirring. The extract was filtered, concentrated, and the extraction procedure was repeated once. The combined concentrated extracts were diluted with water and successively extracted three times each with petroleum ether and ethyl acetate. The resulting petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, and aqueous fractions were separately concentrated under reduced pressure. The ethyl acetate extract was subjected to silica gel (100–200 mesh) column chromatography and eluted with a stepwise gradient of dichloromethane-methanol (100:0, 100:1, 50:1, 30:1, 20:1, v/v). Eluates were monitored by TLC and combined into seven fractions (Fr.1-Fr.7). Fraction Fr.3 was further separated to yield two subfractions (Fr.3 − 1 and Fr.3 − 2), which were combined with Fr.2 and Fr.4 to form Fr.A and Fr.B, respectively. Further chromatographic purification employing MCI, Sephadex LH-20, and semi-preparative HPLC on the Fr.A fraction resulted in the isolation of compounds ZN-1 (18.2 mg), ZN-2 (4.0 mg), ZN-3 (1.2 mg), ZN-4 (9.2 mg), ZN-5 (7.8 mg), ZN-6 (3.2 mg), ZN-7 (4.2 mg), ZN-8 (1.2 mg), ZN-9 (4.0 mg), ZN-10 (0.9 mg), ZN-11 (2.3 mg), ZN-12 (3.7 mg), ZN-13 (3.8 mg), and ZN-14 (4.8 mg). Similarly, fraction Fr.B yielded compounds ZN-15 (560.0 mg), ZN-16 (4.4 mg), ZN-17 (11.6 mg), ZN-18 (4.5 mg), ZN-19 (4.3 mg), and ZN-20 (4.3 mg). All isolated compounds were stored at 4 °C for subsequent analyses. Cytotoxicity assay The cytotoxicities of the isolated compounds ZN-1 to ZN-20 were assessed against human pancreatic cancer PANC-1 cells using the standard Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8 assay 46 2 2 3 50 Network pharmacology Twenty compounds isolated from Siegesbeckiae Herba were submitted to the Swiss Target Prediction (STP, https://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/ https://sea.bkslab.org/ Homo sapiens 47 48 https://www.uniprot.org/ 49 Pancreatic cancer targets were collected by searching the GeneCards ( https://www.genecards.org/ https://www.omim.org/ https://idrblab.org/ttd/ 50 52 https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/ 53 https://string-db.org/ Homo sapiens 54 To further elucidate the potential mechanism of action, the intersecting targets were subjected to GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis using the Metascape platform ( https://metascape.org/ 55 59 https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn 60 Molecular docking To elucidate intermolecular interactions, molecular docking was performed using compounds 16 17 16 17 https://old.tcmsp-e.com/index.php https://www.uniprot.org/ https://dockthor.lncc.br/ 61 Conclusions Twenty compounds, including one new compound, were isolated from Siegesbeckiae Herba. Bioactivity evaluation revealed two flavonoids exhibited significant cytotoxicity against PANC-1 cells. Network pharmacology analysis indicated these compounds act through multiple targets within critical cancer-related pathways, particularly the PI3K-Akt, Ras, and HIF-1 signaling pathways.
