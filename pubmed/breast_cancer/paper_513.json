Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide; however, its therapeutic options are limited. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of HCC could provide insight into new therapies. Emerging studies indicate the important role of long-noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the pathogenesis of HCC.

However, only approximately 2% of the human genome encodes protein-coding genes, while approximately 98% of the genome is transcribed into non-coding RNAs [ 5 [ 6 e.g. [ 7 [ 8 Taurine upregulated gene 1 ( TUG1 [ 9 in vitro TUG1 TUG1 [ 10 TUG1 [ 11 TUG1 [ 12 TUG1 TUG1 TUG1 Materials and methods Cell culture HepG2 and SNU-449 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Cat. #HB-8065 and CRL-2234, respectively; ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The JHH-4 cell line was obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (JCRB) Cell Bank (Cat. #JCRB0435, Osaka, Japan). HepG2 cells were maintained in low-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco, Detroit, MI, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cat. #SV3016003, Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA) and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic (Cat. #1TFS-1CC-15240062, Gibco), in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 Genetic perturbation of HCC cells To inhibit the expression of TUG1 [ 13 TUG1 TUG1 R70007 TUG1 TUG1 [ 13 TUG1 TUG1  Supplementary Table 1 Analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of mRNA and miRNA were performed as previously described [ 13 −ΔΔCt RPL19 U6  Supplementary Table 1 RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) Total RNA was obtained from control and TUG1 TUG1 P TUG1 q GSE273253 Bioinformatic analysis of clinical data and RNA interaction Gene and miRNA expression levels of HCC patients were derived from TCGA using the TCGAbiolinks package. In brief, gene expression data were queried with the following parameters: project = TCGA-LIHC, data.category = Transcriptome Profiling, and data.type = Gene Expression Quantification. For miRNA expression, parameters used were project = TCGA-LIHC, experimental.strategy = miRNA-Seq, data.category = Transcriptome Profiling, data.type = Isoform Expression Quantification. For the survival analysis, the expression profiles of HCC patients were derived from the OncoLnc database in the LIHC dataset, queried by gene ID or miRNA accession (MIMAT0000421: miR-122-5p). Correlation analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software version 10.3.0 (GraphPad) and derived from the GEPIA and starBase v2.0. To identify novel TUG1 TUG1 TUG1 Proliferation and glycolysis-related assays Cell proliferation was assessed by the MTT assay, which measures metabolic activity to quantify the number of living cells. Briefly, approximately 5 × 10 4 Glucose uptake into HCC cells was measured by the Glucose Uptake-Glo Assay (Cat. #J1341, Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Briefly, approximately 2 × 10 5 + Levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production were measured by the CellTiter-Glo 2.0 Cell Viability Assay (Cat. #G9241, Promega). Briefly, approximately 2 × 10 5 via Lactate production was assessed by the Lactate-Glo Assay (Cat. #J5021, Promega). Briefly, approximately 2 × 10 5 + Dual luciferase reporter assays Wild-type and mutant sequences of TUG1 PKM ALDOA  Supplemental Table 1 5 Renilla Western blotting analysis Proteins from HCC cells were prepared in radioimmunoprecipitation (RIPA) lysis buffer containing the complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Cat. #04693132001, Roche, Basel, Switzerland), separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then incubated in the BlockPRO 1 Min Protein-Free Blocking Buffer (Cat. #BM01-500, Visual Protein, Taipei, Taiwan, China), and probed overnight with the following primary antibodies: PKM (1∶2000; Cat. #A0268, ABclonal, Woburn, MA, USA), ALDOA (1∶2000; Cat. #A1142, ABclonal), and β-actin (1∶2000; Cat. #sc-47778, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and goat anti-rabbit IgG (1∶5000, Cat. #7076 and Cat. #7074, respectively; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) were used as secondary antibodies. Blots were imaged using a UVP ChemStudio instrument (Analytik Jena, Beverly, MA, USA). The quantification of protein levels was normalized to β-actin. Uncropped blots are shown in  Supplementary Fig. 1 Statistical analysis Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism software version 10.3.0.
