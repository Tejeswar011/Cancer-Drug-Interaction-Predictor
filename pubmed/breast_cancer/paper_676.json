Reconstructive options in resource-constrained environments are curtailed by both equipment and skilled manpower, necessitating avoidance of resource-intensive techniques. Thoracoepigastric flap (TEF) reconstructions of the forearm, wrist, and hand are simple to perform, provide a sizeable versatile integument cover, and avoid the hygiene and edema complications associated with classic groin flaps in these settings. Methods: Patients receiving upper extremity reconstruction with TEFs after upper extremity trauma by a single surgeon at our resource-limited tertiary care center were analyzed retrospectively. Patient demographics, mechanism of injury, surgical indication, and postoperative complications were collected. Results: Between 2011 and 2024, 42 patients, with a mean age of 31 years, underwent TEF reconstruction of upper extremity soft-tissue defects. Most patients in our cohort who had extensive soft tissue loss on an average had 5.3 visits to the operating theater and an average length of stay of 23 days. Defect and flap sizes were not uniformly available from patient charts and were therefore not analyzed. The commonest complication was flap tip necrosis requiring skin grafts in 2 patients. Conclusions: When raised as double flaps, TEFs are particularly advantageous in low- and middle-income countries because they do not require microsurgical skill, provide extensive coverage for large trauma-related defects, and offer a reliable option for limb reconstruction, especially in settings where follow-up care may be uncertain. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes OPEN-ACCESS TRUE COUNTRY UNITED STATES Takeaways Question: Findings: Meaning: INTRODUCTION The upper limbs are among the most injured anatomical regions of the body. 1 3 4 5 1 6 7 Although a variety of techniques may be used to manage upper extremity soft-tissue defects when local or regional flaps are available, distant flaps are often the only options when local and regional flaps are unavailable, as in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Free tissue transfer, although increasingly available even in sub-Saharan Africa, 8 9 10 10 12 13 14 15 16 18 16 18 19 20 15 14 15 21 22 23 Most upper limb defects resulting from high-energy trauma frequently have attendant skeletal injury, which necessitates urgent soft-tissue coverage to permit skeletal stabilization (as bone is often exposed), either concurrently or sequentially, and adequate soft tissue is a prerequisite for skeletal stabilization. 14 24 METHODS Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the AIC Kijabe Hospital Ethics Committee (KH/ISERC/02718/0028/2024). We reviewed the hospital records of patients in whom a TEF was performed, as described, to provide soft-tissue cover for upper extremity injuries between 2011 and 2024. The procedures were completed under the supervision of author P.N., Tang and Giddins experience level 5. Data on patient demographics, mechanism of injury, surgical indications, and postoperative complications were collected. Given the limitations of the data collection, a descriptive analysis was performed. Categorical data were analyzed using the chi-squar test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. The threshold for statistical significance was a P Surgical Technique Under general anesthesia, a shoulder roll and head ring were placed under the patient. The anterior abdominal wall and injured extremity were prepared and draped, ensuring that the mid-axillary lines on both sides of the patient were within the surgical field (Fig. 1 Fig. 1. Illustration of TEF protocol at an LMIC. Although inpatient, the team partners closely with on-staff physical and occupational therapists dedicated to flap patients to ensure appropriate movement of digits and unaffected joints while minimizing force applied to the flap and recipient site, as secondary mobility disorders have been frequently observed in this cohort. At 3 weeks, the patient was returned to the operating room, and the flaps were divided and inset. Subsequent tendon, nerve, bony, or joint reconstruction can be performed as desired after a minimum of 3–6 months (Fig. 1 The patient and primary caregiver (usually a parent of spouse) are taught wound care, and when they demonstrate that they can comfortably perform dressing changes, they are discharged home. Patients or their relatives who are uncomfortable performing dressing changes are requested to identify a healthcare facility near their home or to stay in one of the guesthouses near the hospital, so as to continue accessing wound care. RESULTS A total of 42 patients with a mean age of 31 years underwent TEF reconstruction of upper extremity soft-tissue defects at Kijabe Hospital between 2011 and 2024. The main indication for TEF reconstruction is soft-tissue coverage over exposed bones, joints, tendons, or neurovascular bundles. One patient required a TEF to cover an extensive defect after wide excision of Marjolin ulcer of the forearm with negative margins (Table 1 2 4 Table 1.

Two TEFs were pre-expanded in patients with postburn and snakebite contractures (Fig. 3 4 The follow-up period ranged from 3 to 10 years. Patients with follow-up periods beyond 6 months had sustained complex injuries requiring additional procedures to improve function (Fig. 3 DISCUSSION We evaluated the feasibility and outcomes of using TEFs for upper limb reconstruction at our center. Forty-five TEFs were successfully performed in 42 patients to reconstruct upper extremity soft-tissue defects resulting from a variety of causes, with just 1 type of complication with a ratio less than 5%. Our observations reestablish the TEF as a beneficial option for upper extremity injuries caused by a wide range of etiologies. We recognize that surgeon experience may affect surgical outcomes independent of environmental and or socioeconomic factors; the procedures were all completed by the same surgeon, with Tang and Giddins surgical experience level 5. In theory, this self-reported metric eliminates the surgeon’s inexperience as a confounding factor in the outcomes observed in this cohort. Additionally, we investigated other potential confounding factors, such as mechanism of injury and/or subcultural trends in pain reporting, that may have contributed to our observations. Nonburn trauma (road traffic and occupational) was the major cause (84%) in male patients compared with 47% in female patients ( P P 25 7 26 Although the TEF is well described in postmastectomy breast reconstruction, it may also be used for limb reconstruction following major traumatic injury or amputation as an alternative to the groin flap. 27 28 19 29 30 31 The main disadvantage of using the TEF is the need for a minimum of 2 procedures in the operating room; nevertheless, the ease of flap dissection and in-setting, as well as the rapidity with which the flap is divided at the second stage, makes the shortness of these procedures efficient and, likely, cost-effective. 3 CONCLUSIONS The upper limb is essential for one’s activities of daily living. Conditions that reduce or eliminate upper extremity function curtail the quality of life of the individual living in a resource-limited environment. Timely restoration of upper limb function is of utmost importance to the patient and family, as this helps eliminate the resultant social and financial burdens, especially considering the young, economically productive people who become overnight dependents, with devastating consequences. 7 26 3 Therefore, TEFs are widely used for upper extremity injuries and are particularly advantageous in resource-limited settings. They require no microsurgical expertise, are easy to dissect, and provide extensive coverage when raised as double flaps. Study Limitations We report our case series from a single, rural, resource-limited, tertiary center. Although our center uses local flaps as the first option for upper extremity soft-tissue reconstruction, there is no clear algorithm for using TEFs. The primary goal of upper extremity reconstruction is to regain function; however, our study did not provide adequate data (ie, exact operation duration, healing time, and some postoperative outcomes) to report functional outcome data. Future studies at this center observing these and other important outcome factors may further support our current findings.
