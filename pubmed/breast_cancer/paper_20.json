Materials and Methods: A review of published literature up to December 31, 2024 was performed through a search in Embase and PubMed databases. The analysis focused on current safety concerns associated with gadolinium-based contrast agents, the hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), gadolinium accumulation, and symptoms associated with gadolinium exposure. Results: A total of 62 publications reporting safety results for gadoterate meglumine were included. Age ranged from a few weeks to 103 years, including patients with all stages of renal impairment. The incidence of HSRs was reported in 17 studies and ranged from <0.01% to 0.58%. Occurrence of NSF was analyzed in 9 studies; to date, no confirmed unconfounded case of NSF diagnosis has been associated with gadoterate meglumine use. Regarding gadolinium presence in the body, 17 studies did not show any significant signal intensity increase in the deep brain in patients after up to 53 exposures, while 4 showed some signal intensity increase in specific subgroups after repeated exposure, but without any clinical symptoms. Symptoms associated with gadolinium exposure have been described in 8 studies, although no causal relationship with gadolinium deposition was established. Safety data obtained from pharmacovigilance monitoring showed an incidence of adverse reactions in 8 cases per 100,000 patients exposed. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were urticaria, nausea, and vomiting (0.001% each), while the incidence of HSRs was less than 0.00035%. No unconfounded NSF reports were received. Conclusions: Clinical evidence from the published data and pharmacovigilance monitoring demonstrated that gadoterate meglumine is a safe magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent for all age groups in a variety of approved indications throughout the whole body, including in patients with renal impairment.

These agents are classified based on their molecular structure as linear or macrocyclic. The macrocyclic GBCAs are more stable and have a lower risk of releasing free gadolinium ions. 1 Gadoterate meglumine (or gadoteric acid, Dotarem, Magnescope in Japan) was developed by Guerbet (Roissy CdG, France) in the 1980s. It is composed of gadolinium in complex with DOTA (tetraxetan) and meglumine salts, which makes it the only ionic, macrocyclic and highly stable GBCA. It was first approved in France in March 1989. Gadoterate meglumine is now approved in more than 80 countries worldwide (including Europe and USA) for various indications (MRI of central nervous system [CNS] body and MRA). The recommended dose for gadoterate meglumine is 0.1 mmol/kg (0.2 mL/kg) by intravenous (IV) administration, in MRI of CNS and body in adults as well as in pediatric patients (from neonates to 17 years old), and for MRA indications in adults. Data from the IQVIA-MIDAS database (2008–2022) show that gadoterate meglumine is one of the most frequently used GBCAs worldwide and the first in Europe (49% of GBCA uses). 2 GBCAs in general have shown an excellent safety profile and favorable benefit/risk ratio with a low incidence of mild adverse events, rare cases of severe hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs), and infrequent episodes of neurotoxic reactions. Nausea is reported in approximately 1.5% of patients, hives in 0.2%, and severe reactions in less than 0.001%. 3 Immediate HSRs are rare but potentially harmful events may occur leading to death. These events include nonallergic and allergic reactions and manifest by cutaneous and/or mucosal signs such as generalized erythema, extended urticaria, angioedema (grade 1), mild cardiovascular (tachycardia, hypotension) and/or mild respiratory signs (coughing, dyspnea), with or without cutaneous or gastrointestinal signs (severe nausea, vomiting or diarrhea) (grade 2), cardiovascular collapse, possibly associated with bronchoconstriction (grade 3), or cardiac arrest (grade 4). 4 5 5 Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) is another rare but life-threatening condition, which has been related to the use of some GBCAs, especially in patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease. Initially described as nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy 6 7 8 8 10 More recently, gadolinium has been shown to be retained, in a dose-dependent manner, in the brain, independently of the renal function. 11 12 13 11 14 16 17 18 19 Gadolinium deposition disease (GDD) is a recently emerging clinical entity, proposed by Semelka and colleagues as a possible disease process due to gadolinium toxicity, manifesting in most cases by pain (including bone pain) and skin changes in subjects with normal renal function. 20 21 22 The aim of this literature review was to provide an overview of the clinical safety of gadoterate meglumine over 35 years of use worldwide, primarily focusing on published data, assessing the incidence of HSRs, NSF, and gadolinium deposition. MATERIAL AND METHODS A systematic literature search for clinical articles in English was performed in Embase and PubMed via Medline, up to December 31, 2024, by an expert librarian with over 35 years of experience. The search terms used included Dotarem OR gadoteric acid OR gadoterate meglumine AND ‘contrast medium’ OR ‘gadolinium’ OR ‘safety’ OR ‘tolerability’ OR (adverse NEAR/1 (event* OR reaction* OR effect*)) OR ‘drug reaction’ OR (gadolinium NEAR/1 (deposition OR retention)) OR ‘signal intensity’ OR ‘dentate nucleus’ OR ‘anaphylaxis’ OR ‘allergy’ OR ‘hypersensitivity’ OR nephropat* OR ‘nephrogenic systemic fibrosis’ OR nephrogen*. The selection process is depicted in Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Articles selection flow chart. Gd, gadolinium; GDD, gadolinium deposition disease; HSR, hypersensitivity reaction; NSF, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis; SAGE, symptoms associated with gadolinium exposure. In addition, all safety data on adverse events reported by health care professionals, health authorities, and in the literature were compiled by the Guerbet pharmacovigilance department. RESULTS The literature search identified 62 articles reporting safety data from clinical studies related to IV administration of gadoterate meglumine, which provided data on the general safety of gadoterate meglumine and/or specific results on HSRs (n = 17), NSF (n = 9), or gadolinium deposition (n = 27). The studies were conducted in adult and pediatric population. The patients' age ranged from a few weeks to 103 years. The clinical development program of gadoterate meglumine consisted of more than 50 studies, from phase I to phase IV, assessing the pharmacokinetics, efficacy and/or safety of gadoterate meglumine in a total of 3491 subjects, including pediatric patients and patients with renal impairment. 23 25 23 26 33 1 TABLE 1 Postmarket Surveillance Studies of Gadoterate Meglumine Publication Study Years Location N Patients Age Range (Years) Main Indications Patients With ADRs (%) Patients With Serious ADRs (%) Neiss AC 1991 23 1988–1989 France, Belgium, Switzerland 4169 0–89 CNS, body 35 (0.84%) 0 Briand Y 1992 23 NR France 402 0–17 CNS, MSK 1 (0.25%) 0 Ishiguchi T 2010 26 2001–2005 Japan 3444 Children to elderly CNS, body 32 (0.93%) 0 Emond S 2011 27 2008–2009 France 104 3 days–18 months CNS 0 0 Herbon CU 2007 28 2004–2005 Germany 24308 0–103 CNS, MSK, body 94 (0.39%) 1 (0.004%) Korean Study 2012 23 2011–2012 Korea 1862 0.4–89 CNS, MSK, body, MRA 0 0 Seithe T 2016 29 2012–2013 Germany 1537 16–88 Breast MRI 5 (0.33%) 1 (0.065%) Soyer P 2017 30 2008–2013 International* 35,499 0–98 CNS, body, MSK, MRA 32 (0.09%) 3 (0.008%) Braun J 2020 32 2004–2013 Multicenter Germany† 148,489 0.1–98 CNS, MSK, body, MRA 362 (0.24%) 13 (<0.1%) McWilliams RG 2020 33 2011–2017 International‡ 539 21–95 CNS, MRA, body 0 0 Total/Range 220,353 0–103 561 (0.25%) 18 (0.008%) *Soyer 2017: Argentina, Austria, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Spain, and United Kingdom. †Braun J 2020: pooled results of 2 consecutive PMS.

The incidence is therefore estimated to be 17 adverse reactions in 8 cases per 100,000 patients exposed. Among these reported cases, serious ADRs had an incidence of 6 reactions per 100,000 patients exposed.

The same patient might have experienced multiple ADRs. *Defined as the number of reported ADRs divided by the estimated number of exposed subjects/patients. ADR, adverse drug reaction; SOC, system organ class. Moreover, HSRs, including anaphylactic reaction/shock, were reported with an incidence less than 0.00035% of patients and consisted of symptoms manifesting in skin, cardiovascular system, and respiratory tract. Rare cases of life-threatening or fatal shock were also reported, which are known to occur with all GBCAs. Serious ADRs were very rare. Regarding NSF, among the 63 reports received by Guerbet, an administration of gadoterate meglumine was specifically mentioned in less than half of the cases (30 out of 63). In the remaining cases, it was not known, which GBCA was used. Among the 30 reports mentioning the use of gadoterate meglumine, the diagnosis of NSF was confirmed in only 7 cases, all being multiple-agent reports. The diagnosis was doubtful in the remaining 23 cases (including 5 single agent reports), either due to missing information so that the Girardi score 58 DISCUSSION Gadoterate meglumine has been used in clinical practice for over 35 years, with over 170 million doses administered. In a previous publication, the accumulated safety data from 50 clinical studies (phase I–IV), 8 PMS studies and postmarketing pharmacovigilance monitoring of over 8000 adverse events reported to Guerbet were comprehensively discussed. 23 Data from the 10 PMS studies included patients of all age groups from neonates to elderly subjects and confirmed the good safety profile of gadoterate meglumine in clinical practice for MRI of the CNS and other body regions and for MRA examinations, with an ADR rate of 0.25% and serious ADR rate of 0.008%. 23 26 33 Regarding the HSRs, in the published literature, after a total of 437,369 administrations, the reported incidence of reactions ranged from 0% to 0.58%. Although contrast media are considered to be the main culprits in the advent of an HSR, other factors may be involved in the causality of such reactions. In the SECURE PMS study, 6 out of the 10 patients with HSRs had preexisting allergies or previous reaction to contrast media. 30 32 32 36 88 89 90 Regarding NSF, among the 9 studies, only 1 NSF report was considered to be associated with gadoterate meglumine. 53 58 7 91 92 93 8 9 10 7 Regarding gadolinium deposition, among the 21 studies assessing gadolinium retention in the brain, only 4 studies showed signs of visible hyperintensities after gadoterate meglumine injection. 48 66 75 77 66 94 62 95 61 65 67 75 Among other studies, 2 reported a significant increase in the SI in the brain of pediatric patients. 48 77 96 77 97 48 Overall, the safety of gadoterate meglumine was confirmed and there was little evidence of gadolinium brain deposition associated with gadoterate meglumine use even after repeated administrations in adults (up to 52) or in children (up to 23). Finally, various studies explored the incidence of GDD or SAGE with gadoterate meglumine; however, a causal relationship with the symptoms could not be established as these studies were either surveys, had very small sample size, or involved spontaneously reported events. It is important to highlight that GDD presumes a causal relationship between gadolinium deposition-associated symptoms and GBCAs; however, this phenomenon is not proven through robust scientific research, as acknowledged by the American College of Radiology. 22 22 85 98 99 Regarding the data reported to Guerbet pharmacovigilance database, approximately 25,000 adverse events were received, which occurred in over 11,000 patients, yielding a cumulative ADRs reporting rate of 0.017% (8 cases per 100,000 patients). This was not significantly different from a previous publication reporting pharmacovigilance data from over 50 million administrations of gadoterate meglumine. 23 58 LIMITATIONS The main limitation of this study is the fact that safety outcomes were not collected the same way in all included studies and over different time periods, which may have led to underestimation of some symptoms. In addition, some studies analyzing the safety of GBCAs reported limited unconfounded data for gadoterate meglumine. CONCLUSIONS More than 170 million administrations of gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem) have been performed for MRI examinations of CNS and other body regions as well as MRA. Gadoterate meglumine has proven diagnostic efficacy and very low incidence of adverse events, including HSRs. To date, no confirmed unconfounded case of NSF has been associated with gadoterate meglumine. Few reports of hyperintensities in the brain have been published, albeit with no confirmed clinical symptoms. Overall, clinical data from literature and safety data from pharmacovigilance monitoring confirmed the favorable benefit/risk profile of gadoterate meglumine in adults and children, including patients with impaired renal function.
