The only known treatment for CD is adherence to a gluten-free diet. Gluten has been found to exert deleterious immune-inflammatory effects beyond the small bowel, involving several genetic, cellular, and paracellular mechanisms in the context of chronic inflammation, leading to colorectal carcinoma (CRC) in CD patients. Several neoplasms, including adenocarcinoma and lymphoma, are associated with CD. Despite strong evidence of an association between CD and small intestinal malignancies, CRC is less common and underdiagnosed in patients with CD. In practice, most CD patients are only monitored for small bowel complications despite mild lower gastrointestinal symptoms; thus, colonoscopy is underused, with a greater focus on upper endoscopy and small bowel biopsy, a major hindrance in early diagnosis. Delayed diagnosis and poor prognosis have also been linked to nonspecific symptoms and late presentations. The lack of screening guidelines appears to be a critical gap due to disconnection between CD and heterogeneous expression of the disease complications add further diagnostic delay. AIM To critically evaluate and synthesize existing evidence on the association between CD and CRC to encourage early-stage detection through lower gastrointestinal screening in CD patients and suggest individual-specific management strategies. METHODS The Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases were searched via RESULTS A total of 3028 citations related to CD and neoplasia were initially identified. Following a critical review and exclusions, 136 citations were suitable for inclusion in this study. Despite its low incidence, a clinically significant association was found between CRC and CD that could impact the overall patient survival rate, suggesting early screening investigations, individual-specific interventions, and further longitudinal studies. CONCLUSION A low incidence of colon lymphoma and adenocarcinoma has been revealed. The clinical presentation of colon lymphoma and adenocarcinoma is indolent and nonspecific, with late presentation in the form of adhesions and perforation. A modest but statistically significant increase in CRC risk among CD patients was noted. Several overlapping factors, including individual variability, genetic and environmental factors, diagnostic delays and duration of gluten exposure, compliance with a gluten-free diet, lack of educational awareness, and complex immune-inflammatory interactions, were found to contribute to the overall incidence of CRC in CD patients. However, the true incidence may be underestimated due to the iceberg phenomenon, where limited clinical suspicion, poor screening, and underreporting may mask the underlying burden. This study highlights the need for increased clinical awareness and early screening, especially in noncompliant patients.

Small bowel neoplasia is thought to be the prevailing pathology and includes adenocarcinoma and lymphoma (due to chronic intestinal inflammation) in addition to carcinoids and leiomyosarcoma[ 5 6 7 8 8 9 MATERIALS AND METHODS The Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases were searched via RESULTS A total of 3028 citations related to CD and neoplasia were initially identified. Following a critical review and exclusions, 136 citations were suitable for inclusion in this study (Figure 1 Figure 1 The PRISMA flow diagram of this study. DISCUSSION Intestinal protective factors Within the dynamic milieu of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), several key factors operate in concert to maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier during periods of chronic inflammation. These factors include cytoskeletal proteins[ 10 11 12 13 14 1 Table 1 Protective factors within the intestinal barrier  Factor  Type  Role in barrier protection  Notes  Ref. KIF Cytoskeletal protein Maintains cytoskeletal structures. Keratin 7 and 20 upregulation leads to crypt widening, while keratin 8 downregulation is observed during inflammation KIFs are influenced by stress and inflammation. Types 1 (acidic) and 2 (basic) are noted Helenius et al 10 Paneth cell granules Cellular component Synthesizes and releases antimicrobial peptides to maintain the microbial barrier Low zinc concentration is associated with granule depletion Kelly et al 11 Microbiome environment Microbial component Influences the risk of certain diseases, including celiac disease; enteroviral infections are linked to increased disease risk The intestinal microbiome’s composition and health have systemic effects Clinton et al 12 γδ T cells Immune cells Reside in the intestinal wall; overactivation and control by IL-15 are crucial for gut homeostasis Elevated IL-15 expression disrupts gut hemostasis Suzuki et al 13 IEL Immune cells γ/δ CD3+ and CD8+ IELs are increased in the duodenum of celiac patients, indicating a protective or reactive role The distribution of IELs varies between the duodenum and colon in celiac patients [ 14 KIF: Keratin intermediate filament; IEL: Intraepithelial lymphocytes; IL: Interleukin. Gluten effects on the bowel Gliadin peptides exert systemic and local effects. Among those that affect the bowel wall are the induction of oxidative stress, the disruption of the intestinal barrier, and damage to the intestinal mucosa[ 15 2 2 Figure 2  Immunopathogenesis of celiac disease upon exposure to gluten. Glutathione enzymes (glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase, and reduced glutathione peroxidase) that combat reactive oxygen species (ROS) markedly decreased after treatment with gliadin peptides[ 16 17 18 Effects of a long-term GFD on colorectal neoplasia Compared with data on outcomes in other malignancies, such as lymphoma, little is known about the outcomes of patients with colorectal cancer and strict adherence to a GFD. Available evidence is limited by differing methods of assessment of adherence and inherent recall bias within the studies reviewed. Additionally, factors such as inability to reverse prior gluten exposure during study assessment, inability to comply strictly with a GFD and the absence of a noninvasive assessment method for a GFD are factors used to assess long-term effects decisively[ 19 20 8 20 21 et al 22 et al 22 et al 23 et al 24 ONCOGENIC PATHWAYS IN CD The influence of gluten exposure is discussed in a multilayered classification to understand the toxic effects of gluten that target several body compositions based on observations at de novo and cell culture levels, starting from the gene level to the organ level. Gene level At the gene level, hypermethylation induces high-frequency microsatellite instability (MSI) and deficient mismatch repair (MMR), as shown by the loss of expression of the repair genes human mutL homolog 1 ( MLH1 25 26 27 20 Molecular level Although the significant risk of CRC in patients with CD has been explored, the countera-association, i.e. Several complex and integrated mechanisms have been described to explain the association between CD and CRC at the molecular level. CD results in the overexpression of interleukin-15 (IL-15) in intestinal epithelial cells, which then activates the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/5 and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathways, leading to the overexpression of BCL-2 and the survival of genetically damaged epithelial cells, thus promoting tumorigenesis[ 28 29 30 Studies have shown that chronic epithelial turnover and chronic inflammation in CD may promote Wnt pathway dysregulation, which is central to CRC tumorigenesis, leading to beta-catenin accumulation and unchecked proliferation[ 31 32 Cell level At the cell level, activated lymphocytes lead to respiratory bursts and the release of ROS, affecting the prooxidant-antioxidant balance. There is evidence to suggest that gliadin has a direct effect on cytoplasmic mitochondria, when mitochondria are disrupted and cell viability is reduced, as observed in Caco cell lines exposed to gliadin, increased mitochondrial biogenesis and a reduced mitochondrial antioxidant response occur. Gliadin peptide-driven dendritic cells (ijCD80/83/83/HLA-DR) via 33 34 35 These proinflammatory cytokines alter the TME, promoting the maturation of antigen-presenting cells (enhancing the T helper 1 cells response), supporting CD8+ cell cytotoxic activity, and interferon secretion, creating a cytokine-rich environment that can promote antitumor immune surveillance and may cause immunosuppression in the long-term[ 36 37 38 21 39 40 Interestingly, the properties of gluten change in response to chemical and enzymatic activities. In the non-heat-treated state, acid undergoes deamidation at a temperature of (90 °C) for 3 hours and renders more soluble and less immunoreactive in human colon LoVo cell lines than under the conditions of enzymatic changes in response to microbial transglutaminase, which leads to increased gluten immunoreactivity[ 41 Treatment of experimental cell lines with gluten-specific immunodominant peptides (p56-88 and p57-68) results in reduced cell growth and inhibition of tissue transglutaminase (tTG). This effect was abolished by the addition of antibodies against tTG to CaCo2 cells. No inhibitory effect on cell growth or tTG activity was observed with the addition of the deamidated peptide p57-68 (E65). In contrast, inhibition persists with the other peptide, p69-82 (formerly nontoxic), which is produced through the substitution of glutamine 72 with glutamic acid[ 22 42 Altered angiogenesis is a factor that is involved in tumorigenesis in CD, in which a regulatory single-nucleotide polymorphism in TNF-superfamily13 (rs11552708) is associated with CD. The expression of proangiogenic factors (G protein subunit alpha 13, TGF-α, v-erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2, and soluble guanylyl cyclase 2 is downregulated, while the expression of transglutaminase 2 and promyelocytic leukemia protein is upregulated, and the tTG antigen was shown to increase transglutaminase 2 expression[ 23 43 23 44 Tissue level At the paracellular level, gliadin alters the expression of tight junction components (actin, zonula occludens-1, and occludin), as demonstrated in a 3-dimensional LoVo cell culture system, after treatment with enzymatically digested gliadin[ 45 46 25 26 Role of the microbiota in the intestine Microbiota consists of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that interact in a state of symbiosis, maintain bowel barrier integrity, and serve as a defense mechanism. Several health disorders have recently been attributed to dysregulation of microbiota fingerprints in the gut that surprisingly affect gut health and several other organ systems[ 47 20 48 49 50 51 To understand the relationship between colon cancer, the microbiota and ILCs, which increase the release of inflammatory mediators from ILCs, constitute a unique family of innate immune cells, including natural killer cells, which differentiate from the bone marrow. IL-22 secreted by ILC-3 cells plays a role in controlling epithelial cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. Intestinal dysbiosis leads to the release of IL-22 and IL-17 from ILC-3 cells, and the proportion of ILC-3s significantly decreases in colon cancer with increasing inflammatory activity of T helper 17 cells in the intestine. Notably, ILC-3s express the antigen-presenting factor MHC-II, which halts intestinal inflammation by limiting the activity of microbiota-specific T helper 17 cells in an MHC-II-dependent manner[ 52 Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Epsilonproteobacteria Proteobacteria, via Bacteroides fragilis 53 54 55 56 Organ level Gluten has been shown to exert several effects on various organs. Gluten challenge increases humoral and cellular responses, with increasing numbers of CD3+ and CD25+ cells, and the mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-1β and the C-C chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 significantly increase as early as 2 hours following challenge; however, the levels of tumor necrosis factors (TNF-α and β1) remain unchanged[ 57 58 et al 59 CD association with microscopic colitis Chronic inflammation of the colon in patients with CD is traditionally associated with microscopic colitis (lymphocytic colitis (20%-27%) and microscopic gastritis)[ 60 63 64 65 66 Neoplasia and CD CD is associated with an increased risk of various neoplastic conditions, including EATL and colorectal cancer[ 60 62 Chronic inflammation and carcinogenesis Chronic inflammation in patients with CD can induce carcinogenesis via 65 67 e.g. i.e. 68 71 In contrast, other studies suggest that chronic antigen exposure and exhausted CD8+ IELs may lead to immune escape mechanisms, allowing tumor growth despite active immunity, and persistent IL-15 signaling has been linked with the downregulation of MHC1, leading to poor immune anticancer surveillance[ 72 73 i.e. 74 75 65 EATL and genetic factors EATL originates from α/β rather than γ/δ T cells, which express TCRs, as well as common neoplastic cells, which are CD3+, CD4, CD8-, and CD103-[ 59 76 77 78 A common signature observed for a monoclonal phenotypically abnormal IEL population exists in reticulum cell sarcoma along the GIT in the stomach, duodenum, jejunum, and colon. This group of RCD patients has a greater number of IELs with CD3+CD8- cells than CD patients do, regardless of whether they are GFD adherent or nonadherent; these independent findings were attributed to infiltration by circulating T cells but supported by TCR-γ clonality and histological findings[ 64 79 80 81 82 Risk and prognosis Conflicting risk exists regarding the risk of colorectal cancer and CD. Long-term follow-up studies have revealed an association between CD and Hodgkin lymphoma risk [risk ratio (RR) = 6.9] over 11.2 years of follow-up; for patients with colon cancer, the adjusted RR was 1.23 ( P P 83 84 et al 27 85 Individualized risk assessment HLA-DQ2/DQ8 are essential for CD diagnosis when ambiguity exists in clinical and histopathological findings. Although they have insignificant predictive value for colon cancer risk alone, studies suggest that chronic immune activation in genetically predisposed individuals may contribute to chronic inflammation (mucosal injury), adding to a tumor-promoting microenvironment[ 86 e.g. 87 88 89 Although not specifically linked to CD, genetic and environmental risk assessment in combination with genetic polymorphisms and biochemical markers (folate levels) enhances CRC risk in the general population, which mandates earlier colonoscopy, lifestyle interventions, and targeted surveillance[ 90 91 IMMUNOPHENOTYPING AND THE PREDICTION OF PROGNOSIS IN CD It is used to study pathological masses of suspected neoplasms in CD patients and to characterize types of lymphoma with certain characteristic immunophenotypes that are associated with patient outcome. Considering RCD is a potential stage of disease where neoplastic complications may develop, understanding these types of lymphoma and their immunophenotypes would help to predict those patients with CD disease who develop neoplastic complications. Common types of lymphoma in CD with reported involvement of the colon are Burkitt lymphoma, which expresses CD19, CD2, and CD10 and is B cell lymphoma 6 or BCL-6 positive, and follicular lymphoma, which accounts for less than 7% of gastrointestinal-related lymphomas, with rare involvement of the colon and BCL-2 and CD20 positivity. EATL or mature T-cell lymphoma, natural killer/T-cell lymphoma with rare involvement of the colon, is characterized by CD3, CD7, and CD103 positivity, in addition to variable reactivity to CD8, CD30 and TCR-β. Specifically, EATL-II expresses CD8+, CD3+, and TCR-β, and the co-expression of CD56 positivity. However, information regarding the prognostic nature of these types of lesions requires invasive biopsy. Combination of clinical parameters and biopsies could be a promising tool to predict the nature of prognosis in patients with RCD. The use of information from patients with RCD and symptoms of malabsorption and findings of anemia (low serum iron, B12 and folate), low electrolytes (Na, K, Cl, and zinc), elevated international normalized ratio and hypoalbuminemia applied in a structured malabsorption score (ranging from 0-8) with a cutoff of ≥ 3 is useful for identifying high-risk patients with RCD who would benefit from further evaluation to identify occult neoplasms, especially lymphoma. Colorectal cancer is a rare neoplasm in patients with RCD for which there is no available literature to investigate and link immunophenotyping to RCD patients. Colonic lymphoma and CD The development of lymphoma in CD patients is a significant milestone complication of the disease secondary to the chronic immune-inflammatory response in GIT. Ancient studies of malignancy and CD in 1974 described lymphoma as reticular cell sarcoma of the GIT, mostly in the stomach, small intestine, and lymph nodes[ 92 93 94 95 EATL and CD share similar IEL haplotypes, clinical presentations, and histological findings[ 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 The described pathologies have different types of presentations of solitary or multiple lymphomas, such as non-B, non-T lymphoma[ 94 103 104 97 105 Colorectal adenocarcinoma and CD The importance of colorectal adenoma and adenocarcinoma in patients with CD is of interest for further advancements in screening strategies for CD patients at risk of malignancy[ 61 2 3 Table 2 Studies showing the association between celiac disease and colorectal adenoma  Ref.

Our suggested approaches for the management of neoplasia in CD patients are as follows.  Initial clinical evaluation: via 120  Diagnostic investigations: 121 121  Gastrointestinal evaluation: 63 121 123 124  Radiological findings: 125 127 128 130  Genetic testing and biomarkers: via 131 132 i.e. SEPT9 VIM 133 SEPT9 VIM 133 SDC2 SEPT9 VIM 134  Targeted and immune-based therapies: vs 135 136 Limitations Current knowledge of the incidence and prevalence of colonic neoplasia is based on retrospective studies with limited longitudinal follow-up, mostly involving patients with a duration of follow-up of up to 10 years, and are prone to selection and reporting biases. Since CD is a life-long illness for which management depends on adherence to a GFD, several other key factors also need to be accounted for, including factors that may increase dysplasia in the intestine and demographic and genetic backgrounds that limit the generalization of these recommendations, as most data are derived from Western populations. The underdiagnosis of CD and inconsistent colorectal screening practices may result in underestimation of the incidence of neoplasms. Variations in diagnostic criteria and a lack of detailed molecular profiling in CD-associated colorectal tumors further limit the ability to draw definitive conclusions. Long prospective studies with standardized protocols are needed to clarify the true nature of this association. Future directions Strategies are needed for the early diagnosis and detection of large bowel and small bowel lymphoma in CD patients. High-performance stool tests for detecting neoplasms, including lymphoma and adenocarcinoma, in CD patients also need to be developed. Notably, enrolling CD patients in a regular screening program for intestinal neoplasia via CONCLUSION Accumulating evidence suggests that gluten exposure has a deleterious effect both locally and systemically. The mechanisms of gluten damage to the bowel, including small bowel changes with villous atrophy, have been proven to extend beyond the small bowel and involve genetic, cellular, and paracellular mechanisms. Although colonic lymphoma is rare, it has a poor prognosis because of its late and nonspecific clinical presentation. A GFD is a mandatory management strategy, and evidence shows that strict adherence is a therapeutic and preventative clinical outcome. A search for gastrointestinal lymphoma is warranted in patients with CD with symptoms of abdominal pain, weight loss, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia not otherwise explained.
