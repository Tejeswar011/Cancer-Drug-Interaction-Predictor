Introduction Allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF1) is a calcium-binding scaffold/adaptor protein commonly associated with inflammatory conditions first identified in activated macrophages of humans and rats [ 1 2 3 4 The AIF1 gene is in the MHC class III region on human chromosome 6p21.33, located in proximity to key genes involved in immune and inflammatory processes, including TNF-α, TNF-β, and NF-κB [ 5 6 6 7 8 In mammals, AIF1 is expressed in different cell types, including activated macrophages, microglial cells, and dendritic cells, where it plays a critical role in modulating immune responses during inflammation [ 4 9 10 11 10 12 13 14 10 12 15 16 17 14 18 19 20 AIF1 is conserved among metazoans, and AIF1 orthologs have been described in invertebrates, suggesting that vertebrate and invertebrate AIF1 have originated from a common ancestral gene [ 21 22 23 24 AIF1 expression and its link to innate immune response have been documented in hemocytes of several mollusks, including the Pacific oyster Magallana gigas Crassostrea gigas Haliotis discus discus 25 26 M. gigas 25 H. discus discus 26 Pinctada martensii 27 Biomphalaria glabrata 28 21 29 Pomacea canaliculata 30 Hirudo medicinalis 21 21 P. canaliculata 31 30 P. canaliculata 32 33 34 35 Angiostrongylus cantonensis 36 P. canaliculata ex-ovo, 31 37 38 39 40 As for the other invertebrates, P. canaliculata 41 42 30 43 43 44 P. canaliculata Pc Pc 45 Due to the limited information available on the identity of Pc- Pc Pc P. canaliculata Pc 20 46 47 P. canaliculata Ricinus communis Mytilus galloprovincialis 48 49 Pomacea Pc 2.

No RCA120 positivity was found in PK, including in the hemocyte islets ( Figure 5 Like the hemocytes, the blastema of regenerating cephalic tentacles exhibited cells with different levels of RCA120 positivity. Some cells are intensely positive to RCA120 and were localized throughout the amputated cephalic tentacle blastema.

Discussion AIF1 is a highly conserved molecule, present both in vertebrates and invertebrates. It plays a key role in inflammatory, immune, and neuro-immune contexts, and it is produced mainly by microglial and macrophagic cells [ 10 11 Pc P. canaliculata Analysis of available transcriptomic data reveals that Pc Pc P. canaliculata Pc P. canaliculata P. canaliculata 50 26 29 M. gigas H. discus discus, P. martensii 25 26 27 25 In P. canaliculata Pc Pc Figure 6 43 51 Pc P. canaliculata In lophotrochozoans, the constitutive expression of AIF1 was first identified in microglial cells of the medicinal leech, H. medicinalis Hm 21 P. canaliculata Hm 22 26 52 53 H. medicinalis 21 Pc 45 In line with observations on the neural repair of H. medicinalis 24 Pc 31 Pc Pc 30 Pc Pc 30 Pc P. canaliculata Pc H. medicinalis Hm 22 24 Hm 22 23 Pc P. canaliculata M. galloprovincialis 48 49 Figure 5 50 43 Figure 6 Pc Pc- Pc Pc Pc- 54 55 56 57 13 14 58 Pc P. canaliculata 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 Procambarus clarkii 66 67 Drosophila melanogaster 68 Pc 31 Pc Pc Pc 2 3 4 Pc 63 69 70 71 4.

The released hemolymph was gathered into 10 mL tubes kept on ice, with approximately 2 mL obtained from each specimen. For each slide preparation, 250 μL of freshly collected hemolymph was either loaded into a Cytospin II™ (Shandon Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and centrifuged at 400 rpm for 3 min or deposited onto slides to permit cell adhesion for 10 min. The hemocytes were then immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (pFA) in 1× PBS for 3 min at room temperature. Fixation was halted by rinsing the slides in 1× PBS for 5 min before either being processed for FISH or undergoing an immunohistochemistry procedure. For organ dissection, control snails were anesthetized in granular ice for 30 min then PKs, stomach, and both the cerebral ganglia were collected, sacrificing the animals. The left cephalic tentacles were amputated from the animals after they had been anesthetized in granular ice for 30 min. The cephalic tentacles were cut at the base [ 45 Furthermore, pelleted hemocytes (400× g 4.4. RT-PCR, Gel Extraction, and Sequencing Total RNA purification was performed with ReliaPrep™ RNA Miniprep Systems (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol. All RNA samples were then checked for purity and quantified with a NanoDrop™ (ND1000 Spectrophotometer, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Approximately 1 µg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The obtained cDNAs, corresponding to hemocytes, PK, cephalic tentacles (0 and 24 hpa), right and left control ganglia, have been employed as templates (1 μL) in RT-PCR reactions using GoTaq ® ® Pc Table S2 ® Pc-AIF1 Table S2 4.5.

Images from histology and immunohistochemistry were taken with a Nikon Eclipse Ni-E microscope (Leica Microsystems Srl, Milan, Italy) at the National Biodiversity Future Centre (NBFC) of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.
