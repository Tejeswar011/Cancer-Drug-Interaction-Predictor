Introduction Vaccination remains one of the most impactful public health tools for preventing infectious diseases. The first successful vaccine, developed using a live attenuated smallpox virus, demonstrated the ability to confer durable protective immunity. Subsequently, inactivated, live-attenuated, subunit, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines have been used to successfully protect against pathogens that cause significant morbidity and mortality. However, existing vaccines often confer suboptimal protection to high-risk individuals with primary or secondary immune deficiencies and the elderly, while to date, there are no effective vaccines for several pathogens causing significant morbidity and mortality, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and tuberculosis [ 1 2 3 4 5 During the past decade, significant technological advances in diverse scientific disciplines, including genetic engineering, molecular and cellular immunology, structural biology, bioinformatics, computational biology, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology, have been used for the development of next-generation vaccine platforms [ 6 7 These innovative approaches include recombinant viral vectors, virus-like particles (VLPs), messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines, synthetic DNA-based vaccines, bacterial vector systems, and novel adjuvants, and aim to optimize the targeting of specific antigens and improve immune responses to vaccines. At the same time, alternative routes of immunization that could offer needle-free and/or cold-chain-free vaccine delivery are being investigated in order to replace conventional intramuscular and subcutaneous vaccines. The wide use of mRNA vaccines during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has signaled the beginning of a new era of vaccinology, bridging the empirical vaccine development of the past with the rapidly evolving technology of today. In this review, our objective is to summarize the recent advances in antigen delivery platforms, novel vaccine adjuvants, and alternative routes of immunization that are set to pave the way to the next generation of vaccines. A literature search was performed in Medline (PubMed) for English-language articles. No additional inclusion or exclusion criteria were applied. Additional references were obtained by searching citation lists of retrieved articles, and the authors identified further appropriate references for inclusion based on expert knowledge. A systematic search methodology was not used. 2. Biotechnological Advances for Novel Vaccine Platforms 2.1. mRNA Vaccines During the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was estimated to prevent over ten million deaths globally, largely due to the unprecedented speed at which mRNA vaccines were developed [ 8 Despite this success, the widespread use of mRNA vaccines also revealed certain limitations related to immunogenicity and reactogenicity. With respect to immunogenicity, protection was found to wane relatively quickly across all age groups, leading to a reduced duration of immunity. Furthermore, immune responses were markedly diminished in high-risk populations [ 9 10 11 12 13 The safety and reactogenicity profile of the first licensed SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines was initially established in pre-authorization clinical trials. However, large-scale vaccination programs rapidly generated real-world evidence that surpassed the breadth and depth of trial data. National immunization campaigns and independent studies in specific populations and varied vaccination schedules contributed substantially to post-authorization safety monitoring. Overall, these data confirmed a favorable safety profile for mRNA vaccines, while also identifying rare adverse events, such as Bell’s palsy (rare; ≥1/10,000 to <1/1000) and myocarditis/pericarditis (very rare; <1/10,000), occurring predominantly in adolescent and young adult males after the second dose [ 14 15 16 mRNA immune reactivity has been proposed as the most prominent mechanism for systemic adverse reactions and myocarditis post-immunization with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines. It is known that exogenous mRNA is intrinsically immunostimulatory and it is recognized by a variety of cell surface, endosomal, and cytosolic innate immune receptors [ 17 18 In some cases, however, the innate response to mRNA can cause an exacerbated immune response, known as “mRNA immune reactivity,” where DCs and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-expressing cells express cytokines and activation markers that trigger a cascade of hyper-inflammation, causing unfavorable systemic reactions with detrimental effects in different organs, including the myocardium [ 19 20 Importantly, the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 infection remains higher than that observed after vaccination. Given that vaccination prevents substantial morbidity and mortality, the overall benefit–risk balance of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines remains strongly positive [ 18 Looking forward, a deeper understanding of the immunological mechanisms underlying mRNA vaccines, combined with advances in antigen design and delivery systems, is expected to drive the development of next-generation vaccines with broader efficacy. Indeed, mRNA vaccines are currently being explored against a wide range of pathogens, including CMV, RSV, HIV, and influenza [ 21 22 23 To address the limitations of first-generation vaccines, a novel platform based on self-replicating mRNA (srRNA) is under investigation. Unlike conventional mRNA vaccines, which only encode the target antigen (e.g., the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein), srRNA vaccines incorporate additional sequences derived from positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses such as alphaviruses. These sequences enable intracellular RNA replication and amplify antigen expression [ 24 25 26 27 srRNA vaccines offer several potential advantages. Because of their self-amplification, they require substantially lower doses to elicit comparable immune responses, which may reduce RNA-associated reactogenicity. Prolonged antigen expression from smaller initial doses could also enhance the magnitude and durability of protection. Immunostimulatory properties may vary depending on the delivery system, the replication machinery itself, and the encoded antigen. Although the addition of self-replicative elements could raise concerns regarding their safety profile, preclinical safety and biodistribution studies have so far reported no major adverse events, aside from transient fever and localized inflammation. In animal models, the highest srRNA concentrations were found in muscle, lymph nodes, and spleen, and remained detectable for up to 60 days after a single immunization [ 28 29 Overall, srRNA vaccines represent a promising evolution of mRNA technology, combining potent and durable immune responses with reduced RNA doses. Although their clinical development is progressing more slowly than that of conventional mRNA vaccines, multiple preclinical and clinical trials are underway. Notably, two srRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines have recently received approval in India and Japan [ 30 31 2.2. DNA Vaccines DNA vaccines have emerged as a highly promising approach, with potential advantages in terms of stability and ease of manufacturing [ 19 32 33 34 In 1990s, a preclinical study determined that intramuscular plasmid DNA injection could drive antigen expression without specialized delivery systems [ 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 Apart from the immunogenicity limitations, concerns exist regarding potential genomic integration. Although plasmid DNA is circular and administered in small doses, and thus has a very low integration risk, continued monitoring is necessary [ 37 38 39 40 41 The first DNA vaccine to enter a phase I clinical trial was developed against HIV-1 in the late 1990s. While it did not progress to licensure, the trial established proof of concept and alleviated many early safety concerns [ 46 47 48 49 50 51 The broader use of DNA vaccines in the future clinical practice is based on the optimization of plasmid design, delivery methods, and immune adjuvants, to maximize antigen expression and stimulate potent and durable immune responses [ 52 53 2.3. Virus-like Particle (VLP) Vaccines and Synthetic VLP (sVLP) Vaccines Virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines, synthetic VLP and nanoparticle (NP) vaccines have been developed to deliver antigens as purified proteins, but with increased immunogenicity and stability compared to traditional subunit vaccines. Virus-like particles (VLPs) arise from the self-assembly of viral structural proteins, which closely mimic authentic viral particles. VLPs are classified into two main categories: nonenveloped and enveloped. Non-enveloped VLPs do not possess an external lipid membrane, while enveloped VLPs are surrounded by a host-derived lipid bilayer that incorporates viral glycoproteins. Both enveloped and non-enveloped VLPs can be either single or multilayered and may be assembled from a single protein or multiple proteins [ 54 55 56 57 58 VLPs are considered highly immunogenic, as they induce robust cellular and humoral immune responses due to their highly repetitive display of antigenic epitopes. Licensed VLP vaccines include the hepatitis B vaccine (HBV) and the human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), which have been widely used, with proven post-licensure safety and effectiveness. Novel VLP-based vaccines against viruses SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, EBOV, adenovirus-7, HPV, HIV-1, hepatitis B, SARS-CoV, dengue, rabies, rotavirus, norovirus, and malaria have been recently approved or are currently being tested in clinical trials [ 59 2.4. Viral Vector Vaccines Viral vector vaccines (VVVs) are engineered by integrating foreign antigen-encoding sequences, typically immunologically relevant transgenes, into the genome of a virus using recombinant DNA technology. Safety is driven by a variety of attenuation strategies to reduce pathogenicity, including the deletion of virulence genes and the incorporation of conditional replication circuits that only function in specialized cells [ 60 To date, viral vector platforms have been broadly categorized into two main types: replication-competent and replication-deficient vectors. Replication-competent vectors retain the ability to replicate within host cells, thereby amplifying the expression of the transgene and generating infectious progeny. This replication mimics natural infection, often resulting in a robust and durable immune response. Replication-competent vectors include platforms based on adenoviruses, retroviruses, rhabdoviruses, and paramyxoviruses, whereas replication-deficient systems commonly utilize adenoviruses, retroviruses, and adeno-associated viruses. Additionally, single-cycle viral vectors have been developed, particularly from the adenovirus and rhabdovirus backbones, which allow only one replication round in order to optimize the safety profile of candidate vaccines. In contrast, replication-deficient vectors are engineered to deliver a single copy of the transgene without undergoing replication, enhancing their safety profile. These vectors typically rely on exogenous promoters to drive immunogenicity, but may elicit comparatively weaker immune responses, often necessitating the inclusion of adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity [ 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 The large-scale deployment of adenoviral vector-based vaccines during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has catalyzed considerable interest in the platform. However, significant safety signals were raised during post-licensure surveillance because of serious adverse events including thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). These real-world data led to risk–benefit reassessment and change in recommendations in several countries [ 68 69 69 Numerous ongoing clinical trials are currently evaluating recombinant viral vector vaccines for a variety of pathogens, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Chikungunya virus, West Nile virus, Lassa fever virus, Zika virus, and Ebola virus [ 60 2.5. Bacterial Vector Vaccines During the last decade, several scientific efforts have focused on the utilization of both attenuated pathogenic or commensal bacteria in the development of therapeutic and preventive vaccines. For vector engineering using pathogenic bacteria, the principal idea is to harvest their high immunogenicity while impairing their pathogenicity through gene modification or attenuation. For vectors that use commensal bacteria, the aim is to take advantage of their immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory properties [ 70 An example is Listeria monocytogenes used in cancer immunotherapy against melanoma, delivering tumor-associated antigens [ 71 72 Today, several attenuated bacterial species are being extensively investigated as vectors for DNA vaccine delivery, including Yersinia enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Shigella spp. In parallel, nonpathogenic lactic acid bacteria—such as the Lactococcus, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus species—have emerged as attractive alternatives due to their safety profiles and mucosal colonization capabilities. Salmonella has been the most extensively investigated vaccine vector strain due to its immunogenic properties. Attenuated Salmonella vectors stimulate robust immune responses due to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and flagellin and induce a primarily Th1 response that promotes the development of antigen-specific adaptive immunity [ 73 74 Although bacterial vaccines hold significant promise, there are still major concerns about their safety, particularly about the potential for horizontal gene transfer of virulence factors or antibiotic resistance genes [ 75 2.6. Bacteriophage-Based Vaccines Bacteriophage-based vaccines have garnered increasing attention as a versatile platform for antigen delivery and vaccine development, leveraging the inherent properties of bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria, to elicit robust immune responses [ 76 Although, veterinary bacteriophage vaccines have gained more relevance in recent years, several investigational phage-based vaccines have been developed for human applications in both preventive vaccines against infectious diseases such as Dengue fever, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2 [ 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 Although bacteriophages present a promising avenue for vaccine development, challenges remain in terms of characterizing the phages and optimizing their delivery and immunogenicity [ 76 2.7. Multi-Epitope Assembly Polypeptide System (MAPS) The multiple-antigen presenting system (MAPS) is a novel conjugation platform for polysaccharide antigens that aims to overcome the shortcomings of current protein-conjugated polysaccharide vaccines, such as pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). MAPS utilizes the high-affinity biochemical interaction between the biotin and rhizavidin in order to assemble strong multiantigen complexes. This technology offers considerable flexibility, allowing for a precise and interchangeable combination of polysaccharide and protein components. Unlike traditional conjugate vaccines, MAPS constructs incorporate pathogen-specific proteins that could potentially induce broad, multiantigen immune responses. To date, MAPS-based vaccine candidates have undergone extensive preclinical evaluation, and one pneumococcal formulation has advanced to early-phase clinical trials in healthy pediatric and adult populations, including older adults [ 85 86 MAPSs are designed to contain multiple copies of B cell and T cell epitopes, enhancing immunogenicity. Furthermore, MAPS vaccines could be rapidly designed and manufactured, which makes them particularly valuable for addressing emerging infectious diseases and pandemic preparedness [ 86 The constructs of different novel vaccine platforms are summarized in Figure 1 Table 1 3. Biotechnological Advances Towards Needle-Free Vaccine Delivery In parallel with the significant ongoing work on novel vaccine platforms, another important area of investigational vaccinology is on alternative modes of vaccine administration. Traditional intramascular and subcutaneous injections require time off for medical appointments, administration by a trained healthcare professional, and most importantly, are associated with pain and stress for the vaccinees. Therefore, several approaches for needle-free vaccine delivery are underway, including transcutaneous (TCI) and oral or inhaled mucosal vaccines. Transcutaneous immunization could offer needle-free vaccine delivery that deposits the vaccine within the epidermal layer of the skin, with the potential to simplify administration and improve vaccine uptake. Different technologies used in TCI include transdermal electroporation, sonophoresis, microneedle patches, skin radiofrequency/thermal and laser ablation, jet or powder injection, and iontophoresis [ 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 93 Mucosal vaccines, administered via the nasal, oral, or pulmonary routes, for respiratory and gastrointestinal pathogens are another important field of ongoing vaccine research. Similarly to TCI, the induction of an immune response by mucosal vaccines is based on the activation of tissue-resident immune cells that can in turn activate a systemic adaptive immune response to vaccine antigens [ 95 However, development of mucosal vaccines has been significantly slower than that of the traditional injectable vaccines. The major obstacles for the development of effective mucosal vaccines are our gaps of knowledge regarding protective mucosal immunity and the lack of set correlates of protection for mucosal immunity; the susceptibility of unprotected subunit antigens to degradation and clearance, and crucially, a lack of effective mucosal adjuvants [ 95 New mucosal pneumococcal [ 96 97 98 4. Biotechnological Advances for Slow Antigen Delivery Effective vaccine-induced immunity has proved difficult for several rapidly mutating pathogens, including HIV-1. The amount of somatic hypermutation associated with the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV has not been achieved using conventional immunization strategies. An underexplored aspect of vaccine design is modulation of antigen kinetics. Extended antigen delivery through continuous immunization over several days has recently been shown to significantly enhance the immune response to HIV antigens. A slow release immunization over two weeks using nonmechanical osmotic pumps (OPs) and a soluble adjuvant resulted in enhanced BGC and TFH cell responses in mouse models [ 99 100 The potential mechanisms include shifting B cell recognition away from non-neutralizing immunodominant epitopes, altered kinetics of immune complex deposition, improved T follicular helper (Tfh) cell responses, enhanced affinity maturation, and enhanced development of B cell memory. Long-term antigen depots may have broad utility to improve antibody responses to vaccines, offering several advantages over conventional (bolus) immunization strategies [ 100 The development of clinically applicable slow delivery technologies is an active area of research and holds promise for improving vaccine efficacy, especially for challenging targets such as HIV. These technologies could include degradable encapsulating biomaterials and depot-forming adjuvants that slowly release antigens over time, maintaining germinal centers and enhancing B cell maturation [ 101 5. Biotechnological Advances for Novel Vaccine Adjuvants Another key aspect of the engineering of more efficacious vaccines is the design of novel vaccine adjuvants that could multiply the immunogenicity of non-live vaccines [ 102 103 Vaccine adjuvants are important components of a number of ‘traditional’ subunit vaccines in order to achieve optimal immune responses. Although certain novel vaccine platforms are intrinsically immunostimulatory (e.g., mRNA-LNPs and viral vectors), others like DNA vaccines and VLPs require the use of additional adjuvants in order to increase immunogenicity, lower antigen dose, and/or tailor responses for specific high-risk populations [ 103 The adjuvants currently licensed were developed mostly empirically and the design of novel more effective adjuvants is based on increased understanding of innate immunity and antigen-presenting cells and the utilization of biotechnological tools. For several decades, beginning in the 1920s, insoluble aluminum salts were the first and only adjuvants used to improve vaccine efficacy against infectious diseases. Since then, several additional adjuvants have been included in approved vaccines [ 104 105 Research for novel vaccine adjuvants has increasingly been focused on targeting innate immune sensors—particularly Toll-like receptors (TLRs)—to amplify both cellular and humoral responses. Identification and functional characterization of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) have significantly advanced the development of vaccine adjuvants targeting the innate immune system. Several PRR agonists are now licensed for clinical use or in late-stage preclinical development, offering novel tools to improve vaccine immunogenicity, particularly for populations with suboptimal immune responses [ 105 One of the most promising such adjuvants is monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), a detoxified derivative of Salmonella minnesota lipopolysaccharide, and a TLR4 agonist. Unlike native LPS, MPLA retains robust immunostimulatory properties while exhibiting a ~1000-fold reduction in reactogenicity [ 106 107 108 109 Table 2 The main concern regarding novel adjuvant development is the potential associated increased reactogenicity. Current research focusses on immunoengineering, novel delivery system, and systems biology to identify biomarkers of safety and adjuvanticity [ 105 6. Discussion Advances in biotechnology have enabled the development of novel vaccine approaches that leverage a deeper understanding of the pathways and mechanisms of the immune system [ 60 62 The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the clinical deployment of mRNA platforms and catalyzed global investment in adaptable and scalable vaccine technologies. Beyond mRNA, diverse antigen delivery systems are advancing into clinical pipelines, offering novel routes to improve the immune response and induction of immunological memory, promote compliance, and enable personalized vaccination strategies for diverse populations. However, significant challenges remain regarding safety, reactogenicity, and real-world efficacy. For mRNA vaccines, high effectiveness and agility are tempered by waning immunity and reactogenicity; srRNA may address dose and durability of immunity concerns. DNA vaccines offer stability and simple production but require specialized delivery and the addition of adjuvants in order to increase immunogenicity in humans. Viral vectors provide strong immunity but necessitate vigilant safety monitoring and design refinements, as highlighted by rare TTS following adenoviral COVID-19 vaccines. Other novel platforms, such as bacteriophage vaccines, are still in the early stages of clinical implementation into human use. Needle-free routes of immunization promise improved acceptance and herd effects but must overcome significant limitations regarding skin barrier penetration, understanding of the tissue-specific immunity, and appropriate antigen and adjuvant selection for each route of immunization. The development of novel adjuvants guided by systems vaccinology could be key to tailoring responses across the less immunogenic vaccine platforms as well as mucosal and transdermal vaccines. Continued interdisciplinary collaboration, supported by mechanistic insights into host–pathogen interactions and immune modulation, will be essential to realize the full potential of these technologies in difficult-to-target pathogens and global pandemic preparedness. Future vaccines will likely combine multiple innovations in terms of vaccine platform, antigens and adjuvants included, as well as delivery strategies in order to provide robust and long-lived protection with acceptable reactogenicity profiles. Equitable access, scale-up, and global pharmacovigilance will determine the real-world impact of these innovations. 7. Conclusions Biotechnological innovations in vaccine platforms, adjuvants, and delivery routes are transforming the landscape of immunization, offering opportunities for more durable, broad, and accessible protection. Future vaccines could utilize several of these advances to achieve safe, long-lasting immunity and improved preparedness against future epidemics.
