Fatty acid composition is crucial for determining meat quality. Pigeon meat, renowned for its tender texture, high protein content, and abundant polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFAs), yet the developmental dynamics and molecular mechanisms of intramuscular fatty acid deposition remain unclear. Previous studies suggest that lipid metabolism is often governed by coordinated gene expression programs. Therefore, we hypothesized that fatty acid profiles in pigeon muscle are regulated by gene co-expression modules identifiable via weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). To test this, we analyzed pectoral muscles from pigeons at five developmental stages (28 days to 48 months) using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and transcriptomic sequencing. A total of 39 fatty acids were identified, with key PUFAs such as DHA increasing and EPA decreasing over time, while overall MUFAs declined and PUFAs peaked at 6 months, revealing distinct stage-dependent patterns in fatty acid composition. WGCNA revealed that three gene modules (green, yellow, turquoise) were significantly associated with fatty acid traits. GO Enrichment analysis indicated their involvement in ribosome activity, mitochondrial pathways, and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis, while KEGG pathway highlighted oxidative phosphorylation and phosphatidylinositol signaling. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis pinpointed hub genes, including RPS16 NDUFS6, RHOJ NUDT12 Highlights • GC–MS identified 39 fatty acids; PUFA peaked at 6 months with age-dependent shifts. • WGCNA revealed three gene modules linked to fatty acid composition. • Hub genes RPS16 and NDUFS6 connected ribosomal and mitochondrial roles in lipid metabolism.

These tools enable identification of co-expression modules and hub genes associated with fatty acid synthesis, transport, and degradation ( Peter & Steve, 2008 Wang et al., 2022 Xiong & Chen, 2024 Sebastià et al., 2024 Shuzhe et al., 2022 Luo et al., 2022 Therefore, the lack of data on gene regulatory networks governing fatty acid traits in meat pigeons represents a clear knowledge gap. To address this, we employed an integrative approach combining RNA-seq and WGCNA to analyze the transcriptome of pigeon pectoral muscle across five developmental stages, alongside detailed fatty acid profiling using GC–MS/MS. We hypothesize that age-dependent variation in intramuscular fatty acid composition is driven by stage-specific gene co-expression modules, and that identification of key hub genes will provide novel insights into lipid regulation and lay a foundation for molecular breeding aimed at improving meat quality traits. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Ethics statement All experimental procedures were performed in strict accordance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals issued by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of Shanghai Academy of Agricultural Sciences (Approval No.: SAASPZ0522056). 2.2 Meat pigeon rearing and sample collection All meat pigeons used in this study belonged to the commercial strain Shenwang No. 1, n 2.3 Fatty acids metabolite extraction Samples were thawed at 4 °C, and 50 mg of each sample was mixed with 5 mL of cold dichloromethane-methanol (2:1 v Fatty acid quantification was performed using the isotope internal standard method, and calibration curves were generated by serially diluting mixed standard solutions. Each calibration point was processed following the same protocol as test samples. Peak area ratios between analytes and internal standards were used to calculate compound concentrations. 2.4 GC–MS/MS analysis Samples were separated using an Agilent DB-23 GC column (60 m × 250 μm × 0. 15 μm; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) mounted on a 7890B GC System. The temperature program was set as follows: initial temperature of 80 °C held for 1 min, ramped to 180 °C at 20 °C/min, held for 5 min, then ramped to 220 °C at 5 °C/min and held for 8 min, followed by a final ramp to 280 °C at 5 °C/min and held for 3 min. Helium was used as the carrier gas as a constant flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Quality control (QC) samples were included to assess system stability and repeatability. Mass spectrometry analysis was performed using a 5977B MSD mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with following parameters: inlet temperature 280 °C; ion source temperature 230 °C; transfer line temperature 250 °C. The electron impact ionization energy was set to 70 eV. The chromatographic peak areas and retention times were extracted using the MSD ChemStation software. A standard calibration curve was constructed to quantify the content of medium- and long-chain fatty acids in the samples. 2.5 RNA extraction and transcriptome sequencing Total RNA from meat pigeon was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA concentration and purity was assessed by NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and integrity was confirmed using 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis or Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA; RNA 6000 Nano Kit). Samples with RIN ≥ 7.0 were used for library construction. For library preparation 3 μg RNA was used purify polyadenylated mRNA via poly-T magnetic beads, which was fragmented and subjected to the first-strand cDNA synthesis with random hexamers and Super Script II, followed by second-strand synthesis using DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. After end repair, 3′ adenylation, and Illumina PE adapter ligation, fragments (400–500 bp) were size-selected by AMPure XP and amplified via 15-cycle PCR. Purified libraries were quantified on a Bioanalyzer 2100 system and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at Shanghai Personal Biotechnology Cp. Ltd. (Shanghai, China) using paired-end 150 bp reads. On average, each sample generated ∼6.5 Gb of clean reads. 2.6 Quality control and differentially expressed gene analysis Sequencing generated image files were processed by the platform's software to produce raw FASTQ Data. To ensure data quality, sequencing reads were filtered using fastp (v0.22.0) to remove adapters, low-quality sequences (Q < 20), and contaminants, yielding high quality clean data. Quality statistics including Q20, Q30, GC content, and total/clean reads per sample are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Reference genome and annotation files of Columba livia 2 P 2.7 Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) Based on targeted fatty acid profiling of meat pigeon pectoral muscle, the most abundant fatty acids and their contents were selected as phenotypic data for trait-module association analysis. Fatty acid metabolism traits were integrated with transcriptome sequencing data for weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The WGCNA package was utilized to construct the gene co-expression network. First, hierarchical clustering of all samples was performed based on gene expression profiles. The TOM (Topological Overlap Matrix) similarity measure was applied to calculate gene co-expression similarity coefficients, and the pickSoftThreshold function was used to determine the optimal soft-thresholding power ( β 2.8 Module eigengene analysis The module eigengene (ME), defined as the first principal component of each module, was calculated. By integrating biological traits with module hub genes profiles, Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p p 2.9 Functional enrichment analysis In WGCNA, hub genes within modules are typically identified as those with high gene significance (GS) and module membership (MM). For modules significantly associated with fatty acid composition traits, GS and MM values were calculated, and candidate hub genes were selected based on criteria of MM > 0. 8 and GS > 0. 2. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed using the R package clusterProfiler ggplot2 ComplexHeatmap 2.10 PPI network analysis Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was carried out to explore gene-gene interactions and identify hub genes. The PPI network was constructed using the STRING database ( https://string-db 2.11 RT-qPCR analysis To validate the expression of hub genes identified from trait-specific modules, total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the PrimeScript™ RT Reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian, China). Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) was conducted on a LightCycler480 II PCR system (Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) with 2× SGExcel FastSYBR Mixture (B532955 Sangon). The amplification program involved an initial 3 min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles of 15 s denaturation at 95 °C and 45 s annealing/extension at 60 °C. Gene expression levels were normalized to the internal reference gene, β-actin.

A p 3 Results and analysis 3.1 Fatty acid metabolism profile in pigeon pectoral muscle Targeted fatty acid metabolomics analysis using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC–MS/MS) was performed on the pectoral muscle of meat pigeons at five developmental ages. A total of 39 fatty acids were identified, including 16 saturated fatty acids (SFAs), 9 monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), and 14 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). The total fatty acid content in the pectoral muscle of pigeons at 28 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 4 years of age was 1331. 84 μg/g, 1279. 42 μg/g, 1270. 16 μg/g, 938. 04 μg/g, and 873. 49 μg/g, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Box plot of SFA, MUFA, and PUFA in meat pigeons across various age groups. Fig. 1 Eight major fatty acids were identified in pigeon pectoral muscle, comprising two SFAs and six PUFAs, which collectively accounting for over 85 % of the total fatty acid content. Among SFAs, palmitic acid (C16:0) was the most abundant, followed by stearic acid (C18:0), with their combined levers dominated the total fatty acids profile ( Table 2 Table 3 Table 4 Table 2 Composition and Content of SFA in meat pigeons across various age groups.

After stringent data filtering and quality control, all transcriptomic datasets met the requirement for downstream analysis. Mapping the quality-controlled reads to the pigeon reference genome yielded an overall mapping rate exceeding 94 %, with a unique mapping rate of over 91 % for all samples. A total of 17,095 expressed genes were identified, underscoring the reliability of the sequencing data for subsequent analyses. Principal component analysis (PCA) of gene expression profiles across developmental stages showed that PC1 and PC2 explained 37.5 % and 29.1 % of the total variance, respectively ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Transcriptome Sequencing and Functional Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes in Pectoral Muscle of Meat Pigeons across various age groups.

PUFAs have been shown to modulate muscle fiber composition and immune responses by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway—a key mechanism governing lipid metabolism and inflammation ( Jannas-Vela et al., 2023 Chen, Zhao, Zhang, & Geng, 2017 Zheng, Pan, & Cao, 2013 Chang et al., 2017 Banaszak et al., 2024 Wang et al., 2014 Wang et al., 2022 Juodka, Nainienė, Šiukščius, Leikus, & Šarauskas, 2024 Zhang et al., 2022 Banaszak, Kuźniacka, Biesek, Maiorano, & Adamski, 2020 Fatty acid profiling identified that C14:0, C16:0, C16:1 n-7, C18:0, C18:1 n-9, C18:2 n-6,9, arachidonic acid (ARA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), C14:1 n-5, C18:2 n-6,9,12, C20:1 n-9, and C20:2 n-6,9 as the predominant fatty acids in squab pectoral muscle. Their relatively high levels, indicated that these fatty acids constitute the major components of intramuscular fat. To elucidate the molecular regulatory mechanisms of fatty acid composition, WGCNA was performed by integrating transcriptomic data with the quantified fatty acid contents. WGCNA has been widely applied in studies of muscle development and lipid deposition in livestock and poultry, enabling the systematic identification of core regulatory factors underlying complex phenotypes. For instance, Xing et al. constructed co-expression modules associated with intramuscular fat content in chickens and identified key regulatory genes such as HAT1 TNIP1 Xing et al., 2020 PPARG PLIN1 Zhao et al., 2020 In the Green module, core genes such as PRS16 RPS27 Hanna & Hafez, 2018 RPS16 RPS27 RPS16 RPS16 Wang et al., 2019 Jian et al., 2021 Xiong, Zhao, He, & Sun, 2011 RPL39 Zou & Qi, 2021 Liu, Wang, Liang, & Yang, 2024 Mistry et al., 2021 The yellow module showed a significant correlation with the contents of stearic acid (C18:0) and arachidonic acid (ARA). Core genes in this module were mainly associated with mitochondrial respiratory chain complex functions, indicating their potential role in fatty acid oxidative metabolism. Among these, NDUFS6 NDUFC2 Guerrero-Castillo et al., 2017 Wang, Mohsen, Mihalik, Goetzman, & Vockley, 2011 Huang et al., 2019 ATP5MJ Fujikawa, Ohsakaya, Sugawara, & Yoshida, 2014 ATP5MJ Giménez-Escamilla et al., 2024 Core genes of the turquoise module showed complex regulatory interactions within the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and were strongly associated with key fatty acids such as C16:0, EPA, and C18:2. Functional annotation indicated that these hub genes were involved in cell signaling, cytoskeletal organization, and extracellular matrix regulation, suggesting roles in fatty acid accumulation and skeletal muscle development. RHOJ and DLC1, members of the Rho GTPase family, regulate cytoskeletal remodeling, endothelial cell migration, and angiogenesis ( Xiaoying, Xiaoli, & DongChi, & JiaoZuoyi., 2020 Sordella, Jiang, Chen, Curto, & Settleman, 2003 Kiko et al., 2023 RHOJ DLC1 GNAI2 Cezanne et al., 2022 Polit, Rysiewicz, Mystek, Błasiak, & Dziedzicka-Wasylewska, 2020 GNAI2 In the brown module, RAN HAT1 RAN Lin et al., 2025 Mohamed et al., 2023 Lin et al., 2025 RAN HAT1 Gruber et al., 2019 Denu, 2019 HAT1 Xu et al., 2023 HAT1 HAT1 HAT1 The red module exhibited a significantly negatively correlated with the contents of C18:1 N-9 and DHA. Among its core genes, NUDT12 P Ewa et al., 2019 Sarah et al., 2022 NUDT19 Kang et al., 2003 NUDT12 Guo et al., 2023 Li et al., 2025 Despite systematically integrating transcriptomic data with fatty acid profiles to identify key regulatory modules and hub genes involved in muscle lipid metabolism, this study has several limitations. First, the functions of the identified hub genes were primarily inferred through bioinformatics analyses, lacking direct experimental validation at the protein or cellular level. In particular, the precise molecular mechanisms by which ribosomal and mitochondrial genes influence fatty acid metabolism remain unclear and require targeted functional assays—such as in vivo or in vitro knockdown, overexpression, or gene editing experiments—for further elucidation. Second, the relatively limited sample size at each developmental stage may reduce the statistical power and generalizability of the findings. Future studies should focus on functional validation of these core genes using molecular biology techniques and metabolic flux analysis. In addition, integrating multi-omics approaches—such as proteomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics—will help refine the regulatory networks underlying lipid metabolism. These efforts will enhance our understanding of intramuscular fat deposition and provide theoretical and technical foundations for improving pigeon breeding and developing functional meat products. 5 Conclusion This study identified 39 fatty acids in the pectoral muscle tissues of pigeons across various age groups (28 days, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 48 months). Predominant fatty acids included C14:0, C16:0, C16:1 N-7, C18:0, C18:1 N-9, C18:2 N-6,9, ARA, EPA, DPA, DHA, C14:1 N-5, C18:2 N-6,9,12, C20:1 N-9, and C20:2 N-6,9. By Integrating transcriptomic data with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), three co-expression modules(green, yellow, and turquoise), were found to have significant positively correlated with pectoral muscle fatty acid composition, whereas the brown and red modules showed significant negative correlations. PPI network analysis of differentially expressed genes identified several hub genes, such as RPS16, RPS27, NDUFS6, ATP5MJ, RHOJ, GNAI2, RAN, HAT1, LOC135577198 NUDT12 CRediT authorship contribution statement Suwei Zheng: Haobin Hou: Xin Li: Xiaoliang Wang: Qiang Meng: Zihan Qiao: Yingying Tu: Yunzhou Yang: Daqian He: Xiaohui Shen: Junfeng Yao: Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.
