Introduction The development of effective and specifically targeted anticancer medicines is the primary goal in cancer therapeutic approaches. Chemotherapy continues to be the most essential means for treating cancer, even with the availability of several clinical cancer treatment techniques, including laser therapy, stem-cell transplantation, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, and surgery. 1,2 However, traditional cancer chemotherapeutic agents lack selectivity, resulting in toxicity to normal cells due to the similarities between cancer and normal human cells. Another emerging challenge in antitumor therapy is the development of tumor cells' resistance to anticancer drugs. 3,4 5,6 7,8 In humans, protein kinases (PKs) comprise the fifth-largest protein family, 9,10 9,11,12 9,10 13,14 9,15 16–18 The surface of cancerous cells overexpresses a class of tyrosine kinases known as human epithelial growth factor receptors (EGFR). Given that it is implicated in the proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis of cancer cells, EGFR (HER1) is one of the most significant cancer treatment targets. 19–22 23–28 19,20,29 The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family and hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR), which is also known as c-Met (c-mesenchymal epithelial transition factor), are receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Enhanced vascular permeability, endothelial growth, invasion, migration, cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and morphogenesis are primarily triggered by VEGFR-2 and c-Met. Moreover, VEGFR-2 is critical in pathological and physiological angiogenesis. Therefore, experts believe that directly stopping the intracellular kinase domains of VEGFR-2 and c-Met by competing with the ATP-binding sites is the most effective way to stop tumor growth 15,29–49 Three serine/threonine kinases (Pim-1, Pim-2, and Pim-3) make up the provirus integration in Maloney (Pim) kinases family. They play a crucial role in controlling several biological processes, such as the cell cycle, apoptosis, and proliferation. 50 51 K m 52,53 54 The benzofuran nucleus is a useful building block in the realm of pharmaceutical discovery and development due to its intriguing biological characteristics, especially in the field of cancer treatment. This scaffold has various approaches to mediate its anticancer action, such as anti-angiogenesis, antitubulin polymerization, and inhibition of carbonic anhydrases, EGFR, and different protein kinases. 16,55,56 Fig. 1 16,56–58 Fig. 1 Examples of various benzofuran- and pyrazole-based candidates with anticancer activity targeting different protein kinases. Azoles, viz. 15 Fig. 1 59–62 in vitro in vivo 59–62 1.1. Rationale of molecular design Molecular hybridization is an effective technique in the realm of drug discovery and development, where this approach aims to conjugate two or more pharmacophoric or bioactive subunits covalently into novel hybrid molecules. In comparison to their parent drugs, these newly created hybrids often exhibit better affinity and efficacy, improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and the ability to engage in dual or multiple modes of action, with diminished undesirable side effects and reduced likelihood of drug–drug interactions and emergence of drug resistance or proliferation. 63–67 The majority of studies that link the molecular structures of various heterocyclic-based derivatives and their ability to suppress protein kinases have revealed that these compounds have four main characteristic features, a central aromatic heterocyclic scaffold, which serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) to interact with the adenine binding pocket of the target enzyme, an aryl ring, such as substituted phenyl, aromatic, and fused aromatic heterocyclic cores, a linker bridge that might be a linear chain or a heterocyclic moiety (where the length and number of hydrogen donor and/or acceptor groups can be altered), and a hydrophobic tail, such as a phenyl ring, which occupies the hydrophobic allosteric pocket through multiple hydrophobic interactions 15,68 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Hypothetical pharmacophoric characteristics of the newly synthesized compounds. As a result of our curiosity in the field of drug discovery and based on the promising anticancer potency of the benzofuran and pyrazole ring systems, we have utilized the molecular hybridization technique to design and create new compounds that possess the key pharmacophoric characteristics of protein kinase suppressors with multi-targeting kinase inhibition and anticancer potential. The new congeners are based on a benzofuran–pyrazole scaffold as the main heteroaromatic system to interact with the adenine binding pocket of the target enzyme tethered with various substituted aromatic and heterocyclic rings via Fig. 2 The National Cancer Institute (NCI) tested all the new target candidates for their anticancer activity against a set of sixty cancer cell lines. Moreover, the impact of the most promising compound was further evaluated in vitro  In silico in silico 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Chemistry 2.1.1.

Compound 3d showed non-selective, broad-spectrum anticancer activity against all the cancer subpanels, with selectivity ratios ranging from 0.83 to 1.3 ( Table 3 3.2.3.

Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis detection 3.2.4.1. Cell cycle assay Normal cell growth and division are governed by four cell cycle stages of pre-G1, G1, S, and G2/M phases. However, the majority of cancer cells frequently undergo uncontrollable cell divisions brought on by cell cycle down-regulation. Therefore, targeting particular cell cycle stages is a crucial therapeutic approach in the management of antiproliferative disorders. 80 Given that 3d has emerged as a well-balanced active compound that functions as both an anticancer agent and a multi-targeting protein kinase suppressor, it was of interest to gain a deeper understanding of how 3d inhibits the growth of cancer cells. A propidium iodide (PI) staining experiment was performed in this study to look at its effect on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis activation. 81,82 When 3d was added to MCF-7 cancer cells at its GI 50 vs. Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Cell cycle detection of compound 3d on the HepG-2 cancer cell line in comparison with the untreated cells. 3.2.4.2. Apoptosis detection Flow cytometry assay employing annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide double labeling was used to further examine the apoptotic impact of compound 3d. 81,82 Table 5 Fig. 4 Table 5 Apoptosis detection assay for compound 3d in HepG-2 cancer cells Total Early Late Necrosis NH/HepG-2 44.05 24.66 15.07 4.32 Cont.HepG-2 2.09 0.52 0.17 1.4 Fig. 4 Apoptosis detection of compound 3d on the HepG-2 cancer cell line in comparison with the untreated cell line. It has been reported that suppression activity against VEGFR-2 and EGFR results in the induction of cell death via 82 3.3.  In silico 3.3.1. Molecular docking of compound 3d Firstly, we carried out a validation step to confirm the suitability of the docking protocol against the five target enzymes using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2. 69,70 83 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Validation of the docking procedure to c-MET, EGFR, VEGFR-2, B-Raf, and Pim-1, where the co-crystallized ligand is shown in cyan and the re-docked ligand in purple. The tested compound 3d showed comparable activity to that of staurosporine against c-MET kinase with IC 50 −1 −1 −1 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Docking poses of (A) compound 3d and (B) staurosporine inside the active site of c-MET kinase. The binding affinity of 3d was tested against EGFR in comparison to the co-crystallized ligand lapatinib. It has good affinity for the EGFR active site in comparison to lapatinib with binding energy scores of −9.2 and −11.4 kcal mol −1 via Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Docking poses of (A) compound 3d and (B) lapatinib inside the active site of EGFR. In the case of VEGFR-2, compound 3d has a comparable binding mode to that of the co-crystallized ligand, sorafenib ( Fig. 8 −1 −1 Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Docking poses of (A) compound 3d and (B) sorafenib inside the active site of VEGFR-2. Moreover, 3d exhibits good binding affinity to the mutated B-Raf “V600E” with a score of −9.6 kcal mol −1 −1 Fig. 9 Fig. 9 Docking poses of (A) compound 3d and (B) vemurafenib inside the active site of B-Raf “V600E”. Finally, the docking of 3d against Pim-1 did not show any hydrogen bonding achieved by the reference staurosporine, instead, it binds to the ASN172 and ASP186 residues ( Fig. 10 Fig. 10 Docking poses of (A) compound 3d and (B) staurosporine inside the active site of Pim-1. In analyzing the binding interactions of compound 3d across various kinase targets, it is crucial to consider both the conserved and divergent structural features within the ATP-binding pocket and allosteric sites of these kinases. Despite sharing a common ATP-binding region, kinases such as B-Raf (V600E), c-Met, Pim-1, EGFR, and VEGFR-2 exhibit distinct structural nuances that govern the binding affinity and selectivity. For instance, B-Raf (V600E) harbors a mutated valine-to-glutamic acid residue at position 600, resulting in a hydrophobic pocket alteration that accommodates inhibitors such as vemurafenib more effectively. 84 85 Similarly, the EGFR and VEGFR-2 kinases share a relatively conserved hinge region that facilitates hydrogen bonding interactions, as evidenced by the binding of 3d to MET793 in EGFR and GLU885 in VEGFR-2. However, subtle variations in the surrounding residues, such as the bulky LYS868 in VEGFR-2, allow differential interactions, contributing to the distinct binding profiles observed. 86,87 88 Thus, the observed multi-kinase inhibition profile of 3d can be rationalized by its structural adaptability to accommodate diverse kinase pockets, facilitated by its benzofuran–pyrazole scaffold and strategically positioned aromatic and hydrogen-bond donor/acceptor functionalities. This structural versatility underscores the potential of 3d as a multi-target kinase inhibitor capable of modulating different signalling pathways through differential binding modes. Further optimization to enhance the selectivity and minimize off-target interactions can be considered in future studies to further refine its kinase-targeting profile. 3.3.2.

Conclusion The goal of this study is to design and develop new benzofuran–pyrazole-based analogues, tethered with various substituted aromatic and heterocyclic ring systems featuring the pharmacophoric fragments of protein kinase suppressors 3a–d and 4a–d. The conclusions can be summarized according to the following points: • All the new analogues were selected by the NCI to screen their antiproliferative activity against sixty human cancer cell lines (NCI60). • The 1 H d 50 • Fortunately, its LC 50 • Due to its promising antiproliferative activity, compound 3d was further assessed for its in vitro • 3d exhibited a significant suppression effect against EGFR (WT) VEGFR-2, and c-Met (IC 50 50 −1 50 −1 • Additionally, 3d resulted in early and late apoptosis in MCF-7 cancer cells and arrested the cell cycle at the G0–G1 phase. • In silico −1 • In addition, the ADME study exhibited that compound 3d follows Lipinski's rule of five, indicating its expected good oral bioavailability. Also, compound 3d has good human intestinal absorption but cannot penetrate the BBB. • Future prospects: more studies will be carried out for further optimization of the pharmacophoric structure of the benzofuran–pyrazole–pyrazoline parent scaffold, considering the significance of the unsubstituted NH groups of the pyrazoline and the benzo[ d Also, in vivo Conflicts of interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this manuscript.
