Alterations in HER2 due to a defect in the HER2 gene or if there are excess amounts of HER2 on the cancer cell have been shown to promote cancer growth. We have previously reported on a first-in-class, tumour-specific antibody called mAb104, which has shown anti-tumour effects in HER2-positive cancers. Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a type of anticancer drug that is composed of a highly potent anticancer drug linked to an antibody that targets a specific protein (e.g., HER2). We have developed ADCs by linking mAb104 to anticancer drugs. In this paper, we demonstrate the significant anti-tumour effects of mab104-ADCs in a variety of tumour types that express HER2. Significantly, we demonstrate anti-tumour effects in tumours previously treated with HER2-directed treatments as well as in tumours with low HER2 expression. Abstract Background: The novel anti-HER2 antibody 104 (mAb104) targets a unique tumour-specific epitope, lacks normal tissue binding and can internalise into tumour cells, thus supporting its development into antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). Methods: We now describe the binding properties and preclinical activity of mAb104-ADCs developed through the conjugation of mAb104 via linkers to the anti-microtubule drug maytansoinoid ematansine (DM1-SMCC; DM1), topoisomerase I inhibitor, exatecan derivative (MC-GGFG-DX8951; DX8951) or microtubule disruptor monomethyl auristatin E (MC-vc-PAB-MMAE; MMAE). Results: Mab104-ADCs demonstrate dose-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro. The safety of single-dose mAb104-DX8951 was demonstrated in vivo at doses up to 10 mg/kg. MAb104-ADCs also demonstrated potent and prolonged anti-tumour activity in a range of tumour types with variable HER2 expression. Mab104-DX8951 showed significant responses in trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer, low HER2-expressing cancers, as well as HER2-overexpressing cancers. Conclusion: These findings indicate the potential for tumour-specific targeting of HER2-expressing tumours with mAb104-ADCs. antibody drug conjugates HER2 epitope trastuzumab-resistant osimertinib-resistant NHRMC Investigator 1177837 VCA Fellowship ECRF20010 Victorian Government through the Victorian Cancer Agency and the Operational Infrastructure Support Program AMS was supported by an NHRMC Investigator grant (No. 1177837).

Introduction Many improvements in cancer treatment in the last decade have come from the use of more selective drugs, which specifically target cancer-associated proteins [ 1 2 3 The human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptor represents a prototypical molecular abnormality that is detectable in several solid tumours and a proven target in breast cancer, gastric cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [ 4 5 6 We have developed novel antibodies that target conformationally exposed epitopes on the HER2 in tumour-specific conditions, and which do not bind HER2 in normal tissues [ 7 7 8 9 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Antibodies and Antibody-Drug Conjugates The anti-HER2 mAb104 is a murine monoclonal IgG1 produced by ONJCRI and characterised as previously described [ 7 10 2.2. Cell Lines The human tumour cell lines (breast carcinoma BT-474 and HCC1954, gastric carcinoma NCI-N87 and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) NCI-H2170, NCI-H1650, NCI-H522 and NCI-H838) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in cell culture media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (CSL or Bovogen, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). The breast cancer patient-derived sample (PDX) KCC_P_4066 was provided by the National Breast Cancer Foundation Repository of primary tumours and metastases from breast cancer patients (BROCADE, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia) for research use approved by the Austin Health Human Research Ethics Committee. This primary tumour sample was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and histology was grade 2 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative and HER2 positive (defined as 3+ on IHC) [ER+/PR-/HER2+]. 2.3. Flow Cytometry (FACS) Primary anti-HER2 antibody or anti-HER2-ADC (10 µg/mL) bound to 0.5 × 10 6 ® ® 2.4. Cell Proliferation Assay Cells were seeded in a 96-well microtiter plate and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were treated with 100 µg/mL of mAb104-ADC, isotype control IgG1-ADC, mAb104, T-DM-1, trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Cell viability was assessed using the 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) colorimetric viability assay with MTS as a substrate (Promega ® 2.5. In Vivo Studies To establish xenografts, cells suspended in 50% volume Matrigel ® 2 3 All animal studies were approved by the Austin Health Animal Ethics Committee in April 2019 (Protocol #A2019/05605) and conducted in compliance with the Australian Code of Practice for the care and use of animals for scientific purposes. 2.6. Dose-Finding Studies for mAb104 Conjugated with Different Payloads The initial in vivo dose finding for mAb104-MMAE and mAb104-DM1 was conducted as a multi-dose, dose escalation study in female NSG mice bearing established HER2 overexpressing NCI-N87 carcinoma xenografts with five mice per group. ADC-conjugated antibodies (mAb104-MMAE and mAb104-DM1) were administered at increasing doses of 0.5, 1.5 and 3 mg/kg. ADC controls (IgG1-MMAE and IgG1-DM1) were given at 3 mg/kg. The mAb104-DX8951 dose finding study was conducted as a staggered, single IP injection of monoclonal antibodies (isotype control IgG1, mAb104) or a single IV tail vein injection of mAb104-DX8951 with escalating doses from 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 10 mg/kg. There were 5 mice in each dose group. Tumour growth was monitored, and the overall mouse health was assessed immediately and, thereafter, antibody administration for adverse effects and tolerability based on approved clinical scores. 2.7. Therapy Studies for mAb104 Conjugated with Different Payloads Using the optimal dose determined from the dose-finding studies, the therapeutic efficacy of mAb104 conjugated to MMAE, DM1 or DX8951 was assessed in the HCC1954 breast cancer xenograft model. Dosing and administration intervals for the naked mAb104 antibody were as per previous in vivo studies evaluating mAb104 as a naked antibody [ 7 11 12 Groups of 5 mice were treated with 20 mg/kg monoclonal antibody (IgG1, mAb104 or trastuzumab), 10 mg/kg T-DM1, 3 mg/kg mAb104-MMAE/DM1 or 4 mg/kg mAb104-DX8951. Control ADCs (IgG1-MMAE/DM1/DX8951) were given equivalent doses as their ADC counterparts. Tumour growth was monitored until reaching endpoints as per our ethics criteria. Anti-tumour activity of mAb104-DX8591 in different tumour models with different HER2 expression. The therapeutic efficacy of mAb104-DX8951 was further assessed in the xenograft model with high HER2 expression (NCI-H2170) or low HER2 expression (NCI-H1650) and a patient-derived PDX breast cancer model expressing high HER2. Groups of 10 mice were treated with 20 mg/kg monoclonal antibody (IgG1, mAb104 or trastuzumab), 10 mg/kg T-DM1, 4 mg/kg mAb104-DX8951 or IgG1-DX8951. Tumours from 2 mice/group were resected after 2 weeks (6 doses of monoclonal antibodies or 4 doses of ADCs) and at the end of therapy for analysis. For the remaining mice, tumour growth was monitored until reaching endpoints as per our ethics criteria. 2.8. Immunohistochemistry Pharmacodynamic studies by immunohistochemistry (IHC, São Paulo, Brazil) analysis were undertaken on collected tumour xenografts to explore treatment effects on tumour cell proliferation (Ki67), marker of DNA damage phospho-Histone H2A.X (Ser139), (pH2A.X) and marker of apoptosis cleaved caspase 3. Briefly, 5 µm sections of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour tissues were boiled in 10 mM citrate buffer for antigen retrieval, endogenous peroxidase quenched, and non-specific protein binding blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) before probing overnight at 4 °C with anti-pH2A.X (Cell Signalling Technologies #9718) and anti-cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signalling Technologies #9661) antibodies. Anti-rabbit-HRP (Dako) was added before DAB (Abcam) incubation to detect positive binding. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. Tumour necrosis was assessed from H&E-stained sections using HALO tumour classifier, where % tumour necrosis = (necrosis area/total area) × 100. pH2A.X copies were quantified using Indica Labs ISH algorithm (version 4.1.3) per mm 2 2.9. Western Blot Analysis Tumours collected at week 2 and 3 of treatment and at the end of the study were analysed by Western blot for effects on HER2 and known HER2-activated signalling pathways as previously described (6). In brief, lysed tumour samples were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with antibodies against HER2 (#2242), HER2 pTyr1221/1222 (#2243), AKT (#4691), AKT pSer473 (#4060), ERK (#4695), ERK pThr202/Tyr204 (#4370) (Cell Signalling Technology ® 2.10. Statistical Analysis Data are presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) unless indicated otherwise. All statistical analyses were performed using Prism (versions 8.2 and 10, GraphPad Software). An unpaired t p 3. Results 3.1. Generation of mAb104-ADCs The mAb104-MMAE, mAb104-DM1 and mAb104-DX8951 ADCs and corresponding control IgG1 ADCs were received from Levena Biopharma (San Diego, CA, USA). Calculated Drug Antibody Ratios (DARs) were 3.4 to 3.7 for MMAE and DM-1 conjugates and ~8 for DX8951 conjugates. The DARs are highly comparable to T-DXd and T-DM1, which have been reported as 7.7 and between 3 and 3.6, respectively [ 11 13 3.2. Mab104-ADC Binding To verify binding properties to HER2 following conjugation of antibody to the cytotoxic payloads, flow cytometry analyses were performed in a panel of cell lines expressing a range of HER2 levels ( Figure 1 7 7 3.3.

Dose Finding Study The mAb104-MMAE ADC demonstrated equivalent efficacy at all doses assessed in a high HER2-expressing gastric cancer xenograft model, NCI-N87, with significant sustained tumour growth inhibition compared to control IgG1-MMAE ( Figure 3 Figure 3 To establish the safety of the mAb104-DX8951, a staggered dose escalation study of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, or 10 mg/kg of the novel mAb104-DX8951 via a single i.v. injection was conducted in mice bearing established HER2 overexpressing (IHC 3+) NCI-N87 carcinoma xenografts. Dose-dependent inhibition of tumour growth was observed within two weeks of a single dose of mAb104-DX8951, with the 10 mg/kg dose significantly more effective than the 2 and 4 mg/kg ADC doses ( p p Figure 3 Supplementary Figure S1 The dose level of 4 mg/kg of mAb104-DX8951 and 3 mg/kg of mAb104-MMAE and mAb104-DM1 was used for further therapy studies. 3.4.2.

Pharmacodynamic Studies Tumors taken at week 2 and 3 of treatment and at end of study were analyzed by IHC for percentage necrosis present, pH2AX DNA damage, apoptosis marker (cleaved caspase 3), and Ki67 proliferation marker. In both NCI-H2170 and NCI- H1650 NSCLC xenografts mAb104-DX8951 did not induce apoptosis or increase necrosis compared to the control arms ( Supplementary Figures S2 and S3 Supplementary Figure S4 Figure S5 Due to the efficacy of treatment achieved with the 104 ADCs in the PDX and HCC1954 models there was insufficient tumor tissue from the 104-DX8951 arms to conduct these analyses. 5. Discussion Antibody drug conjugates of mAb104 have been stably produced with retention of HER2 binding and in vitro cytotoxic specificity following conjugation via linkers to MMAE, DM1 and DX8951. In vivo studies demonstrate that mAb104 ADCs have significant efficacy in various tumour models with variable HER2 expression. Trastuzumab has been the cornerstone of HER2-directed therapy in HER2-overexpressing breast and gastric cancer; however, resistance to trastuzumab or trastuzumab conjugate regimens is universal [ 18 In NSCLC, various novel ADCs targeting oncogenic targets, including HER2, HER3, Trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (TROP2), MET, NECTIN4, Tissue Factor (TF), Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5), mesothelin, and LIV1, are in clinical trials [ 3 19 20 19 NCT04042701 21 22 In general, expression levels and distributional patterns of tumour antigens correlate with ADC response [ 23 24 25 20 26 27 28 29 30 Our study utilised T-DM1 as a comparator, which is an approved HER2 ADC with established efficacy in breast cancer. However, we acknowledge the absence of direct comparative studies with T-DXd, which utilises a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload (similar class to DX8951) and a cleavable linker, which has been approved for previously treated HER2-positive solid tumours. 6. Conclusions In conclusion, we have designed a novel HER2-targeting ADC, mAb104-DX8951, which has shown great potential to respond to trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive cancers, low HER2-expressing cancers, as well as HER2 overexpressing cancers. Moving forward, rational combination strategies with immune checkpoint inhibitors and anti-angiogenic therapies will likely be important to augment the activity of mAb104-DX8951 and overcome potential mechanisms of resistance.
