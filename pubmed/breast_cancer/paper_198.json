Methods Four discussion groups were held with 40 breast cancer patients participating in an exercise program. Hierarchical content analysis identified three central themes: (a) consequences of cancer, (b) coping, and (c) consequences of exercise. Results Regarding cancer consequences, narratives linked to the others’ perception and body stigma prevailed. Participants used mutual support and empowerment as their main coping strategies. The PE program was perceived as a promoter of physical (functional and aesthetic) and psychological benefits. Conclusions The participation of female breast cancer patients in PE programs contributes to greater physical, psychological, and social well-being. The analyzed PE program contributed, in general, to an improvement in body image with special emphasis on body function and in cognitive and affective dimensions. Implications for cancer survivors. PE programs can be a valuable intervention for breast cancer survivors, enhancing body image, quality of life, and emotional resilience during recovery.

It accounts for a quarter of all cancers in women and is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in this population [ 1 2 3 The most common and effective treatments against breast cancer combine surgical procedures with complementary local therapies (e.g., radiotherapy) or systemic treatments (e.g. chemotherapy, hormonal therapy) [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 In this context, it is noteworthy that physical exercise not only significantly enhances the quality of life during and after cancer treatment but also has the potential to reduce the risk of developing certain types of cancer, decrease cancer-specific mortality by nearly 20%, and alleviate various side effects associated with oncological treatments [ 10 11 12 Methods Study design This research was conceived from a qualitative perspective, as there was a need to know in depth the perceptions of female breast cancer patients in a specific context [ 13 14 The present case study was carried out with women diagnosed with breast cancer (stages I–IV) actively undergoing treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy) who enrolled in a PE program performed by the Chair of Physical Activity and Oncology «Fundación José Soriano Ramos» of the Universitat Jaume I (Spain). This organization, through different lines of work addresses the relationships between different types of cancer, physical activity and quality of life. The PE program for female breast cancer patients is one of the most prominent and recognized projects at a social level. This study’s approach allows for a holistic understanding of how our PE program influences the patient’s body image perceptions, considering contextual and individual variables that would be difficult to convey through other methodologies. Sampling and recruitment In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and following the approval from the Jaume I University ethics committee (CEISH/75/2023), participant recruitment was conducted at the Medical Oncology Service of the Provincial Hospital Consortium of Castelló, according to the same inclusion criteria outlined in our previous study [ 12 Data collection We chose to hold discussion groups for data collection, since it offers the possibility for several people to collaboratively share ideas, feelings and perceptions around one or more topics. The focus groups were conducted face to face, in a semi-structured style of interviewing. We designed an interview guide based on open questions in order to encourage participation (see Appendix). This type of interview guide offers flexibility for researchers since they do not need to ask the same questions in all discussion groups, thus, facilitating a more fluid conversation because the participants have greater control. Also, its structure is strict enough to be able to collect important information about the object of study [ 15 16 Favoring a methodological naturalism [ 17 The interview guide initially consisted of an introductory part in which terminological issues such as the concept of body image itself were discussed. This was done through questions such as:  “What does body image mean to you?” The introductory phase of conceptual clarification facilitated the further development of the discussion group on the basis of a common understanding of the expectations and central concepts. Also, it was useful to introduce participants to the dynamics of the activity (for many, it was the first time they participated in a study of these characteristics) and in preparation to address other more complex and personal issues. After the introductory part, participants were asked about their perception in body changes after being diagnosed with breast cancer, the role physical exercise PE played in terms of their body image perception, etc. At the end of the focus groups, participants were invited to offer recommendations and arguments for other female breast cancer patients who were considering to participate in a PE program similar to the one discussed in the focus group. This final part helped to reduce the tension after a potentially intense discussion. Data analysis The authors followed the Reporting Standards for Qualitative Research set by the American Psychological Association (2020) [ 18 19 To ensure the trustworthiness and credibility of the data analysis, a six-step, hierarchical, content analysis of inductive nature was conducted. This analysis allows to compare and contrast the data, to divide the data into broader or narrower categories, as well as to identify and organize the material collected. Therefore, it facilitates the development of general knowledge about a specific topic [ 16 Cancer consequences, Coping, and Physical exercise consequences. Results The results are presented according to the three main themes identified in the data analysis section. First, a characterization of the main consequences of cancer perceived by participants in terms of their body image is presented. This is followed by the main coping strategies used by the participants. Finally, the consequences of the PE program on the participants’ body image are described. Table 1 Table 1 Themes and sub/themes derived from the data analysis Cancer consequences Coping Physical exercise consequences - Autoperception - Discretion - Physical benefits - Others’ perceptions - Empowerment - Psychological benefits Cancer consequences Changes in the perception of one’s own body image were shown to be a central element in the experience of women diagnosed with breast cancer. These body changes at the time of diagnosis and at the beginning of treatment were reported to be very evident on a visual level, and, in addition, they occurred very soon. Beyond the emotional complexity derived from cancer diagnosis, body transformations are a process that could be overwhelming for many participants: “Managing the image that you see in the mirror is a complicated process [...] At night I looked in the mirror and saw that I was changing. My hair, my eyebrows, my eyelashes were falling out. And you get fat. That change is… it is brutal.” However, the awareness of the experienced body changes, as well as the discomfort that comes with it, occurred once the disease stages that supposed a greater risk to patient’s life were overcome: “This brutal image change has been very complicated. The moment you are no longer afraid of dying, when you believe that everything is starting to go well, that is when you look in the mirror and realize that you no longer recognize yourself.” An important aspect related to body image had was the perception of other people. In this sense, participants’ concerns about being stigmatized and labeled as “cancer patients” was a central element in terms of discomfort derived from other people’s perception. Likewise, participants showed a deep concern regarding the possibility of being rejected by significant people in their lives, such as children or partners: “I was more afraid of what my husband would think when he saw me naked than anything else. I was afraid that seeing me like that would cause him rejection.” The shame and anguish expressed by participants was also related to the fact that they felt their bodies were moving away from the canons of beauty socially legitimized for Western women. The comparison of their bodies with other bodies considered “normative” intensified the feeling of alienation with respect to their own image: “I have practiced swimming all my life. And after the surgery, I could not enter the locker room without a breast, with all the scars... I entered the municipal pool, and the locker room was full of young girls. How do I take off my swimsuit now, in front of those magazine bodies? I ran to the bathroom, I hid... And I thought ’I cannot do anything comfortably, it is super uncomfortable anywhere.” Coping Practices aimed at discretion, at hiding one’s own body, were used by some participants to confront the development of a negative body image. Those who opted for this strategy remained more at home, wore looser clothing than usual, and/or avoided certain public spaces in order to conceal their body shape or avoid exposure to another people’s gaze: “I used to wear a lot of tank tops, but now... there are clothes that I just throw away. I did not even want to see them in the closet. I have gained five kilograms; my pants are going to explode. When it comes to outfit, my mind directly leads me to wear skirts, or dresses... things that are not tight, because otherwise I feel very uncomfortable.” One participant justified this type of actions as: “it is not just because of me, although I’m also embarrassed to see myself. But it is also because of the sensitivity of others, I feel bad… I do not want them to see me like that.” This experience reveals, as mentioned above, a duality in the negative perception of body image. On the one hand, the desire to hide one’s own corporeality originated, in an internal dimension of personal rejection, which could be interpreted as a form of symbolic violence in the form of guilt for not having a body aligned with the dominant aesthetic canons. On the other hand, the strategy of discretion also stemmed from a concern for possible perceptions and/or reactions of third parties when faced with the sight of a body visibly affected by the disease. Contrary to discretion, the empowerment of and among women with breast cancer was shown to be an important narrative of resistance against the restrictive view of beauty in female bodies and, at the same time, of active acceptance of the body changes derived from the cancer disease. The empowered participants thought that the disease experience should not be limited to a passive acceptance of body changes. On the contrary, it meant a stimulus for the vindication and legitimation of his new corporality, and the reconstruction of the dominant aesthetic canons:  “I went to the pool without a prosthesis. If they want to look, let them look.” The empowered participants not only exposed their bodies in public, but also understood their attitude as a political responsibility aimed at social acceptance of their corporality and challenging the stigmas associated with the disease: “Changes... are phases that we have to go through. Many physical consequences that we have will remain with us, but here we are, alive. We have to be thankful for that. And I would say we should not hide. If we are not able to normalize our body, we cannot expect others to see it as normal.” Physical exercise consequences Physical changes as a consequence of PE were a key element in the well-being feeling. Although the majority of women did not directly express a change in their perception body image, they did express noticing obvious changes in their physical appearance (e.g., increase in muscle mass legs and arms, improvement in arm mobility, decreased body weight, improved posture) and some patients even reported a perceived improvement in their physical self-image: “I gained 20 kg and had muscle atrophy. Now I don’t feel it that bad, in terms of my body image, at all. I mean, I still need to lose a few kilos to feel completely well, but it is a process that I feel is going very well. I look much better on a physical level.” Conversely, while physical activity was beneficial in attenuating treatment-induced physical alterations, in certain cases, the improvements achieved through the PE program were deemed insufficient: “Exercise has helped me to improve my muscle tone and strength and to lose weight, […]. And I feel very good doing exercise. But I still feel very deteriorated in my physique, and that it is because of all the adverse effects that I have had.” On the other hand, participants showed greater body confidence since their started into the PE program. They evaluated their appearance more positively, which contributed to having positive thoughts and feelings in relation to their body, and increase their levels of self-esteem. One participant verbalized it like this: “The flaccidity that you see, the loins… I look much better now with exercise. When I see myself in the mirror it is totally different, I have more confidence.” Of particular relevance is the fact that the reported changes were not limited to the appreciation of physical appearance or capabilities, but also extended to perceptions of body functionality. Several participants reported experiencing moments during the PE sessions in which they temporarily forgot about their illness. Although pain and cancer-related fatigue were sometimes cited as barriers to engaging in PE, participants also described increased overall well-being, a reduction in treatment-related side effects, and enhanced body acceptance, self-respect, and a more favorable body image: “When I come here, I feel great. As if I were 20 years old, as if I weren’t sick, and as if I were capable of anything the physical trainer asks me to do.” In this context, the PE program appears to support the development of a more positive body image, fostering greater acceptance and appreciation of the body, which in turn contributes to improved interpersonal relationships: “Exercise makes me feel more optimistic, more active… and that translates into better social relationships.” Psychological changes resulting from the PE program also showed to be a key element in the feeling of well-being. All participants emphasized how PE facilitated a greater appreciation of their bodies, enhanced their self-esteem, and fostered positive perceptions of their bodies. In this regard, they stated that engaging in a PE group program was an important factor to feel motivated, socialize and empathize with women facing similar challenges. Moreover, the opportunity to openly share both physical and emotional symptoms related to their illness provided a sense of companionship, understanding, and empowerment in their fight against cancer: “This group is very important for me, because aside from exercise, it has helped me to feel more relaxed since I have colleagues who are further along in the disease and can share with me important experiences that I am about to face. In this sense, you feel calmer because you know more or less what is going to happen, what to expect at each moment. They also offer advice, such as, ‘This is good for your eyelashes.’” Discussion Female breast cancer patients have to cope with traumatic physical and psychological experiences caused by the diagnosis and treatment that affect patients’ daily life, social activities, relationships, quality of life and also associated with body image changes [ 20 9 21 12 Among the results, the emotional impact derived from the physical changes that occur after the diagnosis should be highlighted, especially as an effect of treatments. A significant concern of the participants was associated to the perception of their relatives, such as their partners, who could negatively react to the body changes resulting from cancer. The rejection of these “sick bodies” has been documented in previous studies [ 22 23 8 The acceptance of a new corporality after breast cancer diagnosis is not a uniform process, but rather a gradual and variable one [ 23 9 12 24 25 The results show from a qualitative point of view, how a structured PE program can improve physiological and psychological function, which can in turn, promote physical and emotional well-being [ 12 26 27 28 29 The results of the present study provide new knowledge related to body image in the context of breast cancer, emphasizing that the inclusion in a PE program can have a positive impact on body perception among female breast cancer patients. Healthcare professionals can use this information to better understand the impact of PE on breast cancer patients and their experiences, highlighting the importance of including PE as an essential component of rehabilitation programs during adjuvant treatment or after the oncology treatment. It is important to emphasize that qualitative studies play a fundamental role in research like ours, as they allow patients to articulate their perceptions and experiences in a more open and nuanced manner, providing a richer and deeper understanding of the subjective impact that a physical exercise program can have on self-perceived body image. This approach is essential to capture the individual variations in women’s experiences, as each experience is unique and may be influenced by contextual, emotional, and social factors. This study has two main limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, the cross-sectional design provides only a snapshot of participants’ perceptions, which may be affected by recall bias, particularly among individuals who have lived with breast cancer for a long time. Therefore, it is important to continue exploring the impact of breast cancer on women’s body image longitudinally, adopting an approach that considers this experience to be dynamic and multifaceted, which requires data to be collected at multiple time points. Secondly, breast cancer often involves aggressive treatments that can lead to visible physical changes, such as hair loss and nail damage, which may be difficult for physical exercise programs to address. In this regard, future studies may benefit from analyzing the experiences of participants who have undergone such changes separately, to better understand the extent to which physical exercise can contribute to improving body image in these specific circumstances. Conclusion Breast cancer and its treatments induce significant physical changes. In many cases, the societal pressure to conform to dominant aesthetic standards can contribute to the development of a negative body image, even in the presence of PE within structured programs. However, the PE program examined in this study primarily contributed to an enhanced positive body image, particularly in areas related to physical appearance, emotional well-being, and cognitive function. PE is crucial as an adjunctive treatment during and after breast cancer therapy, and thus should be integrated into cancer rehabilitation programs (both pre- and post-surgery). Furthermore, interdisciplinary collaboration among healthcare professionals, including those in medicine, nursing, physiotherapy, and sports sciences, is essential to ensure the success of these interventions.
