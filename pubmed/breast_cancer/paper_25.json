Summary The diagnostic accuracy of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for detecting molecular residual disease (MRD) after multimodal treatment remains unclear. In a prospective cohort of 132 patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by clinical response evaluation and surgery, tumor-informed personalized-panel and fixed-panel ctDNA assays are applied to serial blood samples. Personalized ctDNA assay demonstrates a superior baseline detection rate (99.2%) and outperforms fixed panels in diagnosing post-nCRT residual disease. Integrating personalized ctDNA with conventional clinical diagnostic methods increases sensitivity for predicting non-pathological complete response (non-pCR) from 78.4%–80.7% to 92.0%–93.2%. Patients with detectable MRD post-nCRT and/or post-surgery exhibit worse survival outcomes. In non-pCR patients, adjuvant immunotherapy improves disease-free survival in post-surgery MRD-positive cases, whereas MRD-negative patients derive no benefit. These findings support incorporating ctDNA into response assessment to guide organ-sparing strategies and adjuvant therapy decisions in ESCC. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03937362 Graphical abstract Highlights • Personalized ctDNA assay shows higher MRD sensitivity than fixed panels in ESCC • Adding ctDNA to clinical evaluation improves detection of non-pCR patients post-nCRT • Post-surgical ctDNA predicts recurrence and identifies benefit from adjuvant therapy • ctDNA-MRD detection supports organ-sparing strategies and adaptive adjuvant therapy Accurate detection of residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy in ESCC remains an unmet need. Liu et al. reveal that integrating ctDNA with clinical response evaluation improves residual disease detection post-neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy to support organ-sparing strategies and that postoperative ctDNA stratifies recurrence risk beyond pathological response to inform adjuvant immunotherapy decisions.

We assessed the clinical validity of ctDNA for identifying complete responders after nCRT to support organ-sparing strategies and for stratifying postoperative recurrence risk to guide adjuvant immunotherapy decisions.

At baseline, there was no difference in ctDNA fraction between patients classified as CRE positive and CRE negative by conventional diagnostic methods ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Integrated ctDNA and clinical assessment improve sensitivity for residual disease detection after nCRT We next assessed the feasibility of ctDNA-based MoRE in predicting residual disease after nCRT. A total of 131 patients with post-nCRT ctDNA data from all three assays were included for analysis.

Although the addition of ctDNA to CRE improved sensitivity, an increase in false-positive rate was observed ( Figure 3 Figure S3 27 Among 43 pCR patients, 3 had CRE-1-positive diagnosis (2 due to endoscopically non-traversable stenosis and 1 due to high-grade dysplasia), and 1 of these 3 patients was ctDNA positive ( Figure S3 Figure S3 p Figure S3 Figures S3 Postoperative ctDNA predicts prognosis after nCRT We next evaluated the prognostic value of postoperative ctDNA-based MRD in ESCC following nCRT.

Integrating ctDNA-based MRD into clinical management of esophageal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy Based on the aforementioned results, a hypothetical scenario for integrating ctDNA-based systemic MRD assessment with clinical diagnostic modalities for LRD evaluation ( Figure 6 (1) Type 1: patients without residual disease at both locoregional and systemic sites; both LRD and ctDNA-based MRD would be negative after nCRT and remain negative post-surgery. These patients are expected to have good prognosis. (2) Type 2: patients with residual disease confined to the locoregional tumor site would have positive results for both LRD and ctDNA-based MRD post-nCRT. However, after complete surgical resection, both LRD and ctDNA-based MRD would convert to negative. These patients are expected to have favorable outcomes. (3) Type 3: residual disease is present beyond the locoregional site; LRD might be negative, but ctDNA-based MRD remains positive post-nCRT, and the positivity of ctDNA-based MRD would persist after radical surgery, indicating a higher risk of systemic recurrence. (4) Type 4: patients with concurrent locoregional and systemic residual disease would have positive results for both LRD and ctDNA-based MRD post-nCRT; even after radical surgery, when LRD has been removed, ctDNA would remain positive, indicating persistent systemic residual disease and a poor prognosis. Figure 6 Proposed strategy for integrating ctDNA testing into post-neoadjuvant management of esophageal cancer (A) Summary of residual disease evaluation and outcome stratification for ESCC patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy and surgery. The diagram illustrates four types of residual disease changes based on locoregional residual disease and molecular residual disease status, with corresponding prognostic implications. (B) Graphical illustration of a proposed improved clinical pathway incorporating ctDNA testing for response evaluation and postoperative risk stratification. The upper panel shows the current standard-of-care pathway, while the lower panel outlines an adaptive management strategy using ctDNA-based molecular response evaluation to guide adaptive treatment decisions. This conceptual stratification highlights the complementary role of ctDNA-based MRD alongside conventional diagnostics in refining residual disease assessment and supporting personalized management in the post-nCRT setting of ESCC. Therefore, we propose a clinical pathway incorporating ctDNA-based MRD into post-neoadjuvant therapy management for ESCC patients ( Figure 6 Discussion In this prospective study of 132 patients with locally advanced resectable ESCC treated with nCRT followed by response diagnostic tests and surgery, we provide evidence that integrating molecular diagnostics (ctDNA-based MRD detection) with conventional clinical diagnostics improves the accuracy of residual disease detection after nCRT. Moreover, our findings support postoperative ctDNA status as a prognostic marker for recurrence risk and a potential predictive biomarker for benefit from adjuvant therapy. These findings support the incorporation of ctDNA-based MRD evaluation into the current neoadjuvant and perioperative management paradigm to enable adaptive and individualized treatment for ESCC patients. The adoption of organ-sparing strategies as an alternative to standard esophagectomy for patients achieving cCR post-neoadjuvant therapy requires a highly accurate diagnostic approach for residual disease detection. While the previous preSANO trial established the utility of CRE with endoscopic bite-on-bite biopsy and EUS-FNA for detecting major residual disease (>10% residual cancer), the conventional clinical diagnostics have notable limitations, including the inability to assess systemic MRD, using invasive diagnostic procedures, and technical difficulties in suspected lymph node aspirations. 26 26 19 ctDNA has emerged as a transformative biomarker, with recent studies extending its role beyond prognosis to predicting treatment response. 11 , 30 , 31 , 32 23 13 , 33 13 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 Our study revealed that post-nCRT ctDNA assessment could identify patients at risk of postoperative distant metastasis, even among those classified as cCR by conventional CRE. This highlights the value of ctDNA as a molecular supplement to conventional clinical diagnostics, which fails to identify high-risk patients with occult systemic residual disease. The SANO trial reported high distant recurrence rates in cCR patients assessed by conventional CRE methods, regardless of undergoing surgery (34%) or active surveillance (43%). 9 , 10 19 Currently, there is a lack of effective methods for postoperative risk stratification in patients with esophageal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy. Despite the use of combined neoadjuvant therapy and surgery, recurrence rates remain high for esophageal cancer. 34 , 35 , 36 28 11 15 In conclusion, this prospective cohort study from the preSINO trial evaluated the clinical value of ctDNA in guiding perioperative decision-making after neoadjuvant therapy by assessing the ctDNA-based MRD status at key perioperative time points (baseline, post-nCRT, and post-surgery). We demonstrated the potential of personalized ctDNA analysis in identifying residual disease post-neoadjuvant treatment, thereby supporting organ-sparing strategies. Additionally, postoperative ctDNA positivity stratified recurrence risk and informed adjuvant therapy decisions. Our findings highlight the transformative potential of ctDNA in enabling adaptive, individualized treatment strategies. Importantly, ctDNA is optimally applied in conjunction with standard response evaluation and surveillance diagnostics, offering a complementary approach that enhances sensitivity and reduces the risk of undertreatment. This study provides important evidence supporting a shift from empiric treatment paradigms toward molecularly guided precision oncology in esophageal cancer management. Limitations of the study This study had several limitations. First, our exploratory study was observational in nature and lacked intervention based on ctDNA detection. Our findings demonstrate the potential utility of ctDNA-guided adaptive management in ESCC. However, the absence of protocol-directed interventions, non-randomized design, and limited cohort size necessitate cautious interpretation of our work. Larger intervention studies and randomized trials are required to validate our proof-of-concept findings.

All participants provided written informed consent. Method details Study outcomes and objectives The treatment response to nCRT was defined by histopathologic examination of the resection specimens by experienced pathologist. The entire resected tumor and all lymph nodes were evaluated, and pathological tumor regression was assessed by estimating the percentage of residual viable tumor in the macroscopically identifiable tumor bed using the Chirieac tumor regression grade (TRG) system 54 Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the time from the surgery to recurrence or death due to any cause. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from surgery to death. To assess the performance of ctDNA to predict postoperative recurrence, postoperative recurrence rate, DFS and OS were compared between ctDNA positive and ctDNA negative groups. Postoperative adjuvant immunotherapy The administration of adjuvant immunotherapy in the present preSINO study was influenced by the evolving clinical guidelines and regulatory approvals during the study period (2019–2023). Based on the results of CheckMate577 trial, 28 29 In this study, patient enrollment spanned from August 2019 to January 2023; at the time of study initiation in 2019, there were no established adjuvant treatment recommendations for esophageal cancer patients following nCRT and surgery. Therefore, the study design did not mandate postoperative adjuvant therapy. As a result, none of the patients with pCR in our study received adjuvant immunotherapy, consistent with current clinical practice. For non-pCR patients enrolled between 2019 and 2021, adjuvant immunotherapy was not routinely administered, as it had not yet been endorsed by clinical guidelines or regulatory agencies. However, following the publication of CheckMate-577 trial and the subsequent updates to the NCCN and China guidelines, some non-pCR patients enrolled between 2022 and 2023 did receive adjuvant immunotherapy. This timeline reflects the dynamic nature of clinical practice and guideline updates during the study period. The differential administration of adjuvant immunotherapy in non-pCR patients is a result of the study’s longitudinal design, which spanned a period of evolving evidence and regulatory approvals. Postoperative follow-up The first follow-up visit was 1 month after surgery. Patients were then regularly followed up every 3–6 months during the first 2-year period, and every 6–12 months thereafter. In the present study, the cutoff date for follow-up data collection was January 2025, with a minimum follow-up period of 20 months and a maximum of 48 months. Followed-up evaluations included physical examinations, routine blood tests, chest-abdominal CT scan, and ultrasonography of the neck. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed every 6 months in the first 2 years and once a year thereafter. Additional examinations were conducted based on the judgments of the attending physician. Based on the first relapse pattern, recurrences were classified as locoregional or distant disease. Locoregional recurrences were defined as recurrences within the esophagus, anastomosis site, or regional lymph nodes. Distant recurrences were defined as hematogenous organ metastases (such as lung, liver, and bone), peritoneal carcinomatosis, or malignant pleural effusions. Sample collection, processing and sequencing All sample collection procedures complied with the regular routine in clinical practice and written informed consent was obtained before sampling. Pretreatment tumor samples were obtained for WES from the primary esophageal tumor lesion before nCRT via endoscopic biopsy. Tumor tissue samples that contained less than 30% cancer cells were excluded ( Figure S1 13 Approximately 20 mL of peripheral blood at each predefined time point was collected by Cell-Free DNA BCT tubes (Streck, La Vista, NE, USA). The collected blood sample was centrifuged at 2,000 g at 4°C for 10 min within 72h of collection. The supernatant plasma was then transferred to a 15mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 16,000 g at 4°C for 10 min. The supernatant was then transferred to a new tube and stored at −80°C for further analysis. Plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was extracted using the QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 20–60 ng cfDNA was subjected to three ctDNA assays of MRD. Ultra-deep UMI-based sequencing was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, US), with 2 × 151bp paired-end reads and a target raw depth of 100,000x for the personalized panel and 35,000x for the fixed panel. Personalized ctDNA assay for MRD detection The tumor-informed personalized panel used in this study was based on the CanCatch (PROPHET) platform (Burning Rock Biotech, Guangzhou, China), which has been fully described in our previous publication. 13 https://github.com/bnr-cdx/prophet Patient-specific somatic variants were identified through the analysis of WES data obtained from the primary tumor and matched normal white blood cell. The analysis of WES data was as previously described. 13 50 51 Up to 50 highly ranked variants with a VAF≥3% were selected with in-house priority rules. Additionally, variants falling in the repetitive regions, regions with a high GC content (>75%), and homologous regions were filtered out. The biotinylated capture probe pool was produced in-house based on each personalized panel design. The cfDNA was sequenced by the personalized panel and the sequencing data were extracted by UMI adapters, mapped, and filtered. The assumption of a Poisson distribution was used to calculate the significance of somatic mutations for the tumor-informed personalized panel, as previously described. 13 p p 13 Somatic mutation caller for fixed targeted panel The fixed panel spanning 273 kb of the human genome, covering 168 genes (Burning Rock Biotech, Guangzhou, China; Table S3 55 , 56 20 57 For the tumor-naïve fixed panel, MRD was considered positive if any of the following criteria were met: (1) Driver SNV/INDEL≥1 high-quality reads (family size≥2 or duplex size≥1) and AF≥0.01%. (2) Passenger SNV/INDEL≥2 high-quality reads (family size≥2 or duplex size≥1) and AF≥0.1%. (3) Driver fusion≥3 high-quality reads or passenger fusion≥15 high-quality reads. For the tumor-informed fixed panel, paired tumor tissue was used to guide variant calling. Specifically, in plasma samples, any SNV/INDEL not detected in the paired tumor tissue was considered a false positive and excluded from MRD reporting. Otherwise, SNV/INDELs with supporting reads≥4 or VAF ≥0.1% were considered positive and reported. The analytical pipeline, including sequencing platform, panel design, bioinformatics filtering, and variant interpretation logic, was also reported in previously publication. 13 Quantification and statistical analysis Continuous variables were compared using the Mann-Whitney or Kruskal–Wallis test in cases of nonnormal distribution. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test, as appropriate. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and differences of survival between groups were compared with the log rank test. Hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using the univariable Cox proportional-hazards regression model. Multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression model was used to assess the association between variables and survival, adjusting for potential confounders. We used R (version 4.4.1), SPSS (version 29.0) and GraphPad Prism (version 10.2.0) for data analyses and graphical plotting.
