One key protein called valosin-containing protein (VCP) or p97 helps remove damaged or excess proteins and is often overactive in tumors. This review explains how p97 supports cancer cell survival and why blocking its activity may be an effective way to treat cancer. We highlight how experimental drugs that inhibit p97 have shown promise in preclinical studies and early clinical trials and we discuss how combining p97 inhibitors with other treatments could improve outcomes. By better understanding the role of p97 in cancer, researchers and clinicians may be able to develop new therapies that target this important cellular process more precisely and effectively. Abstract Increased basal protein synthesis activity is a hallmark feature that distinguishes many types of malignant cells from their normal counterparts. The survival and proliferation of cancer cells are tightly linked to functional unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) pathways due to their high rates of protein synthesis. The evolutionarily conserved AAA+ ATPase valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 facilitates the extraction of proteins from organelles, chromatin, and protein complexes to target them for ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS)-mediated degradation. p97 plays a key role in protein quality control and in the maintenance of protein homeostasis through its regulation of ERAD. The disruption of p97 activity leads to an accumulation of undegraded proteins, triggers the UPR, and can culminate in proteotoxic cell death. Given this, p97 inhibition offers an opportunity to selectively kill cancer cells that exhibit high basal protein synthesis rates. This review explores p97’s molecular structure, diverse cellular roles, and clinical potential with a particular focus on CB-5083 and CB-5339, the only p97 inhibitors to date that have advanced into clinical trials. We discuss their mechanisms of action, clinical trial outcomes, and the transformative potential of rational combination strategies to maximize their therapeutic potential. By integrating foundational biological insights with translational perspectives, we highlight p97 as a precision target for cancer treatment. valosin-containing protein VCP p97 CB-5083 CB-5339 endoplasmic reticulum stress cancer National Cancer Institute R01CA268383 T32CA009213 University of Arizona Cancer Center Support Grant P30CA023074 Integrative Cancer Scholars (ICS)-CRTEC fellowship This research was supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute: R01CA268383, T32CA009213 and the University of Arizona Cancer Center Support Grant P30CA023074.

Introduction Protein homeostasis is critical for cell survival and is achieved through a tightly controlled balance between protein synthesis and degradation. Two major mechanisms govern protein turnover. The ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for the elimination of the majority of proteins, whereas autophagy mediates the degradation of organelles and selected proteins with long half-lives [ 1 2 3 4 The valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97 is a highly conserved member of the AAA+ family of ATPases. p97 is a hexameric protein that can interact with a wide number of protein cofactors through its N-terminal and C-terminal domains [ 5 Figure 1 6 5 6 7 8 Multiple studies have shown that the disruption of p97’s function promotes an accumulation of undegraded proteins, activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), and induction of apoptosis [ 6 9 10 To date, several p97 inhibitors have been developed, including compounds that bind in ATP-competitive and non-competitive manners that achieve reversible or irreversible inhibition [ 9 11 12 13 9 14 15 16 2. Structural Organization and Functional Domains of p97 p97 has four structural domains: a conserved N-terminal domain, two AAA ATPase domains (D1 and D2), and a C-terminal tail, all of which are essential for its function ( Figure 2 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 3. p97’s Role in the Ubiquitin–Proteasome System (UPS) The UPS is the principal cellular machinery responsible for the selective degradation of damaged, misfolded, or short-lived proteins. It plays a fundamental role in maintaining protein homeostasis, regulating cell cycle progression, orchestrating DNA repair, and modulating a wide range of intracellular signaling pathways [ 30 p97 acts as a segregase within the UPS [ 26 31 A classic example of p97’s function within the UPS is its role in ER-associated degradation (ERAD), where it dislocates misfolded or unassembled proteins from the ER membrane for subsequent proteasomal degradation [ 32 33 34 35 36 Through these multifaceted activities, p97 acts as a core orchestrator of protein quality control within the UPS. The dysregulation of p97-mediated UPS processes is implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. In neurodegenerative disorders, impaired UPS function can lead to protein aggregation, contributing to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s [ 37 38 4. Regulation of p97 Activity p97’s activity is tightly regulated by a combination of post-translational modifications, interacting proteins, and cellular stress responses. Collectively, these processes modulate its conformation and substrate binding capacity to ensure precise cellular function. 4.1. Post-Translational Modifications Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are key regulators of p97 function and serve to modulate its conformation, cofactor binding, substrate interactions, and enzymatic activity [ 39 40 41 40 Ubiquitination is another essential mechanism of p97 regulation that significantly influences its function across multiple cellular pathways [ 42 43 44 26 4.2. Cofactor Interactions Cofactor interactions are central to the functional versatility of p97. They enable it to engage in a wide range of cellular processes by guiding its substrate specificity, subcellular localization, and mechanochemical activity [ 45 46 The Npl4-Ufd1 complex plays a fundamental role in mediating p97’s engagement with polyubiquitinated substrates in response to ERAD, DNA damage response, and chromatin-associated protein quality control [ 47 In contrast, p47 modulates p97’s function in membrane trafficking, Golgi reassembly, and nuclear envelope formation [ 48 4.3. Cellular Stress Responses and Signaling Pathways Cellular stress responses and signaling pathways add another layer of p97 regulation that enable it to respond to environmental and proteotoxic challenges. The UPR and heat shock response are key stress responses that impact p97 activity. The activation of the UPR modulates its function in response to protein misfolding or cellular stress [ 49 The activity of p97 is tightly regulated by several upstream signaling pathways that modulate its ATPase function, substrate processing, and interactions with cofactors. For example, Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) phosphorylates p97 at Thr76 [ 50 51 52 53 In the DNA damage response, ATM and ATR kinases indirectly regulate p97 recruitment and function by phosphorylating chromatin-bound cofactors and adaptors such as SPRTN [ 54 55 56 Collectively, these signaling-driven stress responses ensure that p97’s activity is tightly controlled to meet the fluctuating demands of the cell under different conditions. The dysregulation of these mechanisms due to mutation, oncogenic stress, or chronic inflammation can lead to impaired protein quality control, and genomic instability contributes to cancer development and progression ( Table 1 5. ER-Associated Degradation (ERAD) ER-associated degradation (ERAD) is a cellular process responsible for recognizing and disposing of misfolded or unassembled proteins in the ER to maintain protein homeostasis and prevent cellular dysfunction. p97 plays a central role in ERAD by extracting ubiquitinated substrates from the ER membrane and facilitating their delivery to the proteasome for degradation [ 9 5.1. The ERAD Process ERAD involves a coordinated sequence of steps to recognize, ubiquitinate, extract, and degrade misfolded proteins. In the ER lumen, misfolded or unassembled proteins are identified during protein folding and marked for degradation by the addition of ubiquitin moieties [ 60 61 62 5.2. The Central Role of p97 in ERAD p97 functions as a key player in ERAD by orchestrating the extraction of ubiquitinated substrates from the ER membrane. Its role involves both mechanical extraction and coordination with other cellular components, as highlighted by several studies [ 60 63 64 6. Autophagy and p97-Mediated Aggrephagy Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular process involved in the degradation and recycling of damaged or unwanted cellular components [ 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 Aggrephagy is a specialized form of autophagy responsible for the clearance of protein aggregates that serves to maintain cellular homeostasis under stress conditions. p97 has emerged as a key regulator of this process. Recent studies demonstrate that p97 overexpression reduces the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in autophagy-deficient cells overexpressing p62 [ 72 73 Notably, p97’s role in aggrephagy is further modulated by histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), which determines the specificity of aggregate degradation. In the presence of HDAC6, p97 promotes selective aggrephagy by targeting ubiquitinated protein aggregates for autophagic degradation. However, in the absence of HDAC6, p97 facilitates non-selective aggrephagy to enable the degradation of aggregates regardless of their ubiquitination status [ 74 75 74 76 The dysregulation of p97-regulated autophagy has been implicated in several pathological states, most prominently cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. In cancer, enhanced autophagy may support tumor cell survival by alleviating proteotoxic stress [ 2 77 78 79 80 7. p97 in DNA Damage Response The DNA damage response (DDR) is an essential cellular mechanism that preserves genomic stability by detecting, signaling, and repairing DNA lesions. The disruption of DDR pathways can lead to mutations, chromosomal aberrations, and malignant transformation. p97 plays an essential role in supporting DDR processes through the extraction and turnover of ubiquitinated proteins from chromatin. It facilitates the resolution of DNA damage by removing ubiquitylated proteins from sites of DNA lesions [ 81 82 Another major function of p97 in DDR is its role in the homologous recombination repair (HRR) of DSBs. Studies have shown that p97’s interaction with HRR-associated factors is essential for the timely disassembly of protein complexes at stalled replication forks. The loss or inhibition of p97 results in persistent DSBs, chromosomal breaks, and defective HRR [ 83 8. Chromatin Remodeling and Transcriptional Regulation Beyond its established roles in protein degradation and DNA damage response, p97 has emerged as a critical regulator of chromatin remodeling and transcriptional control. Chromatin remodeling involves dynamic alterations in nucleosome positioning and composition to regulate DNA accessibility for transcription, replication, and repair. p97 contributes to this process through chromatin-associated degradation (CAD) [ 84 63 85 Given its essential functions in the maintenance of genomic integrity, it is not surprising that its disruption can have severe consequences. The impairment of p97 activity leads to the accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins on chromatin. This cellular state is known as protein-induced chromatin stress (PICHROS), which disrupts DNA replication, transcription, and repair by physically obstructing access to DNA [ 84 9. p97 and Cancer Cancer cells frequently exhibit high rates of protein synthesis. This leads to significant proteotoxic stress due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and non-stoichiometric protein complexes, which is often exacerbated by aneuploidy [ 37 13 Dysregulated p97 activity contributes to tumor survival, invasion, metastasis, and therapy resistance across multiple cancers [ 7 86 59 57 Table 2 The upregulation of p97 in cancers and their dependency on its function make it an attractive therapeutic target [ 93 14 94 95 96 10. p97 May Be a Transformative Therapeutic Target Given its central role in multiple cellular processes including protein homeostasis, chromatin remodeling, and the DNA damage response, p97 has emerged as a compelling therapeutic target. The dysregulation of p97 activity is implicated in a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and viral infection [ 7 97 Figure 3 9 These inhibitors are classified as ATP-competitive, which target the D1 or D2 ATPase domains to block ATP hydrolysis, or allosteric, which bind outside these domains to alter p97’s conformation. Reversible inhibitors allow transient inhibition, while irreversible inhibitors permanently disable p97. The different classes of p97 inhibitors are characterized by diverse therapeutic profiles, which may enable precision treatment ( Table 3 10.1. CB-5083 and CB-5339 CB-5083 is a first-in-class selective and orally bioavailable inhibitor of p97 and is also the first targeted p97 inhibitor to enter clinical trials. It is a reversible, ATP-competitive compound that specifically targets the critical substrate processing D2 ATPase domain of p97 [ 9 14 9 14 98 CB-5339 is a second-generation orally bioavailable inhibitor of p97 that was developed to overcome the limitations of its predecessor, CB-5083, including off-target toxicities and suboptimal pharmacokinetics ( Figure 4 15 16 13 10.2. N 2 4 DBeQ was the first small-molecule inhibitor identified to selectively target p97 [ 11 99 100 10.3. 2-(2-Amino-1H-benzo[ 62 62 ML240 and ML241 are two additional small molecule inhibitors developed to target the ATPase activity of p97. These compounds are also ATP-competitive and selectively bind to the D2 domain of p97. Both ML240 and ML241 effectively inhibit ERAD, but only ML240 has been shown to inhibit autophagy and induce apoptosis. In contrast, ML241 exhibits milder cellular effects and does not induce apoptosis to the same extent [ 12 12 101 10.4. NMS-873 NMS-873 is regarded as one of the most potent and selective allosteric inhibitors of p97 identified to date. Unlike ATP-competitive inhibitors that target the nucleotide-binding sites directly, NMS-873 binds to a cryptic allosteric site within the D2 ATPase domain [ 102 102 103 104 105 10.5. UPCDC30245 UPCDC-30245 is another allosteric inhibitor of p97. Studies demonstrate that UPCDC-30245 has broad and potent anti-proliferative effects against cancer cells with IC 50 106 CHOP ATF3 107 108 10.6. Eeyarestatin 1 Eeyarestatin I (ESI) is another small molecule p97 inhibitor that disrupts ERAD [ 109 110 11. Clinical Trials of p97 Inhibitors 11.1. CB-5083 As mentioned earlier, CB-5083 is a first-in-class clinical p97 inhibitor developed by Cleave Biosciences. The compound first advanced to first-in-human Phase I clinical trials in 2015. This marked a significant milestone in the validation of p97 as a therapeutic target. Two trials were initiated: NCT02243917 NCT02223598 NCT02243917 NCT02223598 Pharmacodynamic data demonstrated robust target engagement. Within 24 h, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) exhibited a three-fold increase in polyubiquitinated proteins and a four-fold increase in CHOP expression. This is consistent with p97 inhibition and activation of the UPR. However, the trials also revealed significant limitations. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) including nausea, fatigue, and grade 3 diarrhea prevented further dose escalation. Approximately 30% of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse effects. Plasma concentrations of CB-5083 reached ~1 μM, which aligned with preclinical efficacy thresholds. However, tumor biopsies revealed inconsistent drug penetration. This suggested potential pharmacokinetic barriers to achieving uniform target inhibition in vivo. CB-5083 also exhibited off-target effects on phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6), which led to ophthalmological side effects such as transient night blindness. Although the CB-5083 program did not proceed to Phase II trials and was discontinued by 2017, its clinical trajectory parallels the early development of proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib where initial setbacks eventually led to therapeutic breakthroughs. CB-5083’s clinical data established proof-of-concept for pharmacological p97 inhibition and paved the way for the development of next-generation inhibitors with improved potency, selectivity, and safety profiles. 11.2. CB-5339 CB-5339 is a second-generation orally bioavailable inhibitor of p97 that was developed by Cleave Therapeutics as a successor to CB-5083. CB-5339 also selectively targets the D2 ATPase domain of p97, but features enhanced metabolic stability, bioavailability, and reduced off-target effects on PDE6, which were key limitations that hindered CB-5083’s clinical progression. CB-5339 entered clinical evaluation in 2019 through two Phase I trials. NCT04402541 111 NCT04372641 16 The hematologic malignancy study ( NCT04402541 The solid tumor/lymphoma trial ( NCT04372641 Table 4 12. Rational Combination Approaches with p97 Inhibitors 12.1. Protein Homeostasis Disruptors/Inducers of ER Stress Given p97’s central role in protein quality control, combining p97 inhibitors with other agents that disrupt proteostasis such as proteasome inhibitors or ER stress inducers offers a rational strategy to enhance therapeutic efficacy. While p97 inhibition primarily interferes with the extraction and processing of ubiquitinated substrates in pathways such as the UPS and ERAD, proteasome inhibitors block the final degradation of these substrates. When combined, these agents create a synergistic proteotoxic burden by impairing both upstream and downstream components of the degradation pathway [ 94 Under normal physiological conditions, the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER activates the UPR, which is mediated through three principal stress sensors: Inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). These sensors coordinate transcriptional and translational responses that reduce protein synthesis, upregulate chaperones, and enhance the degradation of misfolded proteins [ 112 The dual inhibition of p97 and the proteasome or co-treatment with ER stress–inducing agents such as bortezomib, tunicamycin, or thapsigargin can overwhelm the cell’s ability to resolve misfolded proteins. This strategy enhances CHOP expression, polyubiquitinated protein accumulation, and caspase activation, resulting in greater tumor cell apoptosis. Moreover, pharmacologic or genetic interference with UPR mediators has been shown to sensitize cells to p97 inhibition by further amplifying ER stress and promoting apoptosis [ 113 12.2. DNA Damage/PARP Inhibitors p97 plays a critical function in the DDR by facilitating the extraction and turnover of ubiquitinated proteins from chromatin during DNA repair [ 114 Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is a key nuclear enzyme that acts as a sensor of DNA damage. Upon detecting DNA strand breaks, PARP-1 catalyzes the addition of poly(ADP-ribose) chains (PARylation) to itself and target proteins. This facilitates the recruitment of DNA repair complexes to the site of damage. In this role, PARP-1 supports multiple aspects of genome maintenance as it is involved in base excision repair (BER) by recognizing single-strand breaks (SSBs). p97 also contributes to replication fork stability including the regulation of fork elongation and recognition of unligated Okazaki fragments during lagging strand synthesis [ 112 115 116 117 p97 inhibitors can also prolong PARP1 trapping to enhance PARP inhibitor-induced cytotoxicity in homologous recombination-defective tumor cells [ 118 12.3. Signaling Pathway Inhibitors Combining p97 inhibitors with antagonists of key signaling pathways represents another rational and promising strategy for cancer therapy that leverages the functional crosstalk between protein homeostasis and oncogenic signaling networks. This dual-targeted approach aims to exploit cancer-specific vulnerabilities by disrupting critical survival and proliferation mechanisms simultaneously. p97 inhibition compromises protein degradation, DNA repair, and stress response pathways, which are functions that are often co-opted or upregulated in malignant cells. When combined with signaling pathway inhibitors such as those targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR, MAPK/ERK, or NF-κB, this strategy can amplify cellular stress and tip the balance toward apoptosis [ 119 120 This combination approach offers several therapeutic advantages. First, it promotes enhanced cytotoxicity through the synergistic induction of apoptosis by capitalizing on the interplay between signaling networks and stress response mechanisms. Second, it improves efficacy by overcoming intrinsic or acquired resistance to monotherapies. Third, it provides broader pathway coverage by targeting multiple cancer hallmarks simultaneously. Finally, it offers the potential for a lower dosing of each agent, which may reduce toxicity. 12.4. Autophagy Inhibitors Autophagy inhibitors like hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) represent another promising class of agents to combine with p97 inhibitors [ 121 122 HCQ inhibits autophagy by disrupting lysosomal acidification and blocking autophagosome–lysosome fusion, which impairs the terminal degradation of autophagic cargo. When used in combination with p97 inhibitors, HCQ may effectively prevent the clearance of p97 inhibitor-stimulated aggregates, leading to a significant increase in p62-positive aggregates and defective autophagic clearance [ 123 This combination strategy specifically targets p97’s role in aggrephagy. Tumors characterized by high levels of proteotoxic stress, such as those with aneuploidy, rapid proliferation, or high metabolic activity, are particularly dependent on aggrephagy for survival [ 3 12.5. Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are a mechanistically rational class of agents to combine with p97 inhibitors due to their ability to modulate chromatin accessibility, protein turnover, and cellular stress responses [ 124 125 HDAC6 plays a distinct role in maintaining proteostasis by regulating aggresome formation and the autophagic clearance of misfolded proteins [ 126 127 75 12.6. Immunotherapies The integration of p97 inhibition with the immune checkpoint blockade represents a novel and emerging strategy in cancer treatment [ 128 129 p97 contributes to the processing and degradation of misfolded or defective proteins via the UPS and ERAD pathways, which intersect with the antigen processing machinery. The inhibition of p97 may increase the intracellular pool of peptides available for MHC-I loading by impairing degradation and enhancing the accumulation of antigenic peptide precursors. This could lead to the elevated surface expression of MHC-I molecules and improved tumor immunogenicity. Combining p97 inhibitors with immune checkpoint inhibitors like anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 antibodies could therefore result in a more immunostimulatory tumor microenvironment [ 130 13. Future Directions p97 has emerged as a multifunctional regulator of proteostasis, chromatin dynamics, and stress responses. These hallmarks are increasingly exploited by cancer cells to sustain survival under stress conditions. Acting at the crossroads of critical cellular processes such as ERAD, the UPS, CAD, aggrephagy, DNA damage repair, and transcriptional regulation, p97 enables tumor cells to navigate both proteotoxic and genotoxic stress. Notably, its consistent overexpression across malignancies and the absence of inactivating mutations underscore p97’s role as a non-oncogene addiction. These factors make it a highly compelling therapeutic target in cancer. The development of small molecule p97 inhibitors has validated this concept in preclinical models with compounds like CB-5083 and CB-5339, demonstrating the capacity to disrupt multiple survival pathways and induce tumor regression. Although the clinical translation of p97 inhibitors has faced significant challenges, including dose-limiting toxicities, CB-5339 has shown promising signs of efficacy in patients with hematologic malignancies and solid tumors in early-phase clinical trials. The collective clinical experience to date with p97 inhibitors highlights the need for refined therapeutic strategies to fully harness p97’s vulnerability. Recent advances in the structural and biochemical characterization of p97, coupled with innovative discovery methods, have revealed numerous allosteric and regulatory sites. These discoveries offer the potential to develop next-generation inhibitors with improved selectivity and safety profiles. Moreover, the possibility of function-specific modulation, such as selectively targeting p97’s roles in ERAD, CAD, or aggrephagy, opens new avenues for precision therapeutic approaches. Combination therapies represent another promising strategy. There is a clear preclinical rationale supporting the combination of p97 inhibitors with proteasome inhibitors, autophagy disruptors, DNA-damaging agents, HDAC inhibitors, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. These rational combinations can synergistically trigger apoptosis-inducing levels of cellular stress, overcome mechanisms of drug resistance, and broaden the therapeutic index of p97 inhibitors. While novel combination therapies may enhance the anticancer efficacy of p97 inhibitors, care must be taken as this may also result in additional adverse events. Moving forward, future research must prioritize the identification of biomarkers of p97 dependency to enable patient stratification and precision therapy. A deeper understanding of tumor-specific reliance on p97’s distinct functions will be essential for guiding clinical decision-making. In parallel, combinatorial regimens should be optimized to maximize efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Their clinical translation should ideally be supported by predictive preclinical models and translational biomarkers of response to optimize success. 14. Conclusions In summary, p97 represents a uniquely positioned therapeutic target at the interface of protein homeostasis, genome stability, and transcriptional control. Continued investment in drug discovery, mechanistic insight, and rational combination strategies holds the promise of transforming p97 inhibition from a conceptual opportunity into a clinically impactful cancer therapy.
