Highlights • FEED, EFD, and PPND studies may not be necessary to assess reproductive toxicity. • The main reason for the waiver was to comply with ICH S5, S6 and S9 guidelines. • The strategy for DART studies differs according to the ICH guidelines. • The strategy for DART studies differs according to drug characteristics. Studies on reproductive toxicity are conducted to assess the effects of chemicals and pharmaceuticals on the reproductive function and fetal development. However, depending on the indication or modality, Fertility and Early Embryonic Development (FEED), Embryo-Fetal Development (EFD), and Pre/Postnatal Development (PPND) studies which evaluate all reproductive stages or EFD studies in a second species may not be necessary. Therefore, based on the Common Technical Document (CTD), PMDA review reports, and other documents of drugs with new active ingredients approved in Japan, we aimed to investigate the implementation status of DART studies by classifying the studies into FEED, EFD, and PPND types, and summarizing the reasons for not conducting the studies. This survey was conducted by the Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity Team of the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (JPMA) to address issues related to DART studies conducted as non-clinical studies for drug development. Of the three DART studies, 35% of drugs received marketing application without conducting EFD studies in at least one species. Among the three study types, PPND studies were the second most frequently waivered, with 36% not conducted. FEED studies had the lowest implementation rate among the three types of studies, with 40% not conducted. The primary reason for waiving at least one study was compliance with ICH S5, S6, S9, and M3 guidelines. In conclusion, the necessity of DART studies varied depending on the applicable ICH guideline and the characteristics of the drug, including therapeutic indication, target, endogenous substances, low exposure, and ADA formation. This suggests that the need for DART studies may be waived because of various reasons, each of which should be justified based on scientific rationale and risk analysis.

Consequently, these studies play critical roles in ensuring safety, particularly during the approval of new medicinal products. Their primary objective is to assess the effects of a drug on reproductive function, reproductive organs, and fertility of parents. Additionally, it is important to assess the effects of the drug on fetal development to determine how they affect the embryo, fetus, and postnatal development and to evaluate the effects on the next generation and verify long-term impacts. Meanwhile, reducing animal use in non-clinical studies is an important focus of the scientific community, ethics groups, and regulatory agencies. The “3R” principles (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) in animal ethics emphasize minimizing animal use and distress in experiments ( Farnaud, 2009 in vitro Park and Hunter, 2024 Hutchinson, 2002 in silico Wu et al., 2013 Weyrich et al., 2022 Matthews et al., 2006 Huh et al., 2011 Low et al., 2021 Ribas et al., 2021 Yaksi et al., 2021 Sasaki et al., 2011 This survey was conducted by the Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (JPMA) team to answer the question, “Is it necessary to conduct all DART studies [Fertility and Early Embryonic Development (FEED), Embryo-Fetal Development (EFD), and Pre/Postnatal Development (PPND) studies] in the application package for a drug with a new active ingredient?” DART studies are commonly performed in drug safety evaluations but are not always considered essential. The decision to perform a DART study is based on the characteristics of the drug and anticipated risks. Thus, depending on the product use, route of exposure, and existing data, it may be appropriate to waive the need for DART studies. Therefore, safety evaluations of pharmaceuticals should be based on scientific rationale and risk analysis to determine whether additional DART studies are necessary. This is because the requirements for DART studies vary for each drug and may not depend on the indication, treatment duration, extent of exposure, or nature of the therapy alone. Furthermore, the required test items are determined based on guidelines from regulatory authorities [Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), etc.] or regulatory guidelines [e.g., International Council for Harmonization (ICH)]. This can include special conditions and exceptions; however, if sufficient data are available for an existing compound of the same chemical class, new testing may be waived. In such cases, redundant testing may be avoided by leveraging existing data. Risk assessments based on indications, patient population, route of exposure, and exposure can thus determine the need for DART studies. In general, small-molecule drugs that are not categorized as anti-neoplastic drugs have been investigated in three types of DART studies (FEED, EFD and PPND) to evaluate all reproductive stages in accordance with the guidelines for DART studies (ICH S5) ( Bailey et al., 2009 We classified the Common Technical Document (CTD), PMDA review reports, package inserts, and interview forms of drugs with new active ingredients approved in Japan from 2017 to 2023, which are publicly available on the PMDA website, into FEED, EFD, and PPND studies, and investigated the implementation status of DART studies. Based on the results of this survey, the reasons for not conducting DART studies (compliance with each ICH guideline, low systemic exposure due to topical administration, and anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation) were summarized and discussed. This survey focuses on DART studies commonly required under ICH guidelines, based on indications, and modalities and shares effective strategies for marketing application submissions for drug development. 2 Methods In this study, we surveyed 266 drugs with new active ingredients approved in Japan between 2017 and 2023 that were publicly available on the PMDA website. Based on CTD, PMDA review reports, package inserts, and interview forms, we classified the data as FEED, EFD, or PPND. The presence or absence of DART studies was checked, and if not conducted, the reasons were recorded. These reasons were classified into 24 categories based on the ICH guidelines and reasons for non-implementation. Using this classification, the need for DART studies was determined based on the specific circumstances and conditions in each case. Although not included in the survey results as they were not the primary reasons for not conducting the DART studies, “Genotoxicity was observed” or “No findings were observed in reproductive organs during repeated-dose toxicity studies” was noted in the application documents and PMDA review reports of some cases ( Table 1 Table 1 Rationale for not conducting reproductive and developmental toxicity studies. 1 Drugs targeting foreign targets (without cross-reactivity with human reproductive tissues) (in accordance with ICH S6: Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals) 2 A serious disease before attainment of reproductive age 3 Drugs using naturally occurring substances 4 Indication for pregnant women only 5 Indication for males only (in accordance with ICH M3: Timing of Nonclinical Studies for the Conduct of Clinical Studies) 6 A GLP study was not conducted because EFD was observed in the preliminary study (in accordance with ICH S9: Antineoplastic Agents for Patients with Advanced Cancer) 7 Resulted in insufficient exposure in animals (dose-limiting toxicity) 8 Drugs utilizing endogenous substances in humans 9 Indication for menopausal patients only (in accordance with ICH M3) 10 Low human exposure and short duration of clinical use 11 When systemic exposure is expected to be low due to local administration 12 Cases where no relevant species exist for safety evaluation (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) (in accordance with ICH S6) 13 When it is difficult to evaluate the toxicity with long-term exposure due to ADA production 14 Not performed for combination product (in accordance with ICH M3) 15 Radiopharmaceuticals 16 If the safety has been evaluated by literature review 17 Only non-human primates (NHPs) can be evaluated (in accordance with ICH S6) 18 Anti-cancer drugs for patients with advanced cancer (in accordance with ICH S9) 19 When the life expectancy of the patient is short (in accordance with ICH M3) 20 If the administration period is until delivery (little effect on breast milk) 21 Evaluated using approved drugs 22 Vaccine (Vaccine for preventing infection guideline) 23 An EFD study in the second species was not conducted because embryo-fetal toxicity was observed in the EFD study in the first species (in accordance with ICH S9) 24 When embryo-fetal toxicity is anticipated from the pharmacological action (in accordance with ICH S5: Guideline on Evaluation of Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity of Drugs) 3 Results Of the three DART studies, 65 % of drugs conducted EFD studies in a second species. Thus, 35 % of these drugs were approved without conducting even a first-species EFD study. PPND studies were the second most frequently conducted, with a 64 % implementation rate and 36 % not conducted. The FEED studies had the lowest implementation rate among the three studies, with an implementation rate of 60 %, and 40 % not conducted ( Fig. 1 1. In accordance with ICH S6, the need for DART studies was waived in four cases because the drug targeted an adventitious agent (without cross-reactivity with human reproductive tissues). Consequently, these drugs were submitted for marketing approval without conducting any FEED, EFD, or PPND studies ( Table 2 Table 2 Drugs targeting foreign targets (without cross-reactivity with human reproductive tissues) (in accordance with ICH S6) ( Bezlotoxumab (Genetical Recombination), 2017 Tixagevimab (Genetical Recombination) and Cilgavimab (Genetical Recombination), 2022 Casirivimab (Genetical Recombination)/Imdevimab, 2021 pH 4-Treated normal human immunoglobulin (subcutaneous injection), 2023 Drug name Indication Bezlotoxumab Prevention of recurrence of Clostridium difficile infection Tixagevimab/Cilgavimab Infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 and its suppression Casirivimab (Genetical Recombination)/Imdevimab (Genetical Recombination) Disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 pH 4-Treated normal human immunoglobulin A- or hypogammaglobulinemia ICH S6 states that “For products that are directed at a foreign target such as bacteria and viruses, in general no DART studies would be expected. ”Therefore, biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals that specifically bind to adventitious agents and do not cross-react with human reproductive tissues, such as monoclonal antibodies and human immunoglobulins, are typically exempted from DART studies. 2. In one case, a waiver of the DART study was granted because the indication for the drug was for a serious disease before reaching childbearing age; Cerliponase alpha injection (indication: Ceroid type 2 (CLN2)). An application for marketing approval was filed without conducting any of the three DART studies: FEED, EFD, or PPND. CLN2 is an ultra-rare, severe genetic disorder associated with progressive neurodegeneration and is characterized by a deficiency in the lysosomal serine protease tripeptidyl peptidase 1 ( Nickel et al., 2018 Worgall et al., 2007 Schulz et al., 2018 3. The need for a DART study was waived in one case because of the natural presence of the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Cedar Pollen extract Bulk Powder (indication: Cedar pollinosis (hyposensitization therapy)) is a bulk powder of the Japanese cedar pollen extract, which is administered orally. FEED and PPND studies were not conducted; however, an EFD study in rats was conducted. No reports suggesting DART-related effects of cedar pollen-derived components are available, although EFD study in rats have shown no effect on embryos and fetuses. Moreover, cedar pollen is naturally occurring, and humans are exposed to large amounts of it every spring. Therefore, this drug was considered unlikely to affect reproductive function, and no PPND study was conducted. 4. In another case, the need for a DART study was waived because the drug was administered only to pregnant women, up to delivery, and there was little concern regarding excretion into breast milk. Spiramycin, indicated for the suppression of congenital toxoplasmosis development, is a large molecule that is administered orally. A FEED study was not conducted because Spiramycin was administered only to pregnant women with Toxoplasma infections. EFD studies have been conducted in mice, rats, and rabbits; however, no PPND studies have been conducted. A PPND study was not conducted because the administration of this drug is limited to delivery in principle, and the influence of Spiramycin on breast milk was considered unlikely (Item 20). 5. In six cases, waivers for DART studies were granted because the drug was indicated only for men, in accordance with the ICH M3: Timing of non-clinical studies to support the conduct of human clinical trials. These agents are listed in Table 3 Table 3 Indication for males only (in accordance with ICH M3) ( Viltolarsen, 2020 Apalutamide, 2019 Pegol, 2018 Darolutamide, 2019 Beta, 2020 Pegol, 2018 Drug name Indication Viltolarsen Duchenne muscular dystrophy Apalutamide Castration-resistant prostate cancer Damoctocog Alfa Pegol Control of bleeding tendency in patients with blood coagulation factor VIII deficiency Darolutamide Castration-resistant prostate cancer Idursulfase Beta Mucopolysaccharidosis type II patients requiring improvement of central nervous system symptoms Nonacog Beta Pegol Control of bleeding tendency in patients with blood coagulation factor IX deficiency Although EFD and PPND studies have not been conducted on these drugs, many drugs have only undergone FEED studies in males. For diseases with very few female patients (e.g., mucopolysaccharidosis type II), female participants were not included in clinical studies. Although the safety of these drugs has not been established in non-clinical studies, its use has been permitted based on a risk–benefit assessment. All other drugs indicated for male-only diseases followed similar waiver criteria. 6. In accordance with the Q & A documents of ICH S9, three waivers were granted for GLP reproduction studies due to embryo-fetal toxicity findings in preliminary EFD studies. A preliminary EFD study of Lorlatinib, for ALK-positive, unresectable, advanced/recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, was conducted in rats and the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was not established based on maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity. However, in a preliminary EFD study in rabbits, maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, and teratogenicity were observed with the NOAEL being at a low dose. Additionally, a NOAEL for Valemetostat Tosilate tablets (indication: Relapsed or refractory adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma) was not established based on maternal toxicity, embryo-fetal toxicity, and teratogenicity observed in a preliminary EFD study in rats. Futivatinib, indicated for FGFR2 fusion-positive, unresectable biliary tract cancer progressing after cancer chemotherapy, was shown to exhibit embryo-fetal toxicity and teratogenicity in the absence of maternal toxicity in a preliminary EFD study in rats, with the NOAEL determined to be a low dose. 7. One drug was granted a waiver for the DART study due to insufficient exposure in laboratory animals caused by dose-limiting toxicity. Sacubitril valsartan sodium hydrate (indicated for chronic heart failure) is administered orally. FEED study in rats and EFD studies in rats and rabbits have been conducted, but a PPND study has not been conducted. Dose-limiting toxicities were observed in the stomach (mucosal hyperplasia/vacuolation of the squamous epithelium) and kidneys (hypertrophy/hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells) in mice and rats after 13 weeks of oral dosing. Therefore, a PPND study was not conducted because it was assumed that sacubitril and valsartan would not provide sufficient exposure relative to the clinical exposure. There have been reports of fetal/neonatal deaths, teratogenicity, and adverse effects of sacubitril valsartan sodium hydrate in patients who received sacubitril valsartan sodium hydrate from the middle to late stage of pregnancy, and the toxicity profile during pregnancy and lactation has already been established ( Anon, 1997 Briggs and Nageotte, 2001 8. In eight cases, the need for DART studies was waived because the active ingredient of the drug was either endogenous or analogous to human substances. Among the survey items, eight drugs for FEED, five for EFD, and eight for PPND were exempted from DART study requirements. These agents are listed in Table 4 Table 4 Drugs utilizing endogenous substances in humans ( pH 4-Treated normal human immunoglobulin, 2021 Andexanet alfa (genetical recombination), 2022 Acid, 2022 Extract, 2022 Alfa, 2022 Lyophilized human alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor concentrate, 2020 Alfa, 2017 Alfa, 2020 Drug name Active ingredient pH 4-Treated normal human immunoglobulin Human immunoglobulin G Andexanet Alfa Modification of endogenous protein (FXa) in the blood coagulation cascade Cholic Acid Capsules Cholic acid Pineapple stem extract Pineapple stem extract (Once in the blood, the substance is degraded into peptides and amino acids and eliminated.) Vonicog Alfa rVWF (same effect as endogenous VWF) Lyophilized Human Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor Concentrate Human plasma proteins Lonoctocog Alfa FVIII (endogenous protein) Simoctocog Alfa Factor VIII 9. In accordance with ICH M3, four drugs were granted waivers for DART studies in menopausal patients for whom the drugs were indicated. These agents are listed in Table 5 Table 5 Indication for menopausal patients only (in accordance with ICH M3) ( Lyophilized human alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor concentrate, 2020 Andexanet alfa (genetical recombination), 2022 Lecanemab (Genetical Recombination), 2023 Vaccine, 2023 Drug name Indication Lyophilized Human Alpha1-Proteinase Inhibitor Concentrate Severe alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency Andexanet Alfa Neutralization of anticoagulant effect during life-threatening or intractable bleeding episodes in patients receiving direct-acting factor Xa inhibitors Lecanemab Suppress progression of mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease Recombinant RSV Vaccine Prevention of RSV infection Severe α1-antitrypsin deficiency is a disease that leads to emphysema and COPD due to a deficiency in circulating α1-antitrypsin, which inhibits proteolytic enzymes ( Mulgrew et al., 2007 Köhnlein and Welte, 2008 Fregonese and Stolk, 2008 Hutchison, 1988 10. Three drugs were granted waivers from the DART studies because of their low human exposure and short duration of clinical use. A PPND study was not conducted for Midenepag isopropyl ophthalmic solution, indicated for glaucoma and ocular hypertension, because of its very low exposure. The minimum anticipated biological effect level, based on the agonist activity of endogenous Prostaglandin E2 at EP receptors, was 660-fold higher than the human Cmax at the proposed dose. Whereas a PPND study of Fidaxomicin Tablets (indication: Infectious enterocolitis) was not conducted because of the short clinical use duration (10 days) and very low plasma concentrations in humans (134-fold margin of safety for rat EFD). Additionally, purified pineapple stem extract, indicated for the removal of necrotic tissues in burns, is removed approximately 4 h after topical application to the burn wound; after entering the bloodstream, it is degraded into peptides and amino acids before being eliminated. Therefore, FEED and PPND studies were not conducted. 11. Regarding topically administered products, the ICH S1A guideline (Carcinogenicity study Guideline) states that “Pharmaceuticals administered by the ocular route may not require carcinogenicity studies unless there is cause for concern or unless there is significant systemic exposure.” Additionally, we investigated whether DART studies can be waived for drugs with very low systemic exposure. The investigation revealed that no drug was granted a waiver for all DART studies solely due to low systemic exposure from topical administration. Oral dosing DART studies have been conducted with transdermal donepezil, indicated for suppression of progression of dementia symptoms in patients with Alzheimer-type dementia, however, DART studies have not been conducted for donepezil patches. In addition, the exposure after percutaneous use of this drug was similar to that after oral administration. FEED and EFD (subcutaneous administration) studies were conducted for the Omidenepag Isopropyl Ophthalmic Solution, indicated for glaucoma and ocular hypertension, but no PPND study was conducted. The rationale for not conducting a PPND study was that the exposure was considered very low due to topical administration (the minimum anticipated biological effect level based on the agonist activity of endogenous PGE2 at EP receptors is 660-fold higher than the human Cmax at the proposed dose), and the pharmacologically based reproductive toxicity profile is predictable from an existing oral drug (PGE2). 12. In accordance with ICH S6, certain DART studies were waived (e.g., monoclonal antibodies) because there were no relevant animal species for drug safety evaluation. Among the survey items, nine drugs for FEED, nine drugs for EFD, and eight drugs for PPND were exempted from DART study requirements. ICH S6 (R1) states that “When the clinical candidate is pharmacologically active only in NHPs, there is still a preference to test the clinical candidate. Additionally, an alternative model can be used in place of NHPs if appropriate scientific justification is provided. However, when no relevant animal species exist for testing a clinical candidate, the use of transgenic mice expressing the human target or a homologous protein in a species expressing an ortholog of the human target can be considered, assuming that sufficient background knowledge exists for the model (e.g., historical background data). In general, no DART studies are expected for products directed at a foreign target such as bacteria and viruses.” Waivers for DART studies were documented in the application dossiers and PMDA review reports, and granted by the regulatory authorities, on the basis that these guidelines were followed. 13. In some cases, DART studies were waived because it was difficult to evaluate safety after long-term exposure, as the drug produces ADA when administered to animals. Among the survey items, six drugs for FEED, nine drugs for EFD, and six drugs for PPND were exempted from DART study requirements ( Romosozumab (Genetical Recombination), 2019 Pegol, 2018 Pegol, 2019 Alfa, 2021 Alfa, 2020 Efanesoctocog alfa (genetical recombination), 2023 Alfa, 2024 Epcoritamab (Genetical Recombination), 2023 Alfa, 2024 14. According to ICH M3, the DART study of the combination product was waived in one case because the DART of the single product had already been evaluated. Among all survey items, three drugs for FEED, five drugs for EFD, and four drugs for PPND were exempted from DART study requirements. ICH M3 states that, “in cases where the patient population includes WOCBP and studies with individual agent(s) have shown findings indicative of embryo-fetal risk, combination studies are not recommended when a potential human developmental hazard has already been identified. Additionally, if non-clinical embryo-fetal studies have indicated that neither agent poses a potential human developmental risk, combination studies are not recommended, unless concerns exist that the combination of individual components could pose a hazard to humans.” The waiver was granted on the grounds that these guidelines were followed. 15. DART studies are not required for radiopharmaceuticals. Among all survey items, two drugs for FEED, two drugs for EFD, and two drugs for PPND were exempted from approval. The FDA guideline for oncology therapeutic Radiopharmaceuticals: Non-clinical studies and Labeling Recommendations Guidance for industry states that “No genetic or reproductive toxicity or carcinogenicity study of a radiopharmaceutical or cold pharmaceutical is warranted during drug development or for approval. Thus, alpha, beta, and gamma radiation cause deoxyribonucleic acid damage and are inherently genotoxic and carcinogenic, damaging male and female germ cells and developing conceptuses.” Consequently, the waiver was based on the rationale provided in the guidelines. 16. Additionally, studies on DART are not required if safety has been assessed through a literature review. Among all survey items, one drug for EFD was exempted from DART study requirements. ICH S6 (R1) states that “When the weight of evidence (e.g., mechanism of action, phenotypic data from genetically modified animals, class effects) suggests that there will be an adverse effect on fertility or pregnancy outcome, these data can provide adequate information to communicate risk to reproduction, and under appropriate circumstances additional non-clinical studies might not be warranted. In addition, extensive public information may be available regarding the potential reproductive and/or developmental effects of a particular class of compounds (e.g., interferons), where the only relevant species is non-human primates. In such cases, mechanistic studies indicating that similar effects are likely caused by a new but related molecule may obviate the need for formal DART studies. In each case, a scientific basis for assessing potential effects on reproduction and development should be provided.” Consequently, the waiver was granted based on compliance with the guidelines. 17. Some DART studies may be waived if only NHPs can be evaluated for safety in accordance with ICH S6. Of all the drugs investigated, fourteen were exempted from FEED study requirements. ICH S6 (R1) states that “Mating studies are impractical for NHPs. However, when the NHP is the only relevant species, the potential effects on male and female fertility can be assessed by evaluating the reproductive tract (organ weights and histopathological evaluation) in repeated-dose toxicity studies of at least 3 months duration using sexually mature NHPs.” waiver was granted based on these guidelines. 18. Some DART studies may be waived for anti-neoplastic drugs (S9) in patients with advanced cancer. Among all survey items, thirty-nine drugs for FEED and forty-two drugs for PPND were exempted from DART study requirements. Section ICH S9 states that “Studies on male and female fertility and early embryonic development for implantation are not needed to support clinical trials or marketing of therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer. The effects of pharmaceuticals on the reproductive organs from general toxicology studies should be used as the basis for assessing impaired fertility in males and females. A study of pre- and postnatal development, including maternal function, is generally not required to support clinical trials or marketing of therapeutics intended to treat patients with advanced cancer. Embryo-fetal studies for anticancer pharmaceuticals should be conducted to support marketing but are not considered essential to support clinical trials intended to treat patients with advanced cancer. These studies are also not considered essential for marketing applications of pharmaceuticals that are genotoxic and target rapidly dividing cells (e.g., crypt cells, bone marrow) or belong to a class that has been well characterized as causing developmental toxicity.” The waiver was granted based on compliance with the guidelines. 19. In one case, a waiver of the DART studies was granted because of the short life expectancies of the indicated patients. Among all survey items, one drug was exempted from the PPND study requirement. A PPND study was not conducted because patients with cancer cachexia, for whom Anamorelin is indicated for cancer cachexia in malignant tumors have a short life expectancy, and the possibility of pregnancy or delivery during treatment can be excluded. 20. In one case, a waiver of DART was granted because the drug was administered until delivery and the effect of excretion into breast milk was limited. Among all survey items, one drug was exempted from the PPND study requirement. Spiramycin (indication: Prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis) is administered to pregnant women suspected of having primary Toxoplasma infection until delivery. Since Spiramycin is generally administered to humans until delivery, it is unlikely that Spiramycin would significantly transfer into breast milk. Although the effect of perinatal administration of Spiramycin on delivery or birth has not been examined, it is unlikely that there are major concerns based on the safety information, including clinical use results. Therefore, no additional PPND study was considered necessary for safety evaluation. A FEED study was not conducted because Spiramycin administration was limited to pregnant women with Toxoplasma infections (Item 4). 21. The need for DART studies may also be waived by assessing the safety profiles of the approved drugs based on their DART data. Among the survey items, seven drugs for FEED, eight drugs for EFD, and seven drugs for PPND were exempted from DART study requirements. 22. In accordance with the guidelines for the prevention of infection, some DART studies on vaccines are not required. Among all the survey items, four drugs for FEED, ten drugs for EFD, and three drugs for PPND were exempted from DART study requirements. The guideline on non-clinical studies of vaccines for prevention of infectious diseases states that “An assessment of FEED to implantation is warranted when there is cause for concern about effects on reproductive organs based on histopathology findings from repeated-dose toxicity studies. The evaluation of EFD and PPND, including maternal function, is determined by clinical indications and the need for vaccination. Studies are usually conducted in a single species, and the dosing interval and frequency are determined by considering the design of the clinical trial.” in addition, the ICH S5 guidelines state that “The type of DART study for a prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine depends on the intended vaccine population and the associated DART risk. Generally, DART studies are not warranted for vaccines developed for neonates, pre-pubertal children, or the elderly.” The waiver was granted based on compliance with these guidelines. 23. In accordance with ICH S9, EFD studies on the second species were sometimes waived because of embryo-fetal toxicity in EFD studies on the first species. Of all the products investigated, fifteen drugs for EFD were exempted from the second-species EFD study requirement. Section ICH S9 states that “for small molecules, EFD studies are typically conducted in two species as described by ICH S5(R2). In cases where an EFD study is positive for embryo-fetal lethality or teratogenicity, a confirmatory study of a second species is usually not warranted.” The waivers were granted because the cases were consistent with these guidelines. 24. According to ICH S5, certain DART studies are not required if pharmacological action predicts embryo-fetal toxicity. Among all survey items, five drugs for FEED, eighteen drugs for EFD, and nine drugs for PPND were exempted from DART study requirements. ICH S5 (R3) states that “Evidence suggesting an adverse effect of the intended pharmacological mechanism on EFD (e.g., mechanism of action, phenotypic data from genetically modified animals) can be sufficient to communicate risk.” The waiver was granted based on compliance with the guideline. Fig. 1 Subject of investigation. The survey analyzed 266 new active ingredient drugs approved in Japan between 2017 and 2023, based on publicly available data from the PMDA website. Blue bar chart: The number of drugs for which FEED, EFD, or PPND studies were not conducted; Red bar chart: The number of drugs for which FEED, EFD, or PPND studies were conducted. 4 Discussion We investigated the current status of DART studies on drugs containing new active ingredients approved in Japan and the reasons for exemption from these studies and discussed the trends and issues. Our results showed that DART studies are not always required, depending on the characteristics of the drugs and ICH guidelines (ICH S5, S6, S9, and M3) ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Reason for not conducting Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity studies. Based on the marketing application submissions, PMDA review reports, package inserts, and interview forms, the waivered reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were reviewed and the reasons were classified into 24 categories. Blue bar chart: Number of FEED studies that were waivered; Red bar chart: number of EFD studies that were waivered; Green bar chart: Number of PPND studies that were waivered. The most common reason for waiving EFD was the anticipated embryo-fetal toxicity based on pharmacology (in accordance with ICH S5). Another common reason was that “An EFD study of the second species was not conducted because embryo-fetal toxicity was observed in the EFD study in the first species (in accordance with ICH S9).” Whereas the most common reason for waiving the FEED and PPND studies was “anti-neoplastic agents in patients with advanced cancer (in accordance with ICH S9).” A common reason for the FEED study-specific waiver was that only NHPs could be evaluated (in accordance with ICH S6), as this is a surrogate for the evaluation of reproductive organs in repeat-dose toxicity studies lasting at least three months. Other reasons for unwillingness to conduct DART studies according to the drug profile, include indications, target molecules, endogenous substances, exposure, safety assessment based on historical data, and ADA. 5 Conclusion Based on the CTD, PMDA review reports, etc. of drugs with new active ingredients approved in Japan, the implementation status of DART studies was classified into FEED, EFD, and PPND, and reasons for not conducting the studies were summarized. Of the three DART studies, 35 % of drugs were submitted for marketing approval without conducting EFD studies in at least one species. Among the three study types, PPND studies were the second most frequently waivered, with 36 % not conducted. FEED studies had the lowest implementation rate among the three studies, with 40 % not conducted. The primary reason for waiving at least one study was compliance with ICH S5, S6, S9, and M3 guidelines. In conclusion, the necessity of DART studies varied depending on the applicable ICH guideline and the characteristics of the drug, including therapeutic indication, target, endogenous substances, low exposure, and ADA formation. Based on our findings, it is evident that conducting DART studies depends on the circumstances and conditions being considered. As decisions are made on a case-by-case basis through discussions with regulatory authorities and expert risk assessments, it is important to refer to current regulatory guidelines and scientific rationale. Additionally, an adequate risk–benefit analysis should be undertaken, and appropriate studies and data should be collected as necessary. This is because decisions regarding the final study design and conduct were based on specific regulatory guidelines and circumstances. These approaches might minimize the use of animals and maximize ethical considerations in DART studies. We hope that the results of this survey will serve as reference information to efficiently obtain scientific data for approval applications of pharmaceutical products while addressing ethical issues related to animal experiments by actively adopting the principles of the 3Rs throughout the pharmaceutical industry.
