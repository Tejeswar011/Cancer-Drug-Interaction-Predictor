In this manuscript, we share insights from our experience developing and delivering a lung cancer-focused lay navigator program in a low-resource community in the Mojave Desert. We identified transportation concerns, Internet needs, and financial concerns as the most common barriers to care among patients scheduled for lung cancer detection/management at our institution. Patients who had a lung cancer diagnosis at enrollment were more likely to report barriers to care. Time spent navigating a patient was longer for patients with a greater number of barriers. Crisis-focused and after-hours navigation calls were more frequently initiated by older and advanced cancer patients. Overall, we identified neighborhood context and barrier resource planning as important considerations to improve the implementation of our patient navigation program within our institution’s clinical practice network. Abstract Barriers to cancer care, including transportation and Internet insecurity, are of special concern in low-resource communities. A patient-centered, telehealth-based, barrier-focused lay navigator program may mitigate such barriers. We share insights from a quality improvement project wherein we developed and delivered a lay navigator program in a low-resource community in the Mojave Desert. We identified 68 patients scheduled for lung cancer detection/management at our institution, 55 of whom completed a barrier assessment, enrolled in the program, and could be evaluated. Participants were predominantly older (76%), White (84%), had a cancer diagnosis at enrollment (69%), and lived in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods. Thirty-three (60%) patients had ≥1 barrier, the most common being transportation (31%), Internet (24%), and financial (24%) concerns. These barriers were more frequent among patients with a lung cancer diagnosis at enrollment. Crisis-focused and after-hours encounters were more frequently initiated by older and advanced cancer patients. Transportation and Internet concerns were significantly associated with missed appointment rates. While the scope of our findings is limited, the delivery of a telehealth-based, barrier-focused lay lung navigator program in this low-resource setting was feasible. Neighborhood context and barrier resource planning are important for the implementation of similar programs within our institution’s clinical practice network. telehealth lay navigation lung cancer low-resource community patient-centered practical barriers National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) AstraZeneca This study was supported by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) through a grant provided by AstraZeneca.

Introduction Low-resource communities receive disproportionately worse cancer treatment and delivery of services than high-resource communities, primarily due to inequitable access to the benefits of scientific advances [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Patients with lung cancer often face significant barriers to care due to disparities in access to screening and the shame and stigma associated with smoking [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 Using patient navigation to alleviate practical barriers, such as transportation or Internet challenges, and coordinating complex cancer care may improve the quality and timeliness of healthcare for patients with lung cancer in low-resource communities. The success of patient navigation is rooted in patient-centeredness, defined by the National Academy of Medicine (USA) as “providing care that is respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient preferences, needs, and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions” [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Importantly, prior lay navigation programs have primarily involved telephonic or mixed interventions. This is pertinent, given that virtual navigation can increase patient access to cancer navigation and education [ 24 25 26 Guided by the findings and principles discussed above, we initiated the City of Hope (COH)-Antelope Valley (AV) Lung Cancer Navigator Program, a telehealth-based, barrier-focused lay navigator program for patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer or imaging findings concerning lung cancer in AV, a low-resource community located in the western region of the Mojave Desert. We undertook this navigator program as a quality improvement (QI) project to gain insights into (1) thoracic cancer care barriers perceived by patients at COH; (2) healthcare resource challenges and neighborhood disadvantages related to vulnerable communities served by COH [ 27 2. Methods The COH-AV Lung Cancer Navigator Program was planned, delivered, and evaluated over 34 months from February 2022 to December 2024. Eligible patients required a presentation of suspicious radiographic findings in the lung(s) or a diagnosis of lung cancer under evaluation for treatment at COH-AV at the time of enrollment. This QI project was reviewed and approved by the COH Institutional Review Board (IRB number: 21654, approval date: 19 November 2021). The QI project was carried out in full compliance with ethical standards and institutional policies. Reporting adhered to the Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence (SQUIRE) 2.0 guidelines [ 28 2.1. Setting The QI project was delivered at COH-AV, a clinical practice site of medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and non-thoracic surgical specialists. COH-AV, a part of the COH medical enterprise, is located in Lancaster, California, within AV, a 3000-square-mile region at the western tip of the Mojave Desert that straddles the northern Los Angeles and southern Kern counties. The area is a low-resource community, with fragmented health care delivery, impaired neighborhood infrastructure, high tobacco use [ 29 30 31 29 32 33 2.2. Intervention The intervention included telephone-based encounters with the lay navigator to assess barriers, listen to concerns, and provide coordination of care. The program navigator was an individual who lived in the AV community for more than 30 years and worked within the COH health care system for 11 years as a medical assistant and administrator. The navigator received (1) 160 training hours on the skills, role, responsibilities, and scope of a lay patient navigator; (2) 30 h of Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI) training on research human subjects, ethics, compliance and regulatory management, privacy, and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations [ 34 35 19 36 The lay navigator identified patients either by screening the schedules of COH-AV medical oncology providers or from direct provider referral to the navigator program via email, phone, or medical record (Epic ® 37 Table S1 38 39 In addition to the community site lung navigator, the core QI team included the community site lung navigator program physician champion and a collaborating thoracic surgeon. Additionally, two patient partners, who were lung cancer survivors living in AV, provided input on program development and delivery. Participants included patients, COH-AV treating physicians, medical staff assistants, a social worker, financial counselors, tobacco specialists, and the QI team. The Rapid Cycle Research framework was used to inform the QI project delivery. This framework consists of six phases: (1) preparation; (2) problem exploration; (3) knowledge exploration; (4) solution development; (5) solution testing; and (6) implementation and dissemination [ 40 41 Figure 1 The present manuscript is limited to describing inputs, activities, program outputs, and process outcomes. Program outcomes, including program impact on timeliness of care (time to obtaining biopsy or treatment) and patient experience, will be shared in another publication. 2.3. Analysis Principal inputs included gift cards and Wi-Fi-enabled iPad ® ® Table S2 Table S2 42 43 Figure 1 Healthcare resources and neighborhood disadvantages were mapped using ArcGIS Pro (Esri Inc., Redlands, CA, USA). Travel distances between ZIP Code centroids of patient residence and COH-AV/COH-Duarte were calculated using ArcGIS StreetMap Premium North America, version 2024.4 (Esri Inc.). The Area Deprivation Index (ADI), a metric that ranks neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage using measures of income, education, employment, and housing quality [ 44 ® The Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate statistical associations between (1) barrier frequency and sociodemographic and clinical variables; (2) the number of missed appointments and sociodemographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, and types of barriers; and (3) mode of patient recruitment and demographic variables. One-sided p p 3. Results 3.1. Patient Enrollment Figure 2 p Table S3 Figure 2 Table 1 Various steps were taken throughout the program to boost patient enrollment, including participating in ten outreach activities. Figure 2 Overall, 29 (52.7%) of the evaluable patients came from moderately-to-highly socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods (mean state-level ADIs > 5), 10 (34.5%) of whom resided in highly disadvantaged neighborhoods (mean state-level ADIs > 7). Moreover, the study participants primarily came from regions where access to thoracic surgical care was low. Specifically, fewer than 10 surgeons were listed as having thoracic surgery privileges at two community hospitals in AV, as verified by the medical executive staff office. These surgeons performed only 11 lung surgeries between 2022and 2024 combined for both hospitals, compared to over 600 lung resection surgeries performed at COH-Duarte between 2022 and 2024. 3.2. Patient Characteristics Table 1 Most of the evaluable patients (41 of 55; 74.5%) resided within 50 miles of COH-AV ( Table 1 3.3. Types of Patient–Navigator Encounters Each evaluable patient had at least two encounters with the navigator—an initial barrier assessment at the time of enrollment into the navigation program, and a program completion encounter. Any follow-up encounters with the navigator were classified into two categories: navigator-directed encounters and patient-/caregiver-directed encounters. Navigator-directed encounters were focused on either coordinating care or providing a barrier solution. Similarly, patient-/caregiver-directed encounters were primarily focused on seeking either a barrier solution (barrier-focused encounters) or crisis management (crisis-focused encounters; defined as symptom- or emotional need-driven encounters). Nineteen (34.5%) patients only had two mandatory encounters with the navigator (initial barrier assessment encounter and the program completion encounter) ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 The navigator also completed encounters initiated by a patient (or their caregiver) to seek a barrier solution or crisis management (14 patients for each type; >5 encounters of each type for 3 patients) ( Figure 3 3.4. Types and Frequency of Barriers to Care Each evaluable patient completed an initial barrier assessment either independently with the navigator or with support from caregivers. A total of 15 of the 55 evaluable patients required family/caregiver assistance to complete the barrier assessment, while the remaining 40 completed the assessment independently with the navigator. Table 2 Table 2 p Table S4 p Thirty-three (60.0%) of the fifty-five evaluable patients had at least one barrier. Transportation concerns constituted the most frequently observed barrier, affecting 31% (N = 17) of all evaluable patients. The second most frequently noted barrier was current smoking habits (15/55 patients; 27.3%), followed by Internet accessibility concerns (13/55 patients; 23.6%) and financial concerns about paying for medical care (13/55 patients; 23.6%). Notably, concerns related to transportation, Internet accessibility, and financial security were more frequent among evaluable patients who were diagnosed with lung cancer at enrollment (39.5%, 29%, and 29% of 38 patients, respectively) than those who had suspicious radiographic findings (11.8% of 17 patients for all three). Interestingly, Internet accessibility concerns (affirmative response to the question “would you be interested in borrowing an Internet-enabled iPad ® The most frequently noted psychosocial barrier was the need to talk to a mental health professional (9/55 patients; 16.4%). Importantly, all patients for whom this psychosocial barrier was identified had a lung cancer diagnosis. The other psychosocial barriers identified by the navigator were concerns about paying rent or mortgage, concerns about the living situation, burden of childcare responsibilities, and being the primary caretaker of a disabled or older adult. 3.5. Referrals and Resources Offered Referrals for services were offered to patients with financial, psychosocial, or tobacco cessation barriers. Overall, 31 (56.4%) of all evaluable patients were offered at least one referral to overcome a barrier ( Table 2 Resources offered to patients with Internet accessibility and transportation barriers included loaner Internet-enabled iPad ® ® ® ® Table 2 ® Transportation gift cards included Uber ® ® Table 2 3.6. Intensity of Patient–Navigator Encounters and Their Association with the Number of Barriers Identified Intensity of navigation is defined as the time needed to provide navigation [ 45 Among the evaluable patients for whom encounter duration data were available, the median intensity of navigation was 23 min (interquartile range 35 min). Five patients had cumulative navigator encounter durations under 15 min ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 p 3.7. Patient Engagement Patient engagement was measured indirectly by assessing (1) the percentage of scheduled clinic appointments missed by the patient and (2) the proportion of patients who activated their online patient portals during the navigation program. Figure 5 Figure 5 p Table S5 p Tables S5 and S6 46 47 48 49 Access to COH’s online patient portal is offered to all new patients at COH-AV upon registration. However, 26 of the evaluable patients in this study had not signed up for the patient portal. Notably, after meeting with the navigator, 18 of these patients signed up for the online patient portal, giving a conversion rate of 69.2%. 4. Discussion Findings from our QI project suggest that the development and execution of a barrier-focused telephone-based lay lung navigator program is feasible in a low-resource setting. Key findings identified during program evaluation were (1) anticipated practical barriers such as transportation and Internet challenges were among the top three needs addressed; (2) frequency and intensity of navigator encounters were most notable for patients with cancer; (3) higher complexity of needs required longer navigation times; (4) positive patient engagement was observed in appointment attendance and online patient portal activation during the course of the navigator program; and (5) transportation concerns and Internet access concerns were significantly associated with appointment attendance. More than 76% of our evaluable patients were 65 years and older, consistent with the statistics for the overall US population, wherein 83% of patients with lung cancer are diagnosed at ≥65 years of age [ 50 32 51 52 53 54 55 9 Frequency and intensity of encounters were greater among patients with cancer and complex care needs. We made efforts to capture navigation intensity (relative time needed for navigation) as opposed to navigation acuity, which is “a measure of patient distress, medical and psychosocial barriers (i.e., financial toxicity, comorbidities, lack of family support), and the complexity of illness and social determinants that indicate the need for the intensity of subsequent navigator interventions across the care continuum” [ 56 45 57 58 59 57 We highlight several key lessons learned from our experience in delivering a lay navigator program. Firstly, while we offered services related to transportation and Internet access to several participants with these barriers, we encountered challenges in resource utilization among these participants. During the setup and initial execution of the program, we discovered that rideshare cards, such as those for Uber ® ® ® ® 57 60 61 62 63 64 65 64 65 66 Our participants included individuals at various points in the cancer care continuum from pre-cancer diagnosis to active cancer diagnosis and treatment. They also varied by location of residence (rural vs. urban), which greatly affected access to cancer services. The majority of the participants were White and from socioeconomically deprived communities with fewer healthcare resources, such as large-volume thoracic surgical centers. This observation underscores the need for context-informed care beyond race and ethnicity, with attention to low-resource community inhabitants of all backgrounds. While our insights are useful to guide the next steps (beyond feasibility) of a lay navigator program for low-resource communities, we note several limitations to our study. These include the following: (1) a small sample size and the QI nature of our program, both of which severely restrict conclusions or the generalizability of our results beyond the COH patient population evaluated in the study; (2) the short duration of program delivery, which may have restricted buy-in and integration within the healthcare system; (3) concurrent institutional changes, such as hiring a new patient intake navigator and a clinic site nurse navigator, which may have influenced uptake; (4) the lack of program buy-in from external providers to COH-AV, as evidenced by lack of referrals; (5) offering iPad ® ® 67 5. Conclusions Our telehealth-based barrier-focused lay lung navigator program delivered in a low-resource community was patient-centered and feasible. While our study does not provide definitive conclusions due to its QI design, it provides insight and guidance for our COH enterprise—with clinical practice networks spanning southern California and the greater Chicago (Illinois), Atlanta (Georgia), and Phoenix (Arizona) areas—to address the needs and optimize healthcare delivery for the urban and rural communities we serve. As expected, patients with a higher number of identified barriers, as well as those with a lung cancer diagnosis at enrollment, had a higher frequency and intensity of encounters with the navigator. Barriers to transportation and Internet access were significantly associated with missed appointment rates in our study population. While addressing practical barriers, such as transportation and Internet access, may be important, we noted that older patients with advanced cancer, particularly those receiving palliative care, may benefit from emotional support and coordination of care. Navigation of these specific populations, particularly in rural areas, warrants further exploration with particular emphasis on the role of social prescribing and navigation. Adopting such models at COH-AV offers a promising strategy to incorporate geographic context into the planning, resource mapping, and assessment of navigation programs in low-resource communities served by COH clinical practice networks.
