We retrospectively analyzed data from 2,159 patients, who underwent lung resection for stage I-IIA NSCLC in nine centers between the years 2010 and 2022. In order to compare survival, we grouped the patients by preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and pan-immune inflammation value (PIV). The mean overall survival (OS) was significantly shorter in patients with high NLR (102.7 vs. 109.4 months, p p p p p p p p p p Keywords Lung cancer Early-stage NSCLC Systemic inflammation Prognosis Subject terms Lung cancer Non-small-cell lung cancer Biochemistry Cancer Surgical oncology pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Springer Nature Limited 2025 Introduction Lung cancer is globally the second most common cancer diagnosis after breast cancer but ranks highest in cancer-related deaths 1 2 3 4 8 9 4 10 12 13 14 14 15 The prognostic significance of NLR and PLR in NSCLC has been studied extensively in the literature, with results from meta-analyses confirming their roles as prognostic factors. For example, patients with high NLR and PLR values have been reported to have shorter survival times 16 14 15 Given the gaps in the literature regarding the prognostic role of these indices, particularly that of PIV in early-stage NSCLC, further studies are warranted. The current study aims to evaluate the prognostic significance of the systemic inflammatory markers including NLR, LMR, PLR, and PIV before surgery in early-stage NSCLC patients and it aims to investigate whether any of them is superior over another. By doing so, this study seeks to provide novel insights into the clinical applicability of these markers in refining prognostic assessment and aiding in individualized treatment planning. Materials and methods Patient selection We retrospectively analyzed the data from 3,116 patients, who underwent R0 lung resection for primary lung cancer in nine centers during the period between January 2010 and December 2022, and, who had a stage I-IIA NSCLC based on a histopathological examination. Inclusion criteria  Patients, who underwent R0 anatomic lung resection and standard mediastinal lymph node dissection due to a primary stage I-IIA NSCLC diagnosis in 9 centers from January 2010 to December 2022. Patients with accessible electronic patient files. Patients, who underwent preoperative tumor staging with PET/CT or thorax CT. Patients with preoperative CBC values within the normal range (e.g., Hb > 8, Platelet > 100,000). Patients with normal preoperative respiratory function test results (FEV1 ≥ 50%, DLCO ≥ 50%). Patients with at least 12 months of follow-up. Exclusion criteria  Patients, who had an active infection within the last month. Patients with another malignancy diagnosed within the last 5 years. Patients with hematologic disorders, rheumatologic comorbidities, autoimmune diseases, or chronic inflammatory diseases, either of which with the potential to affect systemic inflammatory markers or complete blood count parameters. Patients, who received neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic therapy. Patients, who received systemic corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy before or after surgery. Patients with severe renal or hepatic insufficiency (GFR < 30, Child-Pugh C). Patients with missing data in the patient file or during the follow-up process or patients, who failed to attend the follow-up visits. Patients, who lost their lives during the follow-up period due to reasons not related to cancer (e.g. traffic accidents, myocardial infarction, etc.). As a result, the study continued with 2159 cases that met the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Consort Diagram. We performed a formal sample size calculation to ensure adequate statistical power to test the study objectives. Because we would use the log-rank test and Cox regression model for the survival analyses in the study, we performed the sample size calculations using a G*Power (Version 3.1.9.4) software separately for each of these tests. We found that at least 59 patients would be needed to perform the Cox regression analysis on the study data, assuming a large effect size (f² = 0.35), a significance level of 5% (α = 0.05), and 95% power (1-β = 0.95). In the power analysis performed for the log-rank test, we calculated that the sample size should be at least 84 with a large effect size (d = 0.8), a significance level of 5%, and a power of 0.951 (95.1%). These results indicate that our study is adequately powered for the statistical analyses to properly evaluate the effects of independent variables on survival. Study design This study is a retrospective, multicenter, cohort study to analyze data from patients, who underwent R0 resection due to a diagnosis of stage I-IIA NSCLC from nine different centers during the period between the years 2010 and 2022. We analyzed the study population retrospectively by using patient files and hospital electronic databases. We utilized routine complete blood count (CBC) test results to assess systemic inflammation. CBC analyses had been performed on venous blood samples of all patients within 15 days before surgery. Blood samples had been collected in EDTA tubes and analyses had been performed using a Sysmex XN-3000 hematology analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Japan), a Mindray BC-6800 hematology analyzer (Mindray, China), and a Beckman Coulter UniCel DxH 800 hematology analyzer (Beckman Coulter, USA). Routine autoanalyzer systems in the hospitals’ clinical biochemistry laboratories had been used for these analyses. We calculated NLR, LMR, PLR, and PIV ​​by using the absolute neutrophil, platelet, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts from routine complete blood count (CBC) test results obtained before surgery. We calculated NLR by dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the absolute lymphocyte count, PLR by dividing the absolute platelet count by the absolute lymphocyte count, LMR by dividing the absolute lymphocyte count by the absolute monocyte count, and PIV by multiplying the absolute neutrophil count by the platelet and monocyte counts and later by dividing the result by the absolute lymphocyte count. We recorded the demographic characteristics of the patients, including age, sex, and comorbidities, as well as the surgical procedures performed, cancer stages, survival times, disease-free survival times, histopathological diagnoses, NLR, LMR, PLR, and PIV. At the initial stage of the study, we conducted a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to establish the cut-off values for the systemic inflammation parameters, namely NLR, LMR, PLR, and PIV. When the ROC curve analysis was unable to provide a cut-off value, we used the validated cut-off values widely accepted in the literature. For the systemic inflammatory markers with no widely accepted cut-off values in literature, we adopted the median values as the cut-off points. Based on these cut-off values, we assigned the patients to the following groups: Group NLRhigh NLRlow LMRhigh LMRlow PLRhigh PLRlow PIVhigh PIVlow We obtained written informed consent from each patient and conducted the study in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Ege University Medical Research Ethics Committee approved the study (No: 23-12T/20). Statistical analysis We analyzed the data by using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 26.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). We summarized the quantitative data as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or as median in ranges (minimum-maximum), and the categorical data as numbers (n) and percentages (%). We used the appropriate methods for all statistical analyses, based on the distribution and characteristics of the data. We performed normality tests, including the Shapiro-Wilk test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, to assess the distribution of continuous variables. For variables that followed a normal distribution, we compared two groups by using the independent samples t-test. In cases, where the data did not follow a normal distribution, we used the Mann-Whitney U test as a non-parametric alternative. We analyzed the categorical variables by using the Chi-square test. We determined the optimal cut-off values for systemic inflammatory markers (NLR, LMR, PLR, and PIV) through a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. When the analysis did not reveal a specific threshold, we used the median-derived values or the values published in the literature. We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank tests to compare overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between groups. To identify independent prognostic factors, we performed a multivariate Cox regression analysis, reporting hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed multicollinearity among systemic inflammatory markers by using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), with a threshold of VIF < 5 indicating the absence of significant collinearity. We tested the proportional hazards assumption (PH assumption) of the Cox regression model by using log-log (cumulative hazard) plots. The log-log curves for independent variables were parallel over time, confirming the proportional hazards assumption. Therefore, we considered the Cox regression model appropriate for survival analysis. Additionally, we performed a formal sample size calculation and a power analysis by using a G*Power (Version 3.1.9.4) software to ensure that the study would be adequately powered for statistical analysis to detect significant differences. We considered p-values of < 0.05 statistically significant. Results We retrospectively analyzed the data of 3,116 patients, who were diagnosed with stage I-IIA NSCLC, and, who underwent lung resection surgery in nine centers during the period between January 2010 and December 2022. The study proceeded with 2,159 patients based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of the cases, 1,763 (81.7%) were men and 396 (18.3%) were women. The mean age was 61.50 ± 9.22 years (range: 23–86 years), with 816 (37.8%) patients younger than 60 years old and 1,343 (62.2%) patients 60 years old or older.

In line with these findings, we performed a multivariate Cox regression analysis to determine the independent effects of systemic inflammation parameters on overall survival and disease-free survival. The multifactorial analysis showed no superiority of systemic inflammation markers over one another for the prediction of OS or DFS. However, low LMR values appeared to be associated with an increased risk for OS ( p p 5  Table 4 The disease-free survival analysis of groups.

The traditional prognostic markers for lung cancer include the patient’s sex, smoking history, and disease stage, along with many biomarkers of lung cancer such as the elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin-19 fragment, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, progastrin-releasing peptide, tumor M2-pyruvate kinase, and C-reactive protein (CRP), and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 8 9 17 19 Recent years have seen an increasing body of literature, reporting that inflammatory response is associated with tumor progression due to the critical role played by the immune cells in carcinogenesis 20 21 13 13 13 14 13 NLR, LMR, PLR, and PIV ​​can be considered to be the reliable indicators of the inflammatory status of patients because they reflect the degree of systemic inflammation induced by cancer cells. The most important advantage of systemic inflammatory parameters in clinical use is that these markers are simple, inexpensive, and easily accessible. These tests have the potential to become an ideal prognostic measure because of their accessibility through simple routine complete blood counts, their cost-effectiveness, ease of clinical application, and broad screening potential. However, they also have limitations such as the lack of standard cut-off values in the literature ​​and the nonspecificity of the inflammatory markers to cancer. Nevertheless, the availability of routine complete blood count tests in all patients scheduled for resection due to lung cancer allowed us to calculate the NLR, LMR, PLR, and PIV values ​​in our patients. In their study on patients undergoing resection for NSCLC, Takahashi et al. 22 p p 23 p 24 25 p p p In a series of 268 patients, who underwent surgical treatment for lung cancer, Ramos et al. 26 p p 27 28 p p p p p p In the study by Lohinai et al. 23 p 29 p p p p p In their meta-analysis of 4,942 cases with cancer of all types, Güven et al. 30 p p p p p In conclusion, in our study, low LMR and high PLR, PIV, and NLR ​​were associated with worse prognosis. We observed that NLR had a significant effect on OS but not on DFS. OS and DFS were poorer in patients with low LMR. Both OS and DFS were significantly poorer in patients with high PLR. Patients with high inflammatory markers had longer hospital stays, longer chest tube stay-in times, and higher complication rates. In addition, unlike previous studies, the current study evaluated the prognostic performance of systemic inflammation markers in predicting OS and DFS. Although LMR appeared to be superior over other markers in this respect, none of these parameters were statistically superior over one another. The most important advantages of systemic inflammation markers such as NLR, LMR, PLR and PIV for clinical use are that they are simple, inexpensive, easily measurable and widely available 31 However, there are important issues that need to be resolved for these indicators to enter routine clinical practice. The use of variable cut-off points in different studies is one of the main factors limiting the generalizability of the use of these parameters. Although there is a consensus that high values ​​are associated with poor prognosis, there is no consensus on which threshold values ​​will affect clinical decision-making. Therefore, standardization of systemic inflammatory parameters with optimized reference ranges for specific cancer types is necessary. Furthermore, the difference in survival of approximately six months observed between the high and low PIV groups over a long follow-up period may at first glance appear limited in diseases with generally good prognosis, such as early-stage NSCLC. However, in clinical oncology practice, even such small gains can influence decisions such as determining follow-up strategies or referring patients to adjuvant therapy. Especially in cases where traditional risk factors are insufficient, systemic inflammatory markers may be considered as a complementary tool in clinical monitoring and treatment planning rather than a substitute for existing staging systems. In conclusion, comprehensive and large-scale prospective clinical studies are needed to determine the cut-off values of these parameters and to evaluate their prognostic performance in a more accurate and generalizable manner. Conclusion This study, with a different design compared to similar studies in the literature, is a multicenter study, where we comprehensively evaluated systemic inflammatory markers on a large patient population and showed that NLR, LMR, and PLR could be important prognostic markers to predict overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in early-stage NSCLC patients, who underwent surgery. In addition, we found that a newly defined parameter, PIV, on which only a limited number of studies have been performed to examine its prognostic significance in NSCLC, could be an important prognostic factor in predicting OS and DFS in early-stage NSCLC cases. However, none of the circulating inflammatory markers proved to be statistically significant in the multivariate analysis. These results suggest that inflammatory parameters may have an important role in predicting the prognosis of NSCLC patients and planning treatment strategies. In addition, systemic inflammatory markers may have a potential role in predicting postoperative complications. There is a need for more comprehensive, large-scale prospective clinical studies to better evaluate the prognostic performance and predictive accuracy of systemic inflammatory parameters. Limitations This multi-center study is not free from limitations. Firstly, even though the patients had early-stage NSCLC, the groups had some heterogeneity due to the diagnosis of various histopathological stages in the range from stage IA to IIA. Furthermore, the genotypic diversity may have influenced the results of the study. Secondly, the retrospective nature of the study prevents the generalization of the findings. Lastly, the existing parameters lack established cut-off values.
