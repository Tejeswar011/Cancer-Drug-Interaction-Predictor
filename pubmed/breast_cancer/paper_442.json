These tumors, designated primarily as Grade 4, include the following subtypes: (1) diffuse midline glioma with H3‐K27 alterations (DMG, H3‐K27M), (2) diffuse hemispheric glioma with H3‐G34 mutations (DHG, H3G34M), and (3) diffuse pediatric‐type high‐grade glioma with wild‐type H3 and isocitrate dehydrogenase (pHGG, H3‐WT/IDH WT). Clinically, pHGGs are known for their poor outcomes and marked tumor heterogeneity. Despite this, the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the processes governing tumor cell lineage transitions remain incompletely understood. In this study, we used single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) to analyze pHGG tumor cells (excluding infant‐type hemispheric gliomas). Through comprehensive bioinformatic approaches—including cell proportion analysis, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, metabolic activity inference via scMetabolism, proliferation gene scoring, stemness assessment by CytoTRACE2, SCENT, and pseudotime trajectory analysis with Monocle2—we thoroughly investigated the TME features and heterogeneity of these aggressive brain tumors. Our findings highlight the presence of oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC)‐like subpopulations, with epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR PDGFRA EGFR The graphical abstract will illustrate the key findings of our study, highlighting the OPC‐like subpopulations and their role in driving tumorigenic lineage transitions in pediatric high‐grade gliomas. cell lineage transition pediatric high‐grade gliomas tumor heterogeneity tumor microenvironment characteristics Chongqing Municipal Health Commission 2017HBRC007 2022 Future Medicine Young Innovator Team Development Program of Chongqing Medical University W0199 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date September 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:30.09.2025  Tian Tian Chong Huang Lusheng Li 2025 Single‐Cell Profiling of Pediatric High‐Grade Gliomas Reveals OPC‐Like Subpopulations Driving Tumorigenic Lineage Transitions Pediatric Discovery e70027 10.1002/pdi3.70027  Funding: 1 Introduction The 2021 fifth edition of the WHO classification of tumors of the central nervous system introduced the category of “pediatric‐type diffuse high‐grade gliomas (pHGGs)”, emphasizing their distinct biological and clinical features compared to adult‐type diffuse high‐grade gliomas aHGG). This classification underscores the importance of studying pediatric gliomas as distinct entities [ 1 1 2 3 4 Tumor heterogeneity is commonly categorized into classical heritable heterogeneity, tumor evolution with compositional diversity, and transient heterogeneity driven by the TME [ 5 6 Advances in single‐cell RNA sequencing (scRNA‐seq) have significantly enhanced the ability to resolve tumor heterogeneity at single‐cell resolution. Recent studies in pediatric tumors, such as medulloblastoma [ 7 8 9 Pediatric high‐grade gliomas (pHGGs) are currently recognized as neurodevelopmental disorders [ 10 11 12 In this study, we leveraged publicly available scRNA‐seq datasets of pHGG to investigate the heterogeneity and characteristics of the TME. Additionally, we explored tumor cell lineage transitions to identify potential stem cells implicated in tumor origins. These findings were further validated using immunofluorescence analysis, offering insights into the biological mechanisms underlying pHGG progression and its cellular dynamics. 2 Method 2.1 Human Subjects and Ethical Considerations The samples used in this study were anonymized and obtained with informed consent from the patients or their legal guardians, without any financial compensation (Approval No. 409, 2024, Clinical Research Ethics Committee). 2.2 Tumor Tissue Immunofluorescence Staining and Imaging Tumor tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, sectioned into 20 μm slices, and paraffin‐embedded. Antigen retrieval was performed using sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95°C for 15 min, followed by blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies: PDGFRα (1:1000; Cell Signaling, D1E1E; Danvers, MA, USA) and OLIG2 (1:1000; Cell Signaling, E6G6Q; Danvers, MA, USA), diluted in 1% BSA/PBS. Secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor Plus 555 Goat anti‐Mouse IgG, A32727; Alexa Fluor Plus 488 Goat anti‐Rabbit IgG, A32731; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were applied at a 1:1000 dilution for 1 h in the dark at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Fluorescence signals were visualized using a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Oberkochen, Germany) with excitation at 488 nm (Alexa Fluor 488; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 555 nm (Alexa Fluor 555; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Negative controls and omitting primary antibodies were included to ensure specificity. 2.3 Statistics and Reproducibility We did not use statistical methods to set the sample size, and all data were included in the analysis. The experiments were nonrandomized, and neither data collection nor analysis was blinded to experimental conditions. Statistical analysis was performed in R v.4.3.0. Numerical variables were compared using the Bonferroni test when appropriate. Single‐cell sequencing for each tumor was performed as a single replicate and a common practice in human studies due to the limited availability of tissue samples. To ensure reproducibility, at least three samples were collected from each anatomical site group of pHGG. 2.4 Cells Clustering and Doublet Removal Cells were clustered using Seurat v4.3.0 [ 13 14 We used DoubletFinder (v2.0.3) to identify and remove doublets from scRNA‐seq data [ 15 2.5 Subtype‐Proportional Stratified Sampling To minimize sampling bias due to group size imbalance, we performed five rounds of stratified subsampling based on the smallest group size. Subsampling was proportionally conducted across cell subtypes, with different random seeds used for each repetition to ensure stability. All downstream analyses were performed based on the stratified subsampling results. 2.6 Cell Subtype Proportion Analysis The cluster ratio plot function was utilized to generate stacked bar charts displaying the proportion of different cell subtypes across groups, based on metadata. This analysis highlights the distribution of cell subtypes within various groups, using specific color codes for each subtype. To improve readability, X 2.7 Identification of Malignant and Non‐Malignant Cells We used the CopyKAT tool (v4.0.5) [ 16 2.8 Copy Number Variation Analysis We used the inferCNV (v1.14.2) [ 17 2.9 Analysis of Gene Expression ( TOP2A MKI67 EGFR PDGFRA Using single‐cell RNA sequencing data, this study investigated the expression patterns of TOP2A and MKI67 in malignant cells. Box plots with jitter points were generated after filtering nonzero expression values to compare expression levels across DMG, DHG, and H3WT groups. Similarly, based on stratified sampling results, EGFR PDGFRA p 2.10 Gene Enrichment Analysis of Malignant Cell Subtypes Gene enrichment analysis was conducted using COSG (v0.9.0) [ 18 2.11 KEGG and GO Pathway Enrichment Analysis KEGG and GO pathway enrichment analyses [ 19 2.12 Metabolic Characterization of Malignant Cell Subtypes scMetabolism (v0.2.1) [ 20 2.13 Evaluation of Differentiation Potential Using CytoTRACE2 CytoTRACE2 (v1.0.0) [ 21 2.14 Stemness Evaluation Using SCENT In this study, SCENT (v1.0.3) [ 22 2 2.15 Pseudotime Trajectory Analysis of Tumor Cells Pseudotime trajectories of tumor cells were analyzed using Monocle2 (v4.0.5) [ 23 2.16 Sample Handling, DNA Extraction and Next‐Generation Sequencing Twelve patient samples were analyzed. For each, five 5‐μm formalin‐fixed paraffin‐embedded (FFPE) sections and 10 mL of peripheral blood were collected. Plasma and leukocytes were separated by centrifugation, and genomic DNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen,Hilden, Germany), with leukocyte DNA as the germline control. DNA quality and fragment size were assessed via Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Libraries were prepared using the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit and captured with a customized 919‐gene panel (Onco Panscan, Genetron Health, Beijing, China) (Table S1 2.17 Genomic Data Processing and Mutation Analysis Sequencing data were processed with Trimmomatic (v0.36) [ 24 25 26 27 27 http://adtex.sourceforge.net/ 28 29 QC: tumor ≥ 500 × depth, ≥ 90% coverage at ≥ 140 ×; leukocyte ≥ 250 × depth, ≥ 90% coverage at ≥ 10 ×.

At a resolution of 0.3, we identified 153,369 cells, which were classified into multiple populations, including astrocytes, neural progenitor cells (NPCs), oligodendrocytes (ODCs), oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), endothelial cells, and pericytes (Figure 1B,C 1D,F 1E Overall, our cohort captures the key clinical and molecular features of pHGG, emphasizing the considerable cellular heterogeneity among tumor subtypes and underscoring the complex biological nature of this disease. Subsequent analyses will further investigate nongenetic factors and explore the heterogeneity across different pHGG subtypes. 3.2 Malignant Cell Heterogeneity in pHGG Subtypes In this study, we aimed to characterize and compare the transcriptional heterogeneity within our cohort of pHGG subtypes (Figure 1A 12 2A–C 2B 2C 36 37 2D FIGURE 2 Analysis of malignant tumor cell subpopulations.

To further explore the tumor heterogeneity, we conducted Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis on the top 500 differentially expressed genes (Figure 2F MKI67 TOP2A S1 S1 We next assessed stemness across these cells using CytoTRACE2 and SCENT (Figure 2C,D 2E,F 38 39 2G–I 40 41 In conclusion, our findings highlight significant heterogeneity among pHGG subtypes, with OPC‐like cells potentially serving as the origin of tumor differentiation in DMG. 3.3 Distinct Roles of EGFR and PDGFRA in OPC‐Like Cell Differentiation and Tumor Heterogeneity in pHGGs In this study, we focused on the analysis of OPC‐like cell subpopulations identified from scRNA‐seq data. To minimize anatomical biases, we first compared DMG samples from different brain regions, such as the pons and thalamus. Their transcriptional profiles were largely concordant, suggesting that anatomical location had limited impact on our subsequent analyses. OPC‐like cells were identified by their high expression of canonical OPC marker genes, such as OLIG1 PTPRZ1 2B 3A,B 3I 12 42 FIGURE 3 The role of OPC‐like cell subpopulations in pHGG cellular lineage transitions.

Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis further revealed functional heterogeneity among the four subgroups (Figure 3E To investigate the distribution of OPC‐like subpopulations across pHGG subtypes and anatomical regions, we generated proportion plots (Figure 3I CytoTRACE2 and SCENT both assign the highest stemness score to OPC‐3 (Figure 3C,D 43 Pseudotime analysis positions OPC‐3 at the root of the trajectory, implying a tumor‐initiating role in DMG (Figure 3F–H 44 3H We further examined developmental markers of OPCs from previous studies [ 45 46 EGFR PDGFRA 3J 47 48 49 46 47 To assess clinical relevance, we analyzed mutations and expression levels of EGFR PDGFRA S1 PDGFRA EGFR 3L PDGFRA 3M PDGFRA 3O PDGFRA Overall, PDGFRA exhibited greater specificity than EGFR in terms of expression, mutation frequency, and subpopulation abundance, supporting its potential as a therapeutic target. This conclusion is reinforced by further scRNA‐seq analyses. PDGFRA 50 50 Importantly, our findings are consistent with prior studies. G. J. Rahme et al. reported in cells that epigenetic activation of PDGFRA in OPCs—via disruption of CCCTC‐binding factor (CTCF) insulation—could cooperate in gliomagenesis, underscoring its role in tumor initiation [ 50 51 In conclusion, our integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis highlights PDGFRA 4 Discussion Emerging evidence suggests that pHGGs originate from aberrant neurodevelopmental processes rather than representing mere recapitulations of adult GBMs [ 10 11 44 45 46 47 52 4.1 Comparison With Existing Studies on Tumor Heterogeneity Tumor heterogeneity can arise from genetic alterations, clonal evolution, and transient states influenced by the microenvironment [ 5 37 4.2 OPC‐Like Cells in pHGG Tumorigenesis We identified EGFR‐ and PDGFRA‐expressing OPC‐like populations with varying degrees of stemness and lineage commitment. Mechanistically, these cells may lie at the core of pHGG tumorigenesis, particularly in DMG. Notably, EGFR + 23 24 25 26 30 44 45 46 47 52 The existence of multiple OPC‐like states in pHGG aligns with current views of glioma cells occupying diverse lineage hierarchies [ 36 37 36 5 6 11 4.3 PDGFRA‐Expressing OPC‐Like Cells and Therapeutic Implications PDGFRA‐high OPC‐like cells are enriched in DMG, consistent with reports of frequent PDGFRA alterations (amplifications or mutations) in pediatric brainstem gliomas [ 53 53 However, the clinical validation of PDGFRA as a biomarker in pHGG/DMG remains limited, especially in terms of survival analysis or ROC curve performance. This reflects the relative infancy of research under the WHO 2021 classification and the scarcity of prognostic or treatment response data in public datasets [ 33 PDGFRA 53 54 55 Recent studies have highlighted the oncogenic role of PDGFRA signaling in glioma.

Using scRNA‐seq, next‐generation sequencing (NGS), and multiplex immunostaining, we identified at least two functionally relevant OPC‐like populations characterized by EGFR PDGFRA 10 11 EGFR PDGFRA Author Contributions Tian Tian performed all data analyses.
