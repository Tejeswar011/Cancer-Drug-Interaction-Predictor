EVs as membrane-enclosed vesicles involved in the transfer of proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids between cells, thereby modulating a wide range of physiological and pathological processes. Importantly, EVs derived from osteoblasts at various stages of differentiation have been shown to possess distinct molecular cargos and functional characteristics 9 10 12 In this study, we characterized the heterogeneity of EVs derived from previously identified OB subtypes. We then analyzed their molecular cargo to uncover potential determinants of functional diversity. Furthermore, we examined how EVs from different OB subtypes influence OA progression by modulating the subchondral bone microenvironment. Collectively, our findings provide new insights into the role of OB-derived EVs in OA pathophysiology and suggest that targeting stage-specific osteoblast subtypes may offer a promising therapeutic strategy. Material And Methods Cells Mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSC) and the osteoblast precursor cell line (MC3T3-E1) (all from Oricell) were maintained in α-MEM (Corning), while human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Oricell) were cultured in DMEM (Corning). Chondrocytes were isolated from neonatal Bcl/C57 mouse articular cartilage via enzymatic digestion with type II collagenase (Worthington Biochemical) for 12 h, a well-established method preserving chondrocyte phenotype 13 14 2 Osteogenic differentiation was induced in approximately 80% confluent BMSCs and MC3T3-E1 cells using medium containing 0.2 mM ascorbic acid, 10 nM dexamethasone, and 10 mM β-glycerophosphate. Collection of conditioned culture media (CM): BMSC were cultured with osteoblast differentiation medium for 1 day, 5 day and 9 day respectively, which represent EnOBs, StOBs and MinOBs. Following an initial period of incubation and removing the supernatant from the culture. Then, replaced this with a fresh batch of DMEM without FBS and continued the incubation for an additional 24 h at a temperature of 37 °C. The supernatant involved a centrifugation step at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Once we had the cell-free supernatant, we added FBS to it. This process resulted in the creation of three distinct types of conditioned media (CM): EnOB-CM, StOB-CM, and MinOB-CM. All conditioned culture media were temporarily stored at 4 ℃ for subsequent use or at -80 °C for prolonged storage. Negative controls comprised the culture medium from BMSC, and the vehicle consisted of pure α-MEM. Angiogenesis assay, Scratch wound assay and Transwell migration assay HUVECs were exposed to the CM for 30 min before initiating the angiogenesis assay. Matrigel (BD, #356234) was applied to cover the bottom of a 96-well plate (50 μL/well) and polymerized for 30 min. Subsequently, 1 × 10 4 Transwell migration assay: HUVECs (2 × 10 4 Scratch wound assay: HUVECs (2 × 10 5 0 48 0 Isolation of EVs The conditioned media derived from different OB subtypes were collected and EVs were isolated using a sequential differential centrifugation approach, as previously described 15 Cell viability assay BMSCs were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 6 × 10 3 16 Figure S3 Incubation of EVs EV concentrations were determined by total protein content using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. EVs were added to complete osteogenic medium at 1.25 mg/mL and incubated with BMSCs for 24 h. After pre-treatment, cells were cultured in osteogenic induction medium for varying durations depending on the assay. For gene and protein expression analysis, cells were harvested on day 3. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and Alizarin red staining (ARS) staining were performed on days 5 and 9 to evaluate early and late mineralization, respectively 16 For cellular uptake, EVs were labeled with DiD (Beyotime) and incubated with BMSCs on confocal dishes for 2 h. Actin filaments were stained with 10 μM F-actin probe (Servicebio), and nuclei with DAPI (Beyotime). Samples were washed with PBS and imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope (FV3000, Olympus, Japan). Western blot Cell lysates and EV proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. After blocking (Epizyme, Shanghai), membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies to detect target proteins, including anti-RUNX2 (Cell Signaling, #12556), Anti-Sp7/Osterix (Abcam, #209484), BMP2 (Abcam, #284387), rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse Osteocalcin (Abcam, #93876), Col-2 (Proteintech, #28459-1-AP), CD63 (Abcam, #217345), CD9 (Abcam, #307085), Calnexin (Abcam, #22595), TSG101 (Abcam, #125011), COX IV (Abcam, #202554), SOX9 (Proteintech, #67439-1-Ig), TOMM20 (Abcam, #186735), Wnt3a (Abcam, #219412), Wnt7a (Abcam, #100792), beta-catenin (Cell Signaling, #8480), LC3b (Cell Signaling, #2775), PINK1 (Abcam, #216144), SQSTM1/p62 (Abcam, #109012), PARK2/Parkin (Proteintech, #14060-1-AP), MMP13 (Pproteintech, #18165-1-AP), and GAPDH (Abcam, #181603). Following primary antibody incubation, membranes were washed with TBST and then treated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Abcam) for 1.5 h at room temperature. ALP staining, ARS and Alcian Blue staining Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and rinsed with distilled water. For mineralization analysis, ARS (0.2%, Solarbio) was used to stain calcium deposits, and ALP activity was assessed with the ALP Color Development Kit (Beyotime). Mineralized nodules were imaged via a BioTek microplate reader. Quantification was performed by solubilizing ARS-stained cells in 10% cetylpyridinium chloride and measuring absorbance at 562 nm. ALP activity was evaluated using a colorimetric assay kit (Beyotime) per the manufacturer's instructions. For Alcian Blue staining, chondrocytes pretreated with CM for 24 h were fixed and stained with Alcian Blue (Sigma-Aldrich) to detect glycosaminoglycans, followed by imaging using a microplate reader. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analyze EVs were placed on carbon-coated copper grids, negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and imaged using a JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) at 80 kV. For ultrastructural analysis of mineralization and mitophagy, cells were fixed with glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in osmium tetroxide, dehydrated through graded ethanol, embedded in epoxy resin, and examined using a JEM-2100 TEM at 120 kV. Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) was performed on electron-dense and collagen-rich regions to assess crystallinity (five areas per sample). Elemental composition of mitochondria and EVs was analyzed by Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDX). Both SAED and EDX were performed without staining to preserve ultrastructure. EV size distribution was analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer Nano ZSP (Malvern Instruments, UK). Immunofluorescence staining Mitochondrial function was assessed using two fluorescent probes: Mito-Tracker Green for mitochondrial mass and TMRM for membrane potential. Cells were incubated with 10 μM Mito-Tracker Green and 10 μM Lyso-Tracker at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by DAPI nuclear staining for 5 min. After PBS washing, fluorescence imaging was performed using an FV3000 confocal microscope (Olympus, Japan). For flow cytometric assessment, Mito-Tracker Green and DiD-labeled EVs (Beyotime) were analyzed to determine mitochondrial content within EVs. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was quantified using FlowJo software to reflect the uptake or presence of mitochondria-associated signals in EVs. Fourier-Transform Infrared Analysis Amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) was synthesized using a co-precipitation method, in which calcium and phosphate ions were combined in the presence of polyphosphate 17 Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Takara), and quantified by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. Quantitative PCR was performed on a QTOWER system (Analytik Jena) with a 20 μL reaction mixture. The cycling conditions were: 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s, ending with a final extension at 72 °C for 20 s. Gene expression levels were normalized to GAPDH using the 2^-ΔΔCt method (Mm99999915_g1). For miRNA analysis, small RNAs were isolated with the MicroRNA Extraction Kit (J&L Biological, AG21030). Reverse transcription followed the same procedure as for total RNA. Expression of ten selected miRNAs was evaluated via SYBR Green qPCR, normalized to the exogenous spike-in control cel-miR-39-3p. RNA sequencing and miRNA sequencing mRNA and small RNA sequencing were performed by OE Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) using the Illumina HiSeq platform. Total RNA was extracted from various osteoblast subtypes and their derived EVs for library construction, with 1 µg RNA used per sample. RNA purity and concentration were assessed by NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific), and RNA integrity was confirmed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Libraries were prepared with the VAHTS Universal V6 RNA-seq Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. For small RNA sequencing, total RNA was isolated via the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion). Small RNA libraries were then constructed using the Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (NEB#E7330S) following the supplier's protocol, and quality was verified on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Differential expression analysis of genes and miRNAs was conducted using DESeq2, with significance thresholds set at P < 0.05 and fold change > 2. Hierarchical clustering was applied to visualize expression profiles. Functional enrichment analyses including Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways were performed using R (v3.2.0) and supplemented by Hiplot Pro tools. Animal All animal experiments were performed following ethical standards and approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai University (Approval No. ECSHU 2023-101). Destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) model, an OA model, was induced in male C57BL/6 mice by surgically excising the medial meniscus of the right knee to mimic progressive joint degeneration. Post-surgery, mice in the treatment group received EVs via two administration routes: weekly intravenous tail vein injections at 30 μg/g and intra-articular injections at 1 μg/kg. Animals were sacrificed 8 weeks after surgery for histological analysis. Human This study with human subjects was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai University (Approval No. ECSHU 2021-146). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrollment. Micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) analysis High-resolution micro-computed tomography (micro-CT; Skyscan 1176, Bruker) was employed to analyze the joint tissues of male C57BL/6 mice with induced osteoarthritis. Joints were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24 h to preserve tissue structure and remove adjacent muscle. Three-dimensional reconstructions were generated for morphological assessment. Quantitative evaluation of subchondral bone remodeling included bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and subchondral bone plate thickness (SBP.th). Microangiography Vascular and structural assessments in animal models were initiated under anesthesia induced with isoflurane (Sigma-Aldrich). Vascular perfusion was performed via intracardiac injection using a sequential infusion protocol consisting of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with anticoagulants, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and subsequently MicroFil MV-120 (Flow Tech), a radiopaque silicone rubber compound designed to delineate vascular architecture. Following perfusion, the tissues were harvested and subjected to decalcification for a period of three weeks to facilitate downstream imaging and analysis. Histology, immunochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis Mouse knee joints were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), followed by paraffin embedding for histological evaluation. Sagittal sections from the medial knee compartment were stained using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) for general morphology and Safranin O/Fast Green (SO&FG) to highlight cartilage and subchondral bone structures. Osteoarthritic severity was quantified via the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scoring system according to established methods 18 GB113151 To evaluate short-term safety of EV treatment, major organs including heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys were collected for histopathological assessment. Paraffin sections underwent H&E staining to identify any morphological abnormalities or pathological changes. ELISA To evaluate systemic inflammation, serum levels of key pro-inflammatory cytokines—interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)—were measured. Blood samples were collected from all experimental groups, and serum was separated for cytokine analysis. Concentrations were determined using ELISA kits (MultiSciences) following the manufacturer's protocols, with optical density measured at 450 nm by a microplate reader. Statistical analysis All data are presented as mean ± SD from at least three independent biological replicates. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 and Excel 2016. Differences between two groups were assessed by unpaired Student's t-test. One-way ANOVA was used for comparisons among three or more groups under one factor, while two-way ANOVA evaluated the effects of two factors and their interaction. Tukey's HSD test was applied for post hoc multiple comparisons. Significance was set at p ≤ 0.05, indicated as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, and ****p < 0.0001; nonsignificant differences are marked “ns.” In bar graphs, identical letters denote no significant difference. Error bars represent mean ± SD. Results Osteoblast heterogeneity drives subchondral bone remodeling in osteoarthritis In the previous study, we identified three OBs subtypes within subchondral bone of OA patients, EnOBs, StOBs and MinOBs, each exhibiting unique regulatory roles in bone remodeling 19 1 Figure S1 9 Figure S1 Figure S1 Figure S1 To further clarify this temporal progression, we examined the expression dynamics of key osteogenic genes across the differentiation timeline. RUNX2, a transcription factor essential for early osteoblast commitment, was upregulated at early-stage (1D) 20 21 22 Figure S1 1 1 Aberrant remodeling of subchondral bone in OA is driven by complex interactions among chondrocytes, bone marrow-derived BMSCs, and endothelial cells 8 1 1 1 Figure S1 1 1 1 23 1 To determine whether these functional characteristics are also present in immortalized cell lines, we conducted parallel experiments using MC3T3-E1-derived OBs. Similar effects on osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and cartilage degradation were observed, ( Figure S2 EVs from osteoblast subtypes exhibiting the ability to regulate subchondral bone remodeling EVs are increasingly recognized as pivotal mediators of intercellular communication within the subchondral bone microenvironment 24 25 26 12 2 2 2 2 2 To confirm the pro-osteogenic potential of OB-derived EVs, various concentrations were first tested to determine the optimal dosage with minimal cytotoxicity. ( Figure S3 2 2 Figure S3 2 19 Figure S2 Figure S2 miRNAs in EVs are responsible for contributions of OA subchondral bone remodeling miRNAs carried by EVs serve as critical regulators of intercellular communication within the subchondral bone microenvironment 27 Figure S4 3 3 28 29 30 To further identify shared miRNAs potentially contributing to osteogenesis, we performed a Venn analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs across the three EV groups. This analysis revealed 34 intersecting miRNAs, including 26 that were upregulated and 8 that were downregulated. (Figure 3 3 28 3 Given the robust mineralization capacity of Min-EVs observed in earlier experiments, we next focused on their specific miRNA cargo. Among the differentially expressed miRNAs in Min-EVs, ten were identified, nine of which were significantly upregulated. (Figure 3 1 31 3 3 3 Amorphous calcium phosphate released in heterogeneous EVs driving subchondral bone remodeling Within developing bone, EVs play an essential role in delivering pro-osteogenic factors and initiating early nucleational events necessary for matrix mineralization, including the transport of calcium (Ca 2+ 4 4 4 16 21 32 33 3- -1 -1 17 4 -1 4 Calcium phosphate deposits are are commonly found within mitochondria of mineralizing cells 34 4 4 Figure S5 4 4 35 Altogether, these results demonstrate that EVs derived from different OB subtypes mediate distinct roles during osteogenesis and mineralization. In particular, MinOBs utilize mitophagy to transport ACP precursors from dysfunctional mitochondria into EVs. Concurrently, specific miRNAs within MinOB-derived EVs further facilitate mineral deposition. In the late stage of OA-related subchondral bone remodeling, both miRNA profiles and mineral granules contribute to enhanced osteogenic activity in BMSCs, driving the transition from bone resorption toward bone formation. Dynamic regulation of Wnt-mediated mitophagy in subchondral bone remodeling Mitophagy in osteoblasts plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of bone remodeling. A growing body of evidence suggests that impaired autophagy disrupts osteoblast maturation and perturbs the delicate equilibrium between bone formation and resorption 36 37 5 Figure S6 38 5 5 Figure S6 To further investigate the link between Wnt signaling and mitophagy, we treated OB subtypes with Mdivi-1, a selective mitophagy inhibitor. We then collected EVs under these conditions for further analysis. Mitochondrial markers COX4 and TOMM20, indicative of mitochondrial content, were reduced in EVs from cells treated with Mdivi-1 or Wnt agonist 1. ( Figure S6 5 5 Figure S6 OB subtypes-derived EVs increased osteoarthritic subchondral bone remodeling in DMM mice To investigate the role of EVs in OA progression, we initially administered EVs via tail vein injection at either 2 or 4 weeks following DMM surgery. (Figure 6 Figure S7 6 39 40 6 6 6 + 6 + 6 In a parallel experiment, EVs were administered via intra-articular injection to assess how articular cartilage modulates subchondral bone remodeling during OA progression. ( Figure S9 Figure S9 Figure S9 Figure S9 23 Figure S9 Figure S9 Given the distinct pathological stages of OA initiation and progression 7 Figure S10 Figure S10 Figure S10 Collectively, these findings highlight the stage- and context-dependent effects of OB-derived EVs on OA progression. Early administration of EVs may exacerbate vascular invasion and cartilage degeneration, whereas later intervention appears to promote subchondral sclerosis. This underscores the importance of identifying an optimal therapeutic window for EV-based interventions. Furthermore, the differential responses of cartilage and subchondral bone to EV treatment reflect their intrinsic heterogeneity in Wnt signaling and mitophagy activity, providing a rationale for the development of EV subtype-specific therapeutic strategies targeting osteochondral remodeling in OA. Discussion The bone-cartilage interface operates as a functional unit, where subchondral bone and cartilage engage in dynamic molecular crosstalk 6 8 41 42 Nonetheless, the direct isolation of viable osteoblast subpopulations from the densely mineralized subchondral bone matrix at various osteoarthritis stages in both murine models and patients remains technically challenging. Therefore, we obtained osteoblast subtypes by inducing osteogenic differentiation of BMSC at different times in vitro 9 43 44 45 At the end stage of osteoarthritis, increased bone formation results in the densification of the subchondral plate. And in our previous study, we also found the proportion of mineral osteoblast increased in subchondral bone at 8 weeks after DMM surgy mice 19 46 47 et al. in vivo 48 et al. 12 9 47 Wei, Y. et al. 49 et al. 9 34 The observation of ACP leads us to notice the mitophagy in osteogenic differentiation. The role of mitochondria during the process of osteogenesis has been suggested 37 50 28 The in vivo in vitro in vivo In vitro In vivo in vitro in vivo Using the DMM model, we tested two administration strategies: systemic injection (primarily targeting subchondral bone) and local intra-articular injection (primarily affecting cartilage). Considering the limited bone-targeting ability of the three EV types 9 51 18 8 52 53 2 7 At present, no biomarkers have been established for the early identification of osteoarthritis patients characterized by accelerated subchondral bone remodeling 2 Some limitations of this study should be noted. First, the osteoblast subtypes were derived from normal physiological conditions in vitro In conclusion, we have firstly reported the mechanism of heterogeneous OB subtypes during osteogenic progress was regulated by Wnt pathway. We also verified functional EVs with miRNAs and ACP generated from them are affected by the activation of mitophagy. The therapeutic window to intervene OA bone remodeling should consider the dynamic process of OA progression. Supplementary Material Supplementary figures.
