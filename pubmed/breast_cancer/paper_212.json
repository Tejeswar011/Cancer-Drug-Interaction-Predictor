Introduction Oncolytic vaccinia virus (VACV) strains are being investigated for use in immunotherapy as a new experimental cancer treatment. Here, we describe the construction, characterization, and use of VACV strains co-expressing murine Interleukin 2 (mIL2) and tumor-associated antigen (TAA)-derived epitopes as potential therapeutic agents against murine mammary carcinoma. Methods and results In the 4T1 mouse mammary tumor model, VACV-encoded mIL2 expression remarkably increased CD4+ and antigen-specific CD8+ T cell populations. In addition, the virus-expressed epitopes elicited an antigen-specific T cell response resulting in the inhibition of tumor cell growth. Furthermore, experiments with 4T1 tumor-bearing syngeneic BALB/c mice showed that the mIL2 and TAA-derived epitopes expressing VACV strain achieved a significantly better anti-tumoral response than the VACV strains expressing mIL2 alone. Discussion and conclusion Taken together, the combination of concomitant expressions of both compounds is significantly more potent in inhibiting tumor growth than immunotherapy with IL2 alone. These findings suggest that the engineering of novel VACV strains co-expressing IL2 with peptides from tumor-associated antigen epitopes could be a novel strategy for cancer therapy in the future. cancer immunotherapy murine mammary carcinoma engineered vaccinia virus mIL2 TAA The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-in-acceptance Cytokines and Soluble Mediators in Immunity 1 Introduction VACV is one of the most promising oncolytic viruses for cancer therapy due to its large foreign DNA size carrying capacity (> 25 kb), allowing for the expression of multiple exogenous genes without affecting its natural oncolytic capability ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 IL2 plays an essential role in the growth and differentiation of immune cells, especially for T cells, B cells and natural killer cells ( 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Peptide-based tumor vaccines are drugs that can elicit tumor antigen-specific immune responses for cancer therapy and the prevention of cancer ( 17 18 19 20 in vivo 21 22 23 Two studies by Franz O. Smith and Steven A. Rosenberg et al. ( 12 13 24 25 27 24 26 27 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Cell lines and virus The African green monkey kidney fibroblasts CV-1 (ATCC; CCL-70) and the mouse mammary gland carcinoma 4T1 (ATCC; CRL-2539) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The mouse mammary carcinoma cell line N2C derived from female BALB-neuT mice was kindly provided by Professor Mario P. Colombo (Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, Lombardia, Italy). The stable cell lines N2C-pTet-turboFP635-EF-1a-Egfp (later called N2C-eGFP) and 4T1-EF-1a-turboFP635 (later called 4T1-turbo) were constructed as described in the Supplementary Data section (  Supplementary Figure S1 2.2 Peptides Peptides utilized in this study; S1:DYIGPCKYI (SPARC 143-151 225-234 423–431 in vitro  Supplementary Table S1 2.3 Virus strains Vaccinia virus strain LIVP1.1.1 was derived from LIVP (Lister strain, Institute of Viral Preparations, Moscow, Russia) ( 28 29 30  Supplementary Figure S2 2.4 Western blot The Western blot experiments in this work were carried out, as described by Syed R. Haider et al. ( 31 2.5 Flow cytometry analysis of MHC class I molecule H2-kd and H2-Ld 2x10 5 2.6 Generation of cell growth curves with real time imaging 2x10 4 ® ® 2.7 Animal experiments Animal experiments were carried out as described in the protocol approved by the Government of Upper Franconia, Germany and according to the guidelines for the welfare and use of animals in cancer research (application No.: RUF-55.2.2.-2532-2-849). The mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Animal Biosafety Level 2 Laboratory of animal facility at University of Wuerzburg (Wuerzburg, Germany). Tumors were generated by implanting 1x10 5 7 3 2.8 Isolation of murine splenocytes The mice were sacrificed, then spleens were taken out into a 10cm cell culture dish containing 5 ml of ice-cooled complete RPMI medium and crushed using a plunger of the 10-ml syringe until without mostly fibrous tissue remains in the dish. To get the single cell suspension of splenocyte, the cell suspension was pipetted into a 70 μm Nylon cell strainer (352350, Corning) to filter cells and get rid of the tissue debris. After that, the filtered cell suspension was washed with complete RPMI medium by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in 3 ml of ice-cold ACK buffer (A1049201, ThermoFisher) to lyse the red blood cells and the sample was incubated at room temperature for 5 min with occasional shaking. The lysis reaction was stopped by adding 7 ml complete RPMI medium. Lastly, the cells were washed with complete RPMI medium twice and resuspended in 5 ml of complete RPMI medium. The samples were maintained in ice for the remainder of the experiment. 2.9 Flow cytometry analysis of splenocytes The pelleted splenocytes were resuspended in the Cell Staining Buffer (420201, BioLegend) at 5-10x10 6 5 2.10 Isolation of CD8+ T cells After the preparation of single splenocyte pellet suspensions from the spleen of PBS or rVACV injected mice, the cells were filtered through a 70µm cell strainer (352350, Corning) and washed once with the MojoSort™ Buffer (480135, BioLegend). To deplete the non CD8+ T cells, a biotin antibody cocktail was added by incubation with magnetic Streptavidin Nanobeads (480135, BioLegend). Then the magnetically labelled fraction was retained by a magnetic separator, and the CD8+ T cells were collected by decanting the liquid in a clean tube. 2.11 Detection of IFN-γ by flow cytometry CD8+ T cells isolated from spleens were seeded into a 96-well U-bottom cell culture plate (4 x 10 5 2.12 Activation and expansion of epitope specific memory CD8+ T cells First, we prepared CD8+ T cell activation medium. Negative control medium: Complete RPMI medium with 160 U/ml IL2 and 6 ug/ml anti-mouse CD28 antibody. Activation medium: Complete RPMI medium with 1ug/ml peptide mixture,160 U/ml IL2 and 6 ug/ml anti-mouse CD28 antibody. Secondly, an aliquot of 1 x 105 cells/ml 50μL isolated CD8+ T cells was placed per well into a U-bottom 96-well plate, then 150μL of activation medium was added. Lastly, the plate was placed into the CO2 incubator and the cells were cultured for 3 – 4 days to active and expand epitope specific memory CD8+ T cells (effector T cells). 2.13 Co-cultivation assay of activated CD8+ T cells with target tumor cells After determining the cell count, 1 x 10 3 3 ® ® 2.14 Antibodies used in flow cytometry and western blot All antibodies used in flow cytometry and Western blot in this study are listed in the  Supplementary Table S2 2.15 Statistical analyses All the data analyses and graphics were performed using Graphpad Prism 8.0 software. Results are presented as mean ± SD (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P< 0.0001, ns: not significant). The Shapiro-Wilk normality test was performed for all datasets to analyze whether each dataset followed a normal distribution pattern. If the dataset followed a normal distribution, we applied parametric tests such as the student’s t-test and one-way analysis of variance. The student’s t-test was used for non-paired comparisons of two groups. Differences between more than two groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and the Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test used for survival analysis. A p-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. 3 Results 3.1 Design and construction of recombinant Vaccinia virus strains expressing tumor-associated antigen-derived peptides and/or mIL2 The 4T1 cell line is a mouse mammary carcinoma cell line that is widely used in triple-negative breast cancer research as a model for human breast cancer. Our previous findings showed that the cancer therapeutic function of IL2-expressing VACV in the 4T1 mouse model depends not only on the backbone virus strain (Lister strain 1.1.1 vs Copenhagen strain) but also on the promoter used to drive the expression of the payload (p7.5 promoter vs Psyn (E/L) promoter) (  Supplementary Figure S3 32 33 34 35 34 36 37 38  Figures 1A, B  Figure 1C  Supplementary Tables S3A, B  Supplementary Figure S2  Figure 1D  Supplementary Figure S4 in vitro in vivo 39 ®  Supplementary Figures S5A, B Figure 1 Design and construction of recombinant Vaccinia viruses.

For this purpose, 1 x 105 mammary carcinoma 4T1 cells were implanted into the right dorsal flank of 5- to 6-week-old female BALB/c mice. After 13 days, the animals were separated into four groups. The mice were injected intravenously into the tail vein with 1×10 7  Figure 2A  Figures 2B–D  Figure 2E  Figures 2F–H  Figures 3A, B  Figure 3C, D  Figures 3E, F Figure 2 Effects of rVACVs treatment on 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice after intravenous application of different VACV constructions.

Therefore, ex vivo testing of interactions of tumor cells and T cells is pivotal for evaluating the effectiveness of the cancer vaccines ( 40 ® ®  Figures 4A-E  Supplementary Video 1  Figures 5A–E  Supplementary Video 2  Supplementary Figure S6  Figure 6 Figure 4 Effect of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells on the 4T1-turbo.

Statistically significant differences are marked by asterisks. 4 Discussion The therapeutic benefits of IL2 regarding cancer are often associated with severe toxicities, supporting Tregs were reported to play critical roles in suppressing the immune response ( 41 43 44 IL2 is the first effective cytokine used in human cancer immunotherapy. The mechanism of systemic IL2 therapy in cancer immunotherapy includes the stimulation of lymphoid proliferation in tissues and the activation of host-derived T cells in vivo 45 in vivo 46 47 48 50 In this study, we selected four T cell epitopes derived from the SPARC protein and the MuLV gp70 protein as TAA-derived peptides to be constitutively expressed by VACV in order to elicit a peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes response. All four peptides are potential cancer vaccine candidates ( 35 37 51 Potentiation of the tumor-specific killing ability of CD8+ T cells in vivo in vitro 22 23 52 ® The oncolytic vaccine virus is relatively safe, as has been proved by hundreds of experimental data in preclinical and clinical studies. Although we have demonstrated the tumor therapeutic efficacy of VACV strains co-expressing IL2 with tumor-associated antigen epitopes in a mouse model—offering a promising strategy for oncolytic cancer immunotherapy—the translation of this concept into human clinical trials remains challenging. In this study, we utilized T cell epitopes derived from TAAs; however, the overexpression of TAAs may lead to the risk of autoimmunity, as these antigens are also expressed on normal healthy tissues. Additionally, T cells capable of recognizing self-antigens may be eliminated due to immune tolerance mechanisms in the host. Therefore, personalized tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) could represent a superior alternative for translating this strategy into human cancer therapy, as they are uniquely expressed on tumor cells, potentially reducing the risk of autoimmunity while enhancing antitumor immune responses. Moreover, although we did not observe significant IL-2-associated toxicity in our mouse studies, IL2 toxicity remains an important consideration for clinical application. Notably, modified forms of IL2 have been reported to reduce toxicity while increasing its half-life in vivo 53 54 Acknowledgments The authors would like to thank Tanja Schwab, an internship student in the CTRC, for her help with the animal experiments.
