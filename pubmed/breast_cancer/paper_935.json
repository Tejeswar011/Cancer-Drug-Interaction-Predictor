Introduction Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide and is often incurable despite significant advances in radiation therapy, surgical techniques, and systemic treatments [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 In numerous studies, Rutin (RT), a bioflavonoid compound (Chemical identifier; CID: 5280805), has been shown to possess potent anti-cancer, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties [ 7 8 9 10 Figure 1 11 12 13 14 15 16 Although RT possesses great therapeutic potential, its clinical utility is restricted due to chemical instability and poor water solubility, which significantly limit its bioavailability [ 17 18 2. Results 2.1. Characterization of Rutin-Loaded Nano-Phytosomes (RT-PNPs) Morphological examination by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed that the RT-PNPs were spherical and exhibited uniformity in structure ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Table 1 Figure 2 Figure 2 Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic analysis was performed to confirm the chemical compatibility and molecular interactions between rutin, the excipients, physical mixture, and the optimized RT-PNPs formulation ( Figure 3 −1 −1 −1 2.2. Changes in Cell Volume, Viability, Body Weight, and the Mean Survival Time The mice inoculated with EAC exhibited a significant increase in the volume of ascitic fluid compared to those treated with either crude RT or rutin-loaded nano-phytosomes (RT-PNPs), with the reduction being significantly greater in the RT-PNP group than in the RT-treated group ( p Figure 4 p Figure 4 p Figure 4 2.3. Hematology Parameters Table 2 2.4. Blood Chemistry Table 3 p 2.5. Tumor-Associated Biomarkers Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 p 2.6. Redox Status Hepatic and renal antioxidant capacities were significantly reduced in EAC-treated mice, including those for reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px). However, these levels were significantly improved following treatment with either crude RT or RT-PNPs, with the EAC/RT-PNP group showing greater recovery in SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px levels compared to the EAC/RT group ( Figure 6 Figure 7 p Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 6 Figure 7 2.7. Inflammatory Reaction The levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB; Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 p 2.8. Expression Profiles of TP53, Bax, and Bcl-2 Genes The expression levels of the p53 Bcl-2 Bax Figure 9 Bax TP53 TP53 Bax Bcl-2 2.9. Flow Cytometric Analysis of p53 and Ki-67 Expression Results Flow cytometric analysis indicated significant variations in the expression levels of p53 and Ki-67 among the experimental groups. The EAC + RT-PNP group exhibited a significantly higher percentage of p53-positive tumor cells (mean ± SD: 69.0 ± 3.4%) compared to the EAC + RT group (39.0 ± 3.9%) and the untreated EAC group (9.0 ± 2.6%) ( p Figure 10 p Figure 10 2.10. Histopathological Results The liver histology presented in Figure 11 Figure 11 Figure 11 Figure 12 The histological examination of kidneys from control and RT- and RT-PNP-treated mice revealed typical renal morphology, showing well-structured proximal and distal tubules and healthy glomeruli ( Figure 13 Figure 13 Figure 13 A significant increase in the severity of kidney damage scores was observed in the EAC group compared to the other antioxidant-treated groups. Notably, this was significantly reversed in the EAC/RT group and more effectively in the EAC/RT-PNP-treated group, thus highlighting the protective role of RT-PNPs ( Figure 14 2.11. Multivariable Data Analyses Based on the measured biochemical and molecular parameters, hierarchical clustering and heatmap visualization indicated distinct differences among the experimental groups (EAC, EAC-RT, and EAC/RT-PNP). The bright red color indicates that the EAC group exhibited elevated levels of inflammatory markers (TNF, IL-1β, NF-κB), tumor markers (CA19, CA125, CA15), and oxidative stress indicators (MDA). Conversely, EAC-RT and, notably, EAC/RT-PNPs exhibited a notable reduction in these markers (blue gradient), indicating that the treatment inhibited tumor growth and reduced oxidative stress. Conversely, antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT exhibited upregulation in the EAC/RT-PNP group, thereby indicating enhanced bodily defenses against free radicals. The EAC/RT-PNP group showed elevated levels of apoptotic markers (P53, Bax) compared to the EAC group, alongside markedly reduced levels of the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2. This indicates that apoptosis was activated in response to the combined treatment. The clustering patterns visually illustrate the extent to which PNPs combined with RT therapy can alter tumor biomarkers, oxidative stress, and apoptotic signaling pathways ( Figure 15 Distinct biomarker sets were analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) to assess variance and grouping within the experimental groups. The initial two principal components, PC1 and PC2, accounted for 72.3% and 6.8% of the total variation in panel A, respectively, and were visually clustered into three groups (EAC, EAC-RT, and EAC/RT-PNP), indicating apparent differences in global profiles. Panel B compared EAC and EAC-RT, accounting for 63.7% of the variation in PC1, thus indicating a molecular alteration following RT treatment. Panel C indicated that PC1 accounted for 80.3% of the variance between EAC and EAC/RT-PNPs, thereby demonstrating that nanoparticle-based therapy can potentially modify tumor characteristics. PC1 (55.3%) and PC2 (14.1%) showed distinct group segregation in Panel D when comparing EAC-RT and EAC/RT-PNPs, thus indicating an enhanced effect of PNPs beyond RT treatment ( Figure 16 3. Discussion The undifferentiated nature and aggressive growth of EAC cells make them particularly susceptible to chemotherapeutic agents, and they are frequently utilized in preclinical research to investigate the cytotoxic potential of new anti-cancer therapies [ 19 6 20 21 22 23 24 Bcl-2 Bax P53 25 26 27 Tumor markers are biomolecules associated with cancer that can be detected in tissues or blood, thereby offering a non-invasive method for cancer diagnosis and monitoring. Commonly used markers, such as AFP, CEA, CA19-9, CA-125, and CA15-3, are frequently utilized in clinical oncology [ 28 29 26 This study demonstrated that EAC-bearing mice exhibited macrocytic normochromic anemia, which is characterized by reduced RBC/platelet counts and hemoglobin levels. These findings are consistent with those of Elsadek et al. [ 30 31 32 33 34 15 35 This study demonstrated a gradual increase in body weight accompanied by cancer progression, primarily due to the excessive accumulation of ascitic fluid. This accumulation is attributed to an inflammatory response, along with tissue fibrosis related to collagen deposition [ 36 37 38 39 40 39 41 42 43 44 Concerning kidney function, the present findings indicate substantial renal dysfunction in EAC-bearing mice, as evidenced by elevated serum levels of urea and creatinine. These biochemical alterations were corroborated by histopathological analysis, which revealed degenerative, inflammatory, and vascular abnormalities, in addition to neoplastic cell infiltration in renal tissues. These results are consistent with those shown by Donia et al. [ 45 46 47 48 49 50 45 32 RT-PNP administration in EAC-bearing mice led to notable reductions in serum urea and creatinine, enhanced activity of key antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GSH-Px), and suppressed lipid peroxidation, as evidenced by decreased MDA levels, indicating renal protection. This effect was more pronounced than that observed with crude RT, likely due to its superior ROS-scavenging activity in nanoparticle form. These improvements were reinforced by the microscopic and ultrastructural findings, which primarily showed intact renal tubules and glomeruli, with only minor congestion of the tubular vessels. In comparison, untreated EAC-bearing mice exhibited significant structural damage, as evidenced by periglomerular lymphocyte infiltration and severe blood vessel congestion. There is a well-established association between chronic inflammation and the development of malignancies across various anatomical sites. Evidence suggests that proinflammatory pathways contribute to cancer initiation and progression, with the levels of biomarkers like NF-κB and proinflammatory cytokines commonly being elevated in chronic inflammatory environments, thereby contributing to carcinogenic transformation [ 15 37 51 52 15 Multivariate analyses, including hierarchical clustering and PCA, demonstrate the systemic effects of various treatment modalities. The EAC group exhibited elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines, tumor markers, and indicators of oxidative stress. In contrast, EAC/RT-PNPs demonstrated a significant suppression of these markers, along with enhanced antioxidant defense and induction of apoptosis. PCA demonstrated visually discriminated groups along principal components, thus reflecting observable treatment-induced variance. The most important shift occurred between EAC and EAC/RT-PNPs, thereby highlighting the enhanced effect of nanoparticle-based therapy combined with RT on tumor biology and homeostatic equilibrium. The separation of EAC-RT and EAC/RT-PNPs highlights the advantages of nanoparticle integration beyond the effects of RT, thereby supporting biochemical and molecular advantages. This study has some limitations that should be acknowledged. First, stability under prolonged storage conditions was not evaluated, which is essential for practical applications. Second, a blank phytosome/empty nanoparticle control was absent, which would have provided greater clarity on the independent contribution of the carrier system. Third, the results are derived from a single animal tumor model, which restricts the generalizability of the findings. Therefore, the translational potential of RT and its nanoparticle formulation should be interpreted with caution, and further validation in clinical settings and additional models will be essential to confirm these preliminary observations. Additionally, only female mice were utilized to reflect the mammary (breast) cancer origin of the EAC model and its greater clinical relevance to human breast cancer, which predominantly affects females. However, considering emerging evidence for sex-based differences in cancer biology, progression, and response to therapy, future investigations using both male and female models are recommended to characterize sex-specific effects fully and to improve the generalizability of the preclinical findings. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Preparation of Rutin-Loaded Phytosome Nanoparticles (RT-PNPs) The thin-layer hydration technique was employed to formulate RT-PNPs. The formulation consisted of RT, cholesterol, and phosphatidylcholine in optimized ratios. Specifically, cholesterol was incorporated at 5–10% ( w w For preparation, phosphatidylcholine and RT were dissolved in methanol, while cholesterol was dissolved in dichloromethane. The solutions were mixed in a round-bottom flask and subjected to rotary evaporation (Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany) at 45 °C and 100 rpm for approximately 1 h, until the complete elimination of organic solvents resulted in a thin lipid film. Residual solvents were removed via vacuum drying, and the film was flushed with nitrogen before being left overnight at 25 °C. The dried film was then hydrated with distilled water in a rotary evaporator at 45 °C. Particle size reduction was achieved via homogenization at 20,000 rpm (Heidolph, Schwabach, Germany), followed by probe sonication (Sonix, Vibracell, Newtown, CT, USA). A range of formulations was designed to optimize the RT-PNPs by adjusting the cholesterol level (0%, 5%, and 10% w w The CQAs of the prepared RT-PNPs included particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index (PDI), and entrapment efficiency, as these parameters are essential indicators of nanoparticle reproducibility, stability, and functional performance. To assess internal morphology, freshly prepared RT-PNPs were imaged using a TEM (JEOL JEM-2100, JOEL, Tokyo, Japan) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Digital Micrograph and Soft Imaging System Viewer software, Gatan Microscopy Suite (DigitalMicrograph) version 3.62 (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA), were used for image analysis. To verify the compatibility and rule out possible chemical interactions between RT and the carrier components, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR; Bruker Tensor 27, Bremen, Germany) was employed. Spectral data were collected across 4000–400 cm −1 Particle size and zeta potential were measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS) on a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). Measurements were performed at 25 °C following suitable dilution with deionized water. Encapsulation efficiency (EE%) was assessed using ultracentrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to separate the unentrapped RT. The amount of free RT in the supernatant was quantified spectrophotometrically at 257 nm, and EE% was calculated using the following equation: EE% = [(Total RT − Free RT)/Total RT] × 100 The optimized formulation was chosen based on its narrow polydispersity index (PDI < 0.3), the lowest particle size, the highest absolute zeta potential (|>25| mV), and the highest encapsulation efficiency, which collectively capture the stability and robustness of the nanosystem. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to assess potential interactions and verify the compatibility of RT with the excipients. Spectra were collected for crude RT, cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, their physical mixture, and the optimized RT-PNPs using a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrophotometer. Sample preparation involved the KBr pellet method, with data acquired between 4000 and 400 cm −1 −1 4.2. Induction of EAC in Mice The Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cell line was obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo, Egypt, and routinely sustained in vivo through the serial intraperitoneal transplantation of 2.5 × 10 6 6 Only female mice were used, as the EAC model represents murine mammary cancer and most accurately recapitulates breast cancer biology, including tumor progression and therapeutic responsiveness, in females. This aligns with the clinical epidemiology of breast cancer and with established EAC research practices, thus providing greater translational relevance for anti-tumor investigations [ 19 53 A ketamine–xylazine combination (80 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively) was administered intraperitoneally to anesthetize the mice. Ascitic fluid was then obtained from EAC-inoculated mice on day 7 or 8 post-injection, using the same anesthetic regimen. Following collection, the ascitic fluid was analyzed for viable cell count using a hemocytometer in conjunction with 0.4% trypan blue dye exclusion. The cell concentration was then adjusted to 2.5 × 10 6 4.3. Animal Handling and Experimental Protocol Ninety healthy female Swiss albino mice (Mus musculus) with an average body weight of 19.2 g were supplied by the animal House, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt. The animals were young adults, approximately 6–8 weeks old, at the beginning of this experiment. Animals were maintained in groups in standard plastic cages under controlled conditions: relative humidity was maintained at around 45%, the temperature was kept at 25 °C, and a 12 h light/dark cycle was used. Food and water were provided ad libitum throughout this study. Before initiating the experimental procedures, all animals were allowed a one-week acclimatization period to adapt to the laboratory conditions. All procedures were conducted following the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th edition, NRC, 2011) and the International Guiding Principles for Biomedical Research Involving Animals (1985). All animal experiments were approved by the Research Ethics Committee, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt (registration code number MU-ACUC; VM.R.25.08.242). Six groups of 15 mice were formed through random assignment. The first group remained untreated as a control, while the second group was administered Rutin (RT) at a daily oral dose of 25 mg/kg body weight for 20 days. The third group received RT-loaded nano-phytosomes (RT-PNPs) at the same dose and duration as the free RT group, as determined by the LD 50 6 6 The sample size for each experimental group (n = 15 mice) was determined based on previously published EAC murine studies, in which 10–12 mice per group were used to detect biological and tumor-related differences reliably. To ensure at least 80% power for pairwise comparisons at α = 0.05 and to account for anticipated attrition (10–20%, e.g., post-EAC mortality), we increased the group size to 15. This design is consistent with that needed to plan a one-way ANOVA with six groups, in which a total sample size of n = 90 yields approximately 80% power to detect moderate to large effects, which is in line with international standards for preclinical research and adheres to ethical principles that minimize animal use [ 54 55 Body weight measurements were taken for each animal at baseline and at the end of the experiment period. The survival of EAC-bearing mice in all groups was assessed through daily observation. The mean survival time (MST) was determined using the following equation: MST = (first death + last death)/2 [ 23 4.4. Sample Collection Mice from each experimental group were euthanized via cervical dislocation at the end of the experimental period. To ensure consistency in blood sampling, all animals were fasted for 10 h and anesthetized with inhaled tetrahydrofuran to minimize distress. Retro-orbital venous sinus puncture was used to collect blood samples, which were then split into two portions: one in an EDTA tube for complete blood count analysis and the other in a plain tube for serum separation. The isolated serum was stored under appropriate conditions for detailed biochemical and inflammatory cytokine evaluations. 4.5. Hematological Profile Analysis Hematological analysis was conducted using the Hema Screen 18 automated analyzer (Hospitex Diagnostics, Tuscany, Italy) to measure key indices, including red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin (Hb) level, packed cell volume (PCV), platelet count (PLT), total white blood cell (WBC) count, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). In addition, blood cells were manually counted using an improved Neubauer hemocytometer. Hayem’s solution was employed for erythrocyte analysis, while Turk’s solution was used to stain leukocytes. Reference normal ranges for female Swiss albino mice (BW: 29.4 ± 1.2 g; RBC: 7.74 ± 0.69 × 10 6 56 4.6. Serum Biochemical Analysis A biochemical analysis of serum samples was performed using standardized commercially available kits, following the manufacturers’ guidelines. The following parameters were quantified: total protein (TP; Cat. No. CBP007-K), albumin (Cat. No. MET-5017), triglycerides (TGs; Cat. No. TR 200), total cholesterol (TC; Cat. No. STA-384), aspartate aminotransferase (AST; Cat. No. MET-5127), alanine aminotransferase (ALT; Cat. No. MET-5123), alkaline phosphatase (ALP; Cat. No. CBA-301), urea (Cat. No. STA-382), and creatinine (STA-378). The concentration of globulin was determined by subtracting the albumin concentration from the total protein concentration. The serum concentrations of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) were measured using commercial ELISA kits (Cat. No. MBS825017, MBS267737, and MBS287521, respectively) supplied by MyBioSource, San Diego, CA, USA. All procedures were carried out strictly in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were measured using an automated quantitative enzyme-linked fluorescent assay (ELFA) with the mini-VIDAS ® 4.7. Quantification of Tumor Volume and Viable Cell Count in Ascitic Fluid Following EAC inoculation, ascitic fluid was aspirated from each mouse and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min. The volume of the resulting tumor cell pellet was measured using a graduated conical centrifuge tube. Cell viability was determined via the trypan blue exclusion method, in which viable cells excluded the dye and remained unstained, whereas non-viable cells were stained blue. 4.8. Antioxidant Status Following dissection, liver and kidney tissues were carefully washed with ice-cold 1.15% potassium chloride (KCl) solution to eliminate any remaining blood and tissue debris. Tissues designated for biochemical assessments were immediately frozen at −20 °C, while representative portions were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for subsequent histopathological evaluation. Liver and kidney tissues were homogenized in ice-cold phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C to obtain clear supernatants. These were subsequently used to quantify antioxidant enzymes and oxidative stress parameters. The collected supernatants were used to determine the levels of antioxidant enzymes, including catalase (CAT, Cat. No. CA 2517), superoxide dismutase (SOD, Cat. No. SD 2521), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px, Cat. No. GP 2524), as well as reduced glutathione (GSH, Cat. No. GR 2511). Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, as a marker of lipid peroxidation, were measured using the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) method (MDA, Cat. No. MD 2529). All measurements were conducted using commercially available colorimetric assay kits (Biodiagnostic Co., Giza, Egypt) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 4.9. Expression Levels of P53, Bax, and Bcl2 Genes Total cellular RNA was extracted from the tumor cells of mice bearing EAC using the Thermo Scientific Gene JET TM P53 Bax Bcl-2 GAPDH Table 4 GAPDH Bax Bcl-2 P53 57 4.10. Flow Cytometric Analysis of p53 and Ki-67 Expression Single-cell suspensions were prepared from tumor tissues by mechanically disrupting the tissues, filtering through a 70 µm mesh (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA, Cat# 352350), and centrifuging at 300×g for 5 min at 4 °C. We fixed and permeabilized 1 × 10 6 TM ® TM TM 4.11. Histopathological Analysis Liver and kidney tissues fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin were dehydrated in ascending ethanol concentrations (70%, 80%, 90%, and 100%), each for one hour. Following dehydration, the tissues were cleared in xylene (two changes, each for 1 h) and then embedded in paraffin blocks for sectioning. Tissue sections approximately 5 μm thick were prepared using a rotary microtome, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), and examined microscopically. Representative fields were photographed using a light microscope equipped with a high-resolution digital imaging system. Liver and kidney lesions were assessed in five mice using three sections per slide. Each section was examined at 400× magnification in four randomly selected fields, resulting in twelve fields per organ for semi-quantitative analysis. Histopathological lesions were scored using a standardized scale (0 = none; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe), as summarized in Table 5 Table 6 4.12. Statistical Analysis Normal distribution and equal variance assumptions were evaluated using the Shapiro–Wilk test and Levene’s test, respectively. Differences among groups were analyzed via a one-way ANOVA using SAS version 9.3 (Proc ANOVA; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA, 2012). Significant ANOVA results were further analyzed using Tukey’s post hoc test to determine differences between groups. All values are reported as the mean ± standard error, with significance defined as p https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/en 5. Conclusions The toxicity induced by Ehrlich ascites carcinoma is associated with marked disturbances in hematological and biochemical parameters, elevated oxidative stress, diminished antioxidant defenses, dysregulated apoptotic responses, and increased levels of inflammation-related cytokines, accompanied by pronounced pathological lesions in hepatic and renal tissues. Compared with crude RT, RT-PNPs more effectively preserved hepatorenal architecture, enhanced antioxidant capacity, and normalized key biochemical and inflammatory markers. Furthermore, RT-PNPs demonstrated enhanced effect in promoting apoptosis and inhibiting tumor growth. These results highlight the therapeutic advantages of nanoformulated RT, which are attributable to its improved stability, permeability, and aqueous solubility, thereby optimizing its anti-cancer potential.

The EAC group exhibited elevated tumor markers (CA19, CA125, CA15-3), inflammatory mediators (TNF, IL-1β, NF-κB), and oxidative stress indicators (MDA). In contrast, these markers were markedly reduced in EAC-RT and further suppressed in EAC/RT-PNPs.

Mild glomerular atrophy was confined to 1–2 out of 12 assessed fields. Histological evaluation revealed mild inflammation in 1 to 2 of the 12 assessed areas. Histological analysis revealed mild glomerular and interstitial congestion with infrequent hemorrhage in 1 to 2 of the 12 evaluated sections. 2 Histological analysis revealed degeneration with multifocal epithelial sloughing in 3 to 6 out of 12 fields. Mild to moderate glomerular shrinkage appeared in 3 to 4 of the 12 inspected sections. Histological examination revealed moderate inflammation in 3 to 4 of the 12 assessed areas. Histopathological evaluation revealed low-grade interstitial congestion and focal hemorrhagic areas in 3 to 4 out of 12 fields. 3 Histopathological assessment revealed widespread tubular necrosis in 7 to 9 of the 12 examined areas. Evidence of lamellar fusion was detected in 5 to 6 of the 12 inspected fields. Histopathological analysis revealed inflammation in 5–7 of the 12 inspected fields. Histopathological assessment revealed widespread interstitial congestion and hemorrhagic foci in 5 to 6 out of 12 tissue sections. ",
