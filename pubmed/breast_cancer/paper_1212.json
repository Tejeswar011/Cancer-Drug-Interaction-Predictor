Introduction Cancer is a multifactorial disease and a major public health concern worldwide, resulting from the interplay of genetic mutations and environmental factors [ 1 2 3 3 4 5 4 5 3 4 5 Several metabolic factors play pivotal roles in obesity-associated carcinogenesis [ 6 7 8 9 10 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 In response to physical activity, skeletal muscle releases a class of bioactive molecules termed myokines, which are integral to mediating the systemic benefits of exercise [ 14 15 14 16 17 18 Irisin primarily exerts its biological functions by binding to cell surface integrins, a family of receptors widely expressed across different tissues. The integrin αVβ5 complex has been most consistently identified as the principal receptor mediating irisin’s effects in various cell types, including adipocytes, osteocytes, osteoclasts, and astrocytes [ 19 20 19 20 19 20 Given that skeletal muscle is the primary source of irisin, significant inter-organ crosstalk has been observed. One prominent example is irisin’s ability to promote browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), characterized by increased uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1) expression and mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to elevated energy expenditure [ 14 15 21 16 Figure 1 In the pancreas, irisin facilitates β-cell proliferation, enhances insulin secretion and survival, and exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, thereby contributing to overall pancreatic health [ 19 20 22 23 20 22 23 Given that cancer cells preferentially rely on glycolysis for energy production, irisin-induced metabolic shifts towards oxidative phosphorylation may have tumour-suppressive effects [ 11 12 13 24 25 26 27 28 2.

Structure, Source, Half-Life, and Biological Actions of Irisin Irisin is a myokine produced by the cleavage of Fndc5, a transmembrane protein predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle cells [ 29 30 29 30 29 30 Figure 1 Since skeletal muscle is the primary source of irisin, the secretion of irisin is markedly increased during physical activity, linking muscle contraction to various systemic effects [ 20 31 32 20 31 32 Irisin plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism, particularly concerning obesity and insulin resistance [ 20 21 32 20 21 32 20 21 32 4. Obesity-Induced Carcinogenesis Obesity is an established risk factor for multiple solid tumours [ 3 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 33 34 35 36 3 7 10 40 41 5. In Vitro Effects of Irisin on Cancer Cells Since its discovery, recombinant irisin has been utilized in various cancer cell lines to assess its anticancer potential. Research has primarily focused on its anti-proliferative effects, with additional investigations exploring its impact on invasion, migration, metastasis, and cell cycle regulation. 5.1. Irisin’s Role in Proliferation Despite inconsistencies in irisin levels reported in humans and animal models following physical activity, its physiological concentration is estimated to be 3–5 ng/mL. Cancer cell lines have been exposed to both physiological and supraphysiological concentrations of irisin to evaluate its role as an anticancer agent. Interestingly, supraphysiological irisin concentrations were generally more effective in most studies. However, even low concentrations (2.5 nM) significantly reduced breast cancer cell viability (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) after 24 h, as shown in ref. [ 42 Table 1 In prostate cancer cells, Tekin et al. examined the effects of irisin (0.1–100 nM) on androgen receptor-positive (LNCaP) and -negative (DU-145 and PC3) cancer cell lines, reporting a significant reduction in cell viability at supraphysiological concentrations (10 nM and 100 nM) after 24 h treatment [ 43 44 45 In pancreatic cancer cells, 12 h treatment with 100–200 nM irisin decreased cell viability in the PANC-1 cell line [ 46 47 24 Table 1 Although ovarian cancer cell lines (OVCAR3, SKOV3, and Caov4) showed no significant changes in viability at 24 h, 48 to 120 h treatments induced a significant dose- and time-dependent reduction, with the minimum effective dose reported as a 15 nM concentration [ 48 26 Glioblastoma cell lines (U-87 MG, T98G, and LN-18) displayed a dose-dependent reduction in viability after being exposed to 200–1000 nM irisin for 72 h, with U-87 MG cells showing the highest sensitivity at 1000 nM concentration [ 49 50 51 52 53 Table 1 5.2. Molecular Mechanisms of Irisin-Induced Growth Inhibition Mechanistically, cancer cell proliferation is largely driven by dysregulated activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway, which regulates cell metabolism, growth, survival, and motility. Irisin has been shown to inhibit PI3K/Akt phosphorylation in ovarian [ 26 24 52 47 47 49 Table 1 Despite these promising findings, conflicting reports exist. Moon et al. tested irisin on obesity-related cancers (colorectal, thyroid, and oesophageal cancer) and observed no effect on proliferation [ 54 55 Table 1 5.3. Irisin and Cancer Cell Invasion and Metastasis Cancer cells metastasize through EMT, a process characterized by E-cadherin downregulation and N-cadherin/vimentin upregulation, regulated via STAT3/Snail activation [ 56 57 47 26 48 In osteosarcoma, irisin reversed interleukin-6 (IL-6)-induced EMT, leading to a reduction in N-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, MMP2, MMP6, and MMP9 expression, alongside STAT3/Snail suppression [ 50 52 Table 1 55 6. Systemic Irisin Levels and Its Expression in Clinical Cancer Specimens Accumulating evidence suggests that serum irisin levels and Fndc5/irisin expression exhibit significant alterations in various malignancies, with notable reductions observed in multiple cancer types ( Table 2 Table 3 58 59 n 60 61 62 63 64 Table 2 Table 3 Conversely, findings in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain inconsistent. While Gaggini et al. and Shi et al. found no significant difference in serum irisin levels between 56 HCC patients and healthy controls [ 55 65 66 67 Table 3 55 65 66 Contrastingly, Shahidi et al. noted an increase in serum irisin levels in 51 newly diagnosed gastric cancer patients [ 68 69 70 71 72 73 Table 2 Table 3 diseases-13-00304-t002_Table 2 Table 2 List of studies that measured irisin expression in clinical cancer specimens.

Tumour Tissue Fndc5/Irisin Main Results References Breast, Cervix, Ovaries, Endometrium ↑ irisin expression Breast and reproductive tract cancer [ 60 Colorectal Cancer ↑ irisin expression CRC compared to normal tissue [ 62 Oesophagus, Stomach, Liver, Pancreas, Brain ↑ irisin expression Gastrointestinal cancer, grade II astrocytoma [ 69 Thyroid Cancer ↑ irisin expression In oncolytic papillary carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma [ 72 Lung Cancer ↑ Fndc5 mRNA In malignant tissue compared to non-malignant [ 73 Hepatocellular Carcinoma ↑ Fndc5 mRNA HCC patients compared to donors [ 55 ↑ Fndc5 mRNA HCC patients compared to controls [ 65 ↓ Fndc5 mRNA Extracted data from TCGA for HCC patients compared to controls [ 66 Renal Cancer ↓ irisin expression Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma [ 71 diseases-13-00304-t003_Table 3 Table 3 List of clinical studies that measured serum irisin in cancer patients and their main findings. ↑ = significant increase; ↓ = significant decrease; and ↔ = no significant change. Type of Cancer Serum Irisin Levels Number of Patients Study Details References Breast cancer ↓ 101 Patients with invasive ductal [ 58 ↓ 148 Patients with spinal metastases [ 59 Colorectal cancer ↓ 116 Obese and non-obese patients [ 61 Bladder cancer ↓ 150 75 patients vs. 75 apparently healthy subjects [ 63 Prostate cancer ↓ 80 50 primary patients vs. 30 healthy male subjects [ 64 Hepatocellular carcinoma ↔ 36 HCC patients vs. healthy control [ 65 ↔ 20 [ 55 ↓ 219 [ 66 ↓ 43 [ 67 Gastric cancer ↑ 51 Newly diagnosed cases vs. healthy control [ 68 Renal cancer ↑ 176 Different types of renal cancers vs. heathy samples [ 70 Collectively, these findings underscore that variations in irisin levels and expression may depend not only on the type and clinical stage of cancer but also on the methodological approaches employed across studies ( Table 2 Table 3 74 A particularly important factor is the nature of the primary antibody used and the targeted immunogen. Many early studies relied on polyclonal antibodies, which are prone to cross-reactivity due to their affinity for multiple epitopes, potentially detecting non-specific proteins and inflating measured irisin levels [ 75 76 77 75 76 77 In this context, it is crucial to align antibody choice with the detection method and targeted domain of irisin protein [ 76 77 76 76 78 These methodological discrepancies may partially explain the conflicting reports regarding irisin’s diagnostic and prognostic significance in cancer. Therefore, standardized validation of detection protocols, especially through more specific methods (e.g., tandem mass spectrometry), is warranted to enable accurate measurement and comparison across the different sample types [ 74 75 76 77 7. Conclusions Although emerging evidence supports a role for irisin in cancer biology, the current body of literature remains limited, with inconsistent findings across malignancies. Elevated irisin protein expression has been reported in gastrointestinal, brain, breast, ovarian, cervical, endometrial, thyroid, and colorectal cancers, while renal cancer showed decreased levels. Gene expression data largely align with protein findings but remain sparse. Conflicting results, particularly in hepatocellular carcinoma, suggest that the role of irisin may be modulated by tumour-specific regulatory mechanisms. However, these discrepancies may not solely reflect biological differences but are also likely influenced by methodological variability, including inconsistencies in tissue handling, timing of sample collection, and especially antibody specificity and assay design. Therefore, the standardization of detection protocols, including the use of validated monoclonal antibodies targeting specific epitopes and the incorporation of mass spectrometry-based confirmation methods, is essential to reduce technical bias and enhance reproducibility. At the systemic level, while several studies report lower circulating irisin levels in cancer patients, others show elevated levels, further underscoring the need for cross-validation between serum, tissue, and gene expression data. To fully elucidate irisin’s diagnostic and prognostic value, future studies must integrate molecular data with clinicopathological features using harmonised methods. In summary, while irisin shows promise as a diagnostic biomarker and a modulator of tumour progression, its clinical translation will require a concerted effort to standardise methodologies and conduct well-powered, longitudinal studies across diverse cancer types. 8. Future Directions To advance irisin research from observational evidence to clinical application, the next phase of investigation must be built on methodological consistency and translational focus. First, the detection protocols should be standardized. Future studies should adopt uniform, validated assays for irisin detection. This includes using monoclonal antibodies targeting well-defined epitopes (e.g., aa 30–140 for serum, aa 150–209 for tissues), and then using tandem mass spectrometry as an orthogonal method to confirm assay specificity and sensitivity. Altogether, detailed protocols for tissue fixation, antigen retrieval, and sample storage should be reported to enhance reproducibility. Second, design large-scale, longitudinal studies. There is a critical need for prospective multicentre cohort studies that collect matched serum/tumour tissue samples, besides monitoring irisin dynamics over time in relation to treatment, recurrence, and survival. In addition, use consistent cut-offs for high vs. low irisin expression to enable pooled analyses. Third, incorporate irisin into multi-analyte biomarker panels. This would enable assessment of additive value, evaluation of dose–response relationships between irisin levels and clinical outcomes, and exploration of interventional studies targeting irisin pathways through exercise, metabolic modulation, or pharmacological agents in cancers where irisin demonstrates functional relevance. Finally, collaborative research networks are required. Cross-disciplinary collaboration between basic researchers, oncologists, pathologists, and biostatisticians is essential to develop consensus-driven protocols and facilitate translational trials. Through these focused strategies, irisin may emerge as a reliable biomarker and therapeutic target in precision oncology.
