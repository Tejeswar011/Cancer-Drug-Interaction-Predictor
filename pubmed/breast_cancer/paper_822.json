Its incidence is rising in the Middle East, including the United Arab Emirates, where patients often present with aggressive disease phenotypes and complex treatment needs[ 1 3 4 5 6 7 e.g. 8 This dynamic landscape, featuring new therapies and fundamentally evolved treatment paradigms, created a clear need for updated national clinical guidance. Concurrently, variability in the delivery and disparities in the access of IBD care between different healthcare services within the United Arab Emirates underscored the urgency of establishing a unified, contemporary standard of practice nationwide. Responding to these drivers, the second edition of the United Arab Emirates IBD consensus guidance were developed through a rigorous consensus process involving national experts and a systematic review of current evidence. The primary aim was to synthesize the latest advancements and provide a consistent, evidence-based framework to guide clinical decision-making across the country. Furthermore, recognizing that improving IBD care requires a multi-stakeholder effort, the guidance was intentionally designed to serve not only clinicians but also payers/insurance providers, and policymakers, thereby facilitating broader efforts towards enhanced care quality, equitable access, and better patient outcomes, aligning practices in the Emirates with international standards. METHODOLOGY OF THE CONSENSUS The second edition of United Arab Emirates IBD consensus guidance was developed using a Delphi consensus methodology, ensuring a structured, transparent, and evidence-based approach to generating recommendations. A panel of 11 IBD experts in the United Arab Emirates was convened under the Emirates Gastroenterology and Hepatology Society. The guideline development process was informed by international best practices while considering United Arab Emirates - specific challenges such as access to advanced therapies, healthcare infrastructure, and insurance barriers. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify relevant clinical evidence supporting the guideline statements. Three electronic databases - MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials - were searched, with the last search conducted in May 2025. The search strategy included a combination of indexed terms and free-text terms to maximize sensitivity. Full-text publications from major international societies, including the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO), and British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG), were reviewed. Additionally, conference abstracts from January 2024 to April 2025 were included to capture emerging trial data, ensuring that unpublished but clinically significant findings were incorporated. Level of evidence was assessed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2011 framework. This system ranks evidence based on study design, with systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) at the highest level (level 1) and expert opinion at the lowest (level 5). The strength of recommendations was determined using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, classifying them as either strong or conditional[ 9 The guideline statements were finalized using a two-stage Delphi consensus process. In the first round, expert panelists rated each statement on a five-point Likert scale. Statements reaching ≥ 75% consensus were accepted, while those with 50%-74.9% agreement were revised and re-evaluated in the second round. Statements with < 50% agreement were either discarded or substantially modified. This iterative approach ensured that the final recommendations were clinically relevant, practical, and tailored to the United Arab Emirates healthcare system. A summary of all 188 consensus statements is provided in Table 1 Table 1 Summary of the United Arab Emirates inflammatory bowel disease consensus guidance statements  No.  Consensus statement  Evidence; strength; consensus (%) Diagnosis and classification of IBD 1 No single reference standard exists for diagnosing CD or UC; diagnosis requires integration of clinical history, biochemical markers, stool studies, endoscopy, histology, and imaging 5; strong; 100 2 Early detection of IBD is crucial to preventing complications and improving outcomes. Validated screening tools, such as the red flags index and IBD-REFER, may aid in triaging patients or referrals based on clinical history 3b; strong; 100 3 The differentiation between CD and UC should be based on a combination of clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and radiologic findings, as no single modality is diagnostic 3b; strong; 100 4 Diagnostic evaluation must exclude other potential causes of colitis, including infections ( Clostridioides difficile Salmonella Shigella Campylobacter Cytomegalovirus Mycobacterium tuberculosis Yersinia enterocolitis 3b; strong; 100 5 Extraintestinal manifestations and presence of perianal disease of IBD should be assessed at the time of diagnosis and during the course of the disease, as they may precede or accompany gastrointestinal symptoms 3b; strong; 100 6 Fecal calprotectin should be used as non-invasive screening tools for differentiating IBD from functional bowel disorders, with values > 250 μg/g strongly suggestive of active inflammation 3b; strong; 100 7 Serum CRP should be measured at baseline for all suspected IBD cases, but their utility is limited by lack of specificity 3b; strong; 100 8 Iron deficiency anaemia, hypoalbuminemia, and vitamin deficiencies may provide indirect evidence of chronic inflammation and should be assessed at diagnosis 3b; strong; 100 9 Genetic and serological testing in isolation is not recommended for routine IBD diagnosis due to low predictive value and lack of clear clinical utility 3b; strong; 100 10 Ileocolonoscopy with segmental biopsies is required for the initial diagnosis of suspected IBD, except in acute severe colitis, where sigmoidoscopy with biopsy is preferred 2a; strong; 100 11 Endoscopic differentiation of CD and UC should be based on characteristic features: UC typically presents with continuous inflammation, loss of vascular pattern, and superficial ulceration, whereas CD is often characterized by skip lesions, cobblestoning, deep ulcerations, strictures, and fistulas 3b; strong; 91 12 At the time of index ileocolonoscopy, if endoscopic evidence of active inflammation, two to four biopsies should be obtained from at least five segments (rectum, sigmoid, descending, transverse, and ascending colon) and the terminal ileum, including areas of both inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa 5; strong; 100 13 Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy should be performed in patients with suspected upper gastrointestinal involvement 4; strong; 100 14 Capsule endoscopy may be considered for patients with suspected small bowel CD when ileocolonoscopy and cross-sectional imaging are inconclusive with prior assessments 3b; strong; 100 15 Histologic confirmation of IBD is essential and should include evaluation for crypt architectural distortion, basal plasmacytosis, granulomas, and transmural inflammation 3b; strong; 100 16 Cross-sectional imaging (MRI, MRE, CT, CTE, or intestinal ultrasound) should be performed in all patients with suspected small bowel CD to assess disease extent, stricturing, and complications 2a; strong; 100 17 MRE is the preferred imaging modality for small bowel assessment due to its superior soft-tissue contrast and lack of radiation exposure 2a; strong; 100 18 CTE may be used when MRE is unavailable, contraindicated, or in acute settings requiring rapid evaluation 2a; strong; 100 19 Pelvic MRI should be performed in patients with suspected perianal CD to evaluate fistulae and abscesses 2a; strong; 91 20 Intestinal ultrasound is an emerging modality that may serve as a point-of-care tool for assessing disease activity but has limited use as sole radiological investigation for diagnosis 3b; conditional; 100 21 The Montreal classification should be used for CD and UC in adults to enable standardization of disease characterization, aid in prognostication, and guide treatment decisions 3b; strong; 100 Assessment of disease activity (UC) 22 The Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index should be used for routine clinical assessment of UC due to its validity, reliability, and inclusion of urgency and nocturnal bowel movements. The partial Mayo score may be used but clinicians need to be aware of its subjectivity 3b; strong; 82 23 The Truelove and Witts’ criteria should be used to identify acute severe UC requiring hospitalization and intravenous corticosteroids 3b; strong; 82 24 Fecal calprotectin should be used as a non-invasive screening tool for differentiating inflammatory disorders such as IBD from functional bowel disorders, with values > 250 μg/g strongly suggestive of active inflammation 3b; strong; 100 25 The Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity or Mayo endoscopic subscore should be used to endoscopic scoring of disease activity 3b; strong; 100 26 Histological assessment should complement endoscopic assessment 3b; strong; 100 27 Intestinal ultrasound should be considered where available for non-invasive disease monitoring 3b; conditional; 100 Assessment of disease activity (CD) 28 A patient-reported outcome measure such as HBI or patient-reported outcome 2 is recommended for routine clinical assessment of CD. The Perianal Crohn’s Disease Activity Index should be considered to assess perianal disease activity 3b; strong; 100 29 Fecal calprotectin may be considered to monitor disease activity and response to treatment in CD, with greater sensitivity for colonic involvement than ileal disease. Changes in fecal calprotectin over time should guide disease monitoring 3b; strong; 100 30 The Simple Endoscopic Score for CD should be the preferred tool for routine endoscopic assessment in CD. The Rutgeerts score should be used in CD to assess the risk of recurrence at the anastomosis site following ileocolic resection 3b; strong; 100 31 Histological assessment should complement endoscopic assessment 4; strong; 100 32 Radiological assessment should be integrated into disease monitoring of CD, with the Magnetic Resonance Index of Activity as the preferred objective tool for evaluating luminal disease activity. Intestinal ultrasound may be used where available for non-invasive monitoring 3b; strong; 100 Markers of disease severity in IBD 33 In UC, certain risk factors including younger age at diagnosis (< 40 years), extensive colitis (E3), steroid dependency, severe endoscopic disease activity, presence of extraintestinal manifestations including primary sclerosing cholangitis a more aggressive disease course and higher colectomy risk, warranting consideration of early therapeutic escalation 3b; strong; 100 34 In CD, certain risk factors including young age at onset (< 40 years), perianal involvement, deep ulcers on endoscopy, active smoking and extensive small bowel disease predict a more severe disease course, justifying early advanced therapy 3b; strong; 91 35 Smoking significantly worsens CD outcomes, contributing to treatment resistance, complications, and post-surgical recurrence, making smoking cessation a key management priority 2b; strong; 100 Early disease control in IBD 36 Early initiation of advanced therapy should be prioritized in moderate-to-severe CD or high-risk phenotypes to prevent disease progression, complications, and irreversible bowel damage 1a; strong; 100 37 In UC, the benefits of early advanced therapy remain uncertain, but combination infliximab and azathioprine may be considered as an option in steroid-responsive acute severe UC for superior outcomes 1b; strong; 91 38 Mild CD, defined by the absence of complications, systemic symptoms, and significant endoscopic or biomarker evidence of inflammation, may be managed initially with conventional therapies such as dietary modification, oral budesonide and smoking cessation. However, close monitoring is essential, and advanced therapies should be considered early in patients with risk factors for disease progression 5; strong; 91 Treat to target strategy in IBD 39 The treat-to-target strategy should be the standard approach in IBD management, integrating objective disease monitoring to optimize treatment, guide therapy escalation when targets are unmet, and prevent complications 1b; strong; 91 40 Short-term targets should include symptomatic response within twelve weeks of therapy initiation, recognizing that symptom relief alone does not confirm inflammation control 1b; strong; 100 41 Biochemical remission, defined by normalization of inflammatory biomarkers (for example CRP < 5 mg/L, fecal calprotectin < 250 μg/g), should be the medium-term treatment target (3 months to 6 months of initiation), guiding therapy escalation when unmet 1b; strong; 91 42 Endoscopic remission, defined as absence of ulcers in CD and a Mayo endoscopic score of 0-1 in UC, should be the primary long-term treatment target (6 months to 12 months of initiation), with histologic and transmural healing as aspirational goals 2a; strong; 100 43 Quality of life and disability reduction should be considered as complementary long-term targets in IBD management 3b; strong; 100 Medical therapies (UC) 44 5-ASA should be the first-line therapy for induction and maintenance of remission in mild to moderate UC 1a; strong; 100 45 For patients with active moderate UC, a higher dose of oral mesalamine (4.8 g/day) should be considered, particularly in those with prior corticosteroid use or persistent symptoms. For maintenance of remission a lower dose may be considered once disease control is achieved 1a; strong; 100 46 Combination therapy with oral and topical mesalamine should be preferred for left-sided or extensive UC, while topical mesalamine alone may be used for ulcerative proctitis 1a; strong; 91 47 Oral prednisolone may be used for inducing remission in moderate to severe UC, with a tapering strategy based on clinical response. Budesonide MMX may be considered for induction of remission for mild to moderate UC 1a; strong; 100 48 For active distal UC, combination therapy with topical 5-ASA and topical/rectal steroids maybe considered for induction of remission 1a; strong; 100 49 Corticosteroids should not be used for the maintenance of remission in UC due to their unfavorable long-term safety profile and lack of efficacy in preventing relapse 1a; strong; 100 50 Thiopurine monotherapy is not recommended for induction of remission in UC due to its slow onset of action and lack of robust supporting evidence 1a; strong; 100 51 Thiopurines may be used in combination with infliximab for remission in moderate-to-severe UC 1b; strong; 100 52 Thiopurines may be used for long-term maintenance of remission in UC, but their use should be weighed against their safety profile relative to certain advanced therapies 2a; strong; 91 53 Methotrexate as monotherapy is not recommended for the induction or maintenance of remission in UC due to a lack of consistent efficacy in clinical trials 1b; strong; 100 54 Infliximab is recommended for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe UC based on robust evidence from randomized controlled trials 1b; strong; 100 55 Combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine is superior to monotherapy for corticosteroid-free remission and mucosal healing in advanced therapy-naive patients with moderate-to-severe UC 1b; strong; 100 56 Subcutaneous infliximab (CT-P13 SC) is an effective maintenance therapy following intravenous induction in moderate-to-severe UC 1b; strong; 100 57 Switching from intravenous to subcutaneous infliximab (120 mg, every other week) is safe and effective in UC, but patients on intensified IV dosing (10 mg/kg, every 4 weeks) have a higher relapse risk. These patients may require upfront dose escalation (240 mg, every other week) to maintain remission 2a; strong; 91 58 Adalimumab may be considered for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe UC 1b; strong; 100 59 Golimumab is recommended for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe UC 1b; strong; 82 60 Vedolizumab is recommended for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe UC 1b; strong; 100 61 Ustekinumab is recommended for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe UC 1b; strong; 100 62 Risankizumab is recommended for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe UC with both 180 mg and 360 mg every 8 weeks as effective maintenance dosing options 1b; strong; 100 63 Mirikizumab is recommended for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe UC 1b; strong; 100 64 Guselkumab is effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe UC, with both intravenous and subcutaneous induction strategies available 1b; strong; 100 65 For maintenance therapy, guselkumab should be administered subcutaneously, with both 200 mg every 4 weeks and 100 mg every 8 weeks as effective dosing options 1b; strong; 100 66 Tofacitinib is effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe UC 1b; strong; 100 67 Upadacitinib is effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe UC 1b; strong; 100 68 Ozanimod is effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe UC 1b; strong; 100 69 Etrasimod is effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe UC 1b; strong; 100 70 Etrasimod may be considered as a treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severe isolated proctitis who require advanced therapy 1b; conditional; 100 Medical therapies (CD) 71 Oral 5-ASA are not recommended for the induction or maintenance of remission in CD due to a lack of significant benefit over placebo 1a; strong; 100 72 Sulfasalazine (not mesalazine) may provide modest benefit for induction of remission in mild Crohn’s colitis 1a; weak; 91 73 Systemic corticosteroids are effective for inducing remission in active CD but should not be used for long-term maintenance due to safety concerns and lack of sustained efficacy 1a; strong; 100 74 Budesonide 9 mg once daily is an effective induction therapy for mild to moderate ileal and right colonic CD, offering a better safety profile than systemic corticosteroids 1b; strong; 100 75 Thiopurine monotherapy is not recommended for the induction of remission in CD due to limited efficacy 1a; strong; 100 76 Thiopurines may be considered for maintenance of remission in CD, particularly in corticosteroid-dependent patients, but their effectiveness is lower compared to advanced therapies 1a; weak; 91 77 Combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine is more effective than either agent alone for achieving clinical remission and mucosal healing in CD 1b; strong; 100 78 Intramuscular methotrexate may be considered for inducing and maintaining remission in CD; however, its use should be weighed against its safety profile relative to certain advanced therapies 1a; strong; 100 79 Methotrexate may be used in combination with anti-TNF therapy to reduce immunogenicity in patient’s intolerant or unsuitable for thiopurines 1b; weak; 100 80 Infliximab is recommended for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe CD 1b; strong; 100 81 Combination therapy with infliximab and azathioprine is superior to monotherapy for corticosteroid-free remission and mucosal healing in biologic-naive CD 1b; strong; 100 82 Infliximab is recommended for achieving and sustaining fistula closure in perianal and rectovaginal fistulizing CD 1b; strong; 100 83 Subcutaneous infliximab (CT-P13 SC) is an effective maintenance therapy following intravenous induction in moderate-to-severe CD 1b; strong; 100 84 Switching from intravenous to subcutaneous infliximab (120 mg, every other week) is safe and effective in CD, but patients on intensified IV dosing (10 mg/kg, every 4 weeks) have a higher relapse risk.

Patients who do not achieve response at week 6 may benefit from an additional intravenous dose at week 10. The clinical decision support tool may be used to guide patient selection for its use in CD 1b; strong; 91 88 Ustekinumab is recommended for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe CD 1b; strong; 100 89 Risankizumab is recommended for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe CD colitis with both 180 mg and 360 mg every 8 weeks as effective maintenance dosing options 1b; strong; 100 90 Mirikizumab is recommended for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe CD 1b; strong; 100 91 Guselkumab is effective for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe CD, with both intravenous and subcutaneous induction strategies available 1b; strong; 100 92 For maintenance therapy in CD, guselkumab should be administered subcutaneously, with both 200 mg every 4 weeks and 100 mg every 8 weeks as effective dosing options 1b; strong; 100 93 Upadacitinib is recommended for the induction and maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe CD 1b; strong; 100 Safety and monitoring of therapies in IBD 94 A comprehensive pre-advanced therapy safety screening (that includes hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis) should be performed before initiating advanced therapy to minimize the risk of opportunistic infections and complications associated with immunosuppression. HIV testing should be considered in vulnerable individuals as defined by World Health Organization 3b; strong; 100 95 Patients with latent tuberculosis should receive full chemoprophylaxis before initiating biologic or small-molecule therapy, following treatment protocols and durations as per institutional antimicrobial policies and appropriate referral to infectious disease specialists. Biologic or small-molecule therapy should be delayed for at least 4 weeks after initiating tuberculosis treatment, unless clinically urgent, in which case specialist advice is required 3b; strong; 100 96 Patients with chronic hepatitis B (positive hepatitis B surface antigen) should receive antiviral prophylaxis, preferably with tenofovir or entecavir, initiated at least two weeks before therapy and continued for at least 12 months after cessation, while those with resolved infection should undergo regular monitoring for reactivation 3b; strong; 91 97 Patients with IBD and hepatitis C should be treated with direct-acting antiviral agents according to national and international guidelines, with close monitoring during antiviral therapy due to limited data on its impact in immunosuppressed patients 2a; strong; 100 98 Regular renal and hepatic function monitoring is essential during mesalamine therapy to detect potential adverse effects, including interstitial nephritis and hepatotoxicity, with baseline serum creatinine assessment and periodic renal and liver function tests recommended 3b; strong; 100 99 Corticosteroid use in IBD should be limited to short induction courses with rapid tapering, and prolonged or repeated use should be avoided due to risks including osteoporosis, infections, adrenal insufficiency, and increased mortality 3b; strong; 100 100 Patients requiring corticosteroid therapy should receive calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and those at risk of adrenal insufficiency after prolonged use should undergo adrenal function assessment before withdrawal with appropriate referral to endocrinology services 3b; strong; 82 101 Thiopurines require regular monitoring due to risks of opportunistic infections, hepatotoxicity, bone marrow suppression, and malignancy, including an increased risk of lymphoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer; thiopurine methyltransferase and nudix hydrolase 15 genotyping may be considered before initiation to guide dosing 2a; strong; 91 102 Methotrexate requires routine monitoring for hepatotoxicity, bone marrow suppression, and pulmonary toxicity, with folic acid supplementation recommended to mitigate hematologic toxicity; it is contraindicated in pregnancy and should be discontinued at least three months before conception 3b; strong; 100 103 Anti-TNF agents require thorough safety monitoring due to risks of serious infections, malignancy, immunogenicity, and metabolic effects 2a; strong; 100 104 Anti-TNFs should be avoided in patients with New York Heart Association class III/IV heart failure, active malignancy, or demyelinating disorders, with treatment initiation delayed for at least two years in low-risk malignancies and five years in high-risk cases 3b; strong; 91 105 Vedolizumab has a favorable safety profile with no significant increased risk of infections, malignancies, or hepatic toxicity; however, routine monitoring of liver function is recommended due to rare hepatobiliary events 2a; strong; 100 106 Vedolizumab may be a preferred advanced therapy in patients with a history of malignancy due to its gut-selective mechanism and lack of observed increased cancer recurrence risk 3b; strong; 91 107 IL-12/IL-23 and IL-23 inhibitors have a favorable safety profile in IBD; however, herpes zoster infections and transient liver enzyme elevations may occur, necessitating routine liver function monitoring 2a; strong; 91 108 JAK inhibitors require close monitoring due to potential risks of infections, malignancy, cardiovascular events, thromboembolism, and metabolic disturbances, with recommended screening for CBC, liver function, herpes zoster, lipid levels, and liver function before and during treatment 2a; strong; 100 109 JAK inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy due to teratogenicity and should be discontinued before conception, with effective contraception advised during treatment 3b; strong; 100 110 S1PR modulators require monitoring for lymphopenia, liver enzyme elevations, hypertension, and cardiac conduction abnormalities, with baseline and periodic assessments of CBC, liver function, blood pressure, ophthalmic examination and electrocardiogram in at-risk patients 2a; strong; 100 111 S1PR modulators are contraindicated in patients with significant cardiac conduction disorders, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, decompensated heart failure, recent stroke, or uncontrolled hypertension, and should not be used in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors 3b;

strong; 100 114 Advanced therapy selection should incorporate evidence-informed comparative efficacy, particularly in biologic-exposed patients where some therapies may be less effective 2a; strong; 100 115 Infliximab remains the preferred first-line biologic for perianal fistulizing CD, with combination therapy (infliximab plus an immunomodulator) improving fistula closure rates 1; strong; 100 116 In select cases such as limited ileocecal disease or advanced complicated disease, surgery may be considered as a first-line option instead of prolonged or ineffective medical therapy 1b; conditional; 100 Response assessment and optimization of advanced therapies 117 Response to induction therapy should be assessed between weeks 10 and weeks 14, guided primarily by clinical and biomarker response, with endoscopic evaluation reserved for selected cases 5; strong; 100 118 Patients should ideally achieve clinical remission before transitioning to maintenance therapy, though in practice, a significant clinical response is an acceptable goal to proceed with maintenance 5; strong; 100 119 Extended induction may be considered with certain advanced therapies for patients who exhibit an inadequate response following the standard induction phase 2a; conditional; 91 120 LOR is defined as the recurrence of clinical symptoms or objective markers of active disease after an initial response to therapy. In suspected LOR, non-inflammatory conditions such as IBS, bile acid malabsorption, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, structural complications, and infections should be ruled out before adjusting treatment 5; strong; 100 121 In confirmed LOR, if pharmacokinetic failure is suspected, ideally guided by TDM, therapy should be intensified or switched within class, particularly for anti-TNF agents. If mechanistic failure is suspected, switching to a therapy with a different mechanism of action should be prioritized 2a; conditional; 100 122 Dual advanced therapy may be considered in highly refractory cases, particularly for perianal CD with close safety monitoring and informed consent 3b; conditional; 100 123 Difficult-to-treat IBD should be defined by failure of at least two advanced therapies with different mechanisms of action, recurrent CD following two or more resections, chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis, complex perianal CD, or significant psychosocial comorbidities that interfere with management 5; strong; 100 124 Patients meeting criteria for difficult-to-treat IBD should be referred to a specialized IBD center with access to multidisciplinary care and clinical trials. Early referral ensures timely optimization of complex treatment strategies and access to therapies beyond standard practice 5; strong; 100 125 Proactive TDM at week 14 post-induction and during maintenance is recommended with infliximab to optimize drug exposure, reduce immunogenicity, and improve long-term outcomes. Reactive TDM should be used to guide dose adjustments in cases of primary nonresponse or secondary loss of response 1b; strong; 100 126 Dose intensification with infliximab, either through interval shortening or higher dosing, is effective for secondary loss of response due to low drug levels in absence of anti-drug antibodies and should be guided by TDM 2a; conditional; 100 127 In acute severe UC, accelerated induction or higher initial doses of infliximab may be considered in steroid-refractory cases, but randomized data do not support routine escalation to 10 mg/kg induction. Patient selection should be guided by clinical and biomarker indicators 1b; conditional; 82 128 TDM for adalimumab is recommended, as higher drug levels correlate with improved long-term outcomes. Proactive TDM, post-induction, may optimize drug exposure and reduce early loss of response 2a; strong; 82 129 Dose intensification with adalimumab to 40 mg weekly may be considered for loss of response, guided by reactive TDM. Higher induction dosing has not demonstrated superior efficacy, but maintenance dose adjustments based on pharmacokinetics and inflammatory burden may improve outcomes 1b; conditional; 100 130 The role of TDM in golimumab remains unclear, though higher drug levels correlate with improved outcomes. While early proactive monitoring may help optimize response, routine TDM is not currently recommended 3b; conditional; 82 131 Dose intensification with golimumab to 100 mg every 4 weeks may be considered for UC patients with inadequate response, as it can recapture response in select cases. Proactive optimization strategies incorporating TDM may further enhance outcomes 2a; conditional; 82 132 TDM for certolizumab pegol in CD remains exploratory, with emerging evidence suggesting higher drug levels correlate with improved outcomes. However, no definitive therapeutic thresholds have been established, and its routine use is not recommended 3b; conditional; 91 133 Dose intensification with certolizumab may be considered for refractory CD, but available data show mixed results, and non-TDM-based escalation does not consistently improve outcomes 3b; conditional; 91 134 TDM for vedolizumab is not routinely recommended, though higher drug levels correlate with improved outcomes. Immunogenicity is low, and combination therapy with immunomodulators does not significantly impact drug levels 3b; conditional; 100 135 An additional week 10 dose may be considered for delayed responders to vedolizumab in CD, though its benefit in UC remains uncertain. Dose intensification of vedolizumab to every 4 weeks can restore response in some secondary non-responders but is not effective for primary non-response 1b; conditional; 100 136 TDM for ustekinumab is not routinely recommended, as no clear exposure-efficacy targets exist, and immunogenicity is low and combination therapy with immunomodulators does not significantly impact drug levels 3b; conditional; 100 137 Dose intensification with ustekinumab, including interval shortening or IV reinduction, may be considered for patients with secondary loss of response in CD, as observational data suggest clinical benefit in select cases. However, randomized trials have not consistently demonstrated superiority of IV reinduction followed by every 4 weeks maintenance over standard dosing 2a; conditional; 100 138 TDM for risankizumab is not recommended in view of very low anti-drug antibody rates and the absence of defined exposure-efficacy targets 3b; strong; 100 139 Extended induction with risankizumab with a further three IV induction doses may be considered for non-responders at week 12 in CD and UC. In CD, a single IV rescue dose of 1200 mg or dose intensification to 4 weekly subcutaneous maintenance injections may be considered for secondary loss of response. There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend dose intensification for UC 2a; conditional; 82 140 Routine therapeutic drug monitoring for mirikizumab is not recommended due to its low immunogenicity and minimal impact of anti-drug antibodies on efficacy. Fixed dosing is appropriate based on current evidence 3b; strong; 100 141 Extended induction with mirikizumab may be considered for UC patients with a delayed response, as an additional 12 weeks of induction has shown benefit. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend dose intensification strategies for mirikizumab in UC or CD 2a; conditional; 100 142 TDM for guselkumab is not currently recommended due to the low incidence of anti-drug antibodies and neutralizing antibodies, with no significant impact on drug levels, efficacy, or safety 3b; strong; 100 143 There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend extended induction with guselkumab for post-induction primary non-response or inadequate response. The role of dose intensification following loss of response with guselkumab remains undefined, but based on clinical trial data, escalation to 200 mg every 4 weeks may be considered in patients on 100 mg every 8 weeks on an individual basis in CD 2a; conditional; 91 144 TDM is not recommended for JAK inhibitors, including tofacitinib and upadacitinib, due to their predictable pharmacokinetics, dose-proportional exposure, and lack of immunogenicity 3b; strong; 100 145 Extended induction with tofacitinib (10 mg twice a day for up to 16 weeks) may be considered in UC patients who do not respond after 8 weeks; however, it should be used selectively due to a lack of long-term safety data. Dose escalation from 5 mg twice a day to 10 mg twice a day can recapture response in some patients but must be weighed against potential risks, including venous thromboembolism and herpes zoster 2a; conditional; 91 146 Extended induction with upadacitinib (16 weeks in UC, 24 weeks in CD) may be considered for delayed responders, while dose escalation to 30 mg once daily can recapture response in select patients. However, safety concerns, including risks of venous thromboembolism, herpes zoster, and malignancy, should be carefully considered before dose intensification 2a; conditional; 91 147 Therapeutic drug monitoring is not recommended for S1PR modulators due to predictable pharmacokinetics and lack of immunogenicity. There is insufficient evidence to recommend extended induction or dose optimization strategies for managing loss of response 3b; conditional; 100 Withdrawal of therapy in IBD 148 Stopping infliximab may significantly increase relapse risk in CD and UC. Discontinuation should only be considered in carefully selected patients with sustained deep remission, with close monitoring for early signs of disease recurrence 1a; conditional; 100 149 Thiopurine withdrawal may be considered in patients with CD in sustained steroid-free clinical remission on combination therapy with infliximab for at least 6 months, particularly in those with stable infliximab trough levels and low immunogenicity risk. Post-withdrawal monitoring with biomarkers and scheduled TDM is essential to detect early relapse 1b; conditional; 100 150 There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend the routine discontinuation of non-anti-TNF biologics or small molecules in patients in remission. The limited data available suggest a significant risk of relapse upon withdrawal. Therefore, any decision to stop therapy must be individualized, balancing the risks of long-term drug exposure against the consequences of a disease flare, and made with caution 4; conditional; 100 Management of ASUC 151 Intravenous corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of initial therapy for ASUC, with early response assessment using Travis criteria at day 3 to identify patients requiring rescue therapy 1b; strong; 100 152 Rescue therapy with infliximab or cyclosporine is recommended for steroid-refractory ASUC, with the choice guided by prior therapy exposure, clinician expertise, and potential toxicity concerns.

However, select patients may respond to antibiotics alone, particularly for smaller or less complex abscesses. Surgery should be considered if drainage is not feasible, unsuccessful, or if sepsis persists 2b; strong; 100 Post-operative prevention of recurrence of CD 163 Post-operative prophylactic therapy should be considered in high-risk patients for prevention of early disease recurrence ( e.g. 1b; strong; 91 164 Anti-interleukin therapies (anti-IL12/IL-23 and anti-IL23) and JAK may be considered on a case-by-case basis for post operative recurrence prevention 5; conditional; 100 165 Early post-operative endoscopic assessment (within 6-12 months) using the modified Rutgeerts score is recommended to guide therapy escalation, with i2b or higher lesions warranting immediate treatment intensification 1b; strong; 100 Management of IBD in pregnancy 166 Preconception counselling should be provided to all individuals with IBD planning pregnancy, emphasizing the importance of achieving sustained steroid-free remission for at least 3-6 months before conception to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes 3b; strong; 100 167 Referral to an obstetrician-gynecologist, ideally one with expertise in high-risk pregnancies, and multidisciplinary team co-management are recommended for individuals with IBD during pregnancy 5; strong; 100 168 Aminosalicylates, thiopurines, anti-TNFs, vedolizumab, ustekinumab and IL-23 inhibitors are considered safe and should generally be continued during pregnancy, as active disease poses greater risks than medication exposure. Methotrexate, JAK inhibitors, and S1PR modulators should be discontinued prior to conception due to teratogenicity 3b; strong; 91 169 Pregnant individuals with IBD should undergo routine disease monitoring using fecal calprotectin and CRP each trimester. Endoscopy should be reserved for strong clinical indications, while MRE (without gadolinium) and intestinal ultrasound are preferred for imaging when necessary 3b; strong; 100 170 Labor and delivery planning should be individualized, with vaginal delivery being safe for most patients. Caesarean section is recommended in cases of active perianal disease or prior ileal pouch-anal anastomosis surgery to reduce the risk of complications 3b; strong; 100 171 Breastfeeding should be encouraged in individuals with IBD, as most medications, including 5-ASA, thiopurines, anti-TNFs, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and IL-23 inhibitors, have minimal transfer into breast milk and do not pose significant risks.

In CD, this is reflected by a reduction in abdominal pain and stool frequency as measured by HBI or PRO-2 score, whereas in UC, it is defined by a decrease in rectal bleeding and normalization of stool frequency as measured by SCCAI or Partial Mayo score. While symptom relief is an important patient-centered outcome, relying solely on clinical response can be misleading, as symptoms do not always correlate with active inflammation particularly in CD. Clinical trials such as CALM and REACT demonstrated that tight control strategies based on biomarker monitoring in addition to symptom assessment significantly improved long-term outcomes compared to symptom-driven therapy alone[ 101 102 The medium-term target, as assessed between 3-6 months into therapy is biochemical remission, defined by normalization of inflammatory biomarkers such as CRP and fecal calprotectin. Persistent subclinical inflammation despite symptom improvement has been shown to increase the risk of disease progression. The STRIDE-II consensus recommends CRP levels below 5 mg/L and fecal calprotectin below 250 μg/g in UC and 150 μg/g in postoperative CD[ 61 103 104 105 The long-term target, assessed between 6-12 months into therapy, emphasizes the importance of achieving endoscopic remission, with the addition of aspirational targets that include histologic and transmural healing. Endoscopic remission, defined as the absence of ulcers in CD and a Mayo endoscopic score of 0-1 in UC, has been linked to improved long-term outcomes. A post hoc 106 NCT05230173 107 108 109 110 NCT04259138 111 103 112 113 114 61 115 117  Statement 39:  Statement 40:  Statement 41:  Statement 42:  Statement 43: Medical therapies in IBD  Conventional therapies: e.g. e.g. Thiopurines, including azathioprine and mercaptopurine, are immunomodulators used in steroid-dependent or immunosuppressive-requiring UC and CD. Azathioprine is dosed at 1.5-2.5 mg/kg/day, while mercaptopurine is used at 0.75-1.5 mg/kg/day. Given their delayed onset of action (8-12 weeks), they are not used for induction therapy, but rather for maintenance of remission or as part of combination therapy with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to reduce immunogenicity. Methotrexate is another immunomodulator, primarily used in CD. Subcutaneous or intramuscular methotrexate at 25 mg weekly is used for induction, with maintenance dosing at 15 mg weekly. Oral formulations (7.5-25 mg, weekly) are an alternative but are associated with lower bioavailability. Folic acid supplementation (5 mg, once or twice weekly, excluding the day of methotrexate administration) is required to reduce toxicity. Corticosteroids remain a key component of induction therapy in moderate-to-severe flares of IBD but are not suitable for long-term maintenance due to significant adverse effects. Prednisolone is typically initiated at 40 mg daily, with a gradual taper of 5 mg per week over 8-12 weeks to minimize relapse risk. IV methylprednisolone (40-60 mg daily) or hydrocortisone (100 mg, four times a day) is used in severe colitis or complicated CD requiring hospitalization, with transition to oral steroids once improvement is noted. Budesonide offers a topically active corticosteroid with reduced systemic absorption, making it a preferred option for localized ileal and colonic inflammation. Budesonide MMX (9 mg, once daily) is used for mild-to-moderate UC, while budesonide controlled ileal release (9 mg daily, tapered over 8 weeks) is primarily used for ileal or right-sided CD. In extensive colonic disease, budesonide MMX provides an alternative to prednisolone with a better safety profile, though it remains less effective in severe cases. Budesonide foam enemas (2 mg, twice daily for 2 weeks; then once daily for 4 weeks) are effective for distal UC. Prednisolone suppositories (5 mg, once daily) can be used for proctitis, though mesalazine remains the first-line option.  Advanced therapies (biologics and small molecules): Integrin inhibitors and IL-targeting therapies provide an alternative targeted mechanism of action. Vedolizumab, an α4β7 integrin antagonist that selectively blocks gut lymphocyte trafficking, is administered as an IV induction at 300 mg at weeks 0, 2, and 6, with an optional additional IV dose at week 10, followed by maintenance dosing of 300 mg IV every 8 weeks. The IL-12/IL-23 antagonist ustekinumab is administered as an IV induction dose based on weight (260 mg for < 55 kg, 390 mg for 55-85 kg, and 520 mg for > 85 kg), followed by subcutaneous maintenance of 90 mg at week 8 and then every 8 weeks. Selective IL-23 inhibitors have also emerged as effective treatment options. Risankizumab, which blocks IL-23p19, is administered in UC as IV induction at 1200 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 8, followed by subcutaneous maintenance of 180 mg or 360 mg every 8 weeks. In CD, IV induction consists of 600 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 8, followed by subcutaneous maintenance of 180 mg or 360 mg every 8 weeks. Mirikizumab, another IL-23p19 inhibitor, is approved for UC and under investigation for CD. In UC, induction consists of IV 300 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 8, followed by subcutaneous maintenance of 200 mg every 4 weeks, while in CD, induction consists of IV 900 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 8, followed by subcutaneous maintenance of 300 mg every 4 weeks starting at week 12. Guselkumab, which also selectively targets IL-23, is administered for both UC and CD as IV induction at 200 mg at weeks 0, 4, and 8, or alternatively, subcutaneous induction of 400 mg every 4 weeks at weeks 0, 4, and 8. Subcutaneous maintenance begins at week 12 with 200 mg every 4 weeks or 100 mg every 8 weeks starting at week 16. These biologic therapies provide a gut-selective or targeted anti-cytokine approach, offering favorable safety profiles, particularly for patients at risk of infections associated with systemic immunosuppression. In addition to biologics, small-molecule therapies provide oral alternatives for patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Tofacitinib, a pan-JAK inhibitor, is approved for UC and administered as oral induction at 10 mg twice daily for 8 weeks, followed by maintenance dosing of 5 mg twice daily. Upadacitinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor, is approved for UC and for CD. In UC, induction consists of 45 mg once daily for 8 weeks, followed by maintenance of 15 mg or 30 mg once daily, while in CD, induction consists of 45 mg once daily for 12 weeks, followed by maintenance of 30 mg once daily. S1PR modulators, which regulate lymphocyte trafficking, are also used in UC. Ozanimod is administered as a titrated regimen over 7 days, starting at 0.23 mg on days 1-4, 0.46 mg on days 5-7, followed by maintenance at 0.92 mg once daily from day 8 onward. Similarly, etrasimod is administered as a titrated regimen over 2 weeks, starting at 1 mg on days 1-7, followed by 2 mg once daily from day 8 onward. These regimens represent the standard induction and maintenance dosing strategies for advanced therapies in UC and CD.

This section of the guideline outlines key recommendations for pre-advanced therapy safety screening, infection risk mitigation, and drug-specific monitoring protocols. The aim is to minimize adverse events, optimize therapy selection, and enhance long-term patient safety.

While there is no strict maximum dose in IBD, initiation should not exceed 1 mg/kg or 60 mg/day of prednisolone. Calcium and vitamin D (1500-2000 IU/day) supplementation should be given during steroid treatment. Abrupt withdrawal of ≤ 40 mg/day for up to three weeks is generally safe, but gradual tapering is necessary for higher doses or prolonged use, with reductions of 5-7.5 mg/day during chronic treatment[ 207 211  Statement 99:  Statement 100:  Safety considerations and monitoring with thiopurines and methotrexate: 212 213 199 214 215 217 218 219 220 224 225 226 227 229 170 229 230 232 233 170 234 235  Statement 101:  Statement 102:  Safety considerations and monitoring with anti-TNF therapies (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab): 236 237 219 238 239 240 241 242 243  Statement 103:  Statement 104:  Safety considerations and monitoring with anti-integrins (vedolizumab): 244 245 244 246 247 244 239  Statement 105:  Statement 106:  Safety considerations and monitoring with anti-IL-12/IL-23 and anti-IL-23 agents (ustekinumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab, guselkumab): 145 188 146 189 248 148 190 191 150 193 152 vs  Statement 107:  Safety considerations and monitoring with JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, upadacitinib): 242 249 155 156 197 250 250 251 252 253 254 234  Statement 108:  Statement 109:  Safety considerations and monitoring with S1PR modulators (ozanimod, etrasimod): 255 158 vs 256 CBC should be monitored periodically as ozanimod may cause a reversible significant decrease in lymphocyte counts often needing treatment cessation[ 257 9 258 257 259  Statement 110:  Statement 111:  Statement 112: POSITIONING AND SEQUENCING OF ADVANCED THERAPIES FOR IBD General guide to advanced therapy selection in IBD in the United Arab Emirates Selecting an advanced therapy for IBD is a complex, individualized process that begins with an assessment of disease nature and severity. Patients with mild-to-moderate UC may initially be managed with conventional treatments like 5-ASA and thiopurines. However, those with UC who fail to achieve remission on conventional therapies require escalation or those with CD who present with moderate-to-severe disease especially with high-risk features (as discussed in previous section of this guideline) warrant early aggressive treatment with biologics or small molecules to prevent complications and disease progression[ 88 Balancing efficacy, safety, and response time is critical in selecting an advanced therapy[ 260 vs 8 e.g. e.g. 261 vs vs 262 263 193 195 264 265 Therapy selection is particularly challenging in the United Arab Emirates, where healthcare insurance coverage is highly variable, and access to advanced therapies remains limited for many non-local residents who do not have comprehensive insurance. Given the high costs of biologics and small molecules, many patients must navigate co-payment systems or seek alternative options, including biosimilars, patient support programs, charities or surgical options. This financial barrier makes early, informed decision-making even more crucial, as therapy failure or multiple treatment switches can significantly increase costs and limit long-term treatment options. In this context, RWE and cost-effectiveness considerations play a critical role in guiding treatment decisions, ensuring that patients receive effective care within the constraints of the healthcare system. Selecting advanced therapies in CD This section of the guideline reviews the current clinical evidence for the positioning of therapies in advanced therapy-naive, exposed, and perianal CD populations, with a focus on comparative efficacy.  Positioning of therapies for advanced therapy naive CD: 263 vs vs vs vs vs vs 193 195 vs P < vs P =  Positioning of therapies for advanced therapy exposed CD: vs vs 197 vs vs 188 vs vs 191 vs vs 193 vs vs vs 195 Head-to-head clinical outcomes in advanced therapy exposed CD patients has been reported in three clinical trials. In the GALAXI 2 and 3 trials, among biologic-experienced patients, the rates of combined clinical remission and endoscopic response at week 48 were 40.8% with guselkumab 200 mg every 4 weeks and 37.3% with guselkumab 100 mg every 8 weeks, compared to 25.6% with ustekinumab[ 195 P < P = vs vs 266 vs P < vs P < vs Beyond RCTs, real-world data offer further insights.

JAK inhibitors, such as tofacitinib and upadacitinib, provide the fastest symptom relief, with improvements seen as early as the day 1 in UC and within a week in CD[ 279 280 281 282 260 Patient specific factors  Presence of extra-intestinal manifestations: 17 283 284 285  Age and comorbidities: 242 260 e.g. 239 241 e.g.  Family planning and pregnancy:  Patient preferences and adherence: Healthcare system considerations: Cost, biosimilars, and access Economic factors and healthcare system limitations often dictate treatment selection. Biosimilars for infliximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab have significantly improved affordability, making these agents more widely available. However, IL-23 inhibitors and JAK inhibitors remain costly, limiting access. The availability of specialized IBD centers, provider expertise, and drug familiarity also influences decision-making. Some therapies require extensive monitoring ( e.g.  Statement 113:  Statement 114:  Statement 115:  Statement 116: RESPONSE ASSESSMENT, TDM, AND OPTIMIZATION OF ADVANCED THERAPIES IN IBD Post-induction response assessment and the management of LOR are critical in optimizing long-term outcomes in IBD. This section addresses the assessment and management of inadequate post-induction response and secondary LOR across different biologic and small-molecule therapies, incorporating evidence-based recommendations to optimize treatment durability and patient outcomes. Post-induction response assessment and management Response assessment following induction is typically performed between week 10 and week 14, depending on the therapeutic agent, with decisions primarily based on clinical and biomarker response, and less frequently on endoscopic evaluation[ 61 207 286 287 288  Statement 117:  Statement 118:  Statement 119: Assessment and management of LOR during maintenance therapy Non-inflammatory causes can mimic LOR in IBD, leading to unnecessary treatment changes. Functional disorders like IBS and pelvic floor dysfunction are common, with studies estimating that nearly one-third of IBD patients in remission have IBS-like symptoms[ 289 21 22 290 Clostridioides difficile 199 Once true loss of LOR to an advanced therapy is confirmed, management follows a structured algorithm that includes dose optimization, immunomodulator combination, and therapy switching. Non-immune mediated pharmacokinetic failure, characterized by subtherapeutic drug levels without significant immunogenicity ( i.e. 291 200 292 295 e.g. 291 296 297 Dual advanced therapy, the concurrent use of two biologic agents or a biologic with a small molecule, is an emerging strategy for patients with highly refractory IBD who have failed multiple lines of therapy[ 298 299 300 301 While these initial results are promising, this strategy is considered off-label and requires careful consideration of safety. The 2022 meta-analysis reported a pooled rate of serious adverse events of 6.5%[ 299 208 302 303 Difficult-to-treat IBD has recently been defined through international consensus as IBD that persists despite optimal use of at least two advanced therapies with different mechanisms of action, recurrent post-operative CD after two bowel resections, chronic antibiotic-refractory pouchitis, complex perianal disease, or psychosocial comorbidities that interfere with care[ 304 305  Statement 120:  Statement 121:  Statement 122:  Statement 123:  Statement 124: Strategies for managing LOR to infliximab  Role of TDM with infliximab: 306 101 307 post hoc 308 309 310 311 312 313 136 273 314 Combination therapy with infliximab and an immunomodulator, such as azathioprine or methotrexate, has been shown to reduce immunogenicity and improve drug durability in IBD. The SONIC trial in CD and SUCCESS trial in UC demonstrated that combination therapy led to higher rates of clinical remission and mucosal healing than infliximab monotherapy, primarily by reducing the formation of anti-drug antibodies[ 93 131 post hoc 315 306 316  Role for dose optimization of infliximab: 317 317 318 319 In ASUC, dose intensification of infliximab is often used to improve outcomes in steroid-refractory cases. Standard induction (5 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, and 6) has modest efficacy, leading to exploration of accelerated induction regimens with higher doses or shortened intervals. A retrospective multicenter study and meta-analysis found no significant difference in colectomy rates between standard and accelerated infliximab induction, though an initial 10 mg/kg dose was associated with lower colectomy rates than 5 mg/kg-based regimens[ 320 321  Statement 125:  Statement 126:  Statement 127: Strategies for managing LOR to adalimumab  Role of TDM with adalimumab: 294 322 323 324 P = 325 313 The SERENE CD and SERENE UC trials explored adalimumab’s exposure-response relationship, highlighting its pharmacokinetic complexities[ 326 327  Role for dose optimization of adalimumab: 328 329 313 330  Statement 128:  Statement 129: Strategies for managing LOR to golimumab  Role of TDM with golimumab: 331 332 333  Role for dose optimization of golimumab: post-hoc 334 335 336 337  Statement 130:  Statement 131: Strategies for managing LOR to certolizumab  Role of TDM with certolizumab: post hoc 338 339 340 341  Role for dose optimization of certolizumab: 342 P = P = 343  Statement 132:  Statement 133: Strategies for managing LOR to vedolizumab  Role of TDM with vedolizumab: post hoc 344 post hoc 345 346 347  Role for dose optimization of vedolizumab: 183 143 183 348 349 350 vs vs n n 351 352 I 2 vs P < 353 111 Strategies for managing LOR to ustekinumab  Role of TDM with ustekinumab: 292 188 145 vs 103 354 355 356 357  Role for dose optimization of ustekinumab: 103 via 358 360 361 362 vs P = 363  Statement 134:  Statement 135:  Statement 136:  Statement 137: Strategies for managing LOR to risankizumab  Role of TDM with risankizumab: 191 364 364  Role for dose optimization of risankizumab: 365 366 Rescue therapy with risankizumab has been explored as potentially an effective strategy for patients experiencing inadequate response during maintenance therapy[ 367 368 369 370 371  Statement 138:  Statement 139: Strategies for managing LOR to mirikizumab  Role of TDM with mirikizumab: 150 193 372 post-hoc 373  Role for dose optimization of mirikizumab: 374 375  Statement 140:  Statement 141: Strategies for managing LOR to guselkumab  Role of TDM with guselkumab: 152  Role of dose optimization of guselkumab: vs vs vs 152 vs 195 P 196 vs P  Statement 142:  Statement 143: Strategies for managing LOR to JAK inhibitors-tofacitinib and upadacitinib  Role for TDM with JAK inhibitors: 376 377 378  Role for dose optimisation for tofacitinib: 155 379 380 381 382 383 383  Role for dose optimization for upadacitinib: 384 385 The U-ACTIVATE study assessed the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib retreatment in patients with UC who lost response following treatment withdrawal[ 386 vs vs 387 388 389 392  Statement 144:  Statement 145:  Statement 146: Strategies for managing LOR to S1PR modulators-ozanimod and etrasimod  Role of therapeutic drug monitoring: 393 394  Role of dose optimization: 395  Statement 147: Discontinuation of advanced therapies in sustained remission The decision to discontinue or de-escalate advanced therapy in patients who have achieved sustained, deep remission is a significant clinical consideration, balancing the desire to reduce treatment exposure against the risk of disease relapse. While most evidence pertains to anti-TNF agents, the principles and emerging data for other therapies are critical for shared decision-making.  Discontinuation of anti-TNF therapy: 396 397 vs 398 vs 399 400 Given the findings from the SPARE trial, thiopurine withdrawal can be considered in adult patients with CD who have been in steroid-free clinical remission for more than six months, provided they meet certain criteria. Ideally candidates should have sustained deep remission, including clinical, biochemical (normal CRP, fecal calprotectin), and endoscopic remission, and stable infliximab trough levels above 10 μg/mL with no detectable anti-drug antibodies. Additionally, HLA-DQA1*05-negative patients, who have a lower risk of anti-drug antibodies formation, may be better candidates for immunomodulator withdrawal. Regardless of the approach, close post-withdrawal monitoring with biomarker assessments (CRP, fecal calprotectin) and scheduled TDM is critical to identifying early signs of relapse or declining infliximab levels.

The risk of CRC in IBD is influenced by several factors, including disease duration, extent of colonic involvement, chronic inflammation, and the presence of dysplasia[ 501 502 503 503 34 500 504 The frequency of surveillance colonoscopy is guided by risk stratification based on several factors as defined in the ECCO and AGA guidelines[ 241 500 505 506 The management of dysplasia detected during surveillance colonoscopy is critical[ 507 34 508 509 Non-CRC surveillance in IBD Patients with IBD should undergo age-appropriate cancer screenings, including breast, prostate, and lung cancer, based on standard guidelines. Women with IBD should receive routine cervical cancer screening, with risk stratification for those on immunosuppressive therapy. Annual total body skin exams are recommended for patients on immunomodulators, anti-TNF agents, or small molecules, with lifelong monitoring for those previously exposed to thiopurines. At every colonoscopy, a thorough perianal and anal exam should be performed, particularly for individuals with perianal CD, HPV, HIV, or high-risk sexual behaviors.

The high cost of advanced therapies, including biologics and small molecules, poses a significant challenge, particularly for patients with limited insurance coverage or financial resources. In the United Arab Emirates, where a large expatriate population faces variable insurance coverage, disparities in access to these therapies contribute to delayed treatment, increased hospitalizations, and worse long-term outcomes[ 525 526 528 529 530 Statement 185 Biosimilars should be considered where available, given their comparable efficacy and safety to originator biologics, with lower associated costs facilitating broader access (evidence level: 1b; strength of recommendation: Strong; consensus agreement: 100%). Statement 186 Patient assistance programs should be expanded and promoted to help financially constrained patients access biologic and small-molecule therapies, with standardized application processes to improve accessibility (evidence level: 5; strength of recommendation: Strong; consensus agreement: 100%). Statement 187 Charitable organizations should be recognized as key partners in supporting patients with financial barriers to IBD treatment, with structured referral pathways for eligible individuals (evidence level: 5; strength of recommendation: Strong; consensus agreement: 100%). Statement 188 Healthcare providers should receive training on navigating insurance policies and financial assistance programs to facilitate access to advanced therapies for eligible patients (evidence level: 5; strength of recommendation: Strong; consensus agreement: 100%). CONCLUSION The second edition of the United Arab Emirates IBD consensus guidance represent a significant evolution from the inaugural 2020 edition, marking a substantial advancement in the national approach to IBD management. As IBD incidence continues its documented rise within the United Arab Emirates, affecting both Emirati nationals and the large expatriate population, this updated guidance offer a far more comprehensive, contemporary, and nuanced set of recommendations. The current update aligns United Arab Emirates clinical practice more closely with current international best practices while critically addressing the specific needs and challenges within the local healthcare system. These updates position the guidance to remain relevant and applicable over the next two years, as the next wave of investigational therapies - including TNF-like cytokine 1A inhibitors, microRNA-124 up-regulators, oral bi-specific molecules, and combination biologic strategies - moves through the pipeline. A central feature of this updated guidance is the dramatically expanded therapeutic armamentarium. Reflecting rapid advancements in IBD pharmacology, this edition incorporates detailed guidance on newer drug classes, including IL-23 inhibitors (risankizumab, mirikizumab, guselkumab), selective JAK-1 inhibitors (upadacitinib), and S1PR receptor modulators (ozanimod, etrasimod), alongside established therapies. This broader scope provides clinicians with a more complete toolkit to manage the diverse presentations of UC and CD. Crucially, the 2025 consensus guidance endorse a shift away from a rigid step-up approach towards more personalized and risk-stratified treatment strategies, particularly for CD. The emphasis on early, effective intervention in moderate-to-severe or high-risk CD phenotypes, supported by evidence from trials like PROFILE, aims to alter the natural history of the disease, prevent irreversible bowel damage, and improve long-term outcomes. This is complemented by a strong recommendation for adopting treat-to-target strategies, integrating objective markers - clinical scores, biomarkers (CRP, fecal calprotectin), endoscopy, and aspirational targets like histologic and transmural healing - to guide therapy adjustments and optimize disease control. The positioning and sequencing of these advanced therapies are now more clearly defined, informed by pivotal head-to-head trials and the growing body of RWE, offering clinicians clearer pathways for both advanced therapy naive and exposed patients. The consensus also refines recommendations on TDM, particularly for optimizing anti-TNF therapy by managing pharmacokinetic variability and immunogenicity, acknowledging its growing role in personalized medicine. Furthermore, emerging monitoring modalities like IUS are acknowledged within the guideline statements as potentially valuable non-invasive tools, though their routine adoption in the United Arab Emirates awaits broader implementation. Recognizing the unique healthcare context of the United Arab Emirates, this edition places necessary emphasis on addressing systemic challenges and enhancing access to care. While the high cost of advanced therapies remains a barrier globally, the guidance highlights practical solutions available locally, such as the use of biosimilars, patient assistance programs, and charitable support to improve affordability. Critically, the guidance also implicitly acknowledges other systemic gaps hindering optimal care delivery in the region. These include the current lack of formally recognized and certified roles for IBD clinical nurse specialists, the limited availability of comprehensive multidisciplinary teams (including dedicated IBD dieticians, pharmacists, and psychologists) outside of tertiary hospitals, and inconsistent referral pathways for complex IBD cases to specialist centers. Addressing these structural challenges will require nationally coordinated initiatives to build capacity and standardize care across the Emirates. In line with evolving global understanding, the consensus guidance advocate for the timely referral of patients with complex IBD presentations, such as that refractory to multiple lines of advanced therapy or those with severe perianal disease to specialized centers. This ensures that patients needing advanced diagnostics, multidisciplinary input, complex treatment algorithms (including dose intensification or combination therapies), and potential access to clinical trials receive appropriate care, thereby reducing morbidity. The strengths of the 2025 United Arab Emirates IBD consensus guidance lie in their comprehensive scope, rigorous Delphi consensus methodology, integration of the latest international evidence (from ECCO, AGA, BSG), and pragmatic focus on the United Arab Emirates healthcare environment. By encompassing the newest therapies, refining monitoring strategies, and acknowledging systemic challenges, these serve as a robust and practical resource for clinicians. Nevertheless, limitations remain. While evidence-based, the practical implementation of some recommendations, such as standardized TDM protocols outside tertiary centers, consistent referral pathways, and the development of integrated multidisciplinary care models, will require further development of infrastructure and expertise. Although IUS is included as an emerging tool, its widespread adoption in the United Arab Emirates is currently limited by factors such as the need for specialized training for gastroenterologists and clearer insurance reimbursement pathways, hindering its potential contribution to non-invasive monitoring. Furthermore, the consensus guidance continues to rely predominantly on international data due to the scarcity of large-scale, local United Arab Emirates - specific research on IBD epidemiology, treatment persistence, real-world comparative effectiveness, and the impact of the identified systemic gaps. Establishing a national IBD registry and fostering local research are crucial next steps to further tailor future guidelines. In conclusion, this second edition of the United Arab Emirates IBD consensus marks a transformative update, equipping clinicians with state-of-the-art, evidence-based strategies for diagnosing, monitoring, and treating IBD in the context of a rapidly evolving disease landscape in the United Arab Emirates. By embracing new therapies, promoting personalized and proactive management, acknowledging systemic barriers to care, and providing clear pathways for complex cases, the consensus guidance hopes to standardize and elevate the quality of IBD care across the Emirates, aligning national practice with global standards while remaining responsive to local realities.
