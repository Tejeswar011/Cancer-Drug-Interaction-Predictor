The mechanisms of ADC resistance can be summarized into four categories: antibody-mediated resistance, impaired drug trafficking, disrupted lysosomal function, and payload-related resistance. 15 PIK3CA 16 17 In current clinical practice, there is an urgent need to clarify the efficacy and safety of T-DM1 in patients resistant to pyrotinib and trastuzumab plus pertuzumab and to explore molecular markers that can predict efficacy to guide clinical practice to maximize the efficacy of T-DM1 and the quality of life of patients. The NJMU-BC02 study ( NCT06125834 Results Study population From October 2023 through March 2025, a total of 36 participants were enrolled at 4 academic hospitals in China (Fig. 1 1 1 1 Fig. 1 Flow chart of the NJMU-BC02 study Table 1 Clinicopathological features of the enrolled participants T-DM1 ( n Age, median, (range), years 57.5 (23~88) Female, n 36 (100) HER2 status (IHC), n 3+ 27 (75.0) 2+ (FISH amplified) 9 (25.0) ECOG PS, n 0 24 (66.7) 1 12 (33.3) Hormone receptor, n Positive 16 (44.4) Negative 19 (52.8) NE 1 (2.8) Prior treatment for mBC, n No 4 (11.1) Yes 32 (88.9) Metastatic sites, n Visceral 30 (83.3) Nonvisceral 5 (13.9) NE 1 (2.8) Prior lines of therapy in the metastatic setting, n 0 4 (11.1) 1 12 (33.3) 2 17 (47.2) ≥ 3 3 (8.4) Disease-free interval of trastuzumab treatment, n < 1 year 12 (33.3) ≥ 1 year 24 (66.7) Prior cancer therapy, n Trastuzumab 34 (94.4) Pertuzumab 25 (69.4) TKI 23 (63.9) ADC 1 (2.8) T-DM1 HER2 IHC FISH ECOG PS NE mBC TKI ADC Efficacy The efficacy of T-DM1 was analyzed in all participants.

Twenty-five of the 36 participants experienced treatment-related adverse events of any grade (Supplementary Table 2 Single-cell landscape of tumor samples Exploratory analyses were performed to investigate biomarkers associated with T-DM1 efficacy. Tumor samples from 8 participants before treatment and 2 participants with progressive disease after T-DM1 were available for single-cell RNA sequencing to identify potential biomarkers (Fig. 3a, b Fig. 3 Landscape of tumor samples from 10 participants via single-cell RNA sequencing. a b c d e f g a f f P a https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ After standard data processing and quality control procedures, 80,239 scRNA-seq profiles were classified (Fig. 3c, d 3c, e P P P 3f 3f 3g High cell cycle activity in cancer cells is indicative of T-DM1 resistance To determine the underlying mechanisms of T-DM1 resistance, 10 subgroups of epithelial cells were identified (Fig. 4a 1a 4b P P 1b 4c 4d 1c 4c 18 19 4c 4d 1c Fig. 4 Cell cycle activity of cancer cells can predict the efficacy of trastuzumab emtansine treatment in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. a b c d e GSE243375 f e b f b t f P The mRNA levels of HER2 and HER3 may be involved in resistance to HER2-directed therapies. 17 1d 1e To further validate the role of cell cycle activity in T-DM1 resistance, a neoadjuvant cohort 20 4e 3 4f 1f Activated CD8+ T cells are associated with increased T-DM1 sensitivity CD8+ T cells play crucial roles in the antitumor immune response.

However, the efficacy of T-DM1 for patients after failure of pyrotinib or other licensed TKIs and/or trastuzumab combined with pertuzumab is not very clear. In the TH3RESA study, 21 22 Dual anti-HER2 therapy has been widely used in adjuvant and advanced settings. For first-line treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, trastuzumab combined with pertuzumab or pyrotinib has been approved in China. Additionally, pyrotinib plus capecitabine has also been approved for second-line therapy after failure of trastuzumab. In the HER2CLIMB study, 23 24 9 11 HER2-positive breast cancer is still a heterogeneous disease, with intrinsically different subtypes of cancer cells. In our study, we identified 9 subtypes of cancer cells via scRNA-seq. CDK1+ cancer cells and TK1+ cancer cells, which have high levels of cell cycle activity, were abundant in resistant cases. MMP7+ cancer cells, enriched in genes associated with the humoral immune response, were abundant in sensitive cases. Preclinical studies 19 18 25 26 27 28 Several limitations still exist. First, genomic variations (e.g., PIK3CA 26 In summary, T-DM1 shows promising efficacy with a measurable safety profile in patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer after failure of pyrotinib and/or trastuzumab plus pertuzumab. Importantly, low cell cycle activity and an activated immune microenvironment can predict the efficacy of T-DM1. Future clinical trials are warranted to confirm our findings. Materials and methods Study design and participants This was a prospective single-arm, multicenter, phase Ⅱ trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT06125834 Procedures After enrollment, the participants received T-DM1 3.6 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously every three weeks. Tumor assessments were performed every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 12 weeks thereafter. A complete or partial response should be confirmed 4 weeks later. Treatment-related adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. Dose adjustment or discontinuation was defined according to the protocol until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, patient withdrawal or death. Outcomes The primary endpoint was the ORR according to RECIST 1.1, defined as the proportion of patients with the best complete or partial response. The secondary endpoints included PFS (time from the initiation of study treatment to disease progression or any-cause death), the disease control rate (DCR, proportion of patients with CR, PR or SD), the clinical benefit rate (CBR, proportion of patients with CR, PR, or SD ≥ 24 weeks), treatment-related adverse events, and potential biomarkers of T-DM1 resistance. Pathologic evaluation of tumor biopsies Tumor specimens obtained through percutaneous biopsy were collected and processed for pathological assessment. The samples were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, sectioned, and subsequently stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histological examination. Tissue dissociation and preparation Fresh tissue samples were stored in sCelLiveTM Tissue Preservation Solution (Singleron) on ice within 30 min after percutaneous biopsy. The tissues were subsequently washed three times with Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS), finely minced, and then subjected to enzymatic digestion via 3 mL of sCelLive™ Tissue Dissociation Solution (Singleron) with the Singleron PythoN™ Tissue Dissociation System at 37 °C for 15 min. The cell suspension was collected and passed through a 40-micron sterile strainer, and red blood cells were lysed by adding GEXSCOPE ® g Library preparation for scRNA-seq Single-cell suspensions at 2 × 10 5 ® ® 29 Single-cell data analysis and processing Raw sequencing reads were processed to derive gene expression profiles via CeleScope (version 1.5.2) (Singleron Biotechnologies) with standard parameters. Barcodes and UMIs were extracted and corrected from R1 reads, whereas R2 reads were trimmed of adapter sequences and poly A tails. Trimmed R2 reads were aligned to the GRCh38 (hg38) transcriptome via STAR (version 2.6.1b), and uniquely mapped reads were assigned to exons via FeatureCounts (version 2.0.1). Reads sharing the same cell barcode, UMI, and gene were aggregated to construct the gene expression matrix for downstream analysis. The Seurat package (version 5.0.1) in R was used to analyze the scRNA-seq data. Low-quality cells, including those with over 10% mitochondrial content, more than 8000 genes, or fewer than 200 genes, as well as doublets, were filtered out, resulting in 80,239 cells for subsequent analysis. Data normalization was performed on the basis of raw UMI counts per cell, and 2000 highly variable genes were identified via the FindVariableFeatures function. The ScaleData function was applied to scale these genes, followed by principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Harmony for batch effect correction. The FindNeighbors function calculates the shared nearest neighbor similarity in the batch-corrected cell-PC matrix, and the cell subpopulations are identified via the FindClusters function with a K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Visualization of single-cell data was achieved via the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm. Differentially expressed genes for the cell clusters were identified via the COSine similarity-based marker gene identification (COSG) function. 30 Cell type abundance comparisons We assessed differences in cell type abundance, including lineages and subclusters, via the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for pairwise comparisons and the Kruskal‒Wallis test for multiple group comparisons. P Evaluation of cellular functions via single-cell data GO and KEGG analyses were conducted via the clusterProfiler R package (version 4.8.3). The GSVA R package (version 1.48.3) was employed to conduct single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), which quantifies pathway activity at single-cell resolution by calculating enrichment scores for predefined gene signatures. The algorithm computes the relative expression levels of target genes against background gene sets within individual cells, incorporating normalization against control gene sets to account for technical variability. The enrichment analysis was based on gene sets from the MsigDB database ( http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/ Inference and analysis of cell‒cell communication The CellChat R package (version 2.1.2) was employed for the quantitative assessment of intercellular communication networks. 31 RNA-seq analysis Bulk RNA-seq data from HER2-positive breast cancer patients were obtained from the GEO database under accession number GSE243375 20 Statistical analysis Simon’s two-stage design was used in this study. The null hypothesis of ORR was 20%, and the alternative hypothesis of ORR was 40%. A sample size of 36 achieved 80.211% power to detect a difference (P1--P0) of 0.2000 via a one-sided exact test with a significance level (alpha) of 0.0250. Efficacy assessment was performed both in the intention-to-treat (ITT, at least one cycle of study treatment) and efficacy-evaluable (at least one posttreatment evaluation) populations. The Clopper‒Pearson method was applied to calculate estimates of the ORR, DCR, and CBR and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The median durations of PFS and OS were estimated via the Kaplan‒Meier method. For data from scRNA-seq and RNA-seq, continuous variables were characterized by the median and interquartile range. For these variables, we employed a two-tailed unpaired t P Supplementary information  Supplementary Materials Study Protocol Statistical Analysis Plan CONSORT Checklist Publisher’s note These authors contributed equally: Hong Pan, Ji Wang, Yue Sun, Fanfan Li, Chang Sun.
