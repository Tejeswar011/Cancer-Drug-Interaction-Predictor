Resistance has developed against drugs designed using this approach, leading to a decrease in their effectiveness. In addition, it is well‐documented in the literature that diseases with complex etiologies, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and cancer are influenced by multiple genetic and/or environmental factors. As a result, specificity paradigm is often insufficient for treating these diseases. Therefore, there is a need to develop drugs that interact with multiple targets simultaneously through different mechanisms. This review aims to provide an overview of the methods used in multitarget drug design, the reactions employed in the synthesis of these drugs, their applications, and recent research conducted in this field. This review highlights the rationale behind multitarget drug design as a promising approach to address diseases with complex etiologies. By combining pharmacophore features from different single‐target drugs, multitarget compounds can interact with multiple biological targets simultaneously. This strategy offers improved therapeutic outcomes, reduces the likelihood of resistance, and enhances synergistic or additive effects compared to traditional single‐target approaches. © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH cancer molecular docking multitargeted drugs neurodegenerative diseases synthesis methods Çukurova University TSA‐2022‐15050 TSA‐2021‐13814 FYL‐2023‐15939 TSA‐2023‐16116 TYL‐2024‐17047 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date September 25, 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:29.09.2025  Sadık Hüseyin Cemali Samet Poyraz Samet Belveren Senanur Taş Mehmet Ali Tamer Naciye Yaktubay Döndaş H.

[  1 ] [  2 ] The ‘one target‐one drug’ model has been the dominant strategy in drug discovery, based on the assumption that disease symptoms or progression can be mitigated by precisely activating or inhibiting a single biological target. [  2b ,  3 ] [  3 ,  4 ] [  5 ] Multitarget drugs offer several advantages, including a reduced risk of drug–drug interactions, broader efficacy in certain clinical settings, enhanced patient convenience, and decreased treatment complexity. [  6 ] Figure  1 [  7 ] Figure 1 Design and development of multitarget drugs. [This figure was created with BioRender.com ( https://www.biorender.com/ © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH In support of the growing interest in multitarget strategies, recent drug approval trends also reflect a shift toward polypharmacology. A review of pharmaceutical approvals by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and drugs marketed in Germany between 2023 and 2024 identified 18 out of 73 newly introduced drugs as aligning with the principles of polypharmacology. These include ten antitumor agents (Loncastuximab tesirine, Epcoritamab, Glofitamab, Elranatamab, and so on), five drugs for autoimmune/inflammatory diseases (Ritlecitinib Etrasimod Zilucoplan Elafibranor Sparsentan), one antidiabetic agent (Tirzepatide) with antiobesity effects, one modified corticosteroid (Vamorolone), and one drug for hand eczema (Delgocitinib). These agents exemplify the increasing adoption of multitarget or polypharmacological approaches in contemporary clinical pharmacotherapy. [  8 ] In the synthesis of multitarget drugs, reactions such as copper‐catalyzed azide‐alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), the Stille reaction, the Heck reaction, the Suzuki cross‐coupling reaction, the Sonogashira reaction, and the Diels–Alder reaction are commonly employed due to their high efficiency and versatility. [  4d ] The literature reviewed in this study encompasses research conducted between 2010 and 2024. A comprehensive literature search was performed using international databases, such as PubMed and Web of Science, employing keywords such as ‘multitarget drugs, Alzheimer, Parkinson, cancer, molecular docking, synthesis reactions’, and various combinations thereof. The screening process was completed in Dec. 2024. Previous reviews [  9 ] 2 Multitargeted Drug Definition Multitargeted drugs, which are skeletons that can interact with two or more molecular targets simultaneously, contain pharmacophore groups of two or more drugs with similar or different mechanisms‐of‐action in a single molecule. [  10 ] [  11 ] [  11 ,  12 ] 3 We Need Multitarget Drugs—but why? The ‘lock and key’ model proposed by Erlich over a century ago formed the basis for the ‘one target, one drug’ hypothesis. In recent decades, therapeutic drugs have been developed to selectively modulate a single target, aiming to minimize undesirable effects. [  13 ] [  13b ,  14 ] [  15 ] Multitarget drugs exemplify polypharmacology, offering the advantage of simultaneous modulation of multiple targets and pathways involved in disease progression. This ability reduces the likelihood of resistance development and enhances therapeutic outcomes by addressing disease heterogeneity. Incorporating polypharmacology into drug design challenges traditional paradigms and requires innovative approaches in both computational and synthetic chemistry. [  2 ] However, the multitarget drug development strategy presents a range of challenges and risks. [  16 ] [  17 ] [  2b ] [  4b ] Among these challenges, one of the primary concerns is drug resistance, which significantly hampers the treatment of conditions, such as cancer, epilepsy, malaria, and bacterial infections. [  18 ] [  19 ] [  20 ] [  21 ] [  22 ] [  23 ] [  18b ] [  24 ] As a result, single‐target pharmaceuticals have proven inadequate for addressing multigenic disorders, such as AD [  25 ] [  26 ] [  27 ] 4 Drug Repurposing Drug repurposing refers to the identification of additional therapeutic applications for drugs that are in the experimental stage, currently in use, discontinued, or rendered obsolete due to factors, such as drug resistance or adverse effects. [  28 ] The development and introduction of a new pharmaceutical agent through research and development (R&D) is a time‐consuming and financially demanding process. [  29 ] [  30 ] [  31 ] [  32 ] [  31 ,  33 ] Figure  2 Figure 2 Some repurposing marketed drugs. © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH Thalidomide, a glutamic acid derivative and glutethimide analog with the chemical name 2‐(2,6‐dioxo‐3‐piperidyl)isoindole‐1,3‐dione, [  34 ] [  35 ] [  36 ] [  37 ] [  38 ] [  33 ] [  37 ] [  39 ] Dimethyl fumarate, scientifically known as dimethyl (2 E Fumaria officinalis [  40 ] [  41 ] [  42 ] [  43 ] [  44 ] [  45 ] Minoxidil, chemically designated as 6‐(1‐piperidinyl)‐2,4‐pyrimidinediamine 3‐oxide, contains a piperidine moiety attached to a pyrimidine ring in its structure. It was introduced in the 1970s under the brand name Loniten for the treatment of hypertension. [  46 ] [  47 ] [  48 ] [  49 ] Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor that was synthesized by Pfizer in 1989. It facilitates the relaxation of smooth vascular muscles by inhibiting the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate. Although it was initially developed for the treatment of angina (chest pain) and pulmonary arterial hypertension, clinical phase studies also revealed its effectiveness in treating erectile dysfunction. Based on this new indication, it was launched in 1998 under the brand name Viagra, becoming a successful example of drug repurposing. [  50 ] Aspirin, whose active ingredient is acetylsalicylic acid, and which originates from the willow tree, was first introduced by Bayer in 1899. [  51 ] [  52 ] [  53 ] 5 Benefits of Multitarget Drugs Many diseases—including neurodegenerative disorders, mood disturbances, and cancer—exhibit complex pathophysiologies that cannot be effectively managed by drugs targeting a single molecular entity. [  54 ] The dysregulation of multiple signaling pathways and various physiological processes are recognized as a key contributor to neurodegeneration, [  55 ] [  56 ] [  57 ] However, polypharmacy, defined as the simultaneous use of multiple medications, increases the risk of drug–drug interactions. [  58 ] [  59 ] [  60 ] [  61 ] [  62 ] [  4c ] 6 Pharmacophore Groups The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines a pharmacophore as the ensemble of steric and electronic features necessary to ensure optimal intermolecular interactions with a specific biological target, thereby triggering or inhibiting a biological response. Alternatively, a pharmacophore may be understood as the common structural or functional elements present in a series of compounds that are essential for activating a particular biological target. [  63 ] [  64 ] [  65 ] [  66 ] [  67 ] [  68 ] [  69 ] [  70 ] [  71 ] [  72 ] [  73 ] [  74 ] Chromone is a heterocyclic compound chemically known as 4 H [  75 ] [  76 ] Liu et al. designed and synthesized a series of chromone‐2‐carboxamido‐alkylbenzylamine derivatives capable of interacting with multiple targets for the treatment of AD. The synthesized compound 1 50 50 +2 1–42 +2 1–42 [  77 ]  This research indicates that compounds with substituted chromone rings can serve as pharmacophore groups in multitarget drug development. Benzenesulfonamides exhibit a broad range of pharmacological activities, including antibacterial, anticancer, carbonic anhydrase (CA), and cholinesterase inhibitory effects, as demonstrated in several studies. [  71b ,  78 ] [  79 ] 2 + [  80 ] Ragab et al. designed and synthesized a series of compounds based on 4‐(5‐amino‐pyrazol‐1‐yl)benzenesulfonamide, demonstrating significant inhibition of cyclooxygenase‐2 (COX‐2), 5‐lipoxygenase (5‐LOX), and CA, thereby indicating their potential as effective anti‐inflammatory agents. Specifically, compounds with –Ph, hydroxyphenyl, and thiophenyl substituents, respectively, 2 50 3 50 4 50 [  81 ]  The indole ring, a flexible pharmacophore, exhibits diverse biological activities by interacting with multiple receptors. [  82 ] [  83 ] [  67b ] [  84 ] [  85 ] [  86 ] Nerella et al. designed and synthesized a series of multifunctional hybrid compounds by conjugation of indole and deoxyvaccinone pharmacophore groups. Compound 5 50 50 5 1‐42 50 1‐42 [  87 ]  The triazole heterocyclic ring represents a key pharmacophore in the development of multitarget drugs. Triazoles, also known as pyrroliazoles, are five‐membered unsaturated heterocyclic rings containing three nitrogen atoms. [  88 ] [  89 ] [  90 ] [  91 ] [  92 ] [  93 ] [  94 ] Hydroxy‐1,2,3‐triazole derivatives 6 7 [  95 ] [  96 ] [  97 ] 6a 6b 7 6b 50 6c 6d  Kaur et al. designed and synthesized a series of triazole‐based compounds as multitarget ligands for the treatment of AD. Compound 8 42 42 42 50 42 42 +2 +2 42 +2 42 8 [  98 ]  7 Methods used in Multitargeted Drug Design 7.1 Molecular Docking Molecular docking is a computational technique used to simulate interactions between a molecule and a target protein at atomic level. It helps determine the optimal conformation of a ligand within a protein's binding site and predicts the stability of ligand–protein complexes. This approach is crucial for identifying potential drug candidates and understanding ligand–receptor interactions. [  99 ] [  100 ] [  100 ,  101 ] Molecular docking plays a pivotal role in assessing the binding affinity of chemical compounds to their target receptors, evaluating drug selectivity, and predicting the potential interactions of multiple drugs with a single target. [  102 ] Ali et al. employed molecular docking to screen multitarget compounds and assess their protective effects against acetaminophen‐induced liver damage. Using a library of 40 compounds derived from Curcuma longa Cinnamomum seylanicum [  103 ] 7.2 SAR and QSAR SAR analysis is a modeling approach that explores both qualitative and quantitative correlations between chemical structures and their biological activities. [  104 ] [  105 ] Using multidimensional SAR analysis, Tassini et al. identified a series of compounds with phosphatidylinositol 4‐kinase IIIβ (PI4KIIIβ) inhibitory properties for the treatment of cystic fibrosis. These compounds were found to correct misfolded CFTR proteins carrying the Phe 508 deletion. Additionally, they exhibited synergistic activity with the class I corrector lumacaftor (VX‐809). Compound 9 50 [  106 ]  QSAR analysis seeks to establish statistically significant correlations between molecular structures and their biological activities through computational modeling. This approach enables researchers to predict the biological activity of novel compounds, determine key structural features required for activity, and optimize existing drug candidates. [  107 ] [  105 ] Speck‐Planche et al. applied QSAR modeling to analyze a diverse set of biologically active compounds and identify pharmacophore groups responsible for anticolorectal cancer activity. Compounds 10–12 Figure  3 [  108 ] Figure 3 Proposed molecules as potential anticolorectal cancer. © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH 7.3 Virtual Screening Virtual screening is an in silico technique used to identify potential bioactive molecules by assessing the predicted affinities and possible binding configurations of drug candidates, which are small molecules that may serve as drugs or pharmacophores of the lead compound when interacting with the target protein. [  109 ] [  110 ] [  110a ] Knox et al. employed a virtual screening strategy to identify two targeted compounds with inhibitory activity against heat shock protein 90 (HSP 90) and tubulin. By examining a structural database of ≈160,000 compounds, they identified compound 13 [  111 ]  Chaichit et al. conducted further research using the virtual screening technique to explore molecular interactions with cathepsin K, V‐ATPase, and αvβ3 integrin, which are targets of interest in osteoporosis. Their virtual screening of 108 herbal compounds revealed that rutin, sagittatoside A, icariin, and kaempferitrin exhibited significant binding activity against these targets. This suggests that these compounds may serve as pharmacological agents that influence multiple targets in the context of osteoporosis or within the framework of multitarget drug design ( Figure  4 [  112 ] Figure 4 Cathepsin K, V‐ATPase, and αvβ3 targets herbal compounds. © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH 7.4 Computer‐Aided Pattern Analysis (C@PA) C@PA is a data‐driven computational methodology specifically developed for multitarget drug discovery. Unlike traditional approaches, such as pharmacophore modeling, docking, or QSAR, CAPA does not rely on predefined pharmacophoric features. Instead, it identifies bioactive compounds based on the analysis of chemical patterns and biological activity profiles. This approach has demonstrated superior predictive power for multitarget activities and has been successfully applied in recent multitarget drug development studies. C@PA, also known as computer‐aided pattern scoring (C@PS), involves the extraction of multitarget fragments and subsequent multitarget fingerprints from compounds functionally evaluated against two or more targets, and the application of these fragments and fingerprints across chemical space to predict potential polypharmacological ligands. [  2b ,  113 ] Focusing on ATP‐binding cassette transporter (ABCA1), a challenging pharmacological target involved in malignant, metabolic, and neurodegenerative diseases, Stephan et al. developed a novel chemoinformatics workflow called C@PS to identify new ligands. Using a unique dataset containing critical information on ABCA1, they achieved a 95.5% accuracy rate in identifying compounds with high potency and structural diversity. These findings offer a valuable example not only for the deorphanization of ABCA1 but also for broader multitarget drug discovery efforts targeting pharmacologically orphan proteins. [  113c ] 8 Pharmacophore Combination Approach The integration of pharmacophores derived from selective compounds is a widely used approach in multitarget drug design. [  114 ] [  115 ] [  4d ] Figure  5 [  116 ] Figure 5 Linked, fused, and merged pharmacophores. [  4b,d ] © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH 8.1 Linked Pharmacophores MTDLs in this category are formed by linking molecular structures containing pharmacophore groups that interact with the target independently through distinct linkers, which are not part of the selective ligands. [  116 ] [  117 ] [  7b ] [  7b ,  116 ] [  116 ] Peperidou et al. developed a multitarget compound demonstrating LOX enzyme inhibition and analgesic properties by combining cinnamic acid and paracetamol pharmacophores through an ester group. [  118 ] 14 50 Figure  6 Figure 6 Molecular structure of cleavable MTDL obtained by binding paracetamol and cinnamic acid via the ester group. © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH Cao et al. designed and synthesized a multitarget molecule 15 Figure  7 [  119 ] Figure 7 Designed MTDL 15 © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH 8.2 Fused Pharmacophores MTDLs created by arranging pharmacophore groups in a configuration lack pharmacophore overlap and identifiable linker groups. [  120 ] Sterling et al. designed compound 16 Figure  8 50 50 50 [  121 ] Figure 8 MTDL 16 © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH Chen et al. designed and synthesized a series of compounds that inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatase‐2 (SHP2) and cyclin dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) by utilizing the fused pharmacophore strategy. Among the compounds, compound 17 Figure  9 50 [  122 ] Figure 9 MTDL 17 © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH 8.3 Merged Pharmacophores In merged pharmacophores, the pharmacophore groups are synthesized by identifying the relevant components of each receptor and employing the shared characteristics in the structure of lead ligands to develop MTDLs with a high degree of overlapping pharmacophore groups. These integrated pharmacophores are designed to achieve structures with enhanced physicochemical properties, reduced molecular weights, and simplified configurations. [  4d ] Xu et al. designed triazolopyridine derivatives as dual HDAC/JAK inhibitors by merging the pharmacophores of the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat and the JAK inhibitor filgotinib into a single molecule. Compound 18 Figure  10 50 [  123 ] Figure 10 MTDL 18 © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH Dilipkumar et al. synthesized 30 quinazolinone derivatives that are dual inhibitors of poly (ADP‐ribose) polymerase (PARP1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) by using the merged pharmacophore strategy. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their dual inhibitory effects on PARP1 and STAT3 through docking, MM‐GBSA, and molecular dynamics simulation studies. Compound 19 Figure  11 [  124 ] Figure 11 MTDL 19 © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH 9 Some Synthesis Methods of Multitargeted Drugs The following synthetic methods are frequently employed in the development of multitargeted drugs, not only for their efficiency and modularity but also for their ability to generate pharmacophore‐rich scaffolds with activity across different therapeutic areas. Below, each method is illustrated with selected examples that demonstrate the structural rationale behind their biological activity. 9.1 CuAAC Reaction The CuAAC ‘click’ reaction is widely utilized in medicinal chemistry for constructing 1,2,3‐triazole rings, which serve as stable, bioisosteric linkers with intrinsic pharmacological activity. It involves the reaction of azides with terminal alkynes in the presence of a copper catalyst to selectively yield 1,4‐disubstituted 1,2,3‐triazoles ( Scheme  1 [  125 ] [  4d ] Scheme 1 CuAAC reaction procedure. © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH Quinazoline–1,2,3‐triazole hybrids, synthesized via the CuAAC reaction, were developed as multiple inhibitors targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFR‐2), and Topo II. The triazole ring aligns the pharmacophores, facilitating binding to multiple targets. The compounds exhibited low micromolar cytotoxicity and high selectivity, with 20 50 50 50 20 20 [  126 ]  Costa et al. obtained a series of triazole compounds by conducting the CuAAC reaction between 2‐azidobenzaldehyde and alkynes. The binding affinities of these synthesized compounds for AD‐related targets, such as BACE, glycogen synthase kinase‐3β (GSK‐3β), and AChE enzymes, were assessed using molecular docking, and their antioxidant effects were also examined. The compound 21 3 [  127 ]  9.2 Suzuki Cross‐Coupling Reaction The Suzuki cross‐coupling reaction is a widely used method for forming carbon–carbon (C─C) bonds between organic electrophiles (R 1 2 2 Scheme  2 [  128 ] [  129 ] [  130 ] Scheme 2 Palladium catalyzed Suzuki cross‐coupling reaction. © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH Hou et al. developed a seven‐step reaction protocol to synthesize compound 22 22 [  131 ] Scheme 4 Sonogashira reaction procedure. © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH  Parveen et al. synthesized a series of tert H 23 23a 23b [  132 ]  9.3 Stille Reaction The Stille reaction is a palladium‐catalyzed cross‐coupling process that enables the formation of carbon–carbon (C─C) bonds between alkyl or aryl halides and organostannanes, such as alkenyl, aryl, or alkynyl tin compounds ( Scheme  3 [  133 ] [  134 ] Scheme 3 Stille reaction procedure. © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH Rasolofonjatovo et al. synthesized a series of compounds 24 [  135 ]  Kumar Dey et al. reported a versatile method using the Stille reaction for the total synthesis of ( S R O [  136 ] [  137 ]  9.4 Sonogashira Reaction The Sonogashira reaction is a cross‐coupling reaction that enables the coupling of terminal acetylenes and aryl or vinyl halides using palladium or other transition metal catalysts ( Scheme  4 2 [  138 ] Khatyr et al. synthesized multitarget ligands 25 [  139 ]  9.5 Heck Reaction The Heck reaction facilitates the formation of substituted alkenes through the interaction of an activated alkene and an unsaturated halide, in the presence of a palladium catalyst and a base ( Scheme  5 [  140 ] Scheme 5 Heck reaction procedure. © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH Synthetic indole derivatives 26 [  89 –  91 ]  9.6 Diels–Alder Reaction The Diels–Alder reaction ( Scheme  6 [  141 ] 27 f [  142 ] Scheme 6 Diels–Alder reaction procedure. © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH  9.7 Biginelli Reaction The Biginelli reaction is a cyclocondensation reaction in which β‐keto ester, an aromatic aldehyde, and thiourea or urea react in one‐pot under acidic conditions to form 3,4‐dihydropyrimidin‐2(1 H 28 Scheme  7 [  143 ] H [  144 ] [  145 ] [  146 ] [  147 ] [  148 ] [  149 ] Scheme 7 Biginelli reaction procedure for compound 28. © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH Malek et al. designed and synthesized a series of compounds 29 29a 50 50 29b 50 50 29c 50 50 29a– c [  150 ]  10 Where Multitarget Medications are Most Effective? Neurodegenerative diseases encompass a broad range of neurological disorders, all of which are characterized by the progressive degeneration of neurons in either the central or peripheral nervous system. [  151 ] [  152 ] [  153 ] [  154 ] [  155 ] Pharmaceuticals approved by the EMA and FDA for treating certain neurodegenerative disorders typically target a singular pathological mechanism, providing symptomatic relief ( Figure  12 [  68 ] Figure 12 Some uses of multitargeted durgs. https://www.biorender.com/ © 2025 WILEY‐VCH GmbH Importantly, the clinical adoption of multitarget strategies is gaining momentum. In Germany, ≈20% of newly approved drugs are classified as multitarget therapies, either as fixed‐dose combinations or as agents with well‐defined polypharmacological profiles. [  8 ] 10.1 AD AD, first identified by Alois Alzheimer in 1906, is a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by a decline in cognitive function, memory, and the ability to perform daily activities. [  156 ] [  157 ] [  158 ] [  159 ] Numerous studies have explored the mechanisms and etiology of AD, uncovering multiple factors that contribute to its development. [  25 ] [  160 ] [  161 ] [  162 ] A series of compounds were synthesized by Bolea et al. by linking the benzylpiperidine moiety of the AChE inhibitor donepezil with the indolyl propargylamino moiety of the MAO inhibitor N H N 50 50 50 50 30 [  163 ]  Simoni et al. synthesized a series of multitarget molecules incorporating galantamine and memantine, both FDA‐approved drugs used in AD treatment.

Compound 37 50 37 [  98 ]  Frang et al. modified the ketone carbonyl group of donepezil to create hybrid compounds combined with nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs. Compound 38 50 50 38 [  170 ]  Zhang et al. designed and synthesized, eighteen new bakuchiol derivatives as multitargeted anti‐Alzheimer's drugs. Most of the compounds exhibited AChE and BuChE activity in varying degrees, among them, compound 39 40 50 50 39 40 [  171 ]  Ceyhan et al. prepared indolyl imine derivatives, as multitarget agents via Schiff base reaction, and investigated their in vitro antidiabetic activities, anticholinesterase potency, and antioxidant properties. The anticholinesterase potency of the compounds was investigated toward the AChE and BuChE enzymes.

The degeneration of dopaminergic neurons leads to symptoms including uncontrollable resting tremors, bradykinesia, and postural instability in patients. Furthermore, various neurotransmitter systems contribute to Parkinson's disease, resulting in the degeneration of cholinergic, serotonergic, and noradrenergic neurons, which manifests as cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, and depression. [  179 ] Parkinson's disease, characterized by its intricate pathology, arises from a multitude of molecular processes and pathways, including the ubiquitin‐proteasomal system, the autophagy‐lysosomal pathway, the aberrant aggregation of α‐synuclein, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress. [  180 ] [  181 ] [  182 ] [  183 ] Sashidhara et al. synthesized a series of 3‐arylcoumarin‐tetracyclic tacrine derivatives 49 49a 49b [  184 ]  Hagenow et al. designed the compounds that can interact with A1R/A2AR and histamine H3 receptor (H3R) by overlapping the piperidino‐/pyrrolidino phenyl H3R pharmacophore with the adenosine antagonist arylindenopyrimidine pharmacophore group, taking advantage of the ‘caffeine‐like effects’ of adenosine A1/A2A receptor (A1R/A2AR) antagonists along with the arousal‐promoting properties of histamine H3R antagonists.

Compound 60 50 50 60 60 60 [  203 ]  Tilekar et al. designed and synthesized a series of compounds 61 61a 50 50 61a 61b 61b [  204 ]  Wang et al. designed and synthesized compound 62 50 50 62 [  205 ]  Theodore et al. designed and synthesized a series of new quinoxalinone‐based pyrazole derivatives 63 63a 63b 63a 50 63b 50 63b [  206 ]  Zhang et al. designed 76 HDAC and receptor tyrosine kinase as multitarget angiogenesis inhibitors 64 50 64a 64b −1 [  207 ]  El Hamaky et al. designed and synthesized quinazoline‐1,2,3‐triazole hybrids 65 65a–c 65a 2 50 50 50 50 65b 3 50 50 50 50 65c 50 50 50 50 [  126 ]  Allawi et al. synthesized indole‐6‐carboxylic acid derivatives to target EGFR and VEGFR‐2 in cancers. Among the compounds, compound 66 2 67 3 66 67 [  208 ]  10.5 Malaria Malaria is an illness caused by Plasmodium parasites, which are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Four species of Plasmodium within the Plasmodiidae family— Plasmodium malariae Plasmodium falciparum Plasmodium ovale Plasmodium vivax [  209 ] Many currently available or investigational antimalarial drugs target a single mechanism within the Plasmodium infection cycle. [  210 ] [  211 ] [  212 ] [  213 ] Cysteine protease falcipain‐2 (FP‐2) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) are two enzymes that play important roles in the life cycle of the Plasmodium parasite that causes malaria. Huang et al. designed and synthesized a series of compounds with FP‐2 and DHFR inhibitory properties based on the lead compound 68 50 50 69 50 50 68 [  214 ]  Rawat et al. investigated the inhibitory properties of compounds 70 71 P. falciparum 70 71 70 [  215 ]  Yang et al. conducted a structure‐based drug design study focusing on the mitochondrial respiratory chain of P. falciparum 72 P. falciparum 72 50 −1 [  216 ]  10.6 Leishmaniasis Disease Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by Leishmania [  217 ] [  218 ] [  219 ] Mitochondrial iron superoxide dismutase A (FeSODA) and trypanothione reductase (TR) are two enzymes that play crucial roles in the antioxidant defense system of Leishmania donovani. Bora et al. identified compounds 73 50 74 50 [  220 ]  10.7 Coronavirus Disease 19 (Covid‐19) COVID‐19 is a highly contagious and pathogenic viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). The disease has led to a considerable number of fatalities worldwide and has escalated into a global pandemic. [  221 ] [  222 ] RNA viruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2, possess a high genetic variability, enabling them to accumulate genomic mutations. Most contemporary antivirals are designed as single‐target agents, specifically engineered to inhibit enzymes involved in viral interaction, invasion, or replication. However, mutations in these drug targets can reduce the efficacy of existing antiviral therapies. Consequently, there is an urgent need for the development and implementation of drug‐like compounds or approved pharmaceuticals that can modulate multiple targets within SARS‐CoV‐2. [  223 ] Chauhan et al. synthesized a series of indolealkylamine derivatives 75 75a 75b 75b [  224 ]  Jeon et al. investigated 48 FDA‐approved drugs against SARS‐CoV‐2. 24 Promising antiviral drug candidates were found against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; however, certain candidates exhibited minimal inhibitory concentrations, with the FDA‐approved medicines niclosamide and ciclesonide standing out in certain aspects. Niclosamide, an anthelminthic drug, exhibited very potent antiviral activity against SARSCoV‐2 with IC 50 50 [  225 ]  Ren et al. designed multitargeted antiviral drugs with the aim of discovering highly potent SARS‐CoV‐2 inhibitors. The design strategy consists of simultaneously acting on the host ribosome, viral RNA as well as RNA‐dependent RNA polymerases, and nucleocapsid protein of the virus, to impair viral translation, frameshifting, replication, and assembly. For this purpose, three alkaloids, lycorine, emetine, and cephaeline, were selected to potent inhibitors of SARS‐CoV‐2. Lycorine, emetine, and cephaeline alkaloids may inhibit viral protein synthesis. Lycorine, emetine, and cephaeline are alkaloid analogs with structural similarities; however, cephaeline may be better tolerated by patients than emetine, demonstrating comparable efficacy against ZIKV and EBOV infections through interaction with the same drug targets, including the ribosome. [  226 ]  Mun et al. reported the multitarget interaction of coumarins against COVID‐19 using molecular docking analysis. The researchers conducted a multitargeted molecular docking study involving the coumarin drugs phenprocoumon, hymecromone, and psoralen. Researchers revealed that the modified coumarin derivatives phenprocoumon, hymecromone, and psoralen possess better binding efficacy toward at least three targets out of four targets studied when compared to their parent compounds. The results for these compounds indicate lipophilic, high gastrointestinal absorbable, and blood–brain barrier permeability of the compounds studied. [  227 ]  11 Conclusions Drugs used in therapy nowadays are designed to interact with a single, highly selective biological target while minimizing adverse effects. However, it is now well established that the progression of complex diseases, such as cancer and neurological disorders, involves multiple mechanisms. This realization has highlighted the limitations of highly selective single‐target drugs in effectively treating such conditions. To address these challenges, pharmacological agents are increasingly administered in combination rather than targeting a single biological entity. Despite this approach, drug–drug interactions and increased costs have hindered the achievement of optimal therapeutic outcomes. In response, research has focused on developing drugs capable of modulating multiple biological targets within a disease. Studies indicate that targeting multiple pathways can prevent the progression of complex diseases, including Parkinson's disease, AD, and cancer. Moreover, the use of single multitarget drugs has been reported to mitigate the risk of drug–drug interactions, reduce economic burdens, and minimize undesirable biological effects on patients. Multitarget drugs hold significant potential for treating complex and multifactorial diseases, as well as drug‐resistant conditions. Research groups employing innovative methodologies, such as network analysis, to identify key targets involved in disease pathophysiology and resistance mechanisms anticipate that multitarget drugs will offer improved safety and efficacy compared to single‐target therapies. The core structure of these drugs often consists of heterocyclic scaffolds, which are known for their potent activity against specific targets. However, achieving a balance between desired therapeutic effects and enhanced bioavailability remains a major challenge in multitarget drug design. While increasing the likelihood of success in early‐stage drug development remains a critical goal, and multitargeted drugs hold great promise, significant obstacles must still be overcome on the path to their clinical application. In conclusion, embracing the principles of polypharmacology is essential to advance the development of effective multitarget drugs for complex diseases. Polypharmacological agents provide a promising strategy to overcome the limitations of highly selective single‐target drugs, including drug resistance and insufficient efficacy. Future research focusing on the integration of polypharmacological principles with novel synthetic methodologies and computational tools will likely accelerate the discovery of next‐generation therapeutics.
