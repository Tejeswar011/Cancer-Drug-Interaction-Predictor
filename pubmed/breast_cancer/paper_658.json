Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advancements, HCC remains poorly responsive to treatment, with a poor prognosis. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving HCC is crucial for developing effective therapies. Emerging evidence indicates that dysregulated fatty acid metabolism contributes to HCC. Acyl-CoA medium-chain synthetase 5 (ACSM5), involved in fatty acid metabolism, is down-regulated in HCC; however, its role is not well understood. This study was used to analyze ACSM5 expression in HCC patient samples and cell lines. The newly established ACSM5-overexpressing HCC cell lines, Huh7-ACSM5 and Hepa1-6–ACSM5, were used to investigate the effects and regulatory mechanisms of ACSM5. The results showed that ACSM5 was significantly down-regulated in HCC tumor tissues compared with non-tumor tissues. ACSM5 expression was regulated by DNA methylation, with a DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) inhibitor effectively increasing ACSM5 expression and reducing promoter region methylation. Overexpression of ACSM5 in Huh7 cells reduced fatty acid accumulation, decreased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro TGFB FGF12 Graphical abstract pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
