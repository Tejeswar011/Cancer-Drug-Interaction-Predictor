Both helicases are overexpressed in glioblastoma (GBM), a lethal primary brain tumour, characterised by resistance to radio- and chemotherapy. BLM-depleted glioma cells exhibit senescence-associated or polypoid phenotype when exposed to temozolomide (TMZ) and olaparib (OLA), a PARP inhibitor. This study aims to investigate how RECQL4 depletion influences the response of malignant gliomas to chemotherapeutics. Methods We investigated the effect of RECQL4 depletion in glioma cells on cell growth, apoptosis, senescence and polyploidy in the response to combined TMZ and OLA treatment. We compared transcriptomes of RECQL4- and BLM-depleted LN18 and LN229 glioma cells. Drug-induced cytotoxicity, senescence-associated phenotypes, cell cycle alterations, and polyploidy were assessed using the MTT metabolic assay, β-galactosidase activity assay, and propidium iodide staining. Results RECQL4 depletion modestly affected basal glioma cell viability and proliferation, similarly to knock out of the BLM protein. Deletion of RECQL4 in glioma cells (RQ4 KO) induced profound transcriptomic alterations, dissimilar to BLM depletion. RECQL4-depleted glioma cells treated with TMZ and OLA exhibited reduced viability and increased levels of apoptosis markers. The treatment induced cell cycle arrest, however, RQ4 KO cells did not show signs of senescence phenotype or polyploidisation, when compared to BLM KO glioma cells. Interestingly, both RQ4 KO and BLM KO cells were more resistant to WP744, a doxorubicin derivative, when compared to WT LN229 glioma cells. Conclusion Our results highlight the distinct roles of RecQ helicases in a response to chemotherapeutics and support a rationale for targeting RECQL4 as a therapeutic strategy in glioblastoma.

Comparison of the transcriptional profiles of RECQL4- and BLM-depleted cells revealed significant differences in genes involved in cell cycle regulation and receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways. RECQL4 depletion abolished the cytotoxic effect of the combined TMZ and OLA treatment in LN18 and LN229 cells. However, in contrast to BLM KO cells, RECQL4-deficient cells did not exhibit polyploidisation or features of cellular senescence. Moreover, the cytotoxic response of RECQL4 KO glioma cells to TMZ and OLA remained comparable to that of control cells. In contrast, both RECQL4 KO and BLM KO LN229 cells showed increased resistance to WP744, a doxorubicin derivative that induces apoptosis. These findings underscore the critical role of RecQ helicases in malignant glioma biology and reveal functional divergence between RECQL4 and BLM in the context of therapeutic response. Materials and methods Cell cultures and treatments LN18 and LN229 glioma cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in DMEM medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium, Thermo Fisher Scientific). LN18 and LN229 RECQL4 and BLM knockout cells (LN18 RQ4 KO, LN229 RQ4 KO; LN18 BLM KO, LN229 BLM KO) were generated using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and characterised as described [ 14 15 2 Cells were treated with 500 µM temozolomide (TMZ, Sigma-Aldrich, vehicle: DMSO) alone or in combination with 1 µM olaparib (OLA, MedChemExpress, vehicle: DMSO). WP744, a doxorubicin derivative and topoisomerase II inhibitor, was synthesized and kindly provided by Dr. Waldemar Priebe [ 16 2 RNA isolation, library preparation, sequencing and bioinformatic analysis RNAseq data were collected and analysed as previously described [ 14 15 Quality and integrity of RNA was assessed with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using a RNA 6000 NanoKit (Agilent Biotechnologies). PolyA enriched RNA libraries were prepared using the KAPA Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kit (Kapa Biosystems). Transcriptomic data were analysed as follows: fastq files were aligned to hg38 human reference genome with STAR program [ 17 18 19 20 Cell viability and proliferation Cells were seeded at a density of 4-5 × 10 3 3 Western blot analysis The total protein extracts collected as described [ 21 PLUS Cell cycle and cellular granularity analyses For cell cycle and cellular granularity analysis, cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10 5 6 F-actin staining with Rhodamine phalloidin Cells were seeded onto glass coverslip at a density of 3 × 10 4 Quantification of senescence-associated β-galactosidase-positive cells The activity of senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) was detected, as described [ 15 4 2 Statistical analysis All biological experiments were performed on independent 3–4 cell passages. Results are expressed as means ± standard deviation (SD). P values were calculated using chi-square test, two-tailed t-test, one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by appropriate post-hoc test and ANOVA contrast. Most analyses have been done using GraphPad Prism v6 (GraphPad Software). Moreover, we calculated the odds ratio (OR), and effect size (Hedge’s ‘g’) between the groups. A commonly used interpretation for effect size is as follow: small (0.2), medium (0.5) and large (0.8), however these values are arbitrary and should not be considered rigidly [ 22 23 Results RECQL4 or BLM depletion in glioma cell lines altered marginally cell viability and cell proliferation We analysed the levels of RECQL4 and BLM proteins in LN18 and LN229 glioma cells depleted of respective proteins. Development of those cell lines has been previously reported and validated [ 14 15 1 1 1  Fig. 1 RECQL4 or BLM depletion in glioma cells altered marginally cell viability and cell proliferation.

The combined, TMZ and OLA, treatment resulted in decreased viability in LN18 and LN229 cells, irrespectively of the RECQL4 status. Moreover, there was no differences between treated RQ4 WT (black bars) and KO (orange bars) LN229 cells (g = 0.3), whereas RQ4 KO (violet bars) LN18 cells displayed a resistance to the combined treatment when compared to RQ4 WT (grey bars) cells (g = 6.6) (Fig. 3 3 3 3  Fig. 3 RECQL4 deficiency in glioma cells does not sensitize glioma cells to TMZ and OLA treatment.

A n p B Discussion RecQ helicases participate in multiple DNA-dependent processes essential for genome replication, repair, recombination and transcription. While some functions are overlapping between RecQ family members, each of RecQ helicase also exhibits distinct, non-redundant roles [ 2 3 7 27 28 8 29 30 Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct gene expression patterns between RQ4 and BLM KO glioma cells, particularly in cell cycle–related transcripts, highlighting functional differences between these two RecQ helicases. RQ4 KO cells showed pronounced dysregulation of genes involved in mitotic progression and checkpoint control, consistent with its role in DNA replication and replication fork stability [ 31 32 12 13 33 RECQL4 14 34 Our previous study demonstrated that BLM knockout in LN18 and LN229 cells yielded cells resistant to the combined TMZ + OLA treatment, leading to polyploidy in LN18 cells and cellular senescence in LN229 cells [ 15 16 25 26 The presented findings emphasise the important role of RecQ helicases in malignant glioma progression and functional differences between these helicases in responses to therapy. The results show the resistance of RECQL4 or BLM depleted cells to specific treatments calling for consideration of patient characteristics for mutations in genes coding for various RecQL helicases.
