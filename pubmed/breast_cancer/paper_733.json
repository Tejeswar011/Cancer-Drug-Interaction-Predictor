To overcome the on-target, off-tumor toxicities that result from the expression of even low levels of tumor-associated antigens in healthy tissues, we sought to identify a TCE target with highly tumor-restricted expression patterns. Here, we characterize cancer-testes antigen Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma (PRAME) as a highly selective tumor antigen and identify a proteasomal degradation peptide PRAME 425–433 425 425 425 425 425 425 KEYWORDS PRAME TCR-mimic (TCRm) antibody T cell engager solid tumor Cancer testes antigen pMHC complex immunotherapy diabody Gilead Sciences, Inc This work was supported by Gilead Sciences, Inc. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction T cell engagers (TCEs) are bispecific antibodies that induce T cell-mediated tumor cell killing through simultaneous engagement of a tumor antigen on cancer cells and the CD3 subunit of the T cell receptor (TCR) on T cells. TCEs for the treatment of hematological cancers have shown immense clinical benefit and complete responses, demonstrating the transformative promise of this therapeutic modality. 1 2 Cancer testis antigens (CTAs) are a category of over 200 proteins whose expression is restricted to the testes and placenta, but which become aberrantly expressed in cancers as a result of dysregulated epigenetic and transcriptional processes in malignant cells. 3 4 3 3 Most CTAs are intracellularly expressed and are therefore inaccessible as surface antigens to TCEs except as self-peptides presented on the cell surface in the context of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Peptide-MHC (pMHC) complexes are traditionally recognized by TCRs on T cells and can drive an immune response when an immunogenic peptide is presented and recognized by T cell expressing a cognate TCR. This mechanism of pMHC recognition by T cells has been exploited to develop cancer therapies through CTA peptide-based vaccination approaches that can elicit antitumor humoral responses, or through chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) engineered to express TCRs (TCR-T cells) that specifically recognize CTA peptides. 5 6 Tebentafusp (KIMMTRAK®), a recombinantly expressed and affinity-matured gp100-targeted TCR fused to an anti-CD3 binding domain (ImmTAC), has been approved for the treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma and represents the first in a new class of off-the-shelf biologic TCE therapies targeting CTAs. 7 8 8–12 13–18 Here, we describe the characterization of PRAME as a prevalent, highly cancer-selective solid tumor target and the discovery of TCRm antibodies that recognize PRAME 425 425 425 230 N 425 19–21 22 23 425 24 425 Results Characterization of PRAME expression in solid tumors and normal tissues We performed a bioinformatic analysis of the RNA transcript abundance of six well-described CTAs (PRAME, NY-ESO, ADP, KK-LC-1, MAGE-A4, MAGE-A10) across breast, lung, head and neck, and hematological indications. Among these, only PRAME showed consistently high expression in all indications evaluated and was the most abundant CTA in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC), and breast cancer (BRCA) with little to no expression in normal tissues ( Figure 1(A) 25–28 Figure 1(B) Figure 1(C) Figure 1(D) Figure 1.

We, therefore, anticipated that the majority of antibodies discovered would likely bind primarily to MHC and would not be peptide selective. To maximize sequence diversity and increase the hit rate for peptide selective antibodies, a variety of species, including Lewis rats, wild-type C57BL/6 mice, wild-type BALB/c mice, Trianni humanized mice, and Alloy humanized mice were immunized with purified recombinant complexes of human HLA-A *02:01 MHC and PRAME 425 425 425 230 230 425 To evaluate the specificity and potency of each Fab in a cellular context, we next carried out multiplexed on- and off-target binding assays using the T2 lymphoblast cell line. T2 cells express HLA-A but are deficient in antigen processing and presentation, which facilitates exclusive presentation of exogenous peptides of interest. 20 21 425 230 Figure 2 Figure 2(B) 425 230 Figure 2(C) 425 230 Figure 2(D) Figure 2.

Alanine scan of Fabs binding to PRAME 425 425 https://BioRender.com/loxldiz 425 425 While we expected the alanine scan assay to enrich for selective binders, we anticipated that not all antibodies classified as having a TCR-like binding geometry in our assay would harbor the highly selective properties we sought in a potential TCE targeting arm. Indeed, literature suggests that even selective binders or binders with a “TCR-like” binding geometry may demonstrate off-target reactivity when formatted as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. 22 425 35 Figure 4(A) 425 425 Figure 4(B–E) Table 1 Figure 4(F–G) Table 1 Figure 4.

In 2013, a clinical trial involving a CAR-T directed against the EVDPIGHLY peptide of the CTA MAGE-A3 was terminated as a result of fatalities in two patients due to off-target activity against cardiac tissue. 19 39 40 425 N 22 34 41 N The optimal potency of a TCE is dependent on multiple additional factors, including target epitope, the affinity and format of the targeting arm(s), and molecule valency. 35 42 43 44 425 data not shown Structural characterization of the complex formed between HU-38 and its target pMHC confirmed an optimal binding interaction localized to amino acids Q4–G8 in the center of the PRAME 425 45–47 48 425 In summary, we demonstrate that PRAME is highly cancer-selective because it is expressed in many liquid and solid tumors with expression in normal tissues limited to only non-essential organs. Due to the intracellular expression of PRAME, we further quantified the surface expression density of several PRAME-derived MHC peptides and chose the PRAME 425 425 49 50 Materials and methods Gene expression analysis The RNASeq raw counts of TCGA tumor and GTEx healthy normal tissues were extracted using recount R package. 51 52 IHC staining Human formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues were acquired from commercial vendors in indications of high unmet need. Human FFPE normal tissue TMAs (catalog # 69574031–3139, catalog# 69574031–3140) were obtained from TriStar Technology group. IHC staining for PRAME (Cell signaling Technology, catalog# 56426) was performed on the Discovery Ultra autostainer (Ventana Medical Systems, Roche Tissue Diagnostics) using the Discovery ChromoMap DAB kit (Roche Tissue Diagnostics, catalog# 760–159). Five um tissue sections were incubated with 0.5 ug/ml of PRAME antibody for 40 minutes at room temperature, then incubated with Discovery anti-Rabbit HQ (Roche Tissue Diagnostics, catalog# 760–4815), and discovery anti-HQ HRP (Roche Tissue Diagnostics, catalog# 760–4820) for 32 minutes each, followed by detection with the Discovery ChromoMap DAB kit. Slides were then counterstained with Hematoxylin (Roche Tissue Diagnostic, catalog# 790–2208) for 4 minutes and permanently mounted with Dako Mounting Medium (Agilent Technologies, CS70330–2) on an automated Dako coverslipper (Agilent Technologies, CR10030). IHC staining for HLA-A (Abcam, catalog# ab52922) were conducted on the Leica Bond RX autostainer (Leica Biosystem) using the Bond Polymer Refine Detection kit (Leica Biosystems, catalog# DS9800). The tissue sections were incubated with 0.075 ug/ml of HLA-A antibody for 15 minutes at room temperature. Whole slide Images were acquired using the Aperio AT2 slide scanner (Leica Biosystems). Scoring for staining of tumor tissue sections was performed by a pathologist. Expression data is shown from translational cohorts with >25% tumor cells expressing PRAME including non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung squamous cell carcinoma, TNBC, and HNSCC. Data is not shown from indications with <25% tumor cells expressing PRAME, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, and colorectal cancer. Quantitative mass spectrometry and pMHC antigen density determination Approximately 200 million cells from each cell line were grown according to ATCC specifications, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested by scraping from the plate surface, pelleted, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were transferred to MS Bioworks (Ann Arbor, MI) for MHC peptide quantification. Cell pellets were thawed on ice and resulting cell lysates were clarified via centrifugation, filtered, and immunoprecipitated with a pan-HLA antibody, W6/32. Peptides were eluted from the immunoprecipitated MHC and PRAME peptides were evaluated by mass spectrometry. For quantitative mass spectrometry, stable-isotope labeled peptide standard controls corresponding to PRAME 100 300 425 142 371 394 157 Recombinant peptide HLA-A *02:01 MHC production MHC class I heavy chain and hβ 2 53 E. coli (DE3) g 2 To fold the heavy chain-hβ 2 2 g MHC/Fab complex generation MHC complex was mixed with individual Fabs in a 1:1.2 ratio and injected into a Superdex-200 16 60 column equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 8, 100 mM NaCl. The UV profile of the mixture was superimposed with those of MHC and Fab to compare the elution volume. Antibody discovery Antibody discovery was carried out at AbCellera. Briefly, Lewis rats, wild-type BALB/c & C57BL/6 mice, Trianni humanized mice, and Alloy humanized mice were immunized with recombinant PRAME 425 425 230 Protein purification Fab proteins were expressed in Expi293 cells and the harvested cell culture media were loaded onto an immobilized metal affinity chromatography column (Cytiva HisTrap HP) equilibrated with Buffer A (25 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 300 mM sodium chloride). After loading the column was washed for 5 column volumes with the equilibration buffer prior to protein elution using Buffer B (25 mM Tris pH 8.0, 300 mM sodium chloride, and 500 mM imidazole) in 5% and then 30% step elution where the majority of the protein desorption occurred. The pool was dialyzed to PBS pH 7.4 and 0.2 µm filtered. Analytical SEC was performed on the buffer exchanged Fab which determined the protein to be >95% monodispersed. Diabody-Fc proteins were expressed in either Expi293 or ExpiCHO. The harvest cell culture media were clarified and 0.2 µm-filtered prior to loading on a Protein A column (Cytiva MabSelect SuRe or Cytiva Fibro PrismA) that was equilibrated using 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 25 mM sodium chloride. The harvested cell culture fluid was then loaded onto the column and washed with the equilibration buffer. This was followed by a high salt wash using 25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 500 mM sodium chloride and then another equilibration buffer wash. Protein desorption was induced using 100 mM acetate pH 3.7 and the elution pool was immediately neutralized with 6% (by volume) of 1 M Tris pH 8.0 where some precipitation occurred. The pool was clarified using centrifugation at 5k ×g for 10 minutes and 0.2 µm filtration before moving to the next purification step on a CEX column (Cytiva SP Sepharose HP). The CEX column was equilibrated with Buffer A (25 mM MES pH 5.5, 20 mM sodium chloride) and eluted with an increasing gradient using Buffer B (25 mM MES pH 5.5, 1 M sodium chloride). If further polishing was required, the CEX pool was concentrated and then injected on an SEC column (Cytiva Superdex 200). All material was buffer-exchanged to 20 mM histidine pH 5.8 with the addition of 9% sucrose and 0.05% Tween 80 for long-term storage if needed. Samples were analyzed and determined to be >95% monodispersed by SEC-HPLC, SDS-PAGE (non-reduced and reduced), and mass spectroscopy (intact and reduced). On- vs. Off-target peptide-pulsed T2 cell binding assays Peptides for on and off-target screening were generated at Genscript (PRAME 425 230 P L34965 425 Alanine scan and X-scan peptide-pulsed T2 cell binding assays Peptides for alanine scan and X-scan were generated at Genscript. T2 cells were washed with serum-free IMDM (Gibco Cat. #12440046), resuspended in PBS, and incubated with 50 μg/mL peptides and 5 μg/mL β2 microglobulin (BD Biosciences Cat. # 551089) for 2–4 hours at 37°C in 96-well v-bottom polypropylene plates. The peptide-pulsed cells were then transferred in duplicate (alanine scan) or quadruplicate (X-Scan) to 384-well v-bottom plates using a Biomek FX liquid handler (Beckman Coulter) and incubated with Fc block (BioLegend Cat. # 422302) plus LIVE/DEAD stain (Invitrogen Cat. # L34965 In silico prediction of off-target peptides In order to predict potential off-target peptides that could be theoretically recognized by each antibody, the raw binding score for each peptide was converted to a percentage relative to the target PRAME 425 T cell dependent cytotoxicity assays Target cell lines were stably transduced with the nuclear-restricted fluorescent protein Nuclight Red (Sartorius, Cat#4476) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Target cells were seeded and allowed to adhere overnight.
