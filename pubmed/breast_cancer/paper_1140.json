Nevertheless, the effect of highly concentrated sugar diet on male infertility is still under evaluation. The most important is that biological activity of sucralose, a chloroorganic synthetic sweetener, is highly persistent and difficultly altered in the environment, as its influence on the biological activity of other substances has not been completely elucidated yet. For this reason, in this work, sugar and sucralose–sugar mixtures, frequently used in beverages and other food products, influence Drosophila melanogaster Drosophila melanogaster sucrose sucralose prolificacy longevity DNA damage Drosophila the National Funds by the FCT the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology the Veterinary and Animal Research Centre (CECAV) UIDB/00772/2020 the project AL4AnimalS LA/P/0059/2020 Centre for the Research and Technology of Agro-Environmental and Biological Sciences (CITAB) UID/04033 LA/P/0126/2020 This work was supported by the National Funds by the FCT, the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology, under project UIDB/00772/2020 ( https://doi.org/10.54499/UIDB/00772/2020 https://doi.org/10.54499/UIDB/00772/2020 https://doi.org/10.54499/LA/P/0126/2020 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction The term “sweetener” generally refers to a substance added to food and drinks with purpose of sweetening them [ 1 2 3 4 Sucralose ( Figure 1 5 6 7 8 9 10 ® Sucralose is synthetized in food industry from common sugar through several steps ( Figure 2 The acylation in the first stage may also be made by diethylazodicarboxylate. The C4 epimerization is realized in the second stage. This synthesis involves either the toxic reagents (DCC, DAAD, and PCl 5 Despite being considered safe for use by diabetics and athletes, its harmful effects on human health and the environment are still unknown, and some of its negative effects have only begun to be studied now. A recent study involving pregnant and breastfeeding women [ 11 12 13 Moreover, as sucralose is nearly not biodegradable, it accumulates in the environment [ 14 15 16 Figure 3 Another critical issue yet to be addressed about this compound is the presence of 6-acetyl sucralose, the industrial precursor of the sweetener ( Figure 2 17 18 19 20 21 22 Toxicological studies of the steric derivative of sucralose proved that the mechanism of its genotoxicity can be considered clastogenic (initiator of breaks in the DNA structure). Even microscopic concentrations of 6-acetyl sucralose, which can be detected in industrial samples and beverages, exceed the safe threshold of 0.15 μg/person/day. The 6-acetyl sucralose ester increases in intestinal epithelial cells, expressing genes linked to inflammation, oxidative stress, and carcinogenesis, including MT1G SHMT2 23 24 25 Another harmful action of the steric derivative is impeding the action of CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, proteins of the cytochrome P450 family, that are responsible for the transformation of various food substances to their more accessible form, which leads to secondary toxic effects [ 26 27 28 29 30 Sucralose is frequently used in beverages (soft drinks, fuse teas, dietetic drinks), pharmaceuticals, and dietetic food alongside sugar and other sweeteners (acesulfame K, aspartame, sorbitol, mannitol). This use is aimed to make sweet sensorial properties more expressed in order to enhance the consumer reaction. The same sweeteners are also used in electronic cigarettes, in which they mask the nicotine scent [ 29 On the other hand, as for now, few to no studies are known to describe the sucralose biological activity, including genotoxicity, in the presence of other substances, including natural and synthetic sweeteners [ 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 31 32 33 34 35 In this aspect, D. melanogaster 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 - Shares a substantial proportion of its genome with humans, with approximately 60% of human disease-associated genes having identifiable homologs. Its fully sequenced and extensively annotated genome makes it a valuable model for assessing the impact of mutagens on specific genes and regulatory pathways that are conserved across species, including humans. - It has a short life cycle (approximately 10–12 days at 25 °C) and produces large numbers of offspring, making it particularly suitable for large-scale genetic screens and statistical analyses of mutagenic effects across generations. These features are essential for the efficient and cost-effective assessment of genotoxic risk. - There is an extensive collection of mutant lines, which enables the study of a wide range of biological conditions and responses. This genetic diversity allows researchers to investigate the effects of genotoxic agents under different genetic backgrounds, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of mechanisms involved in DNA damage and repair. - Compared to mammalian models, the use of D. melanogaster - Despite frequent application of Caenorhabditis elegans Drosophila - It has a simple and well-characterized gut microbiota that can be experimentally manipulated, allowing the investigation of how diet, environmental agents, or genetic factors influence microbial composition and host physiology. In this study, D. melanogaster 2. Results 2.1.

Discussion This study reveals the significant effects of different sucrose and sucralose concentrations on various biological and behavioral parameters of D. melanogaster With regard to prolificacy, the data show that the absence (0% and 5%) or excess of sucrose (20%) significantly reduces the number of eggs, larvae, and adults, with peak performance observed at 10–15% sucrose. This dose-dependent pattern is consistent with the findings of Skorupa et al. [ 51 D. melanogaster 52 53 54 Longevity analysis revealed that both sucrose deprivation and excess decreased the mean lifespan of individuals, with the most significant impact observed in the absence of sucrose. These findings align with those of Partridge et al. [ 55 56 57 Both negative geotaxis and exploration assays reveal sex-specific and dose-dependent locomotor deficits, especially under sucralose exposure. These deficits are likely to reflect underlying neurometabolic disruption, consistent with previous reports of dopamine impairment and oxidative stress caused by excessive sugar intake or artificial sweeteners. Females generally exhibited greater sensitivity to sucralose exposure, with significant performance impairment occurring at 0.25% exposure. These results are consistent with those of Gargano et al. [ 58 Drosophila 59 Drosophila The comet assay revealed a significant increase in DNA strand breaks in larval neuroblasts exposed to high concentrations of sucrose (≥15%) or any concentration of sucralose (starting at 0.5%). The observed genotoxicity with elevated sucrose may be linked to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as described by Diniz et al. [ 60 61 62 Drosophila Other direct and indirect genotoxicity issues for sucralose have been conducted recently [ 38 63 64 65 66 67 38 Cyprinus carpio Other studies have raised more serious concerns. For instance, ref. [ 64 MAPK8 APTX EID1 Allium cepa 65 66 67 Therefore, the present study on D. melanogaster In summary, our findings suggest that moderate doses of sucrose support normal physiological parameters in D. melanogaster D. melanogaster 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Strains The Oregon-K (OK) strain was used in this study. It is a wild-type line proficient in all major DNA repair pathways, including homologous recombination (HR), classical non-homologous end joining (c-NHEJ), and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). Additionally, this strain has been biochemically characterized and shown to have low antioxidant enzyme activity, which makes it particularly sensitive for studies involving oxidative damage [ 68 69 4.2. Culture Medium Conditions and Sample Preparation with Drosophila All flies were maintained in a climate-controlled chamber at 24 °C with a 12:12 h light–dark cycle. To maintain the population, newly eclosed adults were transferred to glass vials containing standard culture medium. The composition of this medium is detailed in Table 1 Flies were divided into experimental groups according to the treatment regimen. The control group consisted of flies maintained on standard medium (containing 10% sugar), treatment groups included flies exposed to sugar concentrations of 0%, 5%, 15%, and 20%, as well as flies maintained on a culture medium with 10% sugar supplemented with sucralose at concentrations of 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 10%. Virgin males and females aged between 0 and 3 days were selected for the experiments. For each group, five mating vials were prepared, each containing ten virgin males and ten virgin females. Males in the treatment groups were exposed to the respective sugar and sucralose concentrations for 2 to 3 days under standard conditions (24 °C). Immediately following exposure, males were introduced to females for mating. 4.3. Prolificacy Evaluation Prolificacy was assessed using a standard culture medium (described in Table 1 70 71 4.4. Longevity Assay After offspring counting, individuals from each experimental group (control and treatment with sugar or sucralose) were transferred to three replicate vials per group. Each vial consisted of a 200 mL glass container with approximately 25 mL of culture medium. Flies were transferred to fresh vials every seven to nine days to maintain food quality and avoid generational overlap. Mortality was recorded at each transfer until all individuals in each group had died. Longevity was calculated as the number of days from hatching to death for each fly [ 72 4.5. Open Field Exploration Test (Evaluation of Exploratory) Approximately five adult flies, separated by sex, from both treatment and control groups (as described in Section 2.3 73 4.6. Negative Geotaxis Test (Locomotion) Groups of ten adult flies, separated by sex, from both treatment and control groups (as described in Section 2.3 74 75 4.7. Comet Assay The comet assay was carried out to assess DNA strand breaks, alkali-labile sites, and general genomic integrity in neuroblasts. Approximately 2 to 3 third-stage larvae were collected from each experimental group and the neuroblasts were isolated by dissection using a drop of ringer’s solution (150 mM NaCl, 35 mM KCl, and 2 mM CaCl, adjust the pH to 6.5 with NaOH). The extracted tissues were gently dissociated using forceps into a 1.5 mL microtube with about 100 uL of insect ringer’s solution (130 mM NaCl, 35 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl 2 g 2 76 77 4.8. Data Evaluation and Statistical Analysis The DNA damage data obtained through the comet assay (expressed as the percentage of DNA in the comet tail) were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical comparisons were performed only on the percentage of DNA damage. Graphical representation organized in bars, showing the mean distance traveled by males and females in seconds and centimeters were used to present data from the negative geotaxis test and fly exploration. Prolificacy was assessed based on the number of adults, larvae, and hatched eggs. Quantitative data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). An independent samples t Drosophila 5.
