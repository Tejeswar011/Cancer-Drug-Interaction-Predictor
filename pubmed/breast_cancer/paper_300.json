There has been an increasing incidence of several types of cancer, such as breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, uterine cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, kidney cancer, human papillomavirus-associated oral cancer and melanoma. Advancements in biomedical research have expanded treatment options for numerous cancers; however, an ideal or definitive cure remains elusive. Therefore, identifying novel targets for cancer treatment has become a major area of research in biomedicine. Due to its involvement in several human diseases and tumor progression, discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (DDR2) has attracted considerable attention. The present review synthesizes findings from previous studies and highlights the recent advances in DDR2 research, assesses its role across different types of tumors and evaluates its emerging significance in multiple biomedical fields. discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 cancer solid tumor mechanism inhibitor Regional Science Foundation Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China 82160111 82360115 Targeted Exploration Project of the Medical Department of Lanzhou University lzuyxcx-2022-181 The present study was supported by the Regional Science Foundation Project of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 82160111 and 82360115) and the Targeted Exploration Project of the Medical Department of Lanzhou University (grant no. lzuyxcx-2022-181). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Cancer remains a major global health problem, with an estimated 19.3 million new cases and ~10 million deaths reported worldwide in 2020 alone ( 1 2 3 4 14 15 16 17 Biomarkers are molecules in the blood, other body fluids or tissues that serve as markers of normal or abnormal processes, conditions or diseases, and can be used to monitor how the body responds to therapy for a certain disease or condition ( 16 18 19 Discoidin protein domain receptor (DDR) tyrosine kinases belong to the tyrosine kinase receptor family, which is subdivided into 20 subfamilies based on the homology of ligand-binding extracellular domain features. Abnormalities in these tyrosine kinases are associated with several diseases, including cancer, chronic inflammation and fibrosis ( 20 21 22 23 24 The present review summarizes the latest research progress on DDR2, its role in cancer and its underlying mechanisms of action, including its abnormal expression in cancer and its prognostic value. Additionally, the current status of global drug and future design prospects for DDR2 are also reviewed. 2. Structure and function of DDR2 The molecular structure of DDR includes an extracellular binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular kinase domain. The extracellular binding domain is composed of a discoidin (DS) domain and a DS-like domain for collagen binding ( 25 26 27 28 29 3. Expression of DDR2 in human single cells For further analysis, the present study mapped the DDR2 in tissues, cells and organs using the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database ( www.proteinatlas.org https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000162733-DDR2/cell+line https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000162733-DDR2/tissue 4. Research progress of DDR2 in solid tumors DDR2 is abnormally expressed in numerous human solid tumors and has been associated with tumorigenesis. The current research results of DDR2 in several solid tumors are summarized in Table I Furthermore, analysis of data from the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource database ( http://cistrome.org/TIMER/ Fig. 1 30 33 Fig. 2 5. DDR2 in the tumorigenesis mechanism DDR2 in ovarian cancer Ovarian cancer is a highly prevalent malignant tumor, and its incidence ranks eighth among female tumors in the world. Worldwide, 314,000 cases and 207,000 deaths have been reported annually. Furthermore, the incidence of most cancers is decreasing in Northern Europe and North America based on age markers; however, it is on the rise in certain parts of Eastern Europe and Asia ( 34 35 et al 36 DDR2 can facilitate ovarian cancer metastasis and enhance tumor invasion by regulating the metabolism and secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are major matrix components in the tumor microenvironment (TME). CAFs exhibit considerable heterogeneity and plasticity, and have a marked effect on the immune response and metabolic reprogramming within the TME, thereby influencing tumor progression ( 37 et al 38 39 40 41 42 et al 43 DDR2 in breast cancer Breast cancer is a major health problem among women worldwide. It is characterized by ‘cold tumors’ exhibiting low levels of immune cell infiltration, which limits the efficacy of conventional immunotherapy. At present, research is focused on the strategy of transforming a ‘cold tumor’ into a ‘hot tumor’ through the TME ( 44 In a recent study on DDR2, Corsa et al 45 et al 46 47 Furthermore, triple-negative breast cancer is characterized by the absence of endocrine therapeutic targets and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 blockade, and it has a poor prognosis ( 48 49 50 DDR2 in gastric cancer Gastric cancer, also known as stomach cancer, is a highly malignant and common digestive tract tumor. Advancements in surgical techniques and the development of antitumor drugs have improved the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer. However, the survival rate and quality of life of these patients are still lower than those of patients with colorectal cancer, liver cancer and other digestive tract tumors ( 51 52 53 A study by Kurashige et al 54 et al 55 55 DDR2 in colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Firouzjaei et al 56 DDR1 and DDR2 may serve as potential therapeutic targets for metastatic colorectal cancer ( 57 59 et al 60 DDR2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) HCC is a primary malignant tumor of the liver and is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage when the tumor is unresectable. In such cases, systemic treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors is the primary option ( 61 62 Research findings have revealed that downregulating DDR2 expression can reduce the proliferation and migration of HCC cells ( 63 64 et al 65 65 Immunotherapy is a valuable approach to HCC treatment. Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) is a checkpoint receptor expressed on the surface of several immune cells. PD-L1 is a natural receptor of PD-1 and is predominantly expressed in tumor cells. PD-1 and PD-L1 are closely associated with the progression of human cancer ( 66 67 68 69 Liu et al 70 70 71 + 72 73 74 et al 75 DDR2 in neuroblastoma Neuroblastoma is a cancer that arises from neural crest cells and is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children ( 76 et al 77 78 79 DDR2 in thyroid cancer Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and most cases are diagnosed early, are highly differentiated and have a good prognosis ( 80 81 Liang et al 82 DDR2 in prostate cancer Prostate cancer is a type of urologic cancer that forms in the prostate, with a relatively high incidence worldwide, and it is the second-most common cancer in men after lung cancer ( 83 84 Azemikhah et al 85 et al 86 et al 87 DDR2 in urothelial carcinoma The most common pathological subtype of bladder and upper urinary tract malignancies is urothelial carcinoma ( 88 89 DDR2 in melanoma Although DDR1 is the primary DDR in the epidermis, where it is involved in melanocyte homeostasis, DDR2 appears to be the primary DDR implicated in melanoma ( 90 in vitro in vivo 91 et al 92 92 6. DDR2 and the TME The TME refers to the noncancerous cells and their components present in the tumor environment, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, neurons, fat cells, adaptive cells and innate immune cells. This term also refers to the continuous interaction between tumor cells and the TME, which serves a decisive role in the cancer development, progression and metastasis, as well as in the therapeutic response of the tumor ( 93 94 95 96 97 98 24 99 100 7. DDR2 and CAFs The population of fibroblasts found in both primary and metastatic cancers is collectively referred to as CAFs. They are the most abundant cell types in the TME and are the central hub of cross-communication among several cells in the tumor stroma ( 101 102 103 104 105 106 8. DDR2 and immunotherapy To date, immune checkpoint-targeted drugs, such as anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4, anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1, as well as other new targeted drugs, have achieved notable results in several cancer immunotherapies. However, accumulating evidence suggests that positive response rates remain low in patients receiving immune checkpoint-targeted drugs and drug resistance emerges, which is an issue that warrants attention ( 107 108 109 110 111 9. Co-activation pathway of DDR2 in different solid tumors EMT refers to the cellular process through which epithelial cells lose their properties and gain interstitial properties to facilitate cell movement. This process is abnormally activated in human cancers and contributes to enhanced tumor initiation, cell migration, invasion, metastasis and therapeutic resistance ( 112 37 38 43 53 58 80 10. Current status of research on drugs and antibodies targeting DDR2 Due to its potential use in antitumor therapy, several drugs targeting DDR2 have been developed and used in clinical trials and research. The present review used the Pharnexcloud Cloud database ( https://www.pharnexcloud.com/ Table II Table III 113 118 Table IV 11. Strengths of the present review Table V et al 119 Table I 12. Conclusions and perspectives Several studies have reported that DDR2 serves different pivotal roles in numerous types of solid tumor, especially through ECM and CAFs. It also participates in multiple mechanisms to promote tumor metastasis and drug resistance. Both ECM and CAFs, as well as EMT, are a major focus of tumor research. As the research on DDR2 progresses, biological processes involved in tumor occurrence and development are likely to be revealed. In addition, as the potential of DDR2 inhibitors continues to be investigated through drug development and clinical trials, new perspectives are likely to emerge in the treatment of tumors. The present article offers a comprehensive and insightful review of DDR2 as a promising target in solid tumors. It examines key aspects, including the structure and function of DDR2, its expression in several tissues and tumors, and its role in the tumorigenesis of different types of cancer, such as ovarian, breast and stomach cancers. This broad coverage is useful for researchers looking for a comprehensive resource for DDR2 in solid tumors. Additionally, it bridges the gap between basic research and clinical application by assessing the current global progress on DDR2 drugs and antibodies, which is crucial for translating laboratory findings into potential cancer treatments. Finally, the present review provides potential new directions for the pursuit of effective cancer treatments through DDR2-targeted strategies. Acknowledgements Not applicable.
