IgM myeloma is a rare subtype of multiple myeloma (MM) comprising 0.5% of all of its cases. It is characterized by the unregulated proliferation of IgM-secreting plasma cells in the bone marrow. The underlying pathogenesis involves dysregulation of isotype switch recombination, leading to various translocations involving chromosomes such as 11q13 and 4p16. Patients usually present with symptoms of hyperviscosity syndrome, bone marrow infiltration, and organomegaly. Diagnostic workup includes clinical evaluation, laboratory tests (electrophoresis, bone marrow biopsy, cytogenetics, immunohistochemistry), and imaging. Treatment options for IgM myeloma include proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and autologous stem cell transplantation. However, no clear management guidelines are established for this rare subtype of MM. This article provides an up-to-date detailed overview of the pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnostics of IgM myeloma.

It is considered by the World Health Organization as a lymphoproliferative B-cell disease [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Figure 1 9 Figure 1 Progression and diagnostic criteria across the monoclonal gammopathy spectrum. Schematic overview of MGUS, smoldering myeloma, and symptomatic multiple myeloma with key thresholds (clonal plasma cells in bone marrow, serum M-protein) and CRAB/end-organ damage criteria [ 9 The underlying pathogenesis of MM is the result of the unregulated proliferation of antibody producing plasma cells, leading to the accumulation of high molecular weight proteins in the bone marrow and blood. Patients can present with the characteristic hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, bone lesions (CRAB) symptoms ( Table 1 9 10 11 12 Table 1 10 Table 1 Revised IMWG Diagnostic Criteria for MM (Adapted From IMWG Guidelines [ 9 CRAB criteria Any one or more of the following biomarkers of malignancy Elevated calcium: Serum calcium level > 0.25 mmol/L (or > 1 mg/dL) above the normal upper limit, or an absolute value exceeding 2.75 mmol/L (11 mg/dL) Kidney dysfunction: Estimated creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min or serum creatinine > 177 µmol/L (2 mg/dL) Anemia: Hemoglobin more than 20 g/L below the lower reference limit or total hemoglobin < 100 g/L Skeletal involvement: One or more osteolytic lesions identified on skeletal survey, CT, or PET-CT Clonal plasma cells ≥ 60% in bone marrow Serum free light chain ratio ≥ 100 (involved/uninvolved chains) More than one focal lesion on MRI studies The diagnosis requires either clonal plasma cells comprising 10% or more of the bone marrow, or a confirmed biopsy of a bony or extramedullary plasmacytoma, along with at least one of the following defining features of multiple myeloma. CRAB: hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, bone lesions; IMWG: International Myeloma Working Group; MM: multiple myeloma; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging; PET-CT: positron emission tomography-computed tomography. IgM MM has significant clinical challenges, with most data derived from small series and case reports. Additionally, distinguishing IgM myeloma from Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM) remains a recurrent difficulty [ 12 Methodology We conducted a comprehensive literature review using PubMed and Web of Science databases supplemented by referencing management software for article screening and citation management. Keywords including “IgM Multiple Myeloma”, “IgM Myeloma”, “Multiple myeloma”, “gammopathies”, and “monoclonal gammopathy” were employed resulting in 1,842 studies. Filters were applied to include only articles published in English, observational studies, systematic reviews, case reports, and case series within the past 10 years yielding 103 studies out of the originally obtained 1,842. Two independent reviewers (FE and RF) screened the 103 remaining articles based on screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts. Discrepancies between reviewers were resolved through discussion, and if consensus was not reached, a third reviewer (HE) served as adjudicator. A total of 49 studies were finally included ( Table 2 Fig. 2 Table 2 Summary of Literature Review Process Stage Number of articles Records identified through database search (PubMed and Web of Science) 1,842 Titles and abstracts screened 103 Studies included in final review 49 Figure 2 PRISMA-style study selection for the IgM myeloma review. Database searches of PubMed and Web of Science (English, human studies, last 10 years) identified 1,842 records; 103 full texts were assessed after limits/de-duplication; 49 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. Pathophysiology The most frequent karyotypic alteration in IgM myeloma involves translocations at the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus, located at 14q32. This locus is highly transcriptionally active in B and plasma cells, so transferring an oncogene to 14q32 will cause dysregulation. Errors during class-switch recombination or somatic hypermutation can generate these IgH translocations [ 13 In IgM myeloma, IgH translocations mirror those seen across MM, most commonly t(11;14)(q13;q32) with CCND1 activation, and less frequently t(4;14)(p16;q32) (involving FGFR3/NSD2) and t(14;16)(q32;q23) (MAF); rarer t(6;14) events may involve IRF4/MUM1 or CCND3. Across published cohorts, the prevalence of t(11;14) in IgM myeloma is about 40% in multicenter series and 60-80% in small, focused cohorts, reflecting methodological and population differences [ 13 19 18 Fig. 3 20 Figure 3 Immunophenotype and IGH translocations in IgM myeloma. Common IGH rearrangements at 14q32 (e.g., t(11;14) → CCND1, t(4;14) → FGFR3/NSD2, t(14;16) → MAF; rarer t(6;14) → IRF4/MUM1/CCND3) and representative immunophenotype of IgM myeloma plasma cells: loss of CD19/CD27/CD45 with aberrant CD56/CD20/CD117/cyclin D1. IGH: immunoglobulin heavy chain; WM: Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. In contrast, WM shows a lymphoplasmacytic phenotype with retention of B-cell antigens (e.g., CD19, CD20) and a distinct genetic profile; critically, IgM myeloma is typically MYD88 L265P-negative, which supports its separation from WM (see section “Diagnostics”) [ 21 22 Clinical Features The median age of presentation and diagnosis of IgM myeloma is reported to be 65 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. The typical myeloma symptoms such as hypercalcemia, renal failure, and anemia are equally common in IgM myeloma as it is in other types of myelomas [ 18 23 24 25 18 In the same study [ 18 26 Additionally, acquired von Willebrand disease (aVWD) has been documented in IgM myeloma, likely caused by the adsorption and clearance of von Willebrand factor by the monoclonal IgM paraprotein, contributing to bleeding diatheses [ 27 Organomegaly is a feature more commonly reported in other types of gammopathies, specifically WM. However, some IgM myeloma patients can also present with organomegaly as reported in Avet-Loiseau et al, where a prevalence of organomegaly in 25% (two out of eight) was reported [ 21 28 29 17 30 Diagnostics It is essential to distinguish IgM myeloma from other monoclonal gammopathies, as the management approach differs significantly from other types ( Table 3 18 19 30 31 Table 3 Differential Diagnoses of IgM Myeloma Differential diagnosis Monoclonal IgM in serum Bone marrow findings Clinical features MYD88 L265P mutation IgM myeloma Positive ≥ 10% pure plasmocytic morphology Lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia Absent WM Positive ≥ 10% lymphoplasmacytic morphology Hyperviscosity is more common Present in > 90% of cases AL amyloidosis positive < 20% plasma cells Pulmonary symptoms, polyneuropathy, lymphadenopathy Typically absent IgM MGUS < 3 g/dL < 10% Asymptomatic Variable Other IgM-related disorders Positive Typically absent Cold-induced symptoms (e.g., Raynaud’s, acrocyanosis), neuropathy Variable Adapted from Castillo et al [ 18 19 30 31 The distinction between IgM myeloma and other IgM-related gammopathies, particularly WM is essential due to their divergent biology, clinical behavior, and treatment. IgM myeloma typically shows a pure plasmacytic morphology, lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, and the absence of organomegaly, features that are rare in WM. Immunophenotypically, IgM myeloma frequently lacks normal B-cell markers such as CD19 and CD20 and instead exhibits aberrant expression of CD56 and cyclin D1, especially in the presence of the t(11;14) translocation. In contrast, WM characteristically retains B-cell markers and has a lymphoplasmacytic morphology. A pivotal molecular distinction is the absence of the MYD88 L265P mutation in IgM myeloma, which is present in over 90% of WM cases. This mutation serves as a critical biomarker that helps differentiate between the two entities in diagnostically challenging cases. Additionally, WM often presents with organomegaly and hyperviscosity, whereas IgM myeloma is more commonly associated with skeletal involvement and CRAB symptoms [ 19 31 In addition to plasma-cell IgM myeloma and WM, IgM gammopathies include IgM MGUS and IgM MGCS. IgM MGUS is defined by an asymptomatic circulating IgM M-protein < 30 g/L with < 10% lymphoplasmacytic marrow infiltration. Its natural history is indolent, with a progression risk of about 1.1 events per 100 person-years (most commonly to lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/AL amyloidosis); notably, in the largest series (n = 210), no patients progressed to plasma-cell IgM myeloma. IgM MGCS denotes IgM-mediated organ damage (e.g., neuropathy, cryoglobulinemia, cold agglutinin disease (CAD)) without meeting criteria for WM or myeloma; management targets the IgM-driven pathology [ 32 To establish a definitive diagnosis, bone marrow morphology and immunophenotypic analysis are essential to establish a definitive diagnosis. The diagnostic workup typically begins by taking a focused history and physical examination, looking for possible features of organomegaly, a history of bone pain, and features of amyloidosis such as heart failure, chronic diarrhea, and orthostatic hypotension. Consequently, specific tests are conducted to help in ruling out differential diagnoses for IgM myeloma such as WM, IgM MGUS, IgM amyloidosis, and IgM-related disorders such as IgM neuropathies, cryoglobulinemia (type I and type II), CAD, polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome, Schnitzler syndrome, pyoderma gangrenous, scleromyxedema, and monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance [ 19 30 33 37 Electrophoresis is used as an initial screening test in patients with suspected myelomas. After establishing a possible diagnosis of a monoclonal gammopathy, unilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, including immunohistochemistry and/or flow cytometry, and cytogenetics are done next. Fluorescence in situ 38 32 Since most MM patients have bone involvement, imaging techniques such as skeletal bone survey are considered to be the standard diagnostic approach in diagnosing lytic bone disease in MM [ 39 40 18 41 43 The diagnosis of IgM myeloma currently requires the detection of IgM monoclonal gammopathy, at least 10% plasma cells in a bone marrow biopsy, and the presence of lytic bone lesions and/or the t(11;14) translocation identified through FISH [ 18 39 18 Prognosis The International Staging System (ISS) is a staging system established by the IMWG in 2005 to classify MM based on several prognostic factors ( Table 4 39 44 Table 4 ISS for Multiple Myeloma and Estimated Median Survival ISS stage Criteria R-ISS additional criteria Estimated median survival (years) I Sβ2M < 3.5 mg/L; serum albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL ISS I + standard-risk cytogenetics + normal LDH > 8 years II Sβ2M < 3.5 mg/L; serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL; or β2M 3.5 to 5.5 mg/L, irrespective of serum albumin Does not meet I or III. about 6 years III Sβ2M ≥ 5.5mg/L ISS III + (high-risk cytogenetics OR elevated LDH) about 3 years Standard-risk cytogenetics = absence of del(17p), t(4;14), or t(14;16). High-risk cytogenetics = presence of del(17p), t(4;14), and/or t(14;16). Adapted From International Staging System for Multiple Myeloma [ 39 44 The ISS is based on two variables, serum albumin and β2-microglobulin, which have proved to be reliable predictive factors for survival. This system was developed in North America, Europe, and Asia, in patients younger and older than age 65 years, and with standard therapy or auto transplant where it continued to display effectiveness [ 44 45 44 46 18 Therapeutic Management Due to the rarity of IgM myeloma, most therapeutic recommendations are extrapolated from studies of broader MM populations. Specific clinical trials exclusively evaluating IgM MM are lacking; thus, treatment strategies are adapted from the standard-of-care approaches used in other MM subtypes. Front-line induction Treatment strategies for IgM myeloma follow standard MM protocols with induction therapy consisting of triple or quadruple therapy (steroids, proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulators, monoclonal antibodies), followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplant depending on cytogenetic findings and transplant eligibility, then maintenance therapy [ 18 22 22 Immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) IMiDs, like thalidomide (thal) and lenalidomide (len), have demonstrated efficacy in treating IgM myeloma. Both thalidomide and its structural derivative, lenalidomide, are used to treat various illnesses. They exert their antimyeloma activity through multiple, now partially elucidated mechanisms. A key pathway involves binding to the cereblon (CRBN) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, leading to targeted degradation of transcription factors Ikaros (IKZF1) and Aiolos (IKZF3), which are critical for myeloma cell survival. Additionally, IMiDs enhance T-cell and natural killer (NK) cell activation, inhibit regulatory T cells, suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and exert anti-angiogenic effects within the tumor microenvironment [ 47 48 Lenalidomide plus dexamethasone has shown deep and durable responses in non-IgM MM, achieving ≥ 50% serum M-protein reduction in approximately 90% of patients in early and larger trials [ 49 50 18 Moreover, lenalidomide and thalidomide’s ability to boost interleukin (IL)-2 production and suppress IgM secretion supports their rationale for use in IgM myeloma. The trend is moving towards substituting thalidomide/dexamethasone with lenalidomide/dexamethasone, with some guidelines even proposing lenalidomide monotherapy [ 51 52 Anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies Daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD38, has become a significant treatment option for resistant or relapsed MM. Recent data from large-scale phase III trials have reshaped the first-line therapy for transplant-eligible and ineligible MM patients. The PERSEUS trial demonstrated that adding subcutaneous daratumumab to VRd (D-VRd) significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS), depth of response (complete response or better), and minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rates compared to VRd alone. The estimated 48-month PFS rates were 84.3% for D-VRd versus 67.7% for VRd [ 53 54 Relapsed/refractory disease and targeted therapy (t(11;14)) In the context of innovative treatments, venetoclax has become the first approved selective B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) inhibitor in its class, particularly beneficial for MM patients carrying the t(11;14) (q13; q32) translocation. Venetoclax monotherapy has shown effectiveness in treating relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). However, combining venetoclax with dexamethasone, in the presence or absence of bortezomib, has demonstrated even greater efficacy [ 55 56 56 57 58 T-cell-redirecting therapies Historically labeled as “novel agents,” bortezomib, lenalidomide, and thalidomide revolutionized multiple myeloma therapy in the early 2000s. However, this terminology has become outdated given the emergence of more recent immunotherapies that have substantially reshaped the treatment landscape. These include bispecific T-cell engagers such as teclistamab, talquetamab, and elranatamab, as well as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies like idecabtagene vicleucel and ciltacabtagene autoleucel, which are now incorporated into international treatment guidelines for RRMM. These agents have demonstrated high response rates in heavily pretreated patients and are increasingly considered earlier in the treatment algorithm [ 59 61 59 62 63 Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) In transplant-eligible patients, the contemporary standard mirrors other MM isotypes: induction therapy followed by ASCT and post-transplant maintenance. Induction typically comprises triplet or quadruplet regimens such as bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (VRd), or combinations incorporating monoclonal antibodies like daratumumab. Indeed, daratumumab-based quadruplets have become front-line standard-of-care regimens in many parts of the world, including both standard- and high-risk patients, as supported by the CASSIOPEIA (D-VTd), GRIFFIN (D-VRd), and MAIA (D-Rd in transplant-ineligible) trials [ 64 66 Regarding ASCT, it remains the cornerstone of therapy for eligible patients and is associated with improved PFS. While transplant-related risks exist, they are generally low in contemporary practice (< 1-2%) and outweighed by the survival benefits conferred in properly selected patients. Long-term outcomes are optimized when patients achieve deep responses prior to transplant, and post-ASCT maintenance further enhances durability [ 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 72 Historical outcomes context Earlier series reported limited complete responses with conventional chemotherapy and a median survival of about 3 years in IgM MM [ 68 68 74 Supportive Management Supportive strategies for IgM myeloma mirror standard MM practice; major guidelines do not distinguish by heavy-chain isotype. Care should include risk-adapted infection prophylaxis, structured skeletal management, evidence-based analgesia, and targeted treatment of anemia [ 75 Infections remain a major driver of early morbidity and mortality in MM, with the highest risk in the first months after starting therapy. However, there are no IgM-specific data, so recommendations are extrapolated from general MM guidance [ 75 76 77 78 79 75 In MM, the unregulated growth of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow leads to osteolysis and bone loss, which significantly increases morbidity. Several studies have shown the importance of bisphosphonates for palliative care due to their effectiveness in lowering the risk of hypercalcemia and skeletal complications associated with myeloma. The IMWG Bone Working Group recommends zoledronic acid (or pamidronate) for all patients with active MM, regardless of baseline lytic lesions, with renal-adjusted dosing and mandatory dental evaluation and calcium/vitamin D supplementation. After about 12 months, dosing can be de-escalated (e.g., every 3 months) in deep responders, with continuation or re-initiation at biochemical/clinical relapse [ 80 81 Analgesia should follow cancer-pain guidelines: use regular non-opioids and strong opioids for moderate-severe nociceptive pain, titrated with breakthrough dosing and functional reassessment. For neuropathic components, adjuvant agents such as gabapentinoids or duloxetine can be added; randomized data support duloxetine for chemotherapy-induced painful neuropathy. Non-pharmacologic and interventional measures (e.g., radiotherapy, vertebral augmentation) can be used when indicated [ 82 84 Anemia is a common complication in MM, including IgM MM, resulting from marrow infiltration, inflammation-driven hepcidin-mediated iron restriction, relative erythropoietin deficiency from renal dysfunction, and treatment-related myelosuppression [ 85 86 87 86 88 89 90 91 Given the limited body of literature discussing IgM myeloma, most of the management guidance in this review is extrapolated by data from broader MM populations. Wherever possible, we have cited IgM-specific findings, but for certain therapeutic strategies and prognostic frameworks, extrapolation from general MM studies remains necessary. We highlight the urgent need for dedicated prospective studies focused on this rare subtype. Conclusion IgM myeloma is reported to have a more ominous prognosis compared to the remaining MM subtypes in some cases. This places heavy emphasis on timely diagnosis and effective management. Current diagnostics rely on a combination of clinical assessment, laboratory investigations, bone marrow biopsies, cytogenetics, and immunohistochemistry studies. Following diagnosis, appropriate management is imperative to prevent the progression of the disorder. The current treatment options for IgM myeloma are primarily adapted from those used for other types of MM, but there is a need for more specific and tailored therapies. We invite future studies that investigate the efficacy of the current treatments of IgM myeloma and the development of standardized guidelines for the management of this rare subtype of MM.
