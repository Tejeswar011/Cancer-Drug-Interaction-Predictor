Despite the advances in GCE, the cost of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) remains one of the major obstacles for large-scale production. In situ biosynthesis of ncAAs from commercial precursors offers a promising solution to this challenge, yet only a few biosynthetic pathways have been reported. Here, we present a platform that couples the biosynthesis of aromatic ncAAs with genetic code expansion in E. coli Genetic code expansion (GCE) has expanded protein functionality, but the cost of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) hinder large-scale use. Here, the authors coupled amino acid biosynthesis with GCE in E. coli for the production of ncAA-containing biomolecules.

While the chemical space and functionality of natural proteins are constrained by the diversity of these amino acids, their properties can be expanded and modified through posttranslational modifications. Site-specific incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) via genetic code expansion (GCE) enables the production of proteins with enhanced or novel properties 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 To date, over 300 ncAAs with diverse functional groups have been successfully utilized in GCE, and this number continues to grow 12 13 L α 14 α 15 β α α 16 17 18 19 20 Escherichia coli 21 22 While significant progress has been made in many aspects of GCE technology, particularly in the engineering of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) to improve the incorporation of ncAAs, the supply of ncAAs remains a major challenge. This issue is often referred to as “the Achilles’ heel” of GCE technology, hindering the development of large-scale commercial applications 23 1a 24 25 b1 26 O L 24 27 b4 28 O b3 29 30 b2 31 1b Fig. 1 E. coli a https://BioRender.com/cf6rx1z b c d E. coli L E. coli https://BioRender.com/9aei6t2 In contrast, semisynthesis of ncAAs offers more efficient and versatile solutions for providing ncAAs with various structures for incorporation into proteins (Fig. 1c c3 D ε L 32 L c2 33 S L 34 S L c1 35 E. coli α 36 37 Thermus thermophilus E. coli Mm Pyl CUA α In this work, we aimed to develop a generic in vivo biosynthetic pathway and construct a semiautonomous E. coli Based on these principles, we report here a general approach that couples the biosynthesis of aromatic ncAAs with GCE for the efficient production of site-specifically modified recombinant proteins in E. coli 1d E. coli E. coli Results Design of the biosynthetic pathway We designed two biosynthetic pathways for the synthesis of ncAAs, one pathway starting from aryl propionic acids (path 1), one from aryl aldehydes (path 2) (Supplementary Fig. 1 α α α L 38 39 2a E. coli 2b To avoid these two problems, we considered pathway 2 (Fig. 1d L L α 40 E. coli k cat K m −1 −1 41 42 Initial demonstration with p We began our experiments by assessing the activity of the pathway in vitro.

For this purpose, we first produced several ncAAs not commercially available using E. coli 9 10 With both commercial and in-house synthesized ncAA standards available, we systematically assessed the versatility of the biosynthetic pathway using lyophilized E. coli 3a 11 Fig. 3 Biosynthetic efficiency of ncAAs from aromatic aldehyde precursors in culture by E. coli a b E. coli n b We then proceeded to test the aldehyde substrates for ncAA synthesis in E. coli 12 E. coli Cellulosilyticum 3b We found that substituents at the meta- 6 16 para 17 32 ortho 1 5 34 40 13, 16, 23, 26, 28 32 21 To investigate the stereochemical preferences and reaction rates of the pathway enzymes, we performed detailed kinetic analyses of PpLTA, CsLTA, and RpTD using para k cat K m −1 −1 −1 −1 2S 3 R p 13 k cat K m 2S 3S −1 −1 −1 −1 2S 3 R k cat K m −1 −1 14 2S 3S k cat K m −1 −1 2S 3S To identify the native aminotransferase responsible for the final step of ncAA biosynthesis, we assayed the activity of purified E. coli 41 45 46 15 Next, we investigated the rate-limiting step for substrates that exhibited low conversion in the culture. UPLC analysis, using substrate and intermediate standards, revealed that the transaminase was responsible for the low conversions of ortho α 16 para α 17 Streamlined production of sfGFP coupling biosynthesis pathway with various OTS We next aimed to evaluate the general compatibility of ncAA production with different OTSs.

Macrocyclic peptides, which possess unique pharmacological properties distinct from other well-established therapeutic molecular classes, have garnered significant attention from the scientific community in recent years 58 59 60 To achieve this, we combined our platform for ribosomal ncAA incorporation with SICLOPPS to create unnatural cyclic peptides (Fig. 5 Npu 21 22 5b 23 Fig. 5 The ncAAs biosynthetic pathway applied for intracellular synthesis of peptide macrocycles. a Npu 2b Mj 4a b Tyr CUA c Tyr CUA d Tyr CUA e Tyr CUA 2 b e Biosynthesis of antibody fragments with ncAAs in E. coli We next explored the feasibility of coupling this biosynthetic pathway with the production of antibody fragments incorporating ncAAs. To this end, we established a platform for the recombinant expression of three antibody fragments: an anti-HER2 single-chain fragment variable (scFv) 61 35 62 p The antibody mutants were recombinantly expressed in E. coli 6a p −1 −1 −1 6b 3 −1 −1 −1 −1 Fig. 6 The ncAAs biosynthetic pathway applied for intracellular synthesis of antibody fragments. a Tyr 5a b c 25 d 35 b To confirm the bioactivity of the engineered antibody fragments, we site-specifically conjugated anti-HER2-Fab-A121pAzF with the fluorescent probe AF488-DBCO (Supplementary Fig. 24 6d Discussion Aromatic amino acids, including phenylalanine derivatives, are among the most commonly used ncAAs in GCE technology for a variety of applications. While many aromatic amino acids are commercially available or can be synthesized, the high cost and limited availability of these compounds remain significant barriers to the widespread application of GCE technology. The biosynthetic pathway and platform we present here offer a practical solution to this challenge. The key advantage is that the cost of the starting materials, aryl aldehydes, the precursors in the pathway, is orders of magnitude lower than that of the corresponding ncAAs, while the productivity of proteins and peptides is comparable to or even higher than when using ncAAs. Additionally, the aldehyde substrates can easily penetrate the cell membrane, overcoming the permeability issues typically associated with ncAAs. Although the current biosynthetic pathway does not yet achieve high titers of all ncAAs for efficient GCE, its broad applicability provides a strong foundation for future engineering and optimization efforts to improve production efficiency. Looking ahead, several research directions are worth pursuing. First, optimizing the biosynthetic pathway to efficiently produce a wider range of ncAAs, including both aromatic and aliphatic types, tailored to specific applications, should be a priority. Secondly, aldehydes are not ideal materials due to their reactivity and toxicity. To address this, extending the biosynthetic pathway using enzymes such as transaminase, alcohol dehydrogenase, or carboxylic acid reductases could provide a consistently low concentration of aldehyde from their corresponding precursors, amines, alcohols, or carboxylic acids. Third, exploring the simultaneous synthesis of multiple ncAAs, followed by the integration of several orthogonal translation systems, such as quadruplet codons, within a single cell, would be highly valuable. Finally, it would be worthwhile to evaluate the feasibility of assembling and implementing this coupled system in eukaryotic organisms, such as Pichia pastoris In this work, we integrate the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids with genetic code expansion in E. coli Methods Strains and chemicals Genes were codon-optimized, synthesized, and cloned into pET28a or pET22b expression plasmids by Genewiz.

Strain culture and sfGFP expression were carried out according to the previously described methods. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl) and lysed using a high-pressure homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C, 18,000 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatant was passed through a Ni-NTA agarose purification column pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of washing buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole), and the protein was eluted with 5 column volumes of elution buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole) to obtain the target sfGFP. The protein solution containing high concentrations of imidazole was dialyzed against dialysis buffer (50 mM Na₂HPO₄, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl). After dialysis, the protein solution was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The identities of the purified proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS).
