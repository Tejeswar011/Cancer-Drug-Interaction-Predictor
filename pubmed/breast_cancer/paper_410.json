HOXB7, a member of the HOX gene family, is aberrantly expressed in various tumors, but its role in BC remains unclear. Methods HOXB7 expression in BC was analyzed using public databases (GEPIA, UALCAN) and validated by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray of 36 BC patients. In vitro in vivo Results HOXB7 was significantly upregulated in BC tissues and cell lines, correlating with advanced tumor stage and poor overall survival. HOXB7 silencing inhibited BC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT, while promoting apoptosis. Conversely, HOXB7 overexpression produced the opposite effects. Mechanistically, HOXB7 activated the H-Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway, as indicated by increased phosphorylation of MEK and ERK. These effects were reversed by pharmacological inhibition or activation of ERK signaling. In vivo Conclusion This study provides the first comprehensive experimental evidence that HOXB7 drives BC progression via activation of the H-Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway. These findings highlight HOXB7 as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in BC. Furthermore, our results lay the foundation for future investigations into the broader molecular and immunological networks modulated by HOXB7 in BC. bladder cancer HOXB7 epithelial-mesenchymal transition MEK/ERK signaling pathway tumor progression The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

These findings establish HOXB7 as both a prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target, paving the way for more precise treatments in BC management. Materials and methods Human specimens Paired cancerous and adjacent normal tissue (ANT) samples from 36 patients with bladder urothelial carcinoma were obtained from a commercially available paraffin-embedded tissue microarray provided by Shanghai Weiao Biotechnology Co., Ltd. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) histopathological confirmation of bladder urothelial carcinoma; (ii) availability of matched tumor and ANT samples; (iii) no history of neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy to minimize the risk of treatment-related molecular alterations; and (iv) complete clinical data, including age, sex, tumor stage, pathological grade, and survival information. Patients with other malignancies or incomplete clinical records were excluded. Based on HOXB7 expression levels, the patients were classified into a high-expression group (HOXB7-high) and a low-expression group (HOXB7-low). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was performed to compare the overall survival between the two groups, and differences were assessed using the log-rank test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The 95% confidence intervals were shown by shaded areas in the survival curves. All statistical analyses and visualizations were carried out using R software (version 4.1.3) with the “survival” and “survminer” packages. Immunohistochemistry The paraffin sections were baked at 59˚C for 60 min, deparaffinized in xylene (three times, 10 min each), and dehydrated in anhydrous ethanol (three times, 10 min each). After immersion in distilled water and rinsing with running water for 10–15 min, slides were incubated in 3% H 2 2 3 Databases Gene Expression Profile Interactive Analysis (GEPIA; http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/ 2 http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/  Bioinformatics analysis of the DEGs and signaling pathway. 2 P 2 P Cell culture The human BC cell lines 5637 (CL-0002) and T24 (CL-0227) and the urothelial cell line SV-HUC-1 (CL-0222) were obtained from Procell Life Science & Technology Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China). The human BC cell lines TCCSUP (cat. no. CBP60752) and J82 (cat. no. CBP60311) were purchased from Nanjing Cobioer Biosciences Co., Ltd. The T24, 5637, and J82 cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium (Biological Industries), RPMI 1640 medium, and MEM, respectively, each supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The TCCSUP cells were cultured in MEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% non-essential amino acids, and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. The SV-HUC-1 cells were cultured in Ham’s F-12K medium with 10% FBS. All cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 Transient transfection experiments The siRNA sequences targeting HOXB7 mRNA and si-NC as negative control were synthesized by Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. The sequences were as follows: si-HOXB7#1 forward, 5’-GAGAGUAACUUCCGGAUCUTT-3’ and reverse, 5’−AGAUCCGGAAGUUACUCUCTT−3’; si-HOXB7#2 forward, 5’-CGGAAAGACAGAUCAAGAUTT-3’ and reverse, 5’−AUCUUGAUCUGUCUUUCCGTT− 3’; si-HOXB7#3 forward, 5’-CGAGAGTAACTTCCGGATCTA-3’ and si-NC forward, 5’-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3’ and reverse, 5’-ACGUGACACGUUCGGAGAATT-3’. si-HOXB7 and si-NC were transfected into 5637 cells using Lipofectamine 3000 (cat. no. L3000-015, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After a 4-h transfection period, the cells were cultured in normal medium for 48 h. Subsequently, the cells were harvested for further experiments. The siRNA achieving the highest knockdown efficiency was selected for subsequent functional assays in the 5637 cells. HOXB7 overexpression was achieved using the CV702 plasmid (Shanghai GenePharma, Co., Ltd.). T24 cells were cultured in a 6-well plate and transfected with 5 μg HOXB7 overexpression plasmid or empty vector using Lipofectamine 3000 when confluence reached 70-90%. After 48 h of transfection, reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)-PCR and western blot analyses were performed to evaluate transfection efficiency. Given the differential expression of HOXB7 between 5637 and T24 cells, HOXB7 expression was knocked down in 5637 cells (which exhibit high baseline HOXB7 expression) and overexpressed HOXB7 in T24 cells (which exhibit low baseline HOXB7 expression) to investigate its functional role. A similar approach was previously used to study the functional effects in BC cells ( 14 Lentiviral vector construction Lentiviral vectors encoding a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) for the knockdown of HOXB7 and a scramble shRNA control were provided by Shanghai GenePharma Co., Ltd. The transfection process followed the established protocols. To establish a stably transfected cell line, the transfected cells were cultured in media supplemented with 5 µg/ml puromycin. RT-qPCR was used to assess the mRNA expression levels 72 hours after infection. RT-qPCR Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol ® ® GAPDH forward, 5’-CAGGAGGCATTGCTGATGAT-3’ and reverse, 5’-GAAGGCTGGGGCTCATTT-3’; and HOXB7 forward, 5’-CGAGAGTAACTTCCGGATCTAC-3’ and reverse, 5’-GGTCTTGTTCTCCTTTTTCCAC-3’. The qPCR thermocycling conditions were 40 cycles of 25°C for 5 sec, 55°C for 15 sec, and 85°C for 5 sec. Each sample was measured in triplicate to ensure reliability. Gene expression levels in the cells were normalized relative to GAPDH expression using the 2 −ΔΔCq CCK8 assay A total of 4x10 3 EdU staining assay The Cell-Light™ EdU Apollo643 In Vitro 3 Wound healing assay A linear wound was created in a cell monolayer using a 1-ml sterile plastic pipette tip when the transfected cells had reached ~95% confluence in a 6-well plate. The cells were cultured in a media containing 2% FBS. Images of the wound area were captured using a microscope (BX53, Olympus Corporation) at 0, 24, and 48 h after wounding to monitor the rate of cell migration into the wound space. Colony forming assay Transfected cells (500 cells/well) were seeded into a 6-well plate and complete media was added to each well to a final volume of 2 ml. The cells were cultured in a cell incubator, and the medium was refreshed every 3 days to maintain optimal growth conditions. After 2 weeks, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. Visible colonies were counted and imaged to assess the efficiency of the transfection and the proliferative capacity of the cells. Transwell assay For the migration assay, 2x10 4 For the invasion assay, Matrigel (cat. no. 356234, Corning Inc) was used to precoat the upper chamber for 24 h. Subsequently, 4x10 4 After 24 or 48 h of incubation, the cells on the upper layers of upper chamber membranes were gently removed using a cotton swab. The cells that had migrated or invaded the lower surface of the membrane were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min, followed by staining with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min at room temperature. The number of cells was quantified in four randomly selected fields of view using a light microscope at x100 magnification. Flow cytometry assay for detecting cell apoptosis Cells were harvested and resuspended in 500 µl binding buffer. Subsequently, the cells were stained using an Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol (cat. no. KGA108, Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.). Staining was performed in the dark for 15 min. After staining, the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using a BD FACS Canto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences.). Western blotting assay Cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (cat. no. P1045, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology). Protein concentrations were measured using a BCA protein assay kit (cat. no. P0010, Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology). Equal quantities of protein were mixed with SDS buffer, denatured, and prepared for gel electrophoresis. Sample were resolved on 6-15% SDS gels and resolved using SDS-PAGE (cat. on.

Western blotting and RT-qPCR confirmed efficient knockdown and overexpression of HOXB7, respectively (  Figures 2A, B  Figures 2C, D  Figure 2E  Figure 2F  Figure 2G Figure 2 HOXB7 promotes BC cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis.

HOXB7 promotes migration and invasion in BC cell lines and modulates the expression of EMT markers EMT is a key process involved in cancer metastasis. To evaluate the role of HOXB7 in BC cell migration, wound healing assays were performed. Knockdown of HOXB7 significantly reduced the migratory ability of 5637 cells, while overexpression of HOXB7 enhanced migration in T24 cells (  Figures 3A, C  Figures 3B, D  Figures 3E, F Figure 3 HOXB7 promotes EMT and enhances migration and invasion in BC cells.

Statistical significance is indicated by asterisks. HOXB7 increases MAPK/MEK/ERK signaling To elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of HOXB7 in the occurrence and development of BC, patients with BC were stratified into high- and low- HOXB7 expression groups using data from the TCGA. The analysis revealed a significant difference in gene expression patterns between the two groups (  Figure 4A  Figure 4B  Figure 4C  Figure 4C  Figure 4D  Figure 4E Figure 4 HOXB7 regulates the MAPK signaling pathway in BC.

Confirmation of the role of MAPK/MEK/ERK signaling in the HOXB7-mediated effects To investigate whether the Ras/ERK signaling pathway mediates the functional effects of HOXB7 in BC cells, the ERK1/2-specific activator Ro67–7476 and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 were used for rescue experiments in 5637 and T24 cells. CCK-8 assays demonstrated that the proliferation-inhibitory effect of HOXB7 knockdown in 5637 cells was partially reversed by Ro67–7476 treatment (1 μM, 24 h), while the proliferation-enhancing effect of HOXB7 overexpression in T24 cells was suppressed by PD98059 (10 μM, 24 h) (  Figure 5A  Figure 5B  Figure 5C  Figure 5D  Figure 5E Figure 5 HOXB7 promotes BC progression via activation of the H-Ras/RAF1/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.

Discussion Recurrence and progression remain major challenges in treating BC ( 15 As a key member of the HOX gene family, HOXB7 expression is upregulated in various malignant tumors and is associated with advanced-stage cancer, metastasis, tumor proliferation, and poor patient survival. HOXB7 upregulation has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma ( 16 17 18 19 20 16 21 22 16 23 24 The RAS protein family, known for its role in cell signaling, can influence cell death, proliferation, and metabolic stress responses through the Raf-1/MEK/ERK and Rac1/MKK7/JNK pathways, which in turn modulate tumor progression ( 25 HOXB7 has been shown to enhance the proliferation and metastasis of liver cancer cells by activating the MAPK/ERK pathway ( 26 27 28 29 Interestingly, additional research indicated that HOXB7 exhibited effects beyond its oncogenic role in tumors. Chen et al. ( 30 24 31 The present study systematically demonstrated that HOXB7 promotes BC progression by enhancing cell proliferation and EMT, while inhibiting apoptosis through activation of the H-Ras/Raf-1/MEK/ERK signaling pathway, as validated in both in vitro in vivo From a translational perspective, our findings establish HOXB7 as both a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target in BC. HOXB7 can be targeted indirectly via MEK/ERK inhibition or more directly through HOX/PBX interaction inhibitors such as HXR9, which has shown preclinical anti-tumor efficacy in other HOX-driven cancers ( 32 33 35 This study has several limitations. First, the 5637–T24 cell line model was selected for their contrasting endogenous HOXB7 expression, enabling us to assess both gain- and loss-of-function within a well-established, literature-supported system for bladder cancer. While additional aggressive lines such as J82 or TCCSUP could offer complementary perspectives, our results were consistent across both lines, and this model has been widely used to represent distinct biological states of the disease. Second, our primary focus was to elucidate HOXB7’s biological functions and H-Ras/ERK–mediated mechanisms; although the tumor immune microenvironment was not examined, it remains an important future direction to clarify whether HOXB7-driven ERK activation contributes to immune modulation. Third, potential off-target effects are a well-recognized consideration in RNA interference experiments. we minimized such effects by using multiple independent, sequence-validated constructs, confirming knockdown at both mRNA and protein levels, and observing consistent phenotypic outcomes across assays. Finally, while larger independent patient cohorts were not available, our well-characterized cohort with complete follow-up provided statistically robust associations between HOXB7 expression and pathological parameters, supporting the reliability of our conclusions. Future multicenter studies with larger cohorts are warranted to confirm these findings. In conclusion, this study provides comprehensive experimental evidence highlighting the pivotal role of HOXB7 in BC progression via modulation of the H-Ras/ERK pathway. These insights offer promising directions for the development of targeted therapies aimed at improving clinical outcomes for patients with BC and potentially other malignancies driven by similar molecular mechanisms.
