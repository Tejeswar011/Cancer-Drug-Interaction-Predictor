AbstractThis study, expanding upon previous findings in the MMTV-PyMT model, investigated four independent mouse models, representing luminal (MMTV-PyMT, MMTV-Myc), HER2-amplified (MMTV-Her2) and triple negative (C3(1)TAg) breast cancer subtypes. Consistent with previous results, limited evidence for metastasis-associated somatic point mutations was found for all models. We also found that oncogenic drivers significantly influenced the number and size of metastasis-specific copy number variations (MSCNVs), but common driver-independent MSCNVs were rare. Furthermore, analyzing a cohort with varying genetic backgrounds while maintaining a constant oncogenic driver (PyMT) revealed that genetic background profoundly impacts MSCNVs. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that oncogenic drivers strongly shaped metastasis-specific gene expression (MSGE), with each driver exhibiting distinct expression profiles. In contrast, MSGE in the PyMT-F1 cohort was more variable across strains. Despite the diversity of MSCNV and MSGE, functional analysis revealed that both mechanisms converge on the modulation of key cellular processes, including immune responses, metabolism, and extracellular matrix interactions. These findings emphasize the complex interplay between oncogenic drivers and genetic background in shaping the genomic and transcriptional landscapes of metastatic lesions. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version yes pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint yes pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
