In China, structured frameworks for clinical value assessment are underutilized despite improved access to negotiated medicines. Once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) were selected as a representative case for their reimbursement status and clinical and economic relevance. This study applied a quantitative mini-health (mini-HTA) technology assessment to support rational drug selection. 1 Methods A structured, three-stage methodology was employed to evaluate four once-weekly GLP-1 RAs. First, a weighted scoring system was established for five dimensions—pharmaceutical properties, effectiveness, safety, economy, and other considerations—based on expert consensus using the Quantitative Record Form for Drug Evaluation and Selection in Medical Institutions. Second, evidence for each dimension was systematically collected using a PICO-based search strategy across guideline databases, literature sources, and official documents. Third, each drug was quantitatively scored in each dimension according to predefined criteria and expert-assigned weights; the total scores were used to classify drugs into recommendation levels (“strongly recommended,” “weakly recommended,” or “not recommended”) to guide evidence-based selection in medical institutions. Results Semaglutide (77.8) and dulaglutide (76.3) achieved the highest totals, driven by superior HbA1c reduction and proven cardiovascular benefit, and were strongly recommended. Exenatide microspheres scored 70.2, mainly owing to favourable acquisition cost, and was also strongly recommended. PEG loxenatide scored 62.9, limited by narrower reimbursement coverage and lower international uptake, and received a weak recommendation. Safety profiles were comparable across agents. Conclusion The study demonstrates that a structured, expert-informed mini-HTA framework can be feasibly applied for quantitative evaluation and selection of once-weekly GLP-1 RAs in Chinese medical institutions. Key differentiators among agents were efficacy (notably cardiovascular benefit) and economic/policy factors, while safety differences were minimal. This replicable approach improves transparency, consistency, and evidence-based decision-making in clinical pharmacy and institutional formulary management. selection evaluation digital evaluation national health insurance negotiated medicines once-weekly GLP-1 RAs mini HTA The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Drugs Outcomes Research and Policies 1 Introduction The global healthcare landscape continues to grapple with persistent challenges in the evaluation and selection of medicines. Delivering the appropriate medicine to the right patient requires assessing factors influencing individual drug responses. In this context, the Chinese government has undertaken significant efforts to improve the accessibility and affordability of negotiated medicines (innovative drugs that have been added to the National Reimbursement Drug List in China through formal price negotiations with the National Healthcare Security Administration, thereby improving their affordability and accessibility). A notable initiative is the issuance of the Circular on Further Regulating the Use of Negotiated Drugs Circular of the General Office of the National Health Commission on Standardizing the Work of Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation of Medicines World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines World Health Organization Model List of Essential Medicines In China, the growing focus on drug selection and evaluation in certain provinces and cities has underscored the urgent need for medical institutions to develop comprehensive and quantifiable drug selection and evaluation systems. In April 2023, a revised guideline titled A Quick Guideline for Drug Evaluation and Selection in Chinese Medical Institutions (Second Edition) Quantitative Record Form for Drug Evaluation and Selection in Medical Institutions Figure 1 Martelli et al., 2016 Wong-Rieger et al., 2025 FIGURE 1 The overall drug evaluation system. Diagram titled \"A Mini-HTA of Drug Evaluation and Selection in Medical Institutions\" divides evaluation into five categories: Pharmaceutical properties (28 points), Effectiveness (27 points), Safety (25 points), Economy (10 points), and Other considerations (10 points). Each category includes specific criteria with assigned points. Arrows connect categories, indicating interrelationships. China currently has the highest number of individuals with diabetes globally ( Zhoa et al., 2023 Author anonymous, 2021 Linong et al., 2018 American Diabetes Association, 2022 Despite these advancements, there remains a significant lack of comprehensive studies utilizing the well-structured quantitative record form to appraise the clinical value of once-weekly GLP-1 RAs. This gap in evidence limits the ability of medical institutions to make fully informed decisions regarding drug selection. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating the clinical value of once-weekly GLP-1 RAs using the quantitative record form. By detailing the implementation process, this study seeks to contribute to the broader goals of improving drug selection, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing patient care in diabetes management within China. Furthermore, it aspires to offer insights and methodologies that could be adapted globally to improve drug evaluation and selection processes. The results of the study have implications for addressing global healthcare challenges. Specifically, the implementation of small healthcare assessment frameworks and quantitative record sheets may serve as effective models for other countries, particularly those experiencing similar healthcare constraints. Furthermore, the adoption of structured drug evaluation approaches can help to address issues related to the affordability and accessibility of medicines in low- and middle-income countries. 2 Methods This study employs a structured, three-stage methodology comprising the evaluation system, evidence collection, and comprehensive analysis and decision-making stages. The initial stage uses a well-defined evaluation system to categorize and assess the drugs under investigation. In the second stage, a rigorous evidence collection process is conducted, during which relevant literature and data are gathered and analyzed to inform the evaluation. In the final stage, evidence is interpreted, scores are assigned to the drugs, and recommendations are made regarding their inclusion in medical institutions. 2.1 Evaluation system stage This study is based on the Quantitative Record Form for Drug Evaluation and Selection in Medical Institutions Figure 1 A Quick Guideline for Drug Evaluation and Selection in Chinese Medical Institutions Second Edition the Guideline Martelli et al., 2016 Mannucci et al., 2020 Marsico et al., 2020 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 FIGURE 2 The “pharmaceutical properties” evaluation. Mind map detailing pharmaceutical properties. Central node is \"Pharmaceutical properties\" with branches for: Pharmacy and usage, covering ingredients, packaging, dosage, administration frequency, and ease of use; Pharmacological action, showing varying levels of efficacy and mechanism clarity; Storage conditions, listing temperature and light requirements; In vivo processes, relating to pharmacokinetic parameters; Shelf life, specifying storage durations. Each branch has sub-nodes indicating specific details or requirements, like dosage form and self-administration. FIGURE 3 The “effectiveness” evaluation system. Flowchart titled \"Effectiveness\" categorized into three sections: 1. Indications (green) with three levels: essential clinical need, moderate clinical need, and multiple drug options.2. Guideline recommendations (yellow) with twelve items including diagnosis standards, various guideline classes with different evidence levels, expert consensus, and systematic review.3. Clinical efficacy (blue) with two scores: based on primary and secondary endpoints. FIGURE 4 The “safety” evaluation system.

On the left, a red box labeled \"$4 Economy\" connects to two paths. The top path, labeled \"Drugs with the same generic name (3),\" calculates an evaluation score as three times the minimum daily treatment cost divided by the daily treatment cost of the evaluated drug. The bottom path, labeled \"Drugs with the same indications (7),\" calculates an evaluation score as seven times the same ratio. Paths are color-coded with yellow and blue lines. FIGURE 6 The “others considerations” evaluation system. Mind map illustrating considerations for medicine classification, including Chinese health insurance status, essential medicine status, centralized procurement, original versus generic medicines, manufacturer status, and global use. Various numbered branches detail conditions for each category, such as insurance directory listing and manufacturer rankings. The assignment of weights for each evaluation dimension was accomplished using the Delphi method through anonymous online voting via the Wenjuanxing online platform. A total of 76 participants, including members from the steering (n = 18) and expert panels (n = 58) with multidisciplinary backgrounds in pharmacy, clinical medicine, health policy, and pharmacoeconomics, contributed to the process. Additionally, an external review group of 20 experts (comprising pharmacists, representatives from medical insurance offices, social security bureaus, academic associations, and schools of pharmacy) provided Supplementary Input and independent assessment. During the Delphi process, participants anonymously rated and assigned weights to each evaluation indicator. Two rounds of online discussions—including both the expert panel and the external review group—were held to discuss and refine the rationality and appropriateness of the indicators and their assigned weights. Consensus was defined as at least 75% agreement among participants for each item, in line with commonly accepted standards in Delphi methodology ( Barrios et al., 2021 Figures 1 6 Final weights were calculated using a normalized scoring approach to ensure the sum of all weights equaled 100 points, according to the following formula: W = ∑ i = 1 k W i k where k k The weights for each dimension were calculated using a normalized scoring approach. Specifically, the sum of the individual weightings was normalized to ensure the total score sums to 100 points. The formula for calculating index weight is as follows: Weight = Raw Weight of Dimension / Sum of All Weights × 100 The weights of the five evaluation indicators were illustrated in Table 1 TABLE 1 The weights of the five evaluation indicators.

Selected keywords included “semaglutide”, “dulaglutide”, “exenatide microspheres”, “PEG loxenatide”, “GLP-1 RA”, and “glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist”. 2.2.2 Scope of search (1) Guideline databases: US National Clinical Guidelines Database, International Guidelines Collaboration Network, Trip Guideline Database, and the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. (2) English and Chinese literature databases: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Embase, Wanfang Database, VIP Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Chinese Journal Full Text Database. (3) Official websites: Portals of international and national health administrations, drug regulatory authorities, and relevant industry associations. (4) Drug instructions: Official documentation provided by pharmaceutical manufacturers. 2.2.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria The inclusion and exclusion criteria were established to ensure the selection of high-quality and relevant literature. Regarding pharmaceutical properties, studies addressing pharmacological action, in vivo 2.2.4 Other data sources To supplement the search, additional data were gathered from various sources. Drug prices were obtained from the Hebei Provincial Medical Institutions Drug Trading and Purchasing Platform, while information on medical insurance attributes was referenced from the National Drug Catalog for Basic Medical Insurance, Work Injury Insurance, and Maternity Insurance (2024 edition). Data on essential drug properties were derived from the National Essential Drugs Catalog (2018 edition). Global utilization data were collected from PharmaSmart.com and the websites of drug administration departments in various countries. Corporate credibility assessments were based on information from the Pharm Exec (2024 edition), as shown in Figure 7 FIGURE 7 Selection and evaluation implementation roadmap. Flowchart illustrating a process divided into two main stages. The first stage, \"Evidence collection stage,\" includes \"Quantitative evaluation system\" leading to \"Using evidence query tools\" and then \"Searching for target evidence.\" The second stage, \"Comprehensive analysis and decision-making stage,\" includes \"Evaluation by item\" followed by \"Guiding pharmaceutical decision-making based on evaluation results.\" 2.3 Comprehensive analysis and decision-making stage The evidence collected during the previous stage was systematically organized in alignment with the indicators defined in the evaluation system. Each of the four once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) was assigned a score for each indicator based on evidence-based data. To ensure fairness and scientific rigor, the scoring process was conducted in multiple rounds. In the first round, two clinical pharmacists with relevant expertise independently evaluated each drug according to the five established dimensions and assigned initial scores. In the second round, a multidisciplinary expert panel—including the director of the pharmacy department, 35 pharmacists, 3 physicians, and 3 nurses—reviewed and discussed the initial scores and the supporting evidence. Based on the panel’s discussion, the scores were revised to reflect group consensus. Finally, a further discussion was held to confirm and finalize the scores for each drug. These individual scores were then aggregated to calculate total scores for the four GLP-1 RAs, which served as the basis for pharmaceutical decision-making. Recommendations for new drug inclusion were divided into three groups based on total scores. Specifically, the categorization thresholds were directly adopted from the Guideline Zhao et al., 2023 Total Score = Score for Pharmaceutical Properties × Weight for Pharmaceutical Properties + Score for Effectiveness × Weight for Effectiveness + … This aggregation method ensured that the final score appropriately reflected the relative importance of each dimension. 3 Results 3.1 Pharmacological properties of GLP-1RAs action The GLP-1 RAs exert antihyperglycemic effects by enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion ( Zhao et al., 2020 Manandhar and Ahn, 2015 Lund et al., 2014 Lau et al., 2015 Figure 8 FIGURE 8 Comparison of the molecular structure of once-weekly GLP-1 RAs. Flowchart depicting the structural classification of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Two main branches: \"Based on GLP-1 structure\" and \"Based on Exendin-4 structure.\" The GLP-1 branch includes Semaglutide (94% homology) and Dulaglutide (90% homology). The Exendin-4 branch includes Once-weekly Exenatide (53% homology) and PEG Loxenatide (low homology). Each section lists the amino acid sequences, highlighting differences in red and structural modifications. As depicted in the molecular structure formula, semaglutide has the smallest molecular formula among weekly GLP-1 RA preparations, with a molecular weight of 4.1 kDa. This smaller molecular size facilitates in vivo Lund et al., 2014 Zhao et al., 2020 3.1.1 In vivo Studies have shown a direct correlation between half-life duration and fluctuations in drug concentration during the same dosing interval ( Kapitza et al., 2015 Pradhan et al., 2020 Table 2 TABLE 2 Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters of four GLP-1 RAs.

Specification and packaging: Semaglutide, dulaglutide, and PEG loxenatide are available in both larger and smaller specifications, while exenatide microspheres are limited to a fixed specification. All drugs meet packaging requirements, with each receiving a score of 2. 3. Dosage form: All four drugs are administered via subcutaneous injection, earning a score of 1.5. 4. Dosage: Semaglutide, dulaglutide, and PEG loxenatide allow for dosage adjustments based on blood glucose levels, meriting a score of 1.5 each. Exenatide microspheres, with its fixed dosage, receives a score of 2. 5. Frequency of medication administration: All drugs are recommended for once-weekly subcutaneous injection at any time of day, earning a score of 2 each. 6. Ease of use: After physician instruction, all four GLP-1 RAs can be self-administered at home, demonstrating ease of use. Each drug is allocated a score of 1.5. The pharmacy and usage indicators for semaglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide microspheres, and PEG loxenatide are summarized in Table 3 TABLE 3 Summary of pharmacy and usage of four GLP-1 RAs.

Semaglutide and exenatide microspheres have a shelf life of 36 months, meriting a score of 1.5, while dulaglutide and PEG loxenatide have a shelf life of 24 months, earning a score of 1. The final scores for pharmaceutical characteristics are as follows: semaglutide (23), dulaglutide (19.5), exenatide microspheres (20.5), and PEG loxenatide (19.5). Semaglutide’s superior pharmacological and pharmacokinetic properties earn it the highest score in this category. 3.2 Effectiveness of GLP-1RAs 3.2.1 Indications All four weekly GLP-1 RAs preparations can be used in combination with metformin or sulfonylureas to achieve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Loxenatide is approved in China as a monotherapy for glycemic control in T2DM patients. Notably, dulaglutide and semaglutide have received approval for reducing the risk of major cardiovascular adverse events in adults with T2DM and cardiovascular disease, underscoring their cardiovascular benefits. The 2024 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Diabetes Standards recommend that adults with T2DM who are at high risk for or already have atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure, and/or chronic kidney disease should receive treatment plans incorporating sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) and/or GLP-1 RAs. These agents provide glycemic control while reducing cardiovascular and renal risks. GLP-1 RAs with proven cardiovascular and renal benefits, such as semaglutide and dulaglutide, are prioritized for these indications, each earning a score of 5. Other GLP-1 RAs, which serve as secondary options for clinical needs, are assigned a score of 3. 3.2.2 Guideline recommendations As the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise, treatment guidelines are consistently updated to reflect emerging evidence. GLP-1 RAs, as innovative hypoglycemic agents, increasingly feature in diabetes management guidelines. The 2024 ADA guidelines recommend GLP-1 RAs as the preferred first-line injectable agents for patients with T2DM and ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk factors, replacing insulin as the primary injectable glucose-lowering therapy. Cardiovascular complications remain the leading cause of disability and mortality in patients with T2DM. Since 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has mandated cardiovascular safety evaluations for new hypoglycemic agents prior to approval. Cardiovascular outcomes trials have demonstrated that GLP-1 RAs, including liraglutide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide, significantly reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events ( Marso et al., 2016a Gerstein et al., 2019 Marso et al., 2016b Bethel et al., 2018 The 2024 ADA guidelines recommend GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2is, with or without metformin depending on glycemic control needs, as initial therapeutic agents for patients with T2DM and comorbid ASCVD, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease ( American Diabetes Association, 2024 Chinese Guidelines for the Prevention and Control of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 2020 Soci and ety, 2021 Chinese Expert Consensus on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cardiovascular Disease in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus 2021 Yihong et al., 2021 3.2.3 Clinical efficacy Semaglutide (1.0 mg weekly) demonstrated a reduction in HbA1c of 1.6% in clinical trials, earning the highest score of 10. The hypoglycemic efficacy of the other agents is summarized in Table 4 TABLE 4 Comparison of hypoglycemic efficacy of GLP-1 RA monotherapy.

In the SUSTAIN-7 clinical trial, semaglutide (1.0 mg weekly) demonstrated superior hypoglycemic efficacy over dulaglutide, earning the highest score of 10. Dulaglutide received a score of 9.3, exenatide 9.6, and loxenatide 8.4. The total effectiveness scores for the four GLP-1 RAs are semaglutide (27), dulaglutide (26.3), exenatide (21.6), and loxenatide (20.4). Semaglutide demonstrated the highest overall effectiveness, driven by its superior indications, guideline recommendations, and clinical efficacy. 3.3 Adverse reactions and safety profile 3.3.1 Drug-related adverse reactions Clinical studies report no significant differences in adverse reaction incidence among GLP-1 RAs. The most reported adverse reactions are gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, which occur in over 10% of patients but are generally tolerable with prolonged treatment. When used as monotherapy, GLP-1RAs present a low risk of hypoglycemia. Moderate adverse reactions are assigned a score of 1. Serious adverse events, including pancreatitis, renal injury, cholecystitis, and venous thrombosis, have been reported in the literature; however, their incidence is less than 0.01% ( Chinese Diabetes and Chinese Diabetes Society, 2020 Ping and Jing, 2022 Sha et al., 2022 3.3.2 Special populations Children: GLP-1 RAs are not approved for use in children or adolescents under 18 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in China, resulting in a score of 0. Elderly: Phase III clinical trials and meta-analyses have confirmed the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RAs in individuals aged ≥65 years ( Bode et al., 2011 Boustani et al., 2016 Pregnant and Lactating Women: Exenatide may be considered during pregnancy if the potential benefits to the fetus outweigh the risks, earning a score of 0.3. The use of GLP-1 RAs in lactating women is recommended with caution, earning a score of 0.5. Other GLP-1 RAs lack clinical studies in pregnant women, have an unknown safety profile, and are not recommended. These agents are assigned a score of 0. Animal studies have shown that some GLP-1 RAs are secreted in breast milk, and thus, their use in lactating women is not recommended. Patients with abnormal liver and kidney function: In patients with hepatic and renal dysfunction, dose adjustments and corresponding scores for GLP-1 RAs are summarized in Table 5 TABLE 5 Dose adjustment and scoring in patients with hepatic and renal dysfunction for GLP-1 RA.

While the risk of hypoglycemia is low when used alone, the risk increases when combined with sulfonylureas or insulin. Additionally, GLP-1 RAs may interfere with the absorption of oral medications due to delayed gastric emptying. When combined with warfarin, more frequent monitoring of the international normalized ratio is recommended, earning a score of 3. 3.3.4 Other adverse effects GLP-1 RAs carry a risk of pancreatitis and thyroid cancer. The reversibility score for adverse effects is 0.8, while the carcinogenicity and teratogenicity scores are 0. The safety scores for GLP-1 RAs are as follows: semaglutide (16.7), dulaglutide (16.7), exenatide (13.6), and PEG loxenatide (12.3). 3.4 Economic evaluation of GLP-1 RAs All four GLP-1 RA drugs with the same generic name were rated with a score of 3. Exenatide had the lowest calculated daily cost (10.2 yuan) and was rated with a score of 10. Table 6 TABLE 6 GLP-1 RA economic score results.

By implementing a rigorously designed quantitative record form, we address the existing gap in comprehensive, structured evaluations of these agents in clinical practice. Our systematic approach provides robust evidence to support informed, transparent, and reproducible drug selection decisions by medical institutions. The resulting ranking—semaglutide > dulaglutide > exenatide microspheres > PEG loxenatide—aligns with established efficacy and safety profiles ( Xie et al., 2023 The results indicated minimal differences in the safety profiles of the four drugs, with the primary distinctions observed in hypoglycemic efficacy and cardiovascular benefits ( Teng et al., 2024 Petrova et al., 2024 Yanlan et al., 2022 This study introduced several methodological innovations. First, in the effectiveness evaluation, the clinical efficacy of each drug was quantitatively assessed using clinical trial data while incorporating the guideline-recommended level for each drug. Semaglutide, which exhibited the highest glucose-lowering efficacy ( Hu et al., 2023 Bindel and Seifert, 2025 The use of quantitative scoring in comprehensive drug evaluation provides a multi-dimensional assessment framework, enabling accurate scoring of selected drugs. However, the results of such evaluations are not static and may evolve in response to changing decision-making needs. Factors influencing evaluation outcomes include the variations of different drug specifications, updates to guideline consensus and evidence-based data, the emergence of new adverse reactions, fluctuations in drug prices, adjustments to national health insurance policies and the essential medicines list, implementation of national drug policies, and developments in manufacturing enterprises. Additionally, the weights assigned to various dimensions within the evaluation system are dynamically adjusted to reflect changes in national assessment indicators and the external environment. The Supplementary Data data on drug prices, insurance attributes, and corporate credibility were incorporated into the evaluation using a scoring system aligned with the other evaluation dimensions. For example, drug prices were assessed in relation to their affordability and availability within China’s healthcare system, and corporate credibility was scored based on publicly available data on manufacturer performance and regulatory compliance. In comparison to international HTA models, the Chinese quantitative scoring model exhibits several distinct features. For example, the United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) emphasizes cost-utility analysis through incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), but offers limited flexibility in dynamically adjusting assessment weights ( Thokala et al., 2020 Büsch et al., 2022 Binder et al., 2022 Shiroiwa, 2020 To maintain the relevance and accuracy of drug evaluations, medical institutions should update evaluation results regularly and dynamically. They should also work toward establishing drug selection evaluation standards and operational guidelines tailored to their specific organizational needs. Incorporating these standards into pharmacy practice will enhance objectivity and accuracy in decision-making processes related to drug selection. By adopting such practices, institutions can provide decision-makers with reliable tools to make informed choices regarding drug selection and management ( Janknegt et al., 1996 Shi et al., 2020 Chaojun et al., 2022 Shuning et al., 2021 While this framework is intentionally designed to accommodate future evidence updates and policy changes, several limitations of the present evaluation should be noted. First, this mini-HTA relied on published literature and policy documents, rather than individual-level RWD. This limitation may affect the generalizability of our findings to broader patient populations in real-world clinical practice. Secondly, potential bias introduced by a weighting process that relies on expert opinion in establishing an evaluation system. Finally, there are challenges in obtaining comprehensive cost data for economic evaluation, which in this paper only calculates the minimum daily treatment cost through DDD. Future research should incorporate individual-level RWD and further refine the weighting system to improve robustness and generalizability.
