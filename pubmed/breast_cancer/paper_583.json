Pathogenic BRCA2 mutations are implicated in a significant proportion of MBC cases and may confer increased risk for other cancers. Case presentation A 66-year-old male presented with right upper limb edema and back soreness. Imaging and biopsy confirmed stage IV invasive ductal carcinoma, Luminal B HER2-negative. Genetic testing revealed a germline BRCA2 mutation. During routine imaging, a second primary colon cancer was discovered and resected. Clinical discussion MBC represents less than 1% of all male cancers and is frequently associated with delayed diagnosis. BRCA2 mutations significantly increase the risk for male breast and gastrointestinal cancers. This patient underwent endocrine and CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy and followed by surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for the colon carcinoma. Disease remained stable on follow-up. Conclusion This case highlights the importance of genetic testing, vigilance for second primary malignancies in BRCA2 carriers, and the value of multidisciplinary care for MBC patients. The co-occurrence of these malignancies in a male BRCA2 carrier is rare and underscores the need for broader surveillance in such patients.

Family history was significant for breast cancer in two sisters and two brothers, and both parents died of unspecified cancers. Clinical findings Clinical evaluation revealed right retroareolar swelling with skin retraction. CT imaging confirmed a retroareolar mass (18 mm) with associated right axillary and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy (Fig. 1 2  Fig. 1 Contrast‑enhanced CT images of the right breast and axilla showing a retro‑areolar lesion (18 mm) and right axillary/supraclavicular lymphadenopathy  Fig. 2 Mammography (mediolateral oblique view) demonstrating an irregular retro‑areolar mass with microcalcifications and associated right axillary adenopathy Timeline  Initial presentation: right arm edema and soreness. Diagnosis: stage IV invasive ductal carcinoma. Initiation of endocrine therapy and abemaciclib. 3-month imaging: stable breast disease, discovery of colon lesion. Surgery: laparoscopic colectomy. Follow-up: stable disease, abemaciclib discontinued. Diagnostic assessment Biopsy confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma, grade III, Luminal B HER2-negative (ER+, PR+, HER2 2+, Ki67 25%). Axillary FNA showed metastatic carcinoma. Bone scan and MRI revealed osseous metastases, (ribs, vertebrae) (Fig. 3 4  Fig. 3 Sagittal spine MRI illustrating a vertebral body lesion consistent with bone metastasis  Fig. 4 Contrast-enhanced CT scan showing a left-sided colonic mass (3.2 cm) suspicious for adenocarcinoma Therapeutic interventions Initial treatment included goserelin, letrozole, abemaciclib, and denosumab. Ribociclib was contraindicated due to arrhythmia. Colon resection was performed after pausing abemaciclib perioperatively. Due to the BRCA2 mutation and high-risk colon cancer features, adjuvant chemotherapy with simplified FOLFOX4 was initiated. Abemaciclib was discontinued after 6 months, during chemotherapy, to prevent a hematologic toxicity. Hormonotherapy was continued. Follow-up and outcomes Three- and six-month evaluations showed stable disease on CT and bone scan. Bone consolidation was noted. The patient had occasional grade 1 diarrhea and fatigue but maintained good general condition and adherence to treatment. Discussion This case illustrates the complexity of managing MBC in a BRCA2 mutation carrier, particularly when complicated by metachronous colon cancer. BRCA mutations increase the risk of developing other cancer such as prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer. The association of breast cancer and colon cancer in a male patient harbor a germline mutation is unusual. BRCA2 mutations predispose patients to a spectrum of malignancies and has been associated with increased cancer risks but treatment sensitivity was not evaluated in this case [ 2 3 4 5 Patient perspective The patient expressed relief at having a diagnosis and appreciated the personalized care. He was motivated to ensure his daughter was tested for the BRCA2 mutation.
