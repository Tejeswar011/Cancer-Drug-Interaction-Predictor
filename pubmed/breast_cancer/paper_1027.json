Introduction In 2025, the American Cancer Society estimates around 67,440 incident cases of pancreatic cancer per year in the United States, leading to approximately 51,980 deaths per year [ 1 2 Post-Operative Pancreatic Fistula (POPF), following a distal/left pancreatectomy, occurs in 13% to 64% of cases [ 3 4 5 6 7 6 8 8 A systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis of studies were conducted, with the hypothesis that wrapping the pancreatic stump with a mesh would reduce the number of postoperative pancreatic fistulas (both overall and clinically relevant, as primary outcomes) compared to control groups receiving standard treatment. 2. Materials and Methods Throughout our meta-analysis, we complied with both the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and guidelines [ 9 10 2.1. Search Strategy In April 2025, we employed the PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science (Science and Social Science Citation Index), and Scopus databases to retrieve manuscripts suitable for our meta-analysis. The details of the non-MeSH/MeSH terms used are provided in the Supplementary Materials Supplementary Materials, File S1 Additionally, the reference lists of the main studies were reviewed individually, and the papers retrieved through Pubmed’s ‘related articles’ function were evaluated. By allowing any language for publication, full-text manuscripts in other linguistic forms besides English, with titles/abstracts that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, were electronically translated and then assessed. 2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria In this meta-analysis, all types of studies with group comparisons (case series, case–control studies, cohort studies, controlled clinical trials, and randomized clinical trials) involved patients who either underwent or did not undergo (control group) wrapping of the remnant pancreas with mesh after distal/left pancreatectomy for benign or malignant lesions of the left pancreas. We included all mesh types and conducted subgroup analyses for each mesh type. We did not include the following types of articles/publications: abstracts, posters, letters to the editor, study protocols, non-human studies, editorials, clinical cases, and systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses published before. Nevertheless, we have examined previously released systematic reviews or meta-analyses to locate any comparative studies that may have been omitted in our systematic research [ 11 2.3. Outcomes The main outcomes were the overall occurrence of postoperative POPF and CR-POPF after D/LP. POPF was classified according to the guidelines established by the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) [ 6 7 2.4. Data Extraction Two autonomous evaluators, AM and MZ, conducted all stages of data identification, selection, quality assessment, and extraction. The discrepancies detected throughout the data evaluation and selection process were resolved through a collaborative discussion between the two reviewers, ultimately leading to a consensus. To enhance data precision, a double-blind method was implemented, resulting in an elevated and reliable level of agreement among assessors (Kappa = 0.91). An impartial assessor (FM) has comprehensively assessed all the collected data. By employing the Rayyan web app for systematic reviews ( https://www.rayyan.ai/ 12 2.5. Quality Assessment The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool for randomized trials (Version 2) (RoB 2) and the Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies—of Interventions (Version 2) (ROBINS-I, V2) were adopted by the two impartial evaluators to appraise the quality of the selected research [ 13 14 2.6. Statistical Analysis To perform our meta-analysis, we utilized the Review Manager (RevMan) [Computer program] version 5.4.1, provided by the Cochrane Collaboration in 2020. Whenever dichotomous results were observed, we adopted the corresponding odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), following the Mantel-Haenszel (MH) method. For continuous outcomes, we adopted weighted mean differences (WMD) and the corresponding 95% CIs, which follow the inverse-variance method. Where no mean or standard deviation (SD) for an endpoint was provided, we relied on Wan and Luo’s formulas, with the reported median range and/or interquartile range (IQR) as the starting point to calculate the required data [ 15 16 10 2 p 2.7. Summary of Findings and Assessment of the Certainty of the Evidence 2.7.1. Summary of Findings Tables We prepared summary of findings (SoF) tables to set the group that wraps the pancreatic stump with mesh after distal/left pancreatectomy against the standard or alternative treatment [ 17 We reported the listed outcomes in the SoF tables: Overall Post-Operative Pancreatic Fistula Clinically Relevant Post-Operative Pancreatic Fistula 2.7.2. Assessment of the Certainty of the Evidence We applied the GRADE approach to evaluate the certainty of the evidence for the outcomes mentioned in the foregoing chapter. The GRADE approach uses five domains (risk of bias, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to grade the certainty of the body of evidence for each outcome. Two authors (AM and FM) separately evaluated the certainty of each outcome. Disputes were handled by a third author (MZa). If serious or very serious issues were identified in any of the areas mentioned above, our certainty in the evidence was reduced by one, two, or three levels, as follows: Study limitations: moderate (−1) or serious (−2) risk of bias; in addition, for non-randomized studies (−3) for critical risk of bias Inconsistency: serious (−1) or very serious (−2) inconsistency Indirectness: serious (−1) or very serious (−2) uncertainty about directness Imprecision: serious (−1) or very serious (−2) imprecise or sparse data Publication bias: serious (−1) or very serious (−2) probability of reporting bias The criteria for assigning evidence levels, as used by the GRADE system, are detailed in the Supplementary Materials Supplementary Materials, File S2 For these assessments, we followed the current GRADE guidelines [ 17 3. Results 3.1. Search Results After carrying out our comprehensive literature review, we identified 812 potentially relevant studies (PubMed/MEDLINE: 611 records; Web of Science: 167 records; Scopus: 34 records) Figure 1 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 3.2. Quality of Studies According to ROBINS-I V2, seven non-randomized studies revealed “serious” overall bias [ 18 19 21 22 23 24 25 Figure 2 According to RoB 2, one study revealed “some concerns” bias [ 20 Figure 3 3.3.

Discussion 4.1. Discussion The distal/left pancreatectomy, the management of the resulting pancreatic stump, and the treatment of overall postoperative pancreatic complications (which occurs in 10% to 46% of patients [ 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to determine whether the wrapping of the mesh around the pancreatic stump is responsible for a lower rate of postoperative pancreatic fistula. In our meta-analysis, we included a total of eight studies, one of which was an RCT, while the others were retrospective observational studies. In total, 1042 patients were analyzed: 430 in the wrapping mesh group and 612 in the control group. In wrapping mesh group, the most widely considered mesh was the PGA, which was present in seven out of eight studies, while only one study analyzed the effect of the polyglactin 910 mesh. Analyzing our results regarding overall-POPF, the fistula rate in the wrapping mesh group is 42% (185/430), while in the control group it is 60.9% (373/612). The data was consistent with the information reported in the literature and previously mentioned [ 3 4 5 6 To mitigate the presence of potential confounding factors, we compared the studies by grouping them into subcategories. The statistically significant result showing a lower overall POPF rate in favor of the wrapping mesh group was also confirmed in studies using only PGA mesh in the wrapping mesh group, as well as in those with the control group using only the hand-sewn closure technique. In the wrapping mesh group subcategory “only with transpancreatic mattress suture” and in the comparison between wrapping mesh group (“all mesh”) and the control group subcategory “with only reinforced stapler suture closure”, a trend favoring the wrapping mesh group was observed, although it was not statistically significant. Only in the comparison between the wrapping mesh group subcategory “only PGA mesh + sealant without reinforced stapler suture closure” and the control group, no supportive evidence for wrapping mesh group was observed, showing no statistically significant differences between the two groups. For practical and daily application, even when considering subcategory analyses, it is evident that the protective effect of the mesh is maintained, including with the PGA mesh. Statistical significance is not achieved in analyses that examine a limited number of studies and patients. In particular, when comparing the wrapping mesh group subcategory (only PGA mesh + sealant without reinforced stapler suture closure) to the control group, the included studies also include Imamura et al. and Jang et al. both of these studies present results favoring the control group, even in the “BL/Grade A POPF” subcategory, which also affects overall POPF. In the analysis of the CR-POPF (which does not include the research by Yoshino et al. due to the lack of individual patient data), we observe a consistent and statistically significant result in support of the wrapping mesh group, both in the overall comparison and in the comparison between subcategories. These data suggest that using mesh to wrap the pancreatic stump has a protective effect, reducing both the number of POPFs (overall POPF) and the significant clinical symptoms of these complications, thereby decreasing the number of CR-POPFs. Furthermore, the reduction in CR-POPF appears to be effective even in subgroup analyses, where we have minimized the interference of confounding factors. The analyses of the CR-POPF rate also show a low and not statistically significant level of heterogeneity. For completeness in our analysis, we also compared the wrapping mesh group and control group for each grade of POPF, using the ISGPF classification. In the comparison between BL and Grade A POPF, although a statistically significant difference was not achieved, there is an observable trend leaning towards the control group. In contrast, in grade B POPF, a statistically significant difference is achieved in favor of the wrapping mesh group. In the case of grade C POPF, although no grade C POPF events were observed in the wrapping mesh group, the limited number of events recorded in both groups prevented a statistically significant difference from being achieved. The analyzed data are limited, as not all studies provided their data disaggregated into the three degrees of POPF. Instead, they only provided BL/grade A POPF and CR-POPF. Therefore, for the interpretation of these data, please refer to the previous paragraphs of this discussion. However, it is important to note that all studies have cataloged the POPF according to the ISGPF guidelines. For studies with an extended data collection period, the reliability of the data collection may have been affected by the use of either the first or second version of the ISGPF guidelines. As previously mentioned, this is a limitation of our meta-analysis. When comparing techniques aimed at reducing the occurrence of an event, agreement in defining and classifying the data is a fundamental prerequisite and has been a major bias in many studies. Regarding the other secondary outcomes, our meta-analysis showed that using a mesh to wrap the pancreatic stump appears to have a lower estimated blood loss, reduce the time the drain remains in place, and shorten the length of hospital stay. When these results are translated into clinical practice, a possible interpretation is that reducing the rate of POPF (especially CR-POPF) will accelerate the removal of drainage and the patient’s discharge home. The presence of a clinically significant POPF can lead to a prolonged need for drainage, which in turn results in a longer hospital stay. These results would be achieved without extending the overall operative time. Actually, we observed a trend towards shorter operative times in the control group, but this finding was not statistically significant. However, these data must be interpreted with caution and cannot be generalized. Due to the lack of individual patient data, we were unable to verify whether the duration of surgery was influenced not only by the application of the mesh but also by other confounding factors, such as: the technique used to manage the pancreatic stump, the type of surgical approach (open, laparoscopic, or robotic), the surgical team’s experience and track record, the indication for performing the DP/L (malignant or benign pathology), and whether an associated splenectomy was performed. These influencing factors not only affect the overall operating time but also impact the estimated blood loss. Furthermore, in the analysis of the Estimated blood loss, which was found to be lower in the wrapping mesh group (a statistically significant result), it is important to consider the significant impact of two single study [ 19 20 Supplementary Materials Despite the limitations in the studies included in our meta-analysis, our results confirm the findings previously presented in the literature, expanding the number of studies and patients included [ 11 40 In a 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis on the effect of PGA mesh in preventing pancreatic fistula (both for pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) and DP), Zhang et al. demonstrated a protective effect of PGA mesh application compared to the control group [ 11 18 21 24 In a 2025 umbrella review, Teng et al. found that the PGA mesh was effective in reducing the incidence of pancreatic fistulas [ 40 8 The ISGPS has established strong consensus on the recommendations below: there was no difference in the POPF rate after D/LP between the hand-sewn and stapler techniques; a stapling technique was not suitable for all cases of left pancreatectomy; the use of an energy-based tissue sealant, a chemical sealant device, or a combination of these did not affect the POPF rate; there was no difference in the postoperative pancreatic fistula rate between open, laparoscopic, or robotic approaches; and there are one or more clinically important, patient-related risk factors associated with the POPF rate. There was weak or conditional agreement on the use of prophylactic somatostatin analogs, stents, stump closure, stump anastomosis, and the role of abdominal drains. As previously pointed out by Teng et al., in the ISGPS consensus, the PGA mesh wrapping the pancreatic stump after DP/L was not considered a stand-alone technique. This was likely due to the technique being relatively innovative and the limited data available upon the article’s publication [ 40 Although the results of our meta-analysis support the use of mesh to wrap the pancreatic stump after DP/L, the generalization of the data and the subsequent recommendation of mesh placement as a surgical practice still require further strong and robust scientific evidence, based on randomized and large-scale studies. Through large-scale studies, it would be desirable to assess the pro-inflammatory effect of the mesh on the pancreatic stump, which could potentially hinder and complicate surgery in the event of re-operation due to complications. Furthermore, we believe that the risk of loco-regional dissemination in the event of malignant recurrence at the pancreatic margin should also be analyzed and given serious consideration. In the included studies, no adverse or undesirable events were reported during the placement process or in the postoperative period following mesh placement. Although our analyses considered many confounding factors, some could not be isolated due to the lack of individual patient data. For example, it was not possible to perform subcategory analyses based on the indication (whether benign or malignant) and the surgical approach. Therefore, we could not determine if the reduction in the POPF rate due to the mesh was partly attributable to the use of the minimally invasive technique, as reported by Teng et al. [ 40 8 28 8 41 42 43 8 44 28 8 45 46 47 4.2. Limitations This study has several limitations. (i) The results obtained from this meta-analysis are based on seven non-randomized studies that were assessed as having a “serious” overall bias by ROBINS-I, while the single RCT was assessed as having “some concerns” by RoB2. The high risk of bias among the individual studies included in this meta-analysis therefore requires caution in the analysis, interpretation of the results and their transferability in common clinical practice; (ii) the reliability of the pooled results from various indications, such as benign and malignant, along with a range of autologous and artificial coverage techniques, could be questioned. However, this issue has been partially addressed through subcategory analysis; (iii) only one of the included studies was a randomized controlled trial (RCT), while the others were all small retrospective comparative studies. All the studies come from Asian countries (Japan and South Korea), which limits the ability to generalize the results and apply them to Western countries. Western countries have different lifestyles and often treat patients with higher BMIs, different diseases, and varying therapeutic strategies, as well as different surgical skills; (iv) already extensively highlighted, when interpreting the results, it is essential to consider the significant variability of confounding factors. These include the closure technique associated with the mesh wrapping technique, the technique used in the control group and the perioperative treatment. The latter encompasses the combination or absence of splenectomy, the thickness and consistency of the pancreas, and the use of drainage and somatostatin analogues; (v) all studies used the ISGPS guidelines as the definition and classification criteria for POPF, although some studies referred to the first version, while others used the second version from 2017. These variations, although they are limitations of this meta-analysis, also reflect the significant variability in current clinical practice. Given the high frequency of POPF after D/LP and its impact on both clinical outcomes and healthcare costs, we believe that determining the best technique for managing the pancreatic stump is an important research topic. This meta-analysis highlighted the potential benefits of mesh wrapping techniques for the pancreatic stump, particularly in reducing both overall POPF and CR-POPF, as well as mitigating the postoperative impact of POPF. Furthermore, with the necessary precautions, particularly due to the presence of serious bias in the individual studies analyzed, we believe this approach can be implemented in common clinical practice (through its application in clinical trials) as a reduction in the rate of POPF has been observed and no additional risk has been found in wrapping the mesh around the pancreatic stump. However, before recommending the use of this technique, further randomized controlled trials are needed to outline these benefits for each subgroup and to determine which techniques and products should be used. It would be desirable for RCTs to be conducted on large populations, preferably in a multi-center setting, with clear stratification based on the mentioned POPF risk factors and minimizing the number of confounding factors (thus avoiding the combination of interventions). 5. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis complements and enhances the existing literature, providing a contemporary analysis that incorporates recent advancements in managing the pancreatic stump after DP/L, with the aim of achieving a lower rate of POPF. Wrapping the pancreatic stump with mesh is associated with a decrease in overall POPF and clinically relevant POPF, a decrease in estimated blood loss, a reduced period with the surgical drain, and a decreased length of hospital stay. Despite the limitations mentioned above, the technique of wrapping the mesh around the pancreatic stump after D/LP appears to be a safe and feasible option. Currently, POPF is a highly significant issue in the surgical field, and there are still gaps in our understanding of it. It is therefore essential to conduct high-quality methodological studies to identify the risk factors for the onset of POPF and to evaluate and compare the results of various surgical approaches used to reduce its rate and associated morbidity.
