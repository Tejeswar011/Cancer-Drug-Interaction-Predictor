Metastatic relapses in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) patients with residual disease pose a significant clinical challenge. In this study, we longitudinally modelled cellular state transition from dormant drug-tolerant persister (DDTP) to proliferative (PDTP) cell state across TNBC subtypes. We identified specific molecular and phenotypic alterations that characterize the DTP states in TNBC cells that are maintained upon re-gaining proliferation. We found that Basal-Like proliferative DTPs stably acquired mesenchymal traits, while luminal androgen receptor-positive TNBC DTPs undergo partial Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). TNBC DTP cells exhibit reduced expression of glutathione peroxidase-4 (GPX4), conferring susceptibility to ferroptosis inducers. Mechanistically, GPX4 downregulation promotes EMT in TNBC, supported by an inverse correlation between GPX4 and EMT marker vimentin (VIM) expression that also serves as a predictor of survival in TNBC patients undergoing chemotherapy. The genetic, pharmacological, or chemotherapy-induced suppression of GPX4 in TNBC cells leads to robust upregulation of ferroptosis suppressor protein-1 (FSP1). The clinical significance of these findings is established by a strong predictive value of FSP1 high high Graphical abstract Image 1 Keywords Drug-tolerant persister cells EMT GPX4 FSP1 TNBC Combination therapy pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1 Introduction Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive and heterogeneous type of breast malignancy, comprising four distinct molecular subtypes each exhibiting unique clinical behaviours and responses to therapy [ 1 2 3 1 4 5 3 6 7 Conventionally, TNBC is managed with chemotherapeutic agents as the first-line treatment, typically in a neoadjuvant setting due to the absence of hormone receptor (Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors; ER, and PR) expression and HER2 overexpression [ [8] [9] [10] [11] 10 11 12 10 12 13 14 Cancer cells undergo drug-induced molecular reprogramming, entering a reversible drug-tolerant persister state that enables survival under high doses of drugs [ 16 [17] [18] [19] 20 21 17 22 23 24 The Mesenchymal and LAR subtypes of TNBC have been shown to be more susceptible to inhibition of glutathione biosynthesis pathways as compared to basal-like subtypes [ 25 26 27 27 28 29 30 Ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), also known as AIFM2 (Flavoprotein apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria-associated 2), is a CoQ oxidoreductase that is upregulated in multiple cancers resistant to ferroptosis upon GPX4 inhibition [ 28 29 28 26 31 In this study, we modelled the longitudinal development of TNBC DTP cells evolving from dormant to proliferative states, using cell lines representing four TNBC subtypes exposed to diverse chemotherapeutics. We report that all TNBC subtypes generate DDTP cell populations that transit to PDTP phase with higher chemoresistance compared to the parental cells. DTP cells from BL-1/2 and LAR subtypes exhibited molecular traits belonging to EMT, evidenced by elevated EMT genes, including vimentin. Moreover, cellular and molecular analyses showed that TNBC PDTP cells shared common targetable cellular and biochemical alterations, including increased lipid reactive species and suppressed glutathione synthesis. GPX4 expression modulation in TNBC identifies its role in the regulation of mesenchymal traits, FSP1 expression, and chemoresistance. Human breast cancer tissue analysis, combined with in silico analysis of patient datasets, identified a reverse correlation of GPX4 with both FSP1 and vimentin expression, that is predictive of survival and chemotherapy response in aggressive TNBC. 2 Results 2.1 Chemotherapy induces a dormant DTP state in all TNBC subtypes that switch to a proliferative DTP state characterized by acquired drug resistance and increased proliferation To investigate chemotherapeutic tolerance in TNBC, we established persister cell models using paclitaxel-, doxorubicin, and cisplatin in representative TNBC subtype (hereafter referred to as parental cells, PC) cell line (MDA-MB-468 for BL-1, HCC70 for BL-2, MDA-MB-231 and HS578T for MSL, and MDA-MB-453 for LAR) [ 16 32 Fig. 1 50 Fig. S1A–C Fig. S1D Fig. 1 33 34 50 Fig. 1 50 Fig. S1G Fig. 1 Longitudinal modelling of drug tolerance to generate proliferative persisters, PDTP cells from different TNBC subtypes. 80-95 50 t Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Following drug withdrawal, longitudinally monitoring of post-therapy residual DTP cells revealed four distinct phases ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. S1E Morphological analysis using phase contrast microscopy analysis of DTP cells during phases II and III revealed significant sub type specific differences ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. S1E 19 21 36 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 We investigated whether the TNBC DTP cell populations maintain drug tolerance in different phases (DDTP to PDTP) by re-challenging PC and DTPs with lethal doses of paclitaxel ( Fig. 1 S1F Fig. 1 Fig. S1F Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 S1F, and 1 32 33 16 35 36 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Together, these results highlight that TNBC cells from all subtypes can survive chemotherapy in a dormant persister state and subsequently resume proliferation after drug withdrawal, leading to a more aggressive and resistant PDTP state ( Fig. 1 12 2.2 Chemotherapy induces a stable mesenchymal state in BL-1 and BL-2 subtypes, whereas the LAR subtype undergoes a partial EMT with enhanced migration and invasive properties Drug-induced molecular reprogramming often leads to EMT in epithelial tumors, a plastic state that is more resistant to therapy [ 20 Fig. 1B–F and S1 Fig. 2 Fig. S2A Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. S2B Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. S2D Fig. S2E CDH1 CDH2 VIM FN1 ZEB1, ZEB2, SNAIL1, SNAIL2, TWIST1, TWIST2 CDH2, VIM, SNAIL1 SNAIL2 CDH1 ZEB1 ZEB2 7 Fig. 2 Proliferative chemotherapy-tolerant persisters attain mesenchymal phenotype with increased migration and invasion properties. Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Recent research highlighted the role of hybrid EMT in metastasis and secondary tumor formation in breast and other epithelial tumors, linked to cells capability to acquire an epithelial state (E-Cad + 37 Fig. 2 Drug-resistant residual disease in TNBC patients often correlates with distant metastasis and poor survival [ 13 38 20 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. S2F Fig. 2 Fig. S2G [39] [40] [41] [42] Fig. 2 These cellular/biological characteristics align with the known metastatic potential of drug-resistant cancer cells [ 40 41 43 2.3 PDTP cells display elevated reactive iron levels, impairing GPX4-mediated antioxidant defence, and enhanced susceptibility to ferroptosis inducers A prominent feature of oxidative damage at the subcellular level is abnormal mitochondrial structure and function [ 14 16 Fig. 3 44 Fig. 3 2 2 2 Fig. 3 2 2 45 Fig. 3 Fig. S3A Fig. S3B Fig. 3 Fig. 3 + + Fig. S3C Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 25 27 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 46 + Fig. S3D Fig. 3 + Fig. 3 Fig. S3D + + Fig. 3 + Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. S3E Fig. 3 S3F Fig. S3G Fig. S3H Fig. S3I and J Fig. 3 Fig. 3 TNBC PDTPs are more sensitive to ferroptosis induction due to elevated mitochondrial damage, lipid ROS, labile iron, coupled with glutathione depletion as a result of GPX4 pathway suppression. 2 2- 2 + + 2+ 50 Fig. 3 Based on the increased cellular ROS and iron levels in PDTP cells along with lower glutathione levels, it can be speculated that these cells might exhibit minimal resistance to ferroptosis inducers [ 27 46 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 S3K 50 Fig. S3L Fig. 3 2.4 GPX4 modulation in TNBC and PDTP cells reveals its role in mesenchymal phenotype and a compensatory induction of FSP1 expression Our earlier work showed that TNBCs are intrinsically vulnerable to ferroptosis and express lower levels of GPX4 and GSS, key proteins in the ferroptosis pathway, compared to non-TNBC counterparts [ 33 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Modulation of GPX4 activity and expression in TNBC cells revealed its role in EMT phenotype as well as in induction of compensatory FSP1 expression. Fig. 4 To further investigate whether the phenotypic changes observed in PDTP-Ps are associated with GPX4, we modulated GPX4 expression levels in MDA-468 PC and PDTP-P cells using shRNA-mediated silencing and lentiviral-based overexpression approaches, respectively. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy analysis of GPX4 knockdown PC show significant downregulation of GPX4 together with decreased E-cadherin and concomitant increase in vimentin expression ( Fig. 4 Fig. S4A Fig. 4 We further hypothesized that TNBC cells surviving severe GPX4 suppression induced by high doses of RSL3 might upregulate glutathione-independent alternative compensatory pathways to counteract acute ferroptosis induction that may also operate in chemotherapy-DTPs. To explore this possibility, we analysed the expression of CoQ oxidoreductase FSP1 that has been shown to compensate for the absence of GPX4 and rescue sarcoma cells from ferroptosis [ 28 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 AIFM2 Fig. S4 B, C Fig. S4 D, E Fig. S4F Fig. S4F Fig. S4G Fig. S4J 2.5 Low GPX4 expression and high VIM-FSP1 co-expression are strong indicators of poor outcomes in chemotherapy-treated TNBC patients, particularly those with high-grade tumors and lymph node metastasis Given the established association of GPX4 suppression with increased EMT and FSP1 expression in TNBC DTPs, we further assessed the clinical relevance of our findings in TNBC patients using publicly available matched data. First, we investigated whether individual gene expressions of GPX4 VIM AIFM2 + Fig. 5 Fig. S5A Fig. S5B VIM Fig. 5 VIM Fig. S5C Fig. 5 VIM AIFM2 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Low GPX4, high VIM, and FSP1, are strong indicators of the worst outcome in chemotherapy-treated TNBC patients with high-grade and lymph node metastasis.

Specifically, we examined Basal-Like bulk RNAseq data from TCGA, single-cell RNA sequencing datasets from TNBC patients, and gene expression sets from TNBC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, as illustrated in Fig. 5 GPX4 VIM, S100A4, CDH2, MMPs, SNAI2, ZEB2, and MET Fig. S5F GSS Fig. 5 GSE176078 Fig. 5 Fig. 4 GSE183187 Fig. 5 To explore the relationship between GPX4 and Vimentin at the protein expression level in breast cancer, we conducted dual immunofluorescence co-staining of paraffinized breast tissue sections encompassing normal breast tissue (NBT, n = 8), primary breast tumors (PT, n = 36), and lymph node metastases (MT, n = 10) ( Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. S5G These findings underscore a negative correlation between GPX4 and Vimentin gene in breast tissue, implying opposing roles and regulatory functions at the cellular level, consistent with our experimental insights ( Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Fig. 4 low high high 2.6 Chemotherapy-induced FSP1 overexpression in TNBC is a therapeutic target that synergizes with chemotherapy and GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 As we have observed that the perturbations suppressing activity or expression of GPX4 can induce upregulation in FSP1 expression in TNBC cells ( Fig. 4 Fig. 5 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 MMTV‐R26 Met MMTV‐R26 Met 47 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Chemotherapy-induced sustained FSP1 upregulation in TNBC is a therapeutic target that synergizes with chemotherapy and GPX4 inhibitor RSL3. 75 MMTV-R26 Met Fig. 6 Fig. 6 FSP1 expression is known to suppress ferroptosis under cellular lipid peroxidation stress conditions, including GPX4 inhibition [ 31 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. S6A Fig. 4 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. S6C Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. S6D Fig. 6 Fig. 6 27 50 Fig. S6 G, H Fig. S6 I,J Previous studies on cancer DTP cells suggested the possibility of targeting GPX4 due to their vulnerability to GPX4 inhibitors. However, this approach has a clinical limitation due to the toxicity associated with GPX4 inhibitors [ 17 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 S6K Fig. S6E Fig. S6F Fig. 6 Fig. S6L Fig. 6 Fig. S6M–P Fig. S6Q Fig. S6 M, N, and Q Fig. S6R Fig. S6S Finally, we looked into any possible correlation of our above findings in human breast cancers using the Kaplan–Meier curve of overall survival of breast cancer patients with high AIFM2 Fig. 6 Fig. S6T GPX4 Fig. S6U AIFM2 GPX4 GPX4 GPX4 AIFM2 GPX4 Fig. 6 3 Discussion Recent reports across various solid tumor types confirm that a subset of tumor cells can persist in a dormant state under targeted or chemotherapeutic drugs, eventually regaining proliferation and leading to post-therapy tumor recurrence with metastasis [ [14] [15] [16] 46 48 49 50 51 13 [52] [53] [54] [55] Fig. 7 12 56 Fig. 7 Schematic model summarizing the main findings of the study. (A) (B) (C) Fig. 7 Clinical studies widely acknowledge that chemotherapy resistance in TNBC primarily occurs through non-genetic mechanisms. Earlier investigations using methods such as in situ hybridization [ 57 58 59 57 Fig. 7 59 60 60 61 60 37 37 62 Cellular reprogramming in DTPs drives altered metabolic states crucial for cell proliferation, invasion, and therapy resistance. Recent research highlights how therapy-stressed and EMT cells adapt energy acquisition through OXPHOS [ 60 24 63 30 64 25 65 25 27 30 66 GPX4 suppression is widely noted in solid tumors during DTP states, yet the phenotypic dependence of the DTP state on compromised glutathione levels remains experimentally unclear. Our study identifies GPX4 as a key regulator of EMT in TNBC cells that is commonly upregulated during metastasis in various cancers [ 62 Fig. 7 GPX4 FSP1 VIM Fig. 7 Another very important finding of this study is to demonstrate that chemotherapy forces overexpression of FSP1 in TNBC DDTP and PDTP cells that contributes to chemoresistance. An earlier study has shown that upon GPX4 inactivation, FSP1 maintains growth in H460 lung cancer tumors in vivo [ 28 44 31 28 44 In conclusion, this study significantly advances our understanding of the distinct and shared phenotypes and vulnerabilities of PDTPs across different TNBC molecular subtypes, serving as representative models of recurrence-associated drug-resistant subpopulations in patients. There has been a critical gap in comprehending how dormant and proliferative states in TNBC DTPs develop following chemotherapy exposure [ 18 4 Materials and methods 4.1 Chemicals, drugs, and DNA constructs Chemotherapeutic agents used in the study were purchased from Sigma (Paclitaxel, catalog no T1912; doxorubicin, catalog no D1515; and cisplatin, catalog no PHR1624).

These cells were maintained in RPMI medium (Gibco BRL, USA) supplemented with l 2 4.4 TNBC mouse cell line culture Mouse MGT cell lines were derived from individual MMTV-R26Met TNBC tumors and established as previously described [ 47 47 2 4.5 Generation of DTP and PDTP TNBC models Cells were treated with increasing doses of chemotherapeutic drugs (Paclitaxel, Doxorubicin, and Cisplatin) for 72 h. Cell viability assays were conducted, and IC 50 27 67 85-90 4.6 MTT assay To determine the cytotoxic effect of drugs, dose-response experiments were performed. In a 96 well plate format, MDA-MB-468 (12000 cells), HCC70 (9000 cells), MDA-MB-231 (9000 cells), HS578T (3000 cells), or MDA-MB-453 (9000 cells) cells were seeded for 16 h. Cells were treated with drugs for 72 h with an increasing concentration of drugs. Cell viability was determined using MTT assays as described previously [ 27 50 4.7 Colony formation assay Cells were seeded up to 5, 10, and 15 % confluence and allowed to grow to form visible colonies. The media was replenished every three days. Colonies were fixed in 4 % PFA and stained with crystal violet. Photographs of the plates were taken using a 16.2 Megapixel digital camera (Nikon D7000) with a light box to illuminate the plate. 4.8 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) To study the sub-cellular details using in-house TEM central facility of TMC-ACTREC, cells were grown as a confluent monolayer, fixed with 3 % glutaraldehyde, washed with 0.1 M of sodium cacodylate pH 7.4, and postfixed with 1 % osmium tetroxide. Cells were then dehydrated and processed for sample preparation. Grids were contrasted with alcoholic uranyl acetate for 30 s and dipped once in lead citrate. The grids were observed under a JEOL 1400Plus transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 120 KeV and 10000X. Images were then captured using a Slow Scan CCD camera (TRS, Germany). 4.9 Immunoblotting Whole cell lysate of different cell lines for total protein was prepared in lysis buffer consisting 0.2 % Triton X- 100, 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 50 mM NaF, 0.5 mM NaVO 3 30 4.10 Isolation of total RNA and real-time PCR reactions Cell lysates were prepared in RNA later buffer, and total RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of RNA using the ABI High-Capacity Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies). A total of 10 ng of cDNA was used for the real-time PCR using ABI SyBr Green PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies) in QuantStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies) with gene-specific primers sets, β actin or GAPDH gene expression levels were used as for normalization in all experiments. The expression of target genes was plotted as a fold change of experimental controls after calculating the relative to GAPDH or Actin as a housekeeping gene using the 2(-ΔΔCt) method. The sequences of forward and reverse oligonucleotides used in this study are shown in Table S1 4.11 Migration assays Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 90–100 % confluence and serum-starved overnight. Cells were treated with 5 μg/ml of Mitomycin C for 3 h. The scratch was made using a 200 μl sterile tip, and cells were stimulated with a complete medium containing 10 % FBS. Phase-contrast images of migrating cells at initial and different time points were captured using an inverted microscope (Optika-SRL, IM-5FLD, C–P6 fitted with a 6.3 Megapixel camera) at a 20× objective. The average distance travelled was quantified from 3 independent experiments, and data were plotted in percent wound closure and migration rate over time. 4.12 Invasion assay Matrigel degradation and invasion assays were performed using Boyden chambers (BD Falcon) with 8 μm pore size in a 24-well format. Boyden transwell chambers were coated with 5 μg of the Matrigel suspended in 100 μl of the ice-cold media and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. In 200 μl of serum-free media, 2 10ˆ5 cells were seeded in the Boyden chambers, and in the lower chamber, 450 μl of media containing 10 % of FBS was added to incubate for 16 h. The Boyden chambers were taken out, washed in PBS, and fixed in 4 % Paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 10 min. The chambers were then washed in PBS and stained in 0.03 % crystal violet solution for 10 min. Cells from the inner surface of the chamber were carefully removed using cotton swabs, and the chambers were washed with PBS and air dried. Images of the lower surface containing invaded cells were acquired from 10 different fields on an upright AxioImager Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a 10× objective lens. The number of cells invaded was calculated from 3 independent experiments, and the data were plotted as folds of control. 4.13 Cell area and aspect ratio of cells In order to describe morphological changes, we did area and aspect ratio measurements using Fiji ImageJ software. Binary images were created by thresholding the images to remove background noise. The area measurements were performed on the binary images using the 'Wand (tracing) tool’ in Fiji ImageJ. The aspect ratio of cells was calculated based on their major and minor axes. The major axis refers to the longest axis inside the cell, while the minor axis is the perpendicular axis to the major axis and is located in the middle of the cell when the cell shape resembles an oval. In cases where the cell shape is different from an oval, the major axis is still chosen as the longest axis inside the cell, while the minor axis is arbitrarily chosen to be perpendicular to the major axis and maximally located close to the relative cell center. To calculate the aspect ratio, the length of the major axis was divided by the length of the minor axis for each of the 100 randomly selected cells. 4.14 Immunofluorescence staining Immunofluorescence staining of cells was performed as described earlier [ 68 4.15 ROS measurements Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were quantitatively measured in live cell samples using the cell-permeant reagent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (H 2 C10443 2 2 2 2 4.16 GSH measurements Total GSH levels in cells were detected by using a luminescence-based GSHGlo Assay reagent kit (Promega, catalog no. B6912) as instructed by the manufacturer. The assay quantifies total glutathione (reduced and oxidized forms) in cell lysates. To detect GSH, cell lysates of control and treatment experimental sets were prepared directly in the multiwall plate by adding 50 μl μl GSH-specific lysis buffer with the reagents provided in the kit, followed by a 5 min incubation, and then 50 50 μl of Luciferin Generation Reagent was added to each well. The mixture was incubated for 30 min at RT, and the assays were mixed and incubated for 30 min. After the incubation, 100 μl of Luciferin Detection Reagent was added to all wells and mixed. After a 15-min incubation, luminescence was measured using a multi-plate reader (Cytation5 spectrophotometer, Biotek). GSH content was calculated from luminescence measurements and presented as means ± SD fold change relative to controls. 4.17 Iron measurements Cellular iron (Fe 2+ 3+ 4.18 Lipid peroxidation assay A fluorescence shift-based assay (Image-iT Lipid Peroxidation Kit, Cat.

After 72 h, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were fixed using 1 mL of 10 % formalin was added to each well and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 10 min. The initial fixative was then discarded and replaced with fresh 10 % formalin, and the cells were left to fix for 1 h at RT. After fixation, the formalin was removed, and cells were rinsed twice with distilled water (ddH 2 2 2 2 4.21 FerroOrange staining FerroOrange staining was performed in MDA-MB-468 parental control (PC) and MDA-MB-468 drug-tolerant persister (PDTP) cells to detect intracellular labile ferrous iron (Fe 2+ 2 4.22 Whole scan imaging Lung tissues from tumor-bearing mice injected with triple negative breast cancer cells line 468 PC and 468 PDTP were harvested for histological analysis. Lung tissues were dissected and fixed in 10 % neutral buffered formalin for 24–48 h. Fixed tissues were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 10 μm thickness were cut using a microtome, mounted on glass slides, and dried before staining. H&E staining was performed by deparaffinizing sections in xylene, rehydrating through graded ethanol, staining with hematoxylin, followed by differentiation and bluing, then staining with eosin. After dehydration and clearing, slides were mounted with DPX mounting medium. Whole slide imaging was conducted using a Tissue Scope iQ bright field slide scanner (Catalog number: iQ 0234) 0.25 μm/pixel at 40× magnification to capture high-resolution images of stained sections. Image analysis was performed using Qu-Path software, and high-resolution TIFF images were extracted from Qu-Path for further evaluation. 4.23 Breast cancer mouse xenografts Female NOD/SCID mice 4–6 weeks old and weighing 18–22 g, were used in this study. Animals were housed at the institutional animal facility and maintained according to Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) standards, with unrestricted access to food and water. All experimental procedures were carried out strictly as per the approved protocols of the IAEC of TMC-ACTREC (proposal number: 47/2022). For orthotropic TNBC tumor generation, a suspension of 2.5 x 106 MDA-MB-468 PC or PDTP-P breast cancer cells in 50 μl of sterile PBS was bilaterally implanted into the fourth inguinal mammary glands of female mice (n = 6 per group). Tumor size was monitored bi-weekly using a digital Vernier caliper once the tumors became palpable, and body weight was recorded bi-weekly. Tumor volumes were calculated (width2 × length/2). Mice were sacrificed once the tumor volume approached the maximal permissible limits as per IAEC protocols. Tumors and visceral organs were excised and processed for immunofluorescence staining procedures as described elsewhere [82]. Imaging of stained tissues was performed using a 60× objective of Nikon's 10th generation AX/AX R confocal microscope and quantitation of mean fluorescence intensities in each channel was recorded. For histopathological studies of tumor and organ tissues, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed on deparaffinized tissue sections. AxioImager Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a 4× objective lens. Student's t-test was applied for statistical analysis. 4.24 Tissue array immunofluorescence The human breast cancer tissue array (catalog number: NBP2-30212, NOVUS) was deparaffinized and hydrated as per the manufacturer's instructions, followed by antigen retrieval in a heated tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9) using a microwave. Autofluorescence quenching was performed using CuSO4·NH4Cl (pH-6) for 15 min. Tissue arrays were permeabilized using 0.2 % Triton X-100 in Tris buffer for 15 min and then stained with primary antibody for vimentin and GPX4 (1:100 dilution). Fluorophore-tagged secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 568 anti-mouse IgG of Invitrogen, A-11004, and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG of Invitrogen, A-11001) were used in a 1:200 dilution and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. DAPI was used for nuclear staining, and the coverslip was mounted using a Mowiol-based mounting medium. Immunofluorescence images were acquired on 60× objective of Nikon's 10th generation AX/AX R confocal microscope and quantitation of mean fluorescence intensities in each channel and colocalization coefficient (Pearson's colocalization coefficient) and contribution of each channel to the colocalization was estimated using Mander's overlap coefficients k1 and K2. These parameters were used for scoring the tissue staining using Nikon Elements AR analysis 5.42.00 software to estimate the colocalization coefficient. Data was presented in mean fluorescence intensity from three representative images per tissue section in each channel and their contribution to the colocalization. 4.25 Bioinformatics analysis Pre-processing of Datasets: The Microarray ( GSE6434 GSE176078 GSE183187 Scoring Methods: 69 70 71 4.26 Datasets Gene and protein expression analysis of breast cancer patients were done based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) breast cancer dataset. For Survival analysis, TCGA gene expression was used on Kaplan-Meier Plotter ( https://kmplot.com/analysis https://tcpaportal.org/tcpa/survival_analysis.html http://www.rocplot.org/site/index 28 4.27 Statistical analysis All the in-vitro data are presented as mean ± SD from at least three different experimental repeats, unless otherwise mentioned. To compare between experimental groups, we used Student's t-test for the experiments. The reported p-values associated with dataset analysis (TCGA or TCPA) are generated using online portals. p-value <0.05 is considered significant.
