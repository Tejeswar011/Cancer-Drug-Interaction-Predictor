Methods The clinicopathological data and paraffin-embedded tissue of 26 cases of PMSCCB were collected and analysed, and the relevant literatures were also studied. Given the limited sample size collected, the results are considered a preliminary exploratory analysis. Results Twenty-six female patients, with a mean age of 53.11 ± 10.83 years, had no previous history of squamous cell carcinoma. Grossly, the tumor exhibited a solid or cystic-solid appearance, with the maximum diameter averaging 3.73 ± 2.53 cm. Microscopically, there were 18 cases of pure squamous cell carcinoma and 8 cases of mixed type. The immuno-molecular phenotype of the sample was characterised by negative rates of ER, PR, and HER-2 at 65.4% (17/26), 92.3% (24/26) and 69.2% (18/26), positive rates of HER-2 FISH, HPV RNAscope, CK5/6, p63 and EGFR at 19.2% (5/26), 4.1% (1/24), 100% (26/26), 100% (26/26) and 96.0% (24/25), respectively. Most of the 26 patients underwent surgery and chemotherapy, with some receiving additional radiotherapy or targeted therapy. After a median follow-up of months (range, 9–134 months), 17 cases had no recurrence, 8 cases had distant metastasis and 1 case was lost to follow-up. Conclusions PMSCCB occurs exclusively in females, with a mean age of onset of 53.11 ± 10.83 years, and 46.1% of the patients were premenopausal. It is characterized by high expression of CK5/6, p63, and EGFR, which can aid in diagnosis. There is low expression of ER, PR, and HER-2, which may offer opportunities for targeted and endocrine therapies. Anthracyclines combined with cyclophosphamide or/and taxanes may prove effective in chemotherapy treatment. p16-positive expression does not necessarily indicate high-risk HPV infection, and the expression of p53, p16 and EGFR is not correlated with prognosis. However, distant metastasis and GATA3 expression are significant factors influencing the prognosis of PMSCCB. http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100018542 Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province 2023NSFSC0548 Li Junjie This work was supported by the grant 2023NSFSC0548 of the Sichuan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Data Availability The data are all contained within the manuscript.

Introduction Squamous cell carcinoma often occurs in the skin, oral cavity, oesophagus, cervix and other parts of the body, but primary metaplastic squamous cell carcinoma of the breast (PMSCCB) is extremely rare [ 1 2 3 4 5 Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a well-acknowledged proto-oncogene involved in the genesis and progression of breast cancer, inhibits apoptosis, promotes proliferation, enhances the invasiveness of tumor cells, and facilitates angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis of tumors. Breast cancer with overexpression of HER2 progresses rapidly, has a short chemotherapy remission period, shows poor response to endocrine therapy, and has low disease-free survival and overall survival rates. Meanwhile, HER2 amplification serves as the main reference indicator for the treatment of breast cancer with targeted drugs, for example, Herceptin [ 6 7 8 8 Materials and methods Materials Twenty-six patients diagnosed with PMSCCB in Sichuan Cancer Hospital from 01/07/2013 to 01/08/2025 were collected, including 18 cases of pure squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) and 8 cases of mixed metaplastic carcinoma with squamous cell component (MMSC) [ 9 10 Ethics All the retrospective analyses was approved by the Management Committee for Scient of Sichuan Cancer Hospital (SCCSMC-012025023). The study was developed in compliance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the relevant requirements of the national ethics. And the requirement of patient informed consent was waived under a protocol approved by the Management Committee for Scient of Sichuan Cancer Hospital. Members of the research team were unable to access any sensitive information that could directly or indirectly identify individual participants during or after the study. All data was anonymized before analysis. Methods All specimens were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, cleared in xylene, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 μm thickness, and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E). Immunohistochemical staining was performed using the Roche Benchmark XT and Dako Autostainer Link 48 automated platforms. Antibodies for ER, PR, and HER2 were sourced from Ventana Medical Systems, while antibodies for p63, CK5/6, p53, GATA-3, p40, p16, EGFR, and Ki-67 were obtained from Fuzhou Maixin Company. The staining protocol followed standard procedures, including deparaffinization, antigen retrieval using a citrate buffer, and incubation with primary antibodies at appropriate dilutions. The sections were then incubated with a secondary antibody and enzyme complex, followed by color development with DAB and counterstaining with hematoxylin. HER2 gene amplification was evaluated using Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) with a HER2/TOP2A/CSP17 multicolor probe (Guangzhou Anbiping Medical Technology Co.LTD). Tissue sections (4 μm) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, retrieved and subjected to protease digestion. The probe was hybridized overnight at 37°C, followed by post-hybridization washes. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Positive ER and PR was defined according to the 2020 guidelines [ 11 12 HPV RNA was detected using the RNAscope HPV HR18 multi-subtype combined detection kit (Beijing Zhongshan Jinqiao Company), targeting 18 high-risk HPV subtypes. Tissue sections (4 μm) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, retrieved and treated with protease. The probe was hybridized according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and signals were amplified using the RNAscope 2.5 HD Detection Reagents. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. Positive HPV RNA expression was indicated by brown dots within the nuclei or cytoplasm. Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using the software SPSS27.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). For numeric data, results were reported as median values ± standard deviation (SD). The Fisher’s exact test was used to compare categorical values and the missing data of 1–2 cases were directly deleted. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and the Log-rank test were used to analyze survival prognosis and there were 1–3 cases of missing data, which were imputed using the mean value. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Clinical features All the 26 patients with PMSCCB were female, with an average age of 53.11 ± 10.83 years (range, 30–59 years) and had no skin surface ulceration and nipple depression. But, the final pathological results showed that two cases involved the nipple and dermis, and one case involved the nipple. The maximum diameter of the mass ranged from 0.8 to 9 cm (mean 3.73 ± 2.53 cm). Among most gray solid matter, 14 cases had cystic areas, and there was no history of squamous cell carcinoma in other parts. The majority of patients underwent modified radical mastectomy and were clinically staged as AJCC Stage II. However, there were no significant differences in the incidence of tumors between the left and right breasts, or in relation to menopausal status and lymph node metastasis. The specific clinicopathologic features and surgical methods are shown in Table 1 10.1371/journal.pone.0333347.t001 Table 1 Clinicopathological features of PMSCCB.

The proportion of squamous cell carcinoma components in MMSC collected in this study ranges from 40% to 80%. The tumor cells grew in nests, sheets, papillae, expansively, or invasively, with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli, accompanied by keratinization, and visible keratin pearl formation. In some cases, the cystic structure area showed focal cystic wall tumor cell nests infiltrating growth, similar to the morphology of high-grade angiosarcoma-like or acantholytic squamous cell carcinoma. In some cases, central cystic cavity formation is observed (14/26). Among them, there were 9 cases of high-medium differentiation, 9 cases of medium differentiation, 6 cases of medium-low differentiation, and 2 cases of low differentiation.

Treatment and prognosis According to the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), there were two cases in stage I, sixteen cases in stage II, seven cases in stage III and one case in stage IV. All patients underwent surgical treatment: eight patients underwent total mastectomy with lymph node exploration, one patient underwent total mastectomy alone, and seventeen patients underwent modified radical mastectomy. There were fourteen cases of axillary lymph node metastasis resulting in a lymph node metastasis rate of 53.8%. Only one patient had a family history of breast cancer, and there was no history of malignancy at other sites. Approximately 38.5% of the cases in this group were triple-negative breast cancers. Preoperatively, 9 cases received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 2 cases received neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus immunotherapy, 1 case received chemotherapy plus dual-targeted therapy, and 1 case received endocrine therapy. Postoperatively, 9 cases received chemotherapy, 5 cases received chemotherapy plus radiotherapy, 2 cases received chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy, 2 cases received chemotherapy plus targeted therapy, and 1 case received targeted therapy alone.

Discussions PMSCCB, as a rare type of breast cancer, is more common among middle-aged and elderly women, with an average age of onset exceeding 50 years. The average age of patients in this study is 53.11 years, which is consistent with literature descriptions. But, in this group of cases, there were 10 patients under the age of 50, accounting for 38.5%, with the youngest being 30 years old. This indicates that the risk of this disease may be increased in young and middle-aged women. PMSCCB is mainly cystic solid or solid mass, with an average diameter of 2.8–3.5 cm [ 13 14 15 16 9 17 17 It has been reported that p63, CK5/6, and EGFR are crucial immune markers for the diagnosis of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast (PSCCB) [ 18 19 20 21 22 23 The p16 protein is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in various cancers [ 24 21 25 26 8 24 27 p53 is a protein with a molecular weight of 47.3 kDa and is also a human tumor suppressor gene, which has the functions of inducing cancer cell apoptosis and repairing cellular genetic defects [ 28 29 30 31 Many studies suggest that PSCCB can be treated with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin with or without anthracyclines, but other studies have also shown that such cancers are naturally resistant to fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide and anthracyclines, while sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy [ 32 19 33 The mass of PSCCB is relatively large, and modified radical surgery might be more suitable for patients than breast-conserving surgery. However, some studies have pointed out that, especially after breast conserving surgery, radiotherapy can reduce the recurrence rate of breast cancer by half and the mortality rate by about one sixth [ 34 35 36 The prognosis of PSCCB is considered to be worse than that of common NST-negative breast cancer, with a 5-year overall survival rate of only 34.5%−67.2% [ 34 37 38 This study provides preliminary insights into the clinicopathological features and prognosis of PMSCCB through a limited sample, which restricts the statistical power and generalizability of the results. However, these findings still offer valuable information for future research and point to the direction for further investigation. Further validation is needed in a larger sample. Conclusions In general, PMSCCB, as a rare form of breast cancer, predominantly affects middle-aged and elderly women, but it is showing a tendency towards younger age groups. Its immunophenotype frequently exhibits negative expressions of ER, PR, and HER2, with positive expressions of p63, CK5/6 and EGFR. These characteristics not only offer opportunities for targeted therapy and endocrine treatment but also aid in diagnosis. [ 39 Supporting information S1 File REMARK-20 checklists.
