Introduction Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), one of the most prevalent malignant tumors in the head and neck region, is characterized by rapid progression, high aggressiveness, and poor 5-year survival rates [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 With in-depth investigations into cancer mechanisms, COX-2 has been identified as being overexpressed in numerous cancer types, where it exerts pleiotropic and multifaceted roles in tumorigenesis, neoplastic progression, and cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 26 27 IC 50 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 Building upon the therapeutic potential of COX-2 inhibitors, we designed a novel series of pyrazole N-aryl sulfonate derivatives structurally inspired by CXB. Utilizing an innovative synthetic method developed by our group, these compounds were engineered to retain potent COX-2 inhibitory activity while avoiding sulfonamide-related allergic reactions [ 38 4b 4d 5f Based on these findings and suggestive hypotheses, compounds 4b 4d 5f 2.

Validation of Inhibitory Effects of CXB and Compounds 4b 4d 5f Based on the molecular design rationale of the compounds, we wanted to verify the expression status of COX-2 in OSCC cells after being treated with each compound. RT-qPCR was performed to investigate the inhibitory effects after a 24 h treatment. The results revealed a significant downregulation of COX-2 mRNA levels in all compound-treated groups. Furthermore, the mRNA expression levels in the 4b 4d 5f Figure 2 4b 5f 4d Figure 2 Western blotting analysis demonstrated that in CAL-27 cells, treatment with compounds 4b 4d 5f Figure 2 Figure 2 ELISA results demonstrated that in CAL-27 cells, the COX-2 protein levels in treatment groups were slightly reduced compared to the control group ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 These findings further validated the robust inhibitory effects of the tested compounds on COX-2 expression. 2.4. Inhibition of OSCC Cell Proliferation by Compounds 4b 4d 5f As reported above, the CCK-8 assay demonstrated that all compounds exerted inhibitory effects on both CAL-27 and SAS cells at the working concentrations ( Figure 2 In CAL-27 cells, compared to the control group, the mRNA expression of the CYP19A1 gene was significantly downregulated in the 4b 4d 5f Figure 2 4b 4d 5f Figure 2 2.5.

Discussion As one of the most prevalent malignancies in the head and neck region, OSCC is primarily managed through multi-modal therapies combining surgery with chemoradiotherapy [ 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 28 Previous studies have established that NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors exhibit therapeutic efficacy against various cancers [ 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 4b 4d 38 In this study, compounds 4b 4d 5f 4b 4d 5f Furthermore, in VERO cells, compounds 4b 4d 5f The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family comprises a class of zinc-dependent endopeptidases characterized by a conserved Zn 2 + 59 60 61 62 59 63 64 4b 4d 5f 4b 4d 5f Programmed apoptosis, a critical process for maintaining tissue homeostasis, is governed by the BCL2 protein family, which comprises both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members that collectively determine cellular fate [ 65 66 4b 4d 5f 4b 5f 4b 4d 4b 4d 5f Emerging evidence positions COX-2 as a pivotal regulator within multifaced oncogenic signaling cascades [ 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 Despite these encouraging results, several limitations warrant consideration. First, only two OSCC cell lines (CAL-27 and SAS) were examined, which does not fully reflect the molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity of OSCC; future work will incorporate additional models, including patient-derived primary cultures and organoids, to improve representativeness. Second, all functional assays were performed in vitro and therefore do not recapitulate the complexity of the tumor microenvironment—particularly stromal and immune interactions that can influence drug response. Further more, in vivo evaluation such as orthotopic or genetically engineered murine models is still required to determine pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and potential off-target effects under physiological conditions. Finally, the primary objective of subsequent work will be to delineate the precise mechanisms of these compounds in OSCC by systematically perturbing the JAK/STAT3 axis through targeted genetic and pharmacological inhibition strategies. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Molecular Docking Using the PDB database (Protein Data Bank, https://www.rcsb.org 74 4b 4d 5f 4.2. Preparation of Working Solutions An appropriate volume of 2 mg/mL compound emulsion was dissolved in 0.1% DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide) to prepare a 200 μg/mL stock solution [ 38 4.3. Cell Culture The OSCC cell lines CAL-27 (STCC12901P, Servicebio, Wuhan, China) and SAS (CC0706, Cellcook, Guangzhou, China) were cultured in Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium F12 (DMEM/F12) (G4610-500ML, Servicebio, Wuhan, China) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (AB-FBS-DIA1050, ABW, Shanghai, China) and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin-gentamicin solution (G4014-100ML, Servicebio, Wuhan, China). VERO cells were cultured in DMEM (G4524-500ML, Servicebio, Wuhan, China) supplemented with 10% FBS (AB-FBS-DIA1050, ABW, China) and 100 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin–gentamicin solution (G4014-100ML, Servicebio, Wuhan, China). Celmoderatels were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO 2 6 4.4. RT-qPCR Total RNA was extracted from treated cells at the predefined working concentrations (CAL-27: CXB 60 μM, 4b 4d 5f 4b 4d 5f The PCR protocol consisted of initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 30 s. All reactions were performed in triplicate, with melting curve analysis confirming amplification specificity. Primer sequences are provided in Table 2 2 − Δ Δ CT 4.5. Cell Proliferation Assay CAL-27, SAS, and VERO cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells per well. At specified time intervals, 10 μL of Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) reagent (K1018, Apexbio, Boston, MA, USA) was added to each well and incubated for 2 h. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Infinite M200 Pro, Tecan Group, Männedorf, Switzerland). 4.6. Cellular Migration Assay Following 24 h drug treatment at the predefined working concentrations, CAL-27 and SAS cells (5 × 10 5 10 5 2 4.7. Hoechst 33342 Staining After 24 h drug treatment at the predefined working concentrations, CAL-27 and SAS cells were dyed with 300 μL Hoechst 33342 staining (C1022, Beyotime, China) in the dark at 37 °C for 10 min. Then, the residual Hoechst 33342 staining was washed 3 times with 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, G4250-500ML, Servicebio, China). The images were then immediately examined under an inverted fluorescence microscope (CX23, Olympus, Japan). 4.8. Flow Cytometry (FCM) Analysis—Measurement of Apoptosis After 24 h drug treatment at the predefined working concentrations, CAL-27 and SAS cells were trypsinized, centrifuged (200× g 10 4 4.9. Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) With the aim of determining COX-2 concentrations in OSCC cell lines after treatment at the predefined working concentrations, we used a specialized ELISA kit (F0564-A, FANKEW, Shanghai, China), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 40 μL of the sample dilution and 10 μL of the sample (sample final dilution is 5-fold) were added to testing sample wells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. After that, discard the liquid and wash the plate using washing buffer. Repeat 5 times, drying by patting. Subsequently, samples were incubated with 50 μL of HRP-conjugate reagent in each well for 30 min at 37 °C. Wash 5 times, then add Chromogen Solution A and B and incubate for 10 min at 37 °C. Lastly, 50 μL of stop solution was added to each well to stop the reaction, and the sample absorbance was measured using a microplate reader at 450 nm after adding stop solution within 15 min. 4.10. Western Blotting Analysis Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000× g 4.11. Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics were presented as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical differences between groups were assessed using two-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). A p 5. Conclusions In summary, our study demonstrates that the novel pyrazole N-aryl sulfonate derivatives—potent selective COX-2 inhibitors—effectively suppress proliferation, migration, and survival in CAL-27 and SAS cells, likely through inhibition of the JAK/STAT3 signaling axis. These compounds represent promising lead candidates for OSCC-targeted therapy, offering a dual mechanism of action that combines COX-2 suppression with downstream blockade of pro-survival pathways. By bridging the gap between COX-2 biology and JAK/STAT3-driven oncogenesis, this work provides a strategic framework for developing precision therapies against therapy-resistant OSCC subtypes.
