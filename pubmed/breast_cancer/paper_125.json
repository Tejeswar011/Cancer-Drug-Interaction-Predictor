SUMMARY Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) is an autoimmune disorder of the orbit that occurs predominantly in Grave’s hyperthyroidism, while it is an uncommon clinical finding in patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) and hypothyroidism. We report the case of a 62-year-old female patient who presented with left eyelid edema, proptosis, diplopia, and lateral paralysis of the left eye. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits showed retrobulbar mass in the left orbit with hyperintense signals within left medial rectus muscle, offsetting but not infiltrating the optic nerve.

It affects females more frequently, with a four to one female to male ratio, as the age-adjusted incidence rate stands at 16 cases per per per 1 2 3 4 4 5 5 6 Case Report A 62-year-old Caucasian female patient presented to an oncology specialist with progressive left eye proptosis, left upper eyelid swelling, corneal dryness, diplopia, and lateral paralysis of the left eye ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Patient’s eyes on first appointment presenting left eye proptosis. The patient was referred to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits, which depicted biconvex, retrobulbar, well-limited formation in the left orbit, with signal hyperintensity on postcontrast T1-weighted images ( Fig. 2 Fig. 3 Fig. 2 Retrobulbar formation in the left orbit with signal hyperintensity on MRI postcontrast T1-weighted images: (a) axial plane; (b) coronal plane. Fig. 3 The mass within the left medial rectus muscle and discrete enlargement of the right medial rectus muscle on MRI short tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences in coronal plane. An 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( 18 18 Fig. 4a Fig. 4b Fig. 4 18F-FDG PET/CT scan: (a) increased 18F-FDG uptake in the expansive mass within bilateral medial rectus muscles; (b) increased 18F-FDG uptake in the thyroid gland. Laboratory investigations used electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) and showed increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, as well as substantially high anti-thyroid-peroxidase (anti-TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) antibody levels, while TRAb were negative. Ultrasound examination demonstrated a thyroid gland of total volume of 10 mL (weight estimated at 11 grams), appearing in a diffuse parenchyma pattern with no focal nodes. The patient was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis), subclinical hypothyroidism and TAO of moderate severity. Thus, levothyroxine therapy was introduced. Gradual medication dosage calibration was achieved within a year, with optimal dose becoming 125 µg of levothyroxine per per os Discussion The successful outcome of the presented case indicates that prompt correction of hypothyroidism by thyroid hormone replacement therapy can significantly improve symptoms of TAO and render surgical interventions unnecessary, even if clinical manifestations are marked to a smaller extent, with less soft-tissue involvement and more asymmetric disease. Since hypothyroid patients with TAO are scarcely reported in the literature, there are no clear guidelines for treatment. According to the European Group on Graves’ Ophthalmopathy (EUGOGO), it is recommended that all patients with GO, after initial assessment, be referred to a physician with clinical experience in managing thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy ( 7 The particularity of this case is a TRAb negative TAO patient.
