Recently, the combination of ‘medicinal food’ products such as the plant Crataegus pinnatifida and its interaction with the gut microbiota has shown promise as an alternative therapeutic strategy to treat obesity. Methods We obtained secondary metabolites (SMs) of obesity-related gut microbiota and Crataegus pinnatifida from gutMGene database and NAPSS database. bioinformatics analysis was used to elucidate key target and signaling pathways, whereas molecular docking (MD), molecular dynamics simulation and quantum chemical calculations identified crucial SMs involved in these pathways. The toxicity and physicochemical properties of these SMs were also assessed. Results Phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1), a key mediator in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/ Protein Kinase B (Akt) pathway that is crucial for regulating insulin signaling and adipogenesis, emerged as the central hub within the PPI network. Strong binders to PIK3R1 were predicted to be quercetin, kaempferol and naringenin chalcone, suggesting their potential as therapeutic agents to treat obesity. Conclusion The synergistic combination of Crataegus pinnatifida and the obesity-related gut microbiota holds promise as a novel therapeutic strategy for obesity by targeting PIK3R1 and modulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Further experimental validation is necessary to confirm these findings.

Introduction Obesity is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by the dysregulation of energy homeostasis and excessive accumulation of body fat [ 1 2 3 5 Metabolic disorders including diabetes and obesity can potentially be treated with natural products via the modulation of blood glucose and lipid levels. These natural products also interact with the gut microbiota. The intestinal microbiota is a large and diverse group of microorganisms that reside in the human intestine, forming an ecosystem often referred to as a “metabolic organ” that communicates with the host. Beneficial bacteria in this system can produce and metabolize SMs, such as short-chain fatty acids, which are important for obesity regulation [ 6 7 Crataegus pinnatifida is a medicinal shrub that has the potential to treat a range of health conditions, as it has been reported to have antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties and is able to prevent cardiovascular diseases [ 8 10 11 12 13 The gut microbiota, the largest and most diverse group of microorganisms residing in the human intestine, forms a complex ecosystem often referred to as a “metabolic organ” [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 Hence, we aimed to identify key SMs that can mitigate obesity by exploring those associated with Crataegus pinnatifida and the obesity-related gut microbiota. We also used network pharmacology and bioinformatics to identify key gene targets and signaling pathways for these SMs with the final objective of determining the feasibility of using Crataegus pinnatifida and obesity-related gut microbiota in the management of obesity. We summarize the analysis process of the entire study in Fig 1 10.1371/journal.pone.0332038.g001 Fig 1 The flowchart of this study. 2. Methods 2.1 Identification of SMs and targets of obesity-related gut microbiota Obesity-related gut microbiota were identified by querying data from healthy and obese individuals in the GMrepo database (screening threshold |LDA score| > 2) [ 20 https://bio-annotation.cn/gutmgene/ 21 https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ https://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/ 2.2 Identification of SMs and targets of Crataegus pinnatifida The SMs of Crataegus pinnatifida were obtained from the Natural Product Activity & Species Source database ( http://bidd.group/NPASS/ 22 2.3 Identification of combined targets for Crataegus pinnatifida and obesity-related gut microbiota for obesity treatment Obesity-related targets were obtained from the combination of targets retrieved via the keywords “obesity” from DisGeNET ( https://www.disgenet.org/ https://www.genecards.org/ https://www.omim.org/ VennDiagram 23 2.4 Construction of a protein-protein interaction network The STRING database ( https://string-db.org/ 2.5 Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis We performed GO ( www.geneontology.org/ www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html clusterProfiler 24 pathview 25 2.6 Downloading and processing the obesity dataset The obesity dataset GSE88837 GEOquery 26 27 Homo sapiens GSE88837 limma 28 2.7 Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) The top 5000 genes were filtered and selected for WGCNA analysis based on the p-value of differential analysis. WGCNA was performed via the WGCNA 29 2 2.8 Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) The gene sets used in GSEA were obtained from the C2 collections in the MSigDB database using the msigdbr function in the msigdbr 2.9 Screening of core diagnostic genes The candidate genes were those at the intersection of the DEGs and module genes identified via WGCNA. We performed the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) via the glmnet 30 2.10 Construction of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and nomograms for diagnostic genes The diagnostic performance of the core diagnostic genes was evaluated by constructing ROC curves using the pROC 31 rms 32 2.11 Immune infiltration analysis The GSVA GSEABase 2.12 Molecular docking The crystal structures of the target proteins were obtained from the Protein Data Bank ( https://www.rcsb.org/ 2.13 Quantum chemical (QC) calculations The Gaussian16 package was used to perform QC calculations on the SMs, employing the B3LYP functional with D3 empirical dispersion correction. We optimized the geometries and conducted frequency calculations using the def2-SVP basis set. Multiwfn 3.8 software was then used to extract cube files and orbital energies for the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Finally, ChimeraX 1.7 was used to visualize the orbital diagrams. 2.14 MD simulations To predict the binding of SMs to the core targets, MD simulations were conducted via the Desmond program. The OPLS2005 force field was employed to parameterize the interactions, whereas the TIP3P model simulated water molecules. The SM-target complexes were immersed in a cubic water box. To maintain system neutrality, 0.15 M chloride and sodium ions were added. Prior to the simulation, the energy was minimized over 50,000 steps via the steepest descent method to achieve an initial stable state. Following energy minimization, two equilibrium stages were performed: 50,000 steps of NVT equilibrium were followed by an equal number of NPT equilibrium steps. During these stages, the heavy atom positions were restricted to facilitate system adaptation to the simulation environment. An unconstrained 100 ns simulation was subsequently conducted to observe the dynamic behavior of the complexes in the free state. Trajectory data, including energy and coordinates, were saved every 10 ps. Throughout the simulations, the temperature and pressure were maintained at 300 K and 1 bar, respectively, to reproduce physiological conditions. 2.15 Pharmacokinetics and toxicology prediction Pharmacokinetic profiles of selected SMs were predicted SwissADME website ( http://www.swissadme.ch/ https://tox.charite.de/protox3/ 2.16 Statistical analysis All data calculations and statistical analyzes were performed via R programming ( https://www.r-project.org/ S1 File 3. Results 3.1 Network pharmacology analysis 3.1.1 Crataegus pinnatifida SMs and their targets. From the NPASS database, we identified 55 Crataegus pinnatifida-derived SMs, all of which complied with Lipinski’s rule of five. Using SwissTargetPrediction, we discovered 544 targets associated with these SMs, which are therefore considered potential regulatory targets. 3.1.2 Obesity-related gut microbiota SMs and their targets. We identified 126 obesity-related gut microbiota from the GMrepo database. These microbes were cross-referenced with the gutMgene database, leading to the identification of 71 SMs. The targets of these 610 SMs were determined via SwissTargetPrediction. 3.1.3 Crataegus pinnatifida and obesity-related gut microbiota combined targets. We compiled 10,481 obesity-related targets from the DisGeNET, GeneCards and OMIM databases. The intersection of these targets with SMs derived from Crataegus pinnatifida, obesity-related gut microbiota metabolites and obesity-related targets yielded 329 targets ( Fig 2A 10.1371/journal.pone.0332038.g002 Fig 2 Network pharmacology analysis. (A) (B) (C) (D-F) (G) (H) 3.1.4 Construction of the PPI network and identification of core targets. These 329 targets were input into the STRING database (confidence threshold of 0.9), resulting in 254 targets for further analysis. These targets were then used to construct a PPI network ( Fig 2B Fig 2C Fig 2D F 3.1.5 GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were performed on these 254 targets. GO analysis indicated that these targets are involved primarily in biological processes such as response to xenobiotic stimulus, steroid metabolic process, and hormone metabolic process; cellular components such as neuronal cell body, membrane raft and membrane microdomain; and molecular functions such as protein tyrosine kinase activity, nuclear receptor activity and ligand−activated transcription factor activity ( Fig 2G Fig 2H S1 Table 3.2 Bioinformatics validation 3.2.1 Determination of DEGs in obesity. The thresholds for DEGs were set at |log2(FC)| > 0.585 and p value < 0.05 and were visualized via volcano plots ( Fig 3A S2 Table 10.1371/journal.pone.0332038.g003 Fig 3 Identification of key genes and correlation analysis. (A) (B) (C) (D) 3.2.2 GO and KEGG enrichment analysis of key genes. We conducted GO and KEGG analysis on 1036 differential genes from the dataset. GO analysis revealed that these genes are involved primarily in biological processes such as cell chemotaxis, connective tissue development and humoral immune response; cellular components such as collagen−containing extracellular matrix, endoplasmic reticulum lumen and secretory granule lumen; and molecular functions such as glycosaminoglycan binding, heparin binding and extracellular matrix structural constituent ( Fig 4A Fig 4B S3 Table 10.1371/journal.pone.0332038.g004 Fig 4 Enrichment analysis.

To evaluate the impact of gene expression levels on obesity, we utilized GSEA to explore the relationships between gene expression and related biological processes and pathways. The results showed that all genes in the dataset were significantly enriched in signaling pathways such as KEGG_MAPK_SIGNALING_PATHWAY ( Fig 4C Fig 4D Fig 4E Fig 4F Fig 4G Fig 4H 3.2.4 WGCNA results.

To identify the core diagnostic genes among these genes, we applied a machine learning algorithm. The LASSO regression models were built from data from obese and normal tissues, and the λ analysis indicated that the model achieved optimal predictive accuracy for obesity at λ = 4, leading to the identification of 4 core diagnostic genes, including HSD11B1, RXRG, G6PD and PIK3R1 ( Fig 6A B 10.1371/journal.pone.0332038.g006 Fig 6 Machine learning algorithm and nomogram model construction for obesity.

To further assess the diagnostic utility of these genes, we constructed a nomogram model ( Fig 6C Fig 6D Fig 6E Fig 6F Fig 6G 3.2.7 Immune infiltration analysis. Using the ssGSEA algorithm, we analyzed the correlations between 28 types of immune cells and the normal and obese groups ( Fig 7A 7B Fig 7C 10.1371/journal.pone.0332038.g007 Fig 7 Immune infiltration analysis. (A) (B) C. 3.3 Network pharmacology and bioinformatics joint analysis 3.3.1 Identification of obesity treatment targets by Crataegus pinnatifida and the gut microbiota. Through network pharmacology analysis, we revealed that SMs of Crataegus pinnatifida and obesity-related gut microbiota could target obesity by interacting with PIK3R1, PIK3CB, SRC, PIK3CA and PIK3 CD. Complementary bioinformatics analysis revealed four key targets associated with obesity onset: HSD11B1, RXRG, G6PD and PIK3R1. By combining the targets identified via both approaches, PIK3R1 was selected as the likely protein target by which Crataegus pinnatifida and obesity-related gut microbiota may be able to treat obesity ( Fig 8A Fig 8B 10.1371/journal.pone.0332038.g008 Fig 8 Joint analysis. (A) (B) 3.3.2 Molecular docking results. To evaluate the potential of the identified SMs in targeting PIK3R1, we conducted molecular docking studies. Among the six SMs predicted to interact with PIK3R1, four were predicted to have strong binding affinities (binding energies of less than −5 kcal/mol) ( Fig 9A 9D S4 Table 10.1371/journal.pone.0332038.g009 Fig 9 Molecular docking results. The four SMs that docked well with PIK3R1 were quercetin (A) (B) (C) (D) 3.3.3 Quantum chemical calculations. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels provide insight into the electron donation and acceptance capabilities of a molecule. Gaussian calculations revealed the HOMO‒LUMO energies of three SMs, quercetin, kaempferol and naringenin chalcone ( Fig 10A 10C 10.1371/journal.pone.0332038.g010 Fig 10 Molecular structure and HOMO–LUMO orbital diagram of quercetin (A), kaempferol (B) and naringenin chalcone (C). 3.3.4 Molecular dynamics simulation. We conducted a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation to study the interactions between the SMs and the PIK3R1 protein. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the protein-SM complexes indicated that the system reached a stable state at approximately 40 ns ( Fig 11A 12A 13A Fig 11B 12B 13B 10.1371/journal.pone.0332038.g011 Fig 11 Molecular dynamics simulation results of quercetin with PIK3R1.

However, they all inhibited isoforms CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 ability. This suggests that there may be a risk of drug interaction.The toxicological analysis results suggested that kaempferol has no activity against any of the tested toxins. In contrast, quercetin exhibited active toxicity in the carcinogenicity and mutagenicity assays, remaining inactive for other toxicities. Naringenin chalcone had active toxicity in the immunotoxicity but was inactive for the other assessed toxicities ( Table 1 10.1371/journal.pone.0332038.t001 Table 1 The pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity of key SMs. Kaempferol Quercetin Naringenin chalcone GI absorption High High High BBB permeant No No No Pgp substrate No No No Lipinski Yes Yes Yes CYP1A2 inhibitor Yes Yes Yes CYP2C19 inhibitor No No No CYP2C9 inhibitor No No Yes CYP2D6 inhibitor Yes Yes No CYP3A4 inhibitor Yes Yes Yes Toxicity Class 5 3 5 LD50 (mg/kg) 3919 159 3600 Hepatotoxicity (Probability) Inactive (0.68) Inactive (0.69) Inactive (0.60) Carcinogenicity (Probability) Inactive (0.72) Active (0.68) Inactive (0.67) Immunotoxicity (Probability) Inactive (0.96) Inactive (0.87) Active (0.82) Mutagenicity (Probability) Inactive (0.52) Active (0.51) Inactive (0.80) Cytotoxicity (Probability) Inactive (0.98) Inactive (0.99) Inactive (0.74) 4. Discussion Obesity is a metabolic disorder, and effective strategies for its prevention and treatment are needed. The metabolites produced by the obesity-related gut microbiota and those derived from Crataegus pinnatifida can be used to manage obesity. Through network pharmacology analysis and bioinformatics analysis, we identified key pathways and targets for Crataegus pinnatifida and obesity-related gut microbiota for obesity treatment. In the present study, network pharmacology results showed that Crataegus pinnatifida combined with the obesity-related gut microbiota may treat obesity by targeting PIK3R1, PIK3CB, SRC, PIK3CA, PIK3 CD. Through the bioinformatics analysis, we identified HSD11B1, RXRG, G6PD, and PIK3R1 as core genes for the interplay between Crataegus pinnatifida and the obesity-related gut microbiota in obesity regulation. By integrating network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis, we identified PIK3R1 as the ultimate target for Crataegus pinnatifida combined with the obesity-related gut microbiota in the treatment of obesity. Consistent with our bioinformatics findings, previous study has demonstrated elevated PIK3R1 expression in white adipose tissue of high-fat diet-induced obese mice [ 33 GO and KEGG results showed that Crataegus pinnatifida and obesity-related gut microbiota potential therapeutic targets were mainly involved in PI3K−Akt signaling pathway, the Endocrine resistance and Steroid hormone biosynthesis in network pharmacology analysis. In addition, we performed KEGG enrichment analysis on the differentially expressed genes in obese patients in the dataset and found that these obesity-related differentially expressed genes were mainly involved in PI3K−Akt signaling pathway, Cytokine−cytokine receptor interaction and MAPK signaling pathway. These results indicate that PIK3R1 and PI3K−Akt signaling pathways are the core targets and pathways for Crataegus pinnatifida and obesity-related gut microbiota in the treatment of obesity. This pathway is a key component of insulin signaling, where the effects of insulin on adipogenesis are mediated by PI3K/Akt signaling [ 34 35 36 37 38 39 Finally, molecular docking predicted that, among the eight predicted SMs, quercetin, kaempferol and naringenin chalcone would have the highest binding affinity to PIK3R1, which is supported by MD simulations. Quercetin is one of the most abundant flavonoids and is widely found in vegetables and fruits [ 40 41 42 43 44 In our study, quercetin was derived mainly from Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides ovatus, and C. pinnafitida. Analysis of the GMrepo database revealed that Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides ovatus exhibited LDA scores of −4.198 and −4.078, respectively, demonstrating significant enrichment in healthy populations. As prominent members of the Bacteroidetes phylum, these anaerobic bacteria colonize the mammalian gastrointestinal tract where they establish stable, symbiotic relationships with their host [ 45 46 47 48 47 49 50 Our toxicology prediction results using ProTox 3.0 showed that while quercetin may have mutagenic and carcinogenic potential, kaempferol appears to be non-toxic, and naringenin chalcone only demonstrated predicted immunotoxicity. However, these computational predictions contrast with established in vivo findings for quercetin. Multiple in vivo studies have consistently demonstrated that quercetin does not exhibit mutagenic activity, as evidenced by negative results in comprehensive genotoxicity assessments including micronucleus formation, chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchange, unscheduled DNA synthesis, and alkali-labile DNA damage [ 51 52 In summary, our study clarified the potential mechanism and importance of Crataegus pinnatifida and gut microbiota as adjuvant therapy for obesity. However, we still need more basic experiments and clinical studies to confirm the effectiveness of Crataegus pinnatifida, gut microbiota and their SMs. 5. Limitations of the study Our study used plant databases and microbial databases, and through bioinformatics methods, explored and organized Crataegus pinnatifida, obesity-related gut microbiota, SMs, targets, and pathways to explore their key roles in obesity treatment and provide a theoretical basis for clinical adjuvant treatment. However, as a data analysis study, our findings require further validation through in vitro and in vivo experiments to confirm the predicted mechanisms. In addition, this requires subsequent clinical treatment analysis of the gut microbiota we screened and Crataegus pinnatifida in appropriate proportions to obtain more accurate experimental results. 6. Conclusion Our integrative approach using network pharmacology and bioinformatics predicts that targeting the PIK3R1 gene and modulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway can ameliorate obesity. The pathway can be targeted by SMs produced by Crataegus pinnatifida and by obesity-related gut microbiota. This prediction highlights the pivotal role of PIK3R1 in regulating adipogenesis, suggesting a promising avenue for obesity treatment. Our molecular docking and dynamics simulations identified quercetin, kaempferol and naringenin chalcone as potent binders to PIK3R1, opening new perspectives for microbiome-based therapies. These predictions require extensive in vitro and in vivo validation to translate these findings into clinical applications.
