Background Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality among breast cancer survivors, particularly affecting Hispanic women due to a high burden of comorbidities and treatment-related toxicities. However, real-world cardiovascular risk and treatment patterns in this population remain under-characterized. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of 394 Hispanic patients with stage I–III breast cancer treated with curative intent between 2022 and 2023 at two institutions in the Southwestern U.S. Data included demographics, cancer therapy, cardiovascular comorbidities, and medication use. Results The cohort had a mean age of 59.9 years and a mean BMI of 30.1 kg/m². Cardiovascular comorbidities were present in 57.5% of patients, which appears numerically higher than rates reported in prior breast cancer cohorts (~40%). Hypertension (45.7%) and diabetes (24.3%) also appeared numerically more common than prior national estimates. Among hypertensive patients, 73.9% were receiving antihypertensives, which is numerically lower than previously published rates (~77%). In contrast, 94.2% of patients with hyperlipidemia were on statins, numerically higher than prior reports (~70%). All patients with CVD were receiving aspirin. Chemotherapy was administered to 66% of the cohort, a numerically higher rate than prior Hispanic breast cancer studies (~48%). Anthracycline use (19.2%) aligned with national de-escalation trends. Conclusion Hispanic patients with breast cancer in the Southwestern U.S. face a high burden of cardiovascular disease and numerically lower rates of antihypertensive use. These findings support the need for regionally tailored, integrated cardio-oncology approaches. breast neoplasms Hispanic cardiotoxicity hypertension disparities The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-in-acceptance Cardio-Oncology Introduction In 2024, approximately 43,700 women in the U.S. are expected to die from breast cancer ( 1 2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 394 self-identified Hispanic patients with stage I–III breast cancer who received treatment with curative intent at two academic cancer centers in the Southwestern United States: The University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UNMCCC) and the UT Health San Antonio Mays Cancer Center (UTHSCSA). The study period spanned from January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2023. Eligible patients were ≥18 years old, identified as Hispanic in the electronic health record, and had histologically confirmed stage I–III breast cancer. Patients with incomplete medical records or those treated with palliative intent were excluded. The final analytic cohort included 195 patients from UNMCCC and 199 from UTHSCSA. Data were abstracted from institutional electronic medical records—Cerner PowerChart (UNMCCC) and Epic (UTHSCSA)—by trained clinical researchers using a standardized REDCap database. Collected variables included demographics (age, sex, BMI, race), tumor characteristics (stage, receptor subtype), treatment modalities (chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, HER2-targeted therapy), and comorbid cardiovascular conditions. Cardiovascular comorbidities were defined based on either a documented diagnosis in the medical record or active use of related medications during cancer treatment. These included hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, myocardial infarction, heart failure, arrhythmias, stroke, cardiomyopathy, and vascular disease. Medication use data included antihypertensives, statins, and aspirin. Chemotherapy administration was defined as receipt of at least one cycle during the study period. The primary outcomes were prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities and use of cardioprotective medications. Secondary outcomes included institution-level variations in treatment patterns, including chemotherapy regimen, BMI distribution, and cardiovascular medication use. Data were abstracted using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at the University of New Mexico and the University of Texas Health San Antonio (RRID: SCR_003445). Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 28; RRID: SCR_002865). No core facilities, cell lines, antibodies, organisms, or external databases requiring RRIDs were used in this study. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics and treatment variables. Categorical variables were reported as counts and percentages; continuous variables were summarized using means and standard deviations. This study was designed as a descriptive analysis to characterize cardiovascular comorbidities and treatment patterns among Hispanic breast patients with breast cancer. No hypothesis testing, comparative analyses, or multivariable modeling were performed, as the primary objective was to provide descriptive, real-world data rather than infer causality. Results The study included 394 self-identified Hispanic patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Of these, 195 patients were treated at the University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UNMCCC) and 199 at the UT Health San Antonio Mays Cancer Center (UTHSCSA) (  Table 1 Table 1 Demographic and treatment characteristics by institution.

Most patients were diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive disease (80.1%), followed by triple-negative (14.7%) and HER2-positive (19.2%) subtypes. Chemotherapy was administered to 66% of the total cohort, with 19.2% receiving anthracyclines and 15.3% receiving HER2-targeted therapies. Immunotherapy was used in 9.4% of patients. A notable percentage of patients (34.2% at UTHSCSA and 26.8% at UNMCCC) did not receive chemotherapy. Radiation therapy was administered to 58.5% of patients across both institutions.

Our study extends this body of work by focusing exclusively on Hispanic patients in the Southwestern U.S., a region with documented disparities but limited published cardio-oncology data ( 9 13 5 4 A lower proportion (73.9%) of antihypertensive use among patients with hypertension was observed when compared to prior reports ( 3 5 9 4 4 Chemotherapy was administered to 66% of the cohort, which is numerically higher than previous studies in Hispanic populations reporting treatment rates near 48% ( 2 3 Institutional differences were observed in both cardiovascular risk profiles and treatment strategies. For example, UTHSCSA patients had a numerically higher mean BMI and lower chemotherapy rates compared to those at UNMCCC. These differences may reflect differences in patient mix or institutional practice, though causality cannot be inferred ( 6 7 The findings highlight the complex interplay between cancer care and cardiovascular health in Hispanic patients. Given the increasing awareness of cardiovascular disease as a leading cause of death in breast cancer survivors ( 1 6 Future studies should evaluate longitudinal cardiovascular outcomes and test care models designed to improve coordination between oncology and cardiology services. Additionally, interventions to enhance medication adherence and access to preventive care may reduce long-term morbidity in this growing and underserved patient population. Conclusion This research reveals the high rate of cardiovascular comorbidities in a predominantly middle-aged Hispanic female cohort with majority hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. The findings underscore the importance of understanding demographic and clinical characteristics to tailor interventions. Future studies should focus on expanding data collection and examining the relationships between treatment regimens and cardiovascular health outcomes to better care for Hispanic patients with breast cancer. Designing programs tailored for this specific population could be beneficial in achieving these goals.
