The risk factors of BC are various, among which obesity has been proved to be closely related to the incidence and progression of BC, especially in postmenopausal women. Obesity leads to elevated estrogen levels, increased inflammatory factors, and insulin resistance, which are considered to increase the risk of BC. Microbial dysbiosis has emerged as an important element in the development and progression of various cancers, including BC. Meanwhile, Firmicutes, a phylum enriched in the gut microbiota, can affect the metabolism of estrogen and progesterone, which explains part of its role in promoting the development of BC. This review highlights the “obesity–microbiota–hormone–breast cancer” axis, focusing on Firmicutes influence on BC in hormone levels. We also explore potential methods to prevent obesity-related BC and improve patient survival outcomes by regulating gut microbiota. To identify relevant studies, we conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus up to April 2025 using a combination of MeSH terms and free-text keywords related to obesity, microbiota, hormones, and BC.

Furthermore, we propose the “obesity-microbiota-hormone-breast cancer axis” as a mechanism influencing BC development, integrating microbiology, endocrinology, and oncology. We also explore potential future interventions targeting the gut microbiota for BC. These approaches could contribute to the development of microbiota-based therapies. Additionally, they may enhance the clinical management of BC. Obesity and BC: the microbiome’s role Body mass index (BMI) has been inversely associated with premenopausal and positively associated with postmenopausal BC [ 20 2 21 23 24 27 28 29 Notably, obesity creates a cancer-friendly environment by inducing chronic inflammation [ 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 In addition to the systemic metabolic changes mentioned above, the gut microbiota plays a significant role in the incidence and treatment outcomes of BC. Obesity has been shown to cause dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, leading to significant changes in microbial diversity [ 42 43 44 45 46 46 Goedert et al. reported that postmenopausal women with BC exhibit altered fecal microbiota composition, with a lower alpha diversity independent of estrogen [ 47 48 48 49 49 Overview of gut microbiota and firmicutes The gut microbiota, a collective term for the microbial community residing in the human gut, has emerged as one of the most compelling areas of research in microbiology [ 50 51 52 53 The human gut microbiota contains dozens of bacterial phyla, including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes [ 54 55 49 56 1 Alicyclobacillus Bacillus Clostridium Enterococcus Erysipelothrix Eubacterium Haloanaerobium Heliobacterium Lachnospira Lactobacillus Leuconostoc Listeria Paenibacillus Peptococcus Ruminococcus Staphylococcus Streptococcus Syntrophomonas Thermoactinomyces Thermoanaerobacter Veillonella 57 Faecalibacterium prausnitzii 58 59 60 Clostridium perfringens 61 Staphylococcus aureus 62 The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio) plays a key role in preserving gut microbial balance. Changes in this ratio are associated with various pathologies [ 63 64 66 A study comparing stool samples from Japanese individuals with different body weights found that non-obese participants had an average Firmicutes level of 37.0 ± 9.1%, while obese participants had 40.8 ± 15.0%. For Bacteroidetes, non-obese individuals showed 44.0 ± 9.8%, whereas obese individuals had 37.0 ± 14.0% [ 67 16 68 69 70  Fig. 1 General characteristics of Firmicutes in the human gut, including their key features, specific effects, and current research focus on the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio.

(Created with Adobe Illustrator 2020) Firmicutes and hormonal modulation The regulation of estrogen is crucial for women’s health, as it influences a wide range of physiological processes, including reproductive health [ 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 Estrogen, the main sex hormone in women, is released into the bloodstream. It is then inactivated in the liver through binding with glucuronic acid and other compounds, which enhances its solubility in water. This modification allows estrogen to be excreted via the kidneys in urine, with some also excreted through bile into the intestine. Microbially secreted β-glucuronidase can metabolize estrogens from its conjugate forms to deconjugated forms [ 17 17 81 82 82 82 83 Many researchers have focused on the role of Firmicutes in hormone metabolism. The following summarizes selected studies on members of Firmicutes. Studies have shown that Bacteroides melaninogenicus 84 Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 85 86 90 Eubacterium limosum 91 Clostridia Ruminococcaceae 80 Hormones significantly regulate gut microbiota composition and function, impacting various aspects of host physiology. Further research in microbial endocrinology has revealed that catecholamines [ 92 84 93 94 95 lactobacilli 96 Previous studies on the members and functions of Firmicutes related to estrogen levels through enterohepatic recirculation have highlighted the interaction between Firmicutes and hormones like estrogen and progesterone. This interaction plays a role in several pathways that influence women’s health. These interactions may influence various physiological aspects, including fertility, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. The Firmicutes-hormone axis represents a critical link between gut microbiota and hormonal regulation, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for improving women’s health outcomes. Mechanisms linking firmicutes and BC in obese populations As we mentioned above, a key characteristic of the gut microbiota in obese individuals is its dysbiosis, which is marked by an overrepresentation of Firmicutes [ 57 17 13 Estrogen receptor-positive BC is the most common subtype [ 97 98 99 Clostridium leptum Clostridium coccoides 100 Firmicutes 100 Firmicutes have been shown to significantly affect estrogen and progesterone levels, thereby regulating the development and progression of cancer. It is clear that the dysbiosis observed in the gut microbiota of obese individuals increases the risk of BC by influencing hormone regulation. The “obesity-microbiota-hormone-breast cancer” axis provides a valuable framework for understanding this physiological process and offers potential avenues for future research and therapeutic interventions. Influence of gut microbiota on the BC treatments New evidence suggests that the gut microbiota may play a crucial role in BC development and treatment by influencing drug efficacy and toxicity, including responses to chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and other targeted therapies (Table 1 101 102 103 Chemotherapy remains a cornerstone of BC treatment that uses drugs to target and destroy cancer cells [ 104 105 106 107 Lactobacillus Enterococcus 56 56 Raoultella planticola 108 109 Pseudomonas aeruginosa 110 111 112 112 F.nucleatum F.nucleatum 113 114 There is compelling evidence to suggest that the composition of the gut microbiota can influence the efficacy of anti-HER2 therapies in BC, particularly in patients with HER2-positive tumors. Di Modica, M. et al. explored the link between gut bacterial composition and trastuzumab response in HER2-positive patients [ 115 115 Clostridiales Bacteroides 115 116 At the same time, in systemic treatments of cancer, the gut microbiota can affect the metabolism of medical drugs, modulating the immune response to treatment [ 117 118 119 125 120 126 B. longum 127 Bacteroides B. thetaiotaomicron B. fragilis 121 Bifidobacterium 128 B. longum Collinsella aerofaciens Enterococcus faecium 122 Akkermansia Alistipes 123 Ruminococcaceae Clostridales Faecalibacterium 124 125 129 Besides, endocrine therapies, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators, are also affected by gut microbiota. Chen et al. found that tamoxifen and its metabolite 4-hydroxytamoxifen are substrates of bacterial β-glucuronidase, which may limit treatment efficacy by reversing glucuronidation [ 130 131 Additionally, therapeutics can disrupt the gut microbiota composition [ 132 Veillonella 132 133 134 135 132 136 Bacillus stearothermophilus Klebsiella pneumoniae Pseudomonas aeruginosa 136 137 137  Table 1 Summary the effect of gut microbiota on BC therapeutics Therapeutics Study Sample source Main Methodology Results Chemotherapy Ye, Z., 2024[ 111 Female BALB/c mice injected with 4T1and MCF-7 breast cancer cells V3 and V4 16 S rRNA Sequencing The combination of probiotics and anti-tumor drug doxorubicin has a higher tumor inhibition rate Probiotics used alone could not directly induce anti-tumor effects Terrisse, S. et al., 2021[ 132 121 specimens from 76 early BC patients Ion-proton technology (ThermoFisher) Sequencing Fecal microbiota composition at diagnosis is associated with prognosis in early breast cancer (BC) Adjuvant chemotherapy modifies gut microbial β-diversity Certain commensal bacteria are more abundant in BC patients than in healthy individuals These bacteria may negatively influence prognosis They may also contribute to weight gain and neurological side effects during treatment Targeted Therapy Di Modica, M. et al., 2021 [ 115 Female FVB/Ncrl mice injected with human HER2-positive MI6 murine mammary carcinoma cells;24 consecutive patients who received neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy V3 and V4 16 S rRNA sequencing Antibiotic administration has been shown to reduce the therapeutic efficacy of Trastuzumab, suggesting a direct role of the gut microbiota in modulating its activity. In particular, patients who respond well to Trastuzumab are often enriched with bacterial taxa from the Clostridiales Bifidobacteriaceae Turicibacteraceae Bacteroidales Schettini, F. et al., 2023 [ 116 14 metastatic breast cancer patients V3 and V4 16 S rRNA sequencing Microbiota-targeted interventions have been considered as strategies to improve therapeutic response to CDK4/6 inhibitors Immunotherapy Kim, H. et al., 2021 [ 127 Female BALB/c mice injected with 4T1 breast cancer cells 16 S rRNA sequencing Synergistic treatment with B. longum The study by Terrisse, S. et al., 2021 is a registered clinical trial (Clinical trial no. NCT01993498 Our quest for answers: can microbiota be used for BC treatment in obese people Impact of weight reduction surgery on gut microbiota and potential effects on BC risk Given that an imbalance in the gut microbiota of obese individuals may contribute to the development of BC, it is worth exploring whether weight reduction surgery can reverse these microbial alterations and mitigate cancer risk. Evidence from 12 animal experiments and 9 clinical studies suggests that weight reduction surgery induces notable compositional shifts within the phylum Firmicutes, including increases in Lactobacillales Enterococcus Clostridiales Clostridiaceae Blautia Dorea 138 Influence of diet on gut microbiota and estrogen metabolism in BC risk Given that there are various ways to lose weight, can diet adjust the gut microbiota and affect estrogen metabolism? Diet is a major factor influencing gut microbial diversity, and the quality and content of the diet can shape the microbiota [ 139 140 141 142 143 143 144 145 146 147 Potential of GUS inhibitors in preventing BC Given the role of β-glucuronidase in reactivating estrogen metabolites and increasing estrogen bioavailability, could the use of GUS inhibitors help prevent estrogen-driven BC? To date, numerous selective inhibitors targeting human gut microbial β-glucuronidase (GUS) enzymes have been developed [ 148 83 83 83 Potential of fecal microbial transplantation (FMT) in BC treatment The most radical yet efficient means to modify the gut microbiota is FMT. FMT refers to the process of transferring minimally processed stool from a healthy donor into the gastrointestinal tract of a recipient. This procedure is intended to treat conditions linked to imbalances in the gut microbiota [ 149 150 151 152 Role of probiotics and prebiotics in BC prevention and treatment In recent years, probiotics and prebiotics have increasingly entered people’s lives. Does preventive use of probiotics or prebiotics help prevent BC? Probiotics are live beneficial bacteria that help maintain or restore a favorable microbial balance [ 153 155 156 157 Lactobacillus casei 158 Lactobacillus helveticus R389 159 Lactobacillus reuteri 160 Enterococcus faecalis Staphylococcus hominis 161 Lactobacillus brevis KABP052 162 162 Bifidobacterium longum RAPO 127 163 165 166 167 168 170 171 Various strategies can help modulate the gut microbiota. These include weight loss surgery, dietary interventions, fecal microbiota transplantation, and the use of probiotics or prebiotics. Each of these approaches has shown potential in reshaping microbial communities. Modifying the microbiota in this way may offer new options for managing estrogen-driven diseases. BC is one key example. These approaches could help address the metabolic aspects of BC, providing new avenues for its prevention and treatment. Discussion Gut microbiota is often referred to as “the second genome of the human body,” which play a crucial role in various diseases and has attracted widespread attention, especially in cancer research. Studies increasingly highlight its impact on metabolism, immunity, and disease progression. Research on the gut microbiota in BC development and progression has gained increasing attention in recent years. However, the precise mechanisms regarding how gut microbiota influence BC remain largely unclear. Among the proposed mechanisms, estrogen metabolism has emerged as a key pathway, with dysregulation of estrogen homeostasis recognized as a significant risk factor for hormone-dependent BC [ 172 173 18 174 175 Obesity is a known risk factor for both gut microbiota imbalance and BC [ 176 Currently, much of the research on gut microbiota is focused on identifying characteristic microbial profiles associated with healthy individuals versus those with disease. However, there is a significant gap in dynamic studies that track changes in microbiota composition over time or in response to treatment. The variation in experimental protocols, including differences in tissue sources, DNA extraction methods, and microbial analysis techniques, poses challenges for large-scale collaborative research. Standardizing these methodologies would be a significant step forward in advancing our understanding of the relationship between gut microbiota and BC. Additionally, much of the current research predominantly addresses gut microbiota, neglecting the role of the breast microbiota. This gap in focus is significant. Contrary to earlier assumptions, the human breast is not a sterile organ [ 177 177 178 179 180 182 Lactobacillaceae Acetobacteraceae Xanthomonadaceae Ralstonia 183 184 49 185 Conclusion This review describes that the Firmicutes in gut microbiota affects the occurrence and treatment of BC by regulating the metabolic level and bioavailability of hormones. Establishing an “obesity-microbiota-hormone-breast cancer” axis model holds significant potential for advancing our understanding of BC pathogenesis. This axis provides a comprehensive framework for exploring how obesity-induced dysbiosis influences the development and progression of BC. The “obesity-microbiota-hormone-breast cancer” axis highlights the critical role of gut microbiota in preventing BC in obese individuals. It opens new pathways for developing prevention and treatment strategies, focusing on microbiota as a key target in BC management.
