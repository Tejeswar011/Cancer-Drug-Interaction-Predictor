In this study, we examined the impact of gingival connective tissue cells (GCTCs) and periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs), which are involved in the invasive pathway of OSCC, on oral cancer invasion via TAMs recruitment. Transwell (migration) assays were used to examine the effects of GCTCs and PDLCs on the migration of macrophages, which indicated that the interaction between GCTCs and HSC-2/HSC-3 (human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line) promoted the recruitment of macrophages, whereas the interaction between PDLCs was inhibited. An indirect co-culture was then used to examine the effects of GCTCs and PDLCs on the differentiation of macrophages, which indicated that the interaction between GCTCs enhanced their ability to transform into M2-type macrophages. Furthermore, the effects of GCTCs and PDLCs on the recruitment of CD45(+) monocytes, F4/80(+) M0 macrophages, iNOS(+) M1 macrophages, and CD163(+) M2 TAMs were assayed by immunohistochemistry. The results revealed that the interaction between GCTCs and HSC-2/HSC-3 promoted the infiltration of CD45(+) monocytes, F4/80(+) M0 macrophages, and CD163(+) M2 TAMs, whereas the PDLCs inhibited it, while their effect on iNOS(+) M1 macrophages was limited. Collectively, the GCTCs contributed to the infiltration of TAMs into the TME of OSCC cells, whereas the PDLCs exerted an inhibitory effect. These findings suggest a potential regulatory mechanism underlying the progression of OSCC. oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) gingival connective tissue cells (GCTCs) periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) macrophage polarity tumor microenvironment (TME) Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research 22K10170 24K02644 24K13088 24K13130 JST SPRING, Japan JPMJSP2126 5002400009 This study was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (Nos. 22K10170, 24K02644, 24K13088, and 24K13130).

Introduction Solid tumors form a parenchyma–stroma complex, known as the tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME participates in the regulation of tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 8 The TME of OSCC also contributes to tumor progression through interactions between the cancer parenchyma and cancer stroma; previous studies discuss the association between TAMs and tumor progression, focusing only on the direct interactions between cancer cells and TAMs. TAMs are associated with OSCC progression via the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12)/C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) pathway, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and Epidermal growth factor (EGF) production [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that the different invasion abilities of OSCC in GCTCs and PDLCs may be due to the different effects on TAMs recruitment and the differentiation of macrophages in the OSCC TME. To confirm this hypothesis, GCTCs and PDLCs were isolated from patients with wisdom teeth, HSC-2 and HSC-3 were selected as the cancer cell model, and RAW264.7 were selected as the macrophage model to assay the effect of GCTCs and PDLCs on the infiltration and differentiation of TAMs in the TME of OSCC. These findings suggested a new potential regulatory mechanism for the progression of OSCC. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cells and Cell Culture Human oral squamous carcinoma HSC-2 (JCRB0622) and HSC-3 (JCRB0623), as well as the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 (RCB0535), were procured from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank (JCRB) and the RIKEN BioResource Center Cell Bank, respectively. GCTCs and PDLCs were isolated from the normal gingival connective tissue and root surface, respectively, of a 50-year-old male patient and stored as previously described [ 16 2.2. Transwell (Migration) Assay and Giemsa Staining GCTCs and PDLCs were digested and collected using Accutase (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA), and HSC-2, HSC-3, and RAW264.7 were detached and collected using EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) when the confluency of these cells reached approximately 90%. In 24-well plates (Corning, Falcon cell culture inserts; BD Biosciences), the upper chamber of 8 µm Transwell filters without Matrigel was mixed with RAW264.7 cells in α-MEM without FBS at a density of 2 × 10 4 4 4 Figure 1 2.3. Indirect Co-Culture and Immunofluorescence Staining (If) GCTCs and PDLCs were digested and collected using Accutase (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), and HSC-2/HSC-3 and RAW264.7 were digested and collected using EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) when the confluency of these cells reached approximately 90%. GCTCs and PDLCs (3.75 × 10 4 4 4 Figure 2 For IF, the slides were washed thrice with TBS (5 min each). The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and blocked with a blocking solution (DS Pharma Biomedical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) for 20 min. The primary antibodies rat anti-F4/80 (marker of M0 macrophage) (1:10; cat. no. CI:A3-1, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA), iNOS (marker of M1 macrophage) (1:200; cat. no. 18985-1-AP; Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA), and rabbit anti-CD163 (marker of M2 macrophage) (1:200; cat. no. ab182422; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were added, followed by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. After washing them three times with TBS, the secondary antibodies anti-rat IgG Alexa Fluor 488 (1:200; cat. no. A48262; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) and anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 568 (1:200; cat. no. A10042; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. After washing them with TBS and distilled water thrice, the samples were stained with 0.2 g/mL of DAPI (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc., Kumamoto, Japan). The exposure conditions for green (F4/80), red (iNOS, CD163), and blue (DAPI) were 1.2 s, 0.5 s, and 1/15 s, respectively. The stained cells were photographed using an All-in-One BZ-X700 fluorescence microscope (×40 magnification, Keyence Corporation, Osaka, Japan), as well as setting the positive threshold at 30–124. Independent experiments were repeated in triplicate. 2.4. Mouse Model Construction Animal studies were performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Okayama University (approval no. OKU-2022354). Anesthesia was administered using isoflurane in accordance with Okayama University Animal Experiment Committee guidelines. Induction was performed at 5% isoflurane, and sedation was maintained at 2–3%. Adequate anesthesia was confirmed by assessing whether the mice could regain a prone position when placed in a supine posture. After the intraperitoneal anesthesia was administered, mixed cells (HSC-2 or HSC-3, 1 × 10 6 6 18 19 2.5. Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) Staining After four weeks, all mice were humanely euthanized by isoflurane overdose (>5%), and cardiac arrest was confirmed via pulse palpation before performing cervical dislocation. Tumor tissues were excised, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) for 12 h at room temperature, and then decalcified in 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) at 4 °C for 4 weeks. The tissue samples were paraffin-embedded, sectioned into 5 μm slices, and stained with HE. Images were obtained using a bright-field microscope (BX51, Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) at 40× magnification. 2.6. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Staining Serially prepared 5 μm thick sections were subjected to immunohistochemical staining. CD45 (marker of monocyte), F4/80 (marker of M0 macrophage), iNOS (marler of M1 macrophage), and CD163 (marker of M2 macrophage) antigen repair were conducted in a cooker (Renji Katsuryoku Nabe, Asahi Keikinzoku Kogyo Company, Osaka, Japan) and microwave for 8 or 1 min in 0.01 M tri-sodium citrate buffer (pH 6) and 0.01 M Dako Target Retrieval Solution (pH 9; cat. no. S2367; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). They were then blocked with 10% normal serum for 20 min at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies—rabbit anti-CD45 (1:200; cat. no. ab10558, Abcam), rat anti-F4/80 (1:10; cat. no. MCA497, Abcam), rabbit anti-iNOS (1:200; cat. no. 18985-1-AP, Abcam, Proteintech), and anti-CD163 (1:200; cat. no. ab182422; Abcam, Cambridge, UK). After thorough washing, all sections were incubated with avidin–biotin complexes (PK-6101, rabbit ABC kit; Vector Laboratories, Inc., Newark, CA, USA) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were developed using a DAB/H 2 2 2.7. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 10 (GraphPad Software, Inc., Boston, MA, USA). The cell experiments were independently repeated thrice, and the animal experiments were repeated using four consistent mice per group. For comparisons among multiple groups, the non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test was used, followed by the Steel–Dwass post hoc test. A value of p p p p p 3. Results 3.1.

Effects of the Interaction Between GCTCs/PDLCs and HSC-2/HSC-3 on the Histological Findings in the OSCC TME of the Animal Model Firstly, hematoxylin–eosin staining was performed on the resected specimens. In the HSC-2-only group, large tumor nests were observed in the bone and soft tissue invasion area. In the HSC-2 + GCTCs/PDLCs groups, smaller nests were observed at the infiltrative front of the bone and soft tissue area compared to the HSC-2-only group ( Figure 4 Figure 4 3.5. Effects of the Interaction Between GCTCs/PDLCs and HSC-2/HSC-3 on the Infiltration of CD45(+) Monocytes in OSCC TME of Animal Model IHC staining was used to test the CD45(+) monocytes so as to assay the effect of the interaction between the GCTCs/PDLCs and HSC-2/HSC-3 cells on the infiltration of CD45(+) monocytes in the soft tissue and bone tissue invasion areas in front of the OSCC ( Figure 5 Figure 5 In the soft tissue invasion area of the HSC-3-associated experimental group, the infiltration cell number of CD45-positive monocytes at the tumor invasion front showed a similar trend to that of the HSC-2-associated experimental group, the infiltration cell number of CD45-positive monocytes was the highest in the HSC-3 + GCTCs group, which was followed by the HSC-3-only and HSC-3 + PDLCs groups in both the soft tissue and bone tissue invasion areas—and there was a significant difference in each group ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 In the bone and soft tissue invasion areas of all groups, CD45(+) monocytes exhibited oval or spindle shapes and were considered a heterogeneous cell population ( Figure 5 3.6. Effects of the Interaction Between GCTCs/PDLCs and HSC-2/HSC-3 on the Infiltration of F4/80(+) M0 Macrophages in OSCC TME of Animal Model IHC staining was used to test the F4/80(+) M0 macrophages so as to assay the effect of the interaction between the GCTCs/PDLCs and HSC-2/HSC-3 cells on the infiltration of F4/80(+) M0 macrophages into the soft and bone invasion fronts of OSCC cells ( Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 3.7.

Effects of the Interaction Between GCTCs/PDLCs and HSC-2/HSC-3 on the Infiltration of iNOS(+) M1 Macrophages in OSCC TME of Animal Model IHC staining was used to test the iNOS(+) M1 macrophages so as to assay the effect of the interaction between the GCTCs/PDLCs and HSC-2/HSC-3 on the infiltration of iNOS(+) M1 macrophages into the soft and bone tissue invasion fronts of OSCC ( Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 4. Discussion In this study, the fibrous cells established from gingival connective tissue interacting with cancer cell lines accumulated monocyte macrophages in the TME and induced the differentiation of monocyte macrophages into M2 macrophages. In contrast, the fibrous cells established from the periodontal ligament interacting with cancer cell lines inhibited the accumulation of monocyte macrophages in the TME and suppressed the differentiation of monocyte macrophages into M2 macrophages, and concurrently induced a relative increase in M1 macrophages, suggesting a shift in the polarization balance toward an antitumor phenotype. This is the first study to investigate the interaction between cancer parenchyma and peritumoral tissue on the accumulation and differentiation of TAMs, and it is also the first study to demonstrate that the nature of the peritumoral tissue directly affects the accumulation and differentiation of TAMs. This study differs significantly from previous studies on TAMs, which have focused exclusively on cancer parenchyma. The interaction between GCTCs and HSC-2/HSC-3 promoted the infiltration of CD45(+) monocytes/F4/80(+) M0 macrophages into the OSCC TME, whereas the interaction between PDLCs and HSC-2/HSC-3 inhibited it both in vitro and in vivo. Macrophages are a major population of infiltrating leukocytes that are associated with solid tumors [ 20 21 22 14 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Co-culture of GCTCs and HSC-2/HSC-3 promotes the differentiation of monocytes into M2 TAMs. TAMs are characterized by remarkable plasticity and can acquire various intermediate activation stages by simultaneously expressing markers that are associated with both the M1 and M2 phenotypes, although their terminal polarization into M1 or M2 remains a key determinant of their functional roles [ 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 16 42 43 44 45 46 Notably, we observed distinct functional differences between HSC-2 and HSC-3 cells in both the in vitro and in vivo experiments. In the Transwell migration assays, HSC-2 cells consistently attracted more RAW264.7 cells compared to the HSC-3 cells, not only in the single-culture condition but also when co-cultured with either GCTCs or PDLCs. This suggests that HSC-2 cells possess a stronger chemotactic ability toward monocytes/macrophages. In terms of polarization, HSC-2 induced a higher M2 conversion rate than HSC-3, although no significant differences were observed in the proportion of F4/80(+) macrophages between the groups. In the animal model, tumors derived from the HSC-2 + GCTC group exhibited a higher infiltration of CD45(+) monocytes and F4/80(+) macrophages than those in the HSC-3 + GCTC group, which is consistent with the in vitro migration results. Furthermore, the number of iNOS(+) M1 macrophages was significantly higher in the HSC-2 + GCTC group, whereas the M2 macrophage numbers did not differ markedly between the co-culture groups, aside from a slight increase in the HSC-3 group. The overall M1/M2 conversion rates remained comparable across groups. Taken together, these findings suggest that HSC-2, despite being less aggressive than HSC-3 in terms of histological grade, may more potently influence the tumor immune microenvironment by enhancing monocyte recruitment and supporting M1 macrophage polarization. These differences could be due to cell line-specific secretion profiles of chemokines or other immunomodulatory factors and highlight the importance of considering tumor heterogeneity when evaluating TAM behavior and therapeutic strategies [ 47 In this study, we investigated the infiltration of TAMs into two areas: one on the skin side and the other on the bone tissue side. In the soft tissue invasion front, significant differences were observed between the GCTCs and PDLCs groups. However, no significant differences were observed between these groups at the bone tissue invasion front, which may be owing to complex structures such as bone, muscle, and brain in the bone tissue invasion front. In our previous study, we reported that cancer stroma promotes bone destruction by inducing osteoclasts on the bone surface [ 17 However, it is important to note that our study had some limitations. TAMs represent a variety of macrophage subsets that change in response to the cytokine balance within the TME, primarily with an M2-like phenotype [ 48 49 50 51 52 16 5. Conclusions The interaction between GCTCs and HSC-2/HSC-3 promoted the infiltration of TAMs into the TME of OSCC, whereas PDLCs inhibited it. The interaction between GCTCs and HSC-2/HSC-3 had a stronger effect on the differentiation of TAMs than that between PDLCs. These findings reveal the role and function of the peritumoral issue in OSCC progression, providing a new regulatory mechanism for OSCC development.
