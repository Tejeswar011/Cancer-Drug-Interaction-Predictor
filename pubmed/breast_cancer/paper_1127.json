Their “tunable” and “smart” properties enable the precise adjustment of mechanical, chemical, and physical characteristics, allowing responses to specific stimuli such as pH or temperature. These versatile materials offer significant advantages over traditional drug delivery by facilitating targeted, localized, and on-demand therapies. Applications range from diagnostics and wound healing to tissue engineering and, notably, cancer therapy, where they deliver anti-cancer agents directly to tumors, minimizing systemic toxicity. Hydrogels’ design involves careful material selection and crosslinking techniques, which dictate properties like swelling, degradation, and porosity—all crucial for their effectiveness. The development of self-healing, tough, and bio-functional hydrogels represents a significant step forward, promising advanced biomaterials that can actively sense, react to, and engage in complex biological processes for a tailored therapeutic approach. Beyond their mechanical resilience and adaptability, these hydrogels open avenues for next-generation therapies, such as dynamic wound dressings that adapt to healing stages, injectable scaffolds that remodel with growing tissue, or smart drug delivery systems that respond to real-time biochemical cues. hydrogel cancer biomaterials bio-functional Internal Research contract 6059 Internal Research contract, no. 6059, USAMV Cluj. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction 1.1. Hydrogels: Enabling Precision Medicine One well-established and quickly developing area of medicine is precision medicine, which customizes treatments according to a patient’s genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. These findings suggest that hydrogels’ special qualities make them a potential platform for this topic [ 1 2 Since their special qualities may be designed to deliver therapeutic substances precisely where they’re needed without harming healthy tissues, hydrogels are a perfect platform for precision medicine. Highly specialized delivery methods are needed for precision medicine, which customizes therapies to meet the needs of each patient [ 3 4 5 The main contention is that hydrogels are not passive materials. It is possible to design them to be “tunable” and “smart”, which allows for precise adjustment of their characteristics [ 6 7 The section contends that by facilitating targeted, localized, and on-demand therapy, hydrogels provide a substantial benefit over conventional systemic drug delivery, which impacts the entire body. A distinguishing feature of precision medicine is its specificity [ 8 9 10 Hydrogels play an important role in cancer therapy because they allow for the targeted and prolonged release of chemotherapeutic medicines, immune therapeutics, and other anti-cancer agents directly at the tumor site. This focused strategy considerably enhances therapeutic effectiveness while minimizing the severe systemic toxicities that are often associated with traditional therapies [ 11 Furthermore, “smart” hydrogels may be made to react to certain internal (e.g., pH or temperature) or exterior (e.g., light) stimuli found in the tumor microenvironment, enabling on-demand and remotely controlled drug release [ 12 13 14 15 According to the medical uses, they may be developed as injectable hydrogels that are injected in liquid form and subsequently gel in situ inside the body, which is very beneficial for minimally invasive delivery to specific areas such as tumors. They may also be used as “bio-inks” in 3D bioprinting to create complex tissue models or scaffolds with precise topologies for tissue engineering purposes. Hydrogels are used topically for external usage, such as wound treatment, in the form of sheets, gels, or sprays [ 16 Hydrogels are significant because they are biomimetic, meaning they closely resemble real tissues, ensuring great biocompatibility [ 17 18 19 1.2. The Aim of the Review This review provides a comprehensive and critical examination of recent advancements in hydrogel-based systems for regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. It offers an integrated perspective that connects material design with therapeutic application, placing particular emphasis on the development of tailored hydrogel platforms. The discussion focuses on how precise modulation of hydrogel properties such as mechanical strength, degradation kinetics, bio-adhesiveness, and responsiveness to external stimuli can address current biomedical challenges and enhance clinical efficacy. By consolidating emerging strategies in both engineering and application, this review aims to advance the understanding of hydrogel functionality in complex therapeutic contexts. This review emphasizes recent strategies in hydrogel engineering that focus on the precise modulation of key material properties to meet the complex requirements of regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. Beyond commonly addressed features such as mechanical strength, degradation rate, bio-adhesion, and stimuli responsiveness, special attention is given to often overlooked but critical factors like scalability and biocompatibility. These characteristics play a vital role in ensuring optimal performance and clinical readiness. A lack of tunability in these areas continues to hinder the translation of hydrogels from laboratory research to practical therapeutic use, particularly in drug delivery and tissue regeneration. 2. Tunable Hydrogel Fundamentals 2.1. Material Selection and Crosslinking Hydrogels are typically described as three-dimensional, hydrophilic networks capable of absorbing and retaining substantial amounts of water or biological fluids while maintaining structural integrity due to physical or chemical crosslinking [ 20 10 21 n Figure 1 In addition to bulk material choice, the incorporation of specific functional groups or degradable linkers such as enzyme-sensitive sequences or hydrolysable bonds further tailors the hydrogel’s behavior for targeted biomedical applications. Polyacrylamide and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) are well-known synthetic polymers [ 22 23 24 Citric acid (CA) serves as a chemical crosslinking agent for carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels, creating stable ester linkages that characterize the hybrid polymeric network [ 22 23 25 Crosslinking is essential for determining the overall characteristics and varied uses of hydrogels. Its principal function is to provide dimensional stability and inhibit hydrophilic polymer chains from disintegrating in watery settings. The crosslinking density is a vital quantity that directly affects many essential hydrogel features, such as swelling behavior, mechanical strength, and water retention capacity [ 26 27 10 23 24 28 29 Excessive chemical crosslinking in hydrogels can create overly stable matrices that hinder normal tissue remodeling, restrict cell migration, or prevent the complete release of therapeutic agents, potentially leading to chronic inflammation or residual material accumulation in vivo [ 30 31 Several design approaches illustrate this concept. Embedding PLGA-based microspheres into injectable hydrogels enables sequential release of multiple drugs over programmable time frames [ 31 32 33 34 2.2. Physico-Chemical and Mechanical Control The mechanical characteristics of hydrogels are well studied and are crucial for their effective use in several biomedical domains, such as ligament and tendon healing, wound dressing, and tissue engineering [ 35 36 36 37 38 The mechanical properties of hydrogels arise from their network morphology and can generally be categorized into two primary types: Rubber-like hydrogels—often modeled by classical rubber elasticity and viscoelasticity theories; they are characterized by significant extensibility under low stress and full recovery driven primarily by entropic elasticity [ 39 Fibrillar hydrogels—such as collagen, fibrin, silk fibroin, or synthetic fiber-forming systems, where the mechanical response is dominated by enthalpic elasticity. In these materials, deformation resistance is due to stretching of semi-flexible fibers rather than entropy-driven chain retraction [ 40 41 36 42 Across both morphologies, several key determinants influence mechanical performance and tunability: Crosslinking density—higher density increases rigidity but may reduce extensibility [ 43 Monomer molecular weight—larger monomers or longer polymer chains yield stronger, more resilient networks [ 44 Monomer concentration—higher concentrations create denser networks, enhancing strength and viscoelasticity [ 45 Monomer composition—specific chemistries (e.g., hydrophobic domains or ionic groups) can improve toughness, energy dissipation, or responsiveness [ 46 The mechanical properties of hydrogels are elucidated using the principles of rubber elasticity and viscoelasticity. In their expanded form, most hydrogels have rubber-like properties, marked by significant extensibility under little stress and full recovery facilitated by entropic variations in addition to time-dependent viscoelastic responses [ 23 22 The rate and degree of hydrogel swelling are essential factors that directly influence the release patterns of encapsulated solvents and drugs from polymeric networks. Swelling kinetics are significantly affected by various design parameters, such as the crosslinking ratio, the chemical composition of the polymer, the ionic environment, and the conditions of synthesis [ 47 19 48 One essential and much-desired improvement for hydrogels, especially in biomedical applications, is controlled deterioration. In tissue engineering applications, the degradation rate of the hydrogel must align with the rate of new tissue growth, thereby providing ongoing support while facilitating natural tissue remodeling. Hydrogels can be designed to degrade via multiple mechanisms, such as hydrolysis, enzyme-mediated processes, or a combination thereof [ 49 50 51 The degradation rate can be accurately regulated by altering the chemistry of the degradable linker, such as the faster degradation of ester linkages from lactic acid compared to caprolactone, or by integrating enzymatically susceptible linkages with designated amino acid sequences. More highly crosslinked gels typically demonstrate extended degradation times [ 52 53 Different pore sizes are best suited for the regeneration of different tissues. Solvent casting/particle leaching, gas foaming, electrospinning, freeze drying (lyophilization), and sophisticated microfabrication methods including soft lithography and fast prototyping are methods for carefully regulating hydrogel porosity and microarchitecture. In order to guide tissue development and encourage vascularization, these techniques allow for the customization of pore size, total porosity, and complex microarchitectural characteristics like interconnecting microchannels [ 53 54 Similarly, the swelling behavior and porous structure of the hydrogel directly regulate the kinetics of drug diffusion and release [ 55 23 47 Table 1 56 2.3. Smart and Bio-Functional Hydrogels Smart hydrogels, often known as stimuli-responsive hydrogels, are an advanced category of materials designed to undergo certain structural alterations, such as expansion or contraction, in direct response to diverse external stimuli. The stimuli may be physicochemical, including variations in pH, temperature, light, electric and magnetic fields, redox chemical processes, and ultrasonic irradiation [ 57 Figure 2 Alternatively, they may refer to particular biological things, like tiny molecules, proteins, enzymes, or metal ions. This intelligent responsiveness is an essential characteristic that allows for precisely regulated drug release and supports dynamic applications in intricate biological settings [ 23 Various categories of smart and bio-functional hydrogels have been developed. Self-healing hydrogels possess the capability to autonomously repair structural damage, thereby prolonging their functional lifespan and improving reliability in dynamic biomedical applications, including wound healing and tissue scaffolding. Their notable self-repair capabilities are mainly due to the inclusion of dynamic covalent bonds (e.g., Schiff base linkages, disulfide bonds, etc.) or various non-covalent interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, host–guest chemistry, etc.) in their polymeric networks [ 52 Tough hydrogels mitigate the mechanical fragility typically found in conventional hydrogels and are designed with superior mechanical properties. Their robustness facilitates successful application in load-bearing contexts, including cartilage regeneration and artificial ligaments [ 58 59 Hydrogels function as practical three-dimensional structural templates, closely resembling the ECM and offering essential support for cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and differentiation. To preserve cell viability and function, they make it easier for cells to encapsulate under gentle, cell-friendly gelation conditions. Bio-functional hydrogels can be designed to include specific bioactive cues, such as Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequences to improve cell adhesion or matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-sensitive linkers for facilitating cell-mediated degradation and tissue remodeling [ 60 61 62 The development of smart and bio-functional hydrogels represents a huge step forward, allowing for dynamic response to diverse stimuli (e.g., pH, temperature, and light) as well as the inclusion of unique biological signals. These sophisticated hydrogels, including self-healing, resilient, and hybrid systems, provide unparalleled regulation of drug delivery, cell encapsulation, and tissue engineering applications. The synergistic integration of intelligent functionality with biomimicry facilitates the development of advanced biomaterials that can actively sense, react to, and engage in intricate biological processes [ 63 2.4. Limitations of Conventional Hydrogels Despite their versatility, conventional hydrogels face several intrinsic limitations that can hinder their clinical translation. One major drawback is their poor mechanical strength, which makes them prone to deformation or fracture under physiological stresses, limiting use in load-bearing tissues such as cartilage or tendons [ 47 64 65 66 45 67 53 3. Tunable Hydrogels in Regenerative Medicine Hydrogels are advanced scaffolds and delivery systems used in regenerative medicine that can be designed to replicate the natural cellular environment, thereby directing tissue growth and healing. Their adaptability enables the following: Tailored mechanical properties: the mechanical properties of the body’s tissues vary greatly, ranging from tough bone to soft brain matter; Controlled degradation rates: the hydrogel scaffold must break down at a rate that precisely corresponds to the rate at which new tissue is growing for successful tissue regeneration [ 8 Accurate biochemical signaling: hydrogels can be designed to contain and release specific bioactive substances, including peptides, growth factors, or cytokines, in a controlled and prolonged manner; Cell delivery and encapsulation: hydrogels offer a supportive and safe environment for the delivery and encapsulation of cells, including stem cells; Architectural customization: hydrogel scaffolds with incredibly complex and accurate designs that replicate the intricate structures of natural tissues and organs can be created using advanced fabrication techniques, such as 3D bioprinting [ 68 3.1. Tissue Engineering Scaffolds In regenerative engineering, creating a scaffold that can replicate natural ECM and guide stem cells to produce functional tissues is a significant problem. Hydrogels are among the most promising biomaterials in this regard because of their high water content, biocompatibility, and ease of tuning to replicate the characteristics of the extracellular matrix [ 69 70 Figure 3 For instance, to systematically control cell behavior, including migration, proliferation, and differentiation, multiple biophysical cues, such as stiffness, porosity, and degradation, have been integrated into hydrogel scaffolds in a spatiotemporally controlled manner [ 71 72 To enhance the biocompatibility and functionality of hydrogels, numerous sophisticated chemical techniques as well as the addition of functional ingredients have been suggested [ 73 74 75 In this industry, collagen-based hydrogels are frequently utilized due to their cell-binding and biocompatibility properties. The quality of the engineered skin is impacted by its drawbacks, which include immunogenicity, rapid deterioration, inadequate mechanical strength, and shrinkage during fibroblast culture [ 76 77 78 79 80 81 Granular hydrogels (GHs), composed of packed hydrogel microparticles (HMPs), have garnered considerable interest recently in various domains, including bioprinting, drug delivery, and tissue engineering [ 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 Perhaps future research will try to compare the mechanical characteristics of the gel to particular physiological stress ranges that are pertinent to its intended application. It is reasonable to assume that including such estimations would improve the discussion and the applicability of the conclusions in real-world situations. Therefore, we can conclude that hydrogels play a crucial role in regenerative medicine by providing highly adaptable scaffolds and delivery systems that replicate the cellular environment found in the body. Their ability to precisely regulate mechanical characteristics, rates of degradation, biochemical signaling, cell delivery, and architectural design is one of their main advantages. Even though ongoing developments, especially in the area of extracellular matrix mimicry, hold considerable promise, problems still exist with conventional materials ( Table 2 3.2. Controlled Release Systems/Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) Fundamentally, tunable hydrogels are clever networks of polymers made to change predictably in response to particular stimuli. A variety of physiological stimuli, including variations in pH, temperature, or ionic strength, as well as the presence of specific enzymes or biomolecules at an injury or disease site can cause these stimuli-responsive hydrogels to transition from a collapsed, compact state to a swollen, expanded state. Their capacity for controlled release is based on this “smart” behavior [ 93 94 Tunable hydrogels enable controlled release using a range of complex techniques, going beyond basic swelling and collapsing. The “pro-drug” technique is a sophisticated method that works exceptionally well with highly hydrophilic materials, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels [ 95 96 97 The structure–property relationships of PEG-based hydrogels have been made clear by numerous basic investigations, particularly those about equilibrium swelling, mechanics, and transport properties [ 20 98 The process of drug loading, the drug’s size and molecular makeup, and the dosage and release profile required for a given therapeutic application are some of the variables that affect the mechanisms by which drugs are released from PEG hydrogels. Generally speaking, diffusion-controlled, swelling-controlled, and chemically controlled delivery are the primary molecular release mechanisms found in PEG hydrogels. For in-depth mechanistic explanations of these release mechanisms, readers are directed to other reviews [ 20 99 20 100 101 102 The “pro-drug” technique is an additional method of drug delivery that preserves the preferential hydrophilicity of PEG hydrogels. This method utilizes pendant functional groups to covalently tether therapeutics within PEG hydrogels. Predetermined liberation and release rates are made possible by the addition of degradable linkers between the drug and the tether. Numerous linker degradation mechanisms, such as enzymatic and hydrolytic degradation, have been proposed [ 103 104 These hydrogels are essential in contemporary regenerative medicine because they can precisely control release while fine-tuning characteristics such as mechanical stiffness, degradation rate, and biochemical signaling. Tunable hydrogels are at the forefront of coordinating the intricate biological cues necessary for effective tissue repair and regeneration, from directing stem cell differentiation to encouraging angiogenesis and integrating with host tissues [ 30 3.3. Cell Microenvironments & Bioprinting Regenerative medicine seeks to replicate the body’s natural repair processes, aiming to replace or heal damaged tissues. The ability to accurately replicate the cell microenvironment—that complex network of chemical and physical cues that naturally directs cell behavior, differentiation, and the eventual formation of functional tissue—is a critical component in this pursuit. When paired with advanced additive manufacturing methods, such as bioprinting, tunable hydrogels have emerged as essential materials for designing intricate microenvironments [ 105 106 107 Furthermore, these hydrogels can be functionalized with particular biochemical cues, such as peptides, growth factors, and cell adhesion motifs, to actively guide cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation toward particular tissue outcomes [ 30 One revolutionary technique for creating these complex hydrogel-based microenvironments is bioprinting. With the use of this sophisticated additive manufacturing technique, complex, pre-defined 3D tissue constructs can be created by precisely depositing “bio-inks”—usually hydrogels loaded with living cells—layer by layer. The potential for complex tissue engineering significantly increases when tunable hydrogels are created as bio-inks [ 108 Accurate spatial management of cell positioning: By simulating the highly ordered multicellular structures found in natural tissues, bioprinting enables the precise placement of various cell types within a scaffold. To replicate intricate organ architecture, this is essential [ 109 Creation of complex architectures: bioprinting enables the design and construction of intricate geometries, such as internal vascular channels, as well as the production of various material distributions that replicate the subtle structural differences found in organs [ 110 Localized microenvironmental control: It is possible to design sections of a single bio-printed construct with different hydrogel characteristics, such as different growth factor presentations or stiffness gradients. This allows for localized regulation of cell behavior, mirroring the minute changes in the surrounding environment that cells experience in a natural tissue [ 111 Take the regeneration of bone as an example; to achieve this, a bio-printed hydrogel that can be adjusted in stiffness and loaded with osteo-inductive growth factors could be created. For nerve repair, on the other hand, a softer hydrogel that contains neurotrophic factors could be bio-printed into a particular conduit structure to direct the growth of axons [ 112 113 4. Tunable Hydrogels in Cancer Intervention 4.1. Precision Drug Delivery Given the complexity and heterogeneity of tumors, precision medicine in cancer therapy seeks to deliver treatments directly to tumor sites while causing the least amount of damage to healthy tissues. In this battle, tunable hydrogels are becoming ground-breaking instruments that provide previously unheard-of control over precise medication delivery for successful cancer treatment. These intelligent biomaterials have the potential to revolutionize the way we administer treatments by being specifically designed to react to the distinct pathological conditions present in the tumor microenvironment [ 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 Table 3 As a novel form of drug carrier, hydrogels offer numerous exceptional benefits that could revolutionize cancer treatment approaches. Firstly, hydrogels can transport drugs effectively and with precise control. To create a cascade of therapeutic modalities and enable an integrated sequence of cancer treatment, hydrogels can be loaded with a range of therapeutic agents, including immunosuppressants, radionuclides, and chemotherapeutic drugs [ 121 Second, there are numerous delivery methods (intravenous injection, in situ injection, in situ implantation, transdermal delivery, oral delivery, pulmonary delivery, and trans-arterial chemoembolization) and a broad range of sizes (including macro-gels, microgels (0.5–10 μm), and nanogels (<200 nm)) for hydrogels. Therefore, the hydrogel material minimizes the quantity of medicine needed and systemic toxicity by providing continuous and regulated drug administration, enabling precise access to the cancer site [ 119 122 Chemotherapy frequently damages the human body while failing to eradicate cancer cells [ 123 124 A self-assembled hydrogel that responds to temperature and pH was recently created by Lee et al. [ 125 Hydrogels with multinetwork and polyporous architectures, on the other hand, may carry precise doses of radionuclides that can be uniformly dispersed throughout the cancer cells and frequently exhibit shape adaptability and reactivity based on a range of internal and external stimuli [ 126 127 128 Wang et al. [ 129 130 gels-11-00679-t003_Table 3 Table 3 Hydrogel Approaches for Precise and Effective Drug Administration. Method Precision Effects References  Tunable hydrogels as drug carriers Designed to deliver medication specifically to tumor sites based on local pathological conditions Enhances treatment effectiveness while minimizing harm to healthy tissue [ 119 120  Stimuli-responsive hydrogels (e.g., light, pH, temperature) React to specific tumor microenvironment signals to trigger drug release Allows controlled and targeted release of therapeutic agents; improves drug efficiency [ 123 127  Biodegradable and injectable hydrogel systems Enable localized administration with built-in degradation over time Improve patient comfort, reduce systemic exposure, and simplify administration [ 127  Multinetwork and porous hydrogel structures Provide channels for uniform drug distribution and adjustable loading capacity Enhance versatility for various treatments, including wound healing, biosensing, and cancer therapy [ 122 123 124  Hydrogels for combination therapy (e.g., loaded with chemo- and immunodrugs) Can carry multiple types of drugs for sequential or simultaneous release Enable integrated cancer treatment strategies with better coordination of therapy modalities [ 129  Hydrogels replacing conventional chemotherapy methods Offer localized, sustained, and responsive release versus passive, non-targeted chemotherapy Avoid systemic side effects and ensure higher drug concentration at the tumor site [ 119 120 121 4.2. Immunotherapy Enhancement Cell therapy, a cutting-edge treatment method, utilizes living cells to combat diseases and promote healing within the body. This novel method involves administering live cells for medicinal purposes by injection, transplanting, or implantation. Cell-based therapy offers inherent therapeutic benefits that surpass those of conventional medication therapies. When these biologically active cells enter the body, they can quickly adjust to and react dynamically to a variety of biological signals and physicochemical stimuli. They can also interact with the body’s cells to carry out their therapeutic roles [ 131 132 Traditional treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy have limited therapeutic benefits because cancer frequently has very complex microenvironments [ 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 2+ 143 4.3. Three-Dimensional Cancer Models and Diagnostics The ongoing development of three-dimensional (3D) tumor models that capture intricate physiological cues in vitro is one of several advancements necessary to improve the translational efficiency of anticancer agents. The sophistication of 3D models has advanced significantly. However, there are still many important considerations to be made in order to fully appreciate the benefits—and, more importantly, the drawbacks—of employing bioengineered 3D models in the drug discovery process. The development of cost-effective, biologically relevant systems; the meaningful compatibility of complex models and associated analysis procedures with rapid throughput screening; and the definition and validation of practical treatment response metrics are the main obstacles to using 3D models to inform important go/no-go decisions in drug development [ 144 A variety of stimuli, including variations in pH, temperature, magnetic fields, and near-infrared radiation, can trigger intelligent, controlled drug release mechanisms due to recent advancements in stimuli-responsive components. The use of diagnostic imaging agents, such as radiolabeled isotopes, fluorescent dyes, and magnetic nanoparticles, significantly enhances real-time therapeutic monitoring and tumor visualization. When compared to traditional techniques, multifunctional hydrogels exhibit better therapeutic results by integrating chemotherapy, photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, immunotherapy, and their synergistic combinations [ 62 Hydrogels are three-dimensional networks of polymers that can store a significant amount of water. Due to their unique qualities and adaptability, they have become essential tools in cancer treatment. From therapeutic administration to complex 3D models and enhanced diagnostics, their intrinsic biocompatibility, adjustable mechanical characteristics, and capacity to encapsulate cells and biomolecules make them perfect platforms for a variety of cancer-related applications [ 145 Figure 4 The “tunable” component is essential, as it enables scientists to accurately replicate the dynamic and diverse tumor microenvironment (TME) and tailor treatment plans for maximum effectiveness [ 146 However, due to the intrinsic non-uniformity of gel characteristics and cell population heterogeneity, which often result in varied cell responses, studying biological responses within 3D hydrogels presents significant challenges [ 147 148 148 147 149 A revolutionary development in cancer research is the combination of 3D cancer models and tunable hydrogels. The development of highly effective, targeted therapies and the improvement of cancer diagnostics are being aided by these advanced platforms, which provide precise control over the tumor microenvironment. 5. Comparative Analysis Between Hydrogels Materials such as natural polymers (like chitosan and alginate) and synthetic polymers (like PEG and PNIPAM) are critically evaluated in this section, with their distinct benefits and drawbacks for particular uses, like tissue engineering and drug delivery, discussed. A new table that compiles these comparisons is provided. Natural polymers that come from biological sources include chitosan and alginate. Excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and a structure that frequently resembles the natural extracellular matrix are their main advantages. They are therefore very well adapted for tissue engineering, where they can offer a scaffolding that supports the development of cells and the regeneration of tissue [ 150 151 Synthetic polymers are produced in a laboratory, including poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) and poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM). Their great degree of control over their chemical and physical characteristics is their primary advantage. Their mechanical strength, rate of degradation, and sensitivity to particular stimuli (such as pH and temperature) can all be accurately adjusted by researchers [ 152 153 154 5.1. Quantitative Discussion of Trade-Offs and Limitations A hydrogel’s mechanical characteristics (such as stiffness and elasticity) and rate of degradation must be carefully balanced for its intended biological use. A critical examination of these trade-offs goes beyond a straightforward explanation to include a mathematical analysis of how these parameters are adjusted to guarantee efficacy and safety. The application alone determines the ideal balance. In applications such as cartilage regeneration, the hydrogel needs to give the developing tissue sustained mechanical support. The hydrogel scaffold needs to have a high compressive modulus (for example, between 100 kPa and 1 MPa) to withstand mechanical stress because cartilage is a load-bearing tissue [ 155 27 However, a hydrogel used for short-term drug delivery, for example, a localized cancer treatment, needs a distinct set of characteristics. In this case, the main objective is to release the pharmacological payload over a predetermined, frequently shorter period [ 28 96 The quantitative trade-off between a hydrogel’s intended function and its stiffness and disintegration rate is evident. For long-term structural support, a stiff, slow-degrading hydrogel is best; for temporary, regulated therapeutic release, a soft, fast-degrading hydrogel is more appropriate. For hydrogel-based biomedical devices to be successful, this focused tuning is essential. 5.2. Critical Evaluation of Clinical Translation Challenges The translation of hydrogel-based products from lab research to clinical use is a complex process with several obstacles. Hydrogels have enormous potential, but obstacles with long-term biocompatibility, large-scale production, and regulatory approval frequently keep promising materials from becoming commercially available. The regulatory environment around hydrogels is complex since they can be categorized as biologics, medical devices, or drug–device combinations, each of which has a strict approval process. One of the main challenges is proving the hydrogel’s and its breakdown products’ long-term safety and effectiveness [ 156 157 One of the main bottlenecks in production is the transition from tiny, lab-bench batches to commercial quantities. It is challenging to guarantee batch-to-batch uniformity in important characteristics, including porosity, mechanical strength, and drug-loading efficiency. For instance, the synthesis of intricate smart hydrogels frequently depends on certain reaction conditions that are difficult to scale up, which results in high production costs and unpredictability. This difficulty is one of the leading causes of the failure of numerous creative hydrogel prototypes to reach the market [ 158 Although a hydrogel may be biocompatible in the short term, it may not interact with the body predictably over the long run. Prolonged inflammation, immunological rejection, or the buildup of breakdown byproducts can all cause problems. For instance, hydrogels made for injectable drug administration need to break down entirely and be eliminated from the body without causing inflammation. This is a crucial component for long-term implants or items used to control chronic diseases [ 159 5.3. Identification of Knowledge Gaps and Research Priorities The field of hydrogel-based treatments has to fill a number of important knowledge gaps in order to progress and close the gap between laboratory-based prototypes and clinical solutions. A few crucial areas should be the focus of future study in order to fully utilize these materials. The inability to precisely and non-invasively track hydrogel behavior in real time within a living creature is a significant drawback. To monitor important processes, including degradation rates, drug release kinetics, and the host’s immunological response, current techniques are frequently intrusive or lack the spatial and temporal precision required. The creation of sophisticated in vivo imaging methods, such as MRI, PET, or fluorescence imaging, that can offer accurate, quantitative information on a hydrogel’s performance from implantation to complete degradation is a top research objective. This would provide a more thorough comprehension of the interactions between hydrogels and intricate biological systems, guiding the development of safer and more efficient materials [ 160 Even though stimuli-responsive hydrogels represent a significant advancement, the majority of existing formulations only react to one trigger, such as temperature or pH. Multiple, simultaneous stimuli are present in significantly more complicated biological settings. The development of genuinely multi-responsive hydrogels that can respond to several triggers is a top research objective. For instance, a hydrogel might be engineered to release a medication only in response to the detection of a specific enzyme (a cancer biomarker) and a low pH, which would both point to a tumor. This would minimize off-target effects and significantly improve the precision and specificity of drug delivery [ 19 Hydrogels are still primarily designed empirically, using lengthy and laborious trial-and-error trials. The field must adopt a more data-driven and predictive methodology. Utilizing machine learning (ML) and computational modeling to forecast hydrogel performance based on structural characteristics and chemical composition is a significant area of research interest. Complex correlations between a hydrogel’s characteristics (such as its monomer type and crosslinking density) and its behavior in vivo could be modeled by ML algorithms trained on current information. This would streamline the whole development process by speeding up the identification and refinement of novel hydrogel formulations [ 161 5.4. Challenges and Future Outlook Although hydrogels have considerable potential as adjustable platforms for cancer treatment and regenerative medicine, several issues need to be addressed before their full clinical potential can be realized. Optimizing their mechanical properties to match the various physiological environments of various tissues precisely is a significant challenge. Although tough, self-healing, and stimuli-responsive hydrogels have advanced significantly, it remains challenging to ensure long-term mechanical stability and predictable rates of degradation in vivo, particularly for load-bearing applications [ 30 Scalability and manufacturing consistency present yet another significant obstacle. It is necessary to overcome considerable engineering and logistical challenges in order to translate lab-scale hydrogel synthesis into large-scale, economical production for clinical use while maintaining strict quality control. Since these novel, frequently multifunctional biomaterials must pass stringent safety and efficacy tests in order to receive clinical approval, regulatory pathways also pose a significant obstacle. Concerns such as possible toxicity from unreacted monomers or degradation products as well as ensuring the product is immunogenic and biocompatible are crucial [ 162 Looking ahead, the future of hydrogels is poised for transformative advancements. Research will focus on integrating multi-functionality, developing hydrogels that can not only provide structural support but also deliver drugs, genes, or cells in a precisely spatiotemporally controlled manner. The incorporation of innovative functionalities, such as responsiveness to specific biomarkers, pH changes, or external stimuli (e.g., light, ultrasound, etc.), will enhance the therapeutic precision of these devices. Furthermore, the convergence of hydrogel technology with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning will enable the rational design and rapid optimization of novel hydrogel formulations, accelerating their development and clinical translation [ 163 Future developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely linked to the potential of hydrogels as adjustable platforms for cancer intervention and regenerative medicine. These computational tools are providing answers to important problems in personalized medicine by changing the paradigm from conventional, trial-and-error experimentation to data-driven, predictive design [ 164 The capacity of AI to accurately forecast the properties of hydrogels is one of its most significant uses. Numerous tests are typically needed to design a hydrogel with particular properties, such as stiffness, degradation rate, or drug release profile. To develop predictive algorithms, researchers can use machine learning models to examine large datasets of current hydrogel compositions and their corresponding attributes. After that, these models may be used to quickly test novel formulations and determine the best mix of materials, crosslinking agents, and manufacturing conditions to obtain the desired result. In addition to speeding up the R&D process, this also drastically lowers expenses and material waste [ 165 AI is a key component that makes personalized medicine possible. AI models can create hydrogels tailored to a person’s needs by combining patient-specific data with databases of hydrogel properties, such as genetic markers, disease stage, and physiological characteristics. For instance, in the treatment of cancer, an AI algorithm might create a hydrogel that would release a chemotherapy medication at a pace that targets explicitly the drug metabolism and tumor growth rate of a patient. Similarly, a hydrogel scaffold for regenerative medicine might be designed to precisely match the mechanical properties of the wounded tissue in a specific patient, allowing for a quicker recovery [ 166 AI and ML algorithms that predict how different stimuli would affect medication release kinetics can be used to optimize the design of these responsive systems. This level of accuracy is necessary to reduce adverse effects and increase therapeutic effectiveness. For example, to ensure a tailored and effective reaction in an infected wound, a smart hydrogel may be engineered to release an antimicrobial chemical only when it recognizes the presence of particular bacterial toxins [ 167 Hydrogels’ intrinsic tunability makes them incredibly well suited for customized treatments in cancer intervention and regenerative medicine. Hydrogels are at the forefront of the movement to replace the “one-size-fits-all” approach to treatment with strategies that account for individual patient variability. Hydrogels can be tailored to a patient’s unique tissue defects in regenerative medicine. The regeneration of specific tissues, like cartilage, bone, or skin, can be facilitated by encapsulating patient-derived cells in hydrogels with precisely regulated stiffness, porosity, and biochemical cues. This is made possible through sophisticated fabrication techniques, such as 3D bioprinting. This patient-specific design reduces rejection and maximizes functional recovery, potentially aided by imaging data to create anatomically precise scaffolds [ 168 Hydrogels provide a potent way to customize drug delivery and alter the tumor microenvironment for cancer intervention. Traditional systemic chemotherapy frequently results in severe side effects and limited efficacy due to the heterogeneity of tumors among patients and even within a single tumor. To minimize systemic toxicity and maximize therapeutic concentration, tunable hydrogels can be designed to release immunomodulatory agents, gene therapies, or anticancer medications directly at the tumor site. Based on the patient’s genetic composition, drug sensitivity profiles, and tumor characteristics, this local, prolonged, and frequently stimuli-responsive release can be customized [ 169 One major problem is that there are no standardized preclinical models. Simplified in vitro or animal models that fall short of accurately simulating the complexity of the human body are used in many lab experiments. Developing more advanced, multi-organ-on-a-chip platforms that can more accurately forecast a hydrogel’s function, stability, and possible toxicity in people is necessary to address the issue [ 170 Additionally, the regulatory pathway for these novel, multi-component therapies, like a hydrogel that contains both medicines and cells, is frequently unclear. For the FDA and EMA to create more efficient procedures and more explicit rules, material scientists, clinicians, and regulatory agencies must work together more. For treatments that satisfy particular safety and effectiveness requirements, this can include developing special fast-track paths [ 171 In conclusion, there are numerous significant obstacles to overcome when transferring hydrogels from the lab to the clinic. First, there are regulatory and biological obstacles, such as making sure the hydrogels are stable and biocompatible inside the body, which may cause immunological reactions. Another major obstacle is the costly and time-consuming regulatory approval procedure, particularly for complicated materials. Secondly, it is challenging to scale up manufacturing and quality control. To provide predictable treatment outcomes, it is crucial to maintain consistent characteristics throughout many production batches, and strong quality control procedures are required. Developing more precise in vitro models to minimize animal testing and producing customized hydrogels for each patient should be the main goals of future research. Hydrogels can realize their full potential in clinical practice if smart hydrogels that react to biological stimuli are developed [ 172 Finally, it is important to consider early in the research phase if large-scale production is economically feasible. A hydrogel’s economical and scalable manufacture should be a priority for researchers beyond its biological role. The development of automated, closed-system manufacturing techniques may guarantee uniformity, lower production costs, and minimize contamination concerns, hence expanding the patient base for these treatments [ 173 6. Conclusions Hydrogels, a new class of biomaterials, provide unparalleled accuracy and versatility in advanced medical applications, especially in precision medicine and regenerative engineering. Their water-rich, porous, and highly biocompatible nature essentially mimics the body’s natural ECM, making them perfect for interacting with biological systems in a seamless way without causing negative immune reactions. The power of hydrogels lies in their tunable nature. By carefully selecting the appropriate materials and employing various crosslinking techniques (both physical and chemical), their mechanical properties, rates of degradation, and chemical functions can all be precisely designed. This makes it possible to customize stiffness to fit particular tissues (like cartilage versus brain), control swelling behavior for optimal medication release, and incorporate bioactive compounds to direct cellular responses. These days, hydrogels can act as “smart” systems that react to particular internal or external stimuli, allowing for localized and on-demand therapeutic delivery. Because of this sophisticated control, hydrogels are no longer considered passive materials. This approach lessens the serious systemic toxicities associated with conventional therapies while also greatly increasing therapeutic efficacy. Moreover, their ability to model tumor microenvironments in vitro provides crucial resources for understanding the progression of cancer and developing innovative treatments. Hydrogels provide a significant advancement in cancer treatment by enabling the prolonged and targeted delivery of anti-cancer drugs to tumor sites. Hydrogels are highly adaptable scaffolds and delivery systems for regenerative medicine that have been scientifically validated. They can be made to resemble the intricate biological environment in order to guide stem cell differentiation, promote tissue growth, and facilitate healing. Their ability to precisely control molecular signaling, cell delivery, mechanical properties, degradation kinetics, and architectural design using advanced techniques such as 3D bioprinting is essential. Current limitations could be overcome and even more potential unlocked with further advancements, especially in the production of granular hydrogels and the replication of the complex natural extracellular matrix. Ultimately, the development of intelligent and bio-functional hydrogels represents a significant advancement. These materials give previously unheard-of control over tissue engineering, drug delivery, and cell encapsulation by fusing precise biological signals with dynamic reactivity to stimuli. Hydrogels’ synergistic combination of biomimicry and intelligent functioning makes them essential materials with enormous potential to influence medicine in the future and enable genuinely customized and efficient treatments. 7.

This figure illustrates the range of physicochemical stimuli that can induce responsive and intelligent hydrogels to undergo functional changes. Redox reactions (represented by ROS), ultrasonic radiation, pH changes (indicated by the pH scale), temperature changes (in °C), light exposure, and the use of electric and magnetic fields are examples of these stimuli. The smart and bio-functional properties of these hydrogels in various applications, particularly in tissue engineering and controlled drug delivery, are primarily dependent on their ability to respond to specific cues. Figure 3 Schematic illustration of scaffolds for tissue regeneration using hydrogel-based tissue engineering. Hydrogels are flexible scaffolds that can be used to encapsulate a range of medicinal substances. For tissue engineering applications, they can encapsulate various stem cell types, such as adult stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Hydrogels can also transport growth factors, transcription factors, and nanoparticles to support tissue repair and cellular differentiation. The regeneration of different tissues, including skin, muscle, and bone, is facilitated by these integrated approaches. Figure 4 Bio-printed 3D cancer model for research and diagnosis. This figure illustrates the use of a bioprinter to create an in vitro 3D cancer model. Different cell types, such as stromal cells (grey), cancer cells (purple), and endothelial cells (blue), are precisely deposited into a structured environment using a bioprinter. By simulating physiological conditions, an integrated inflow and outflow system enables the controlled delivery of nutrients and the removal of waste products. The complex cellular architecture of the 3D cancer model is displayed in the magnified view on the right, emphasizing the interactions between stromal cells, cancer cells, and the endothelial cell-formed vasculature. gels-11-00679-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Hydrogel Properties and Control Mechanisms.
