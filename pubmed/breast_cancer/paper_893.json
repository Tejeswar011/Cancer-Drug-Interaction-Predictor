Prostate cancer metastasis to the oesophagus is exceedingly rare. Case summary We report an 82-year-old male patient. He presented to the gastroenterology clinic complaining of increased bowel movement frequency from baseline. The patient had a previous history of prostate cancer. Tumour marker analysis revealed markedly elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19 − 9 (CA19-9), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the upper abdomen suggested multiple retroperitoneal lymph node metastases and metastatic lesions in several lumbar vertebrae. Colonoscopy revealed inflammatory changes in the colon, whereas gastroduodenoscopy indicated mucosal lesions in the oesophagus. Haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical analysis (IHC) revealed positive expression of α-methylacyl-CoA racemase (P504S) and androgen receptor (AR), confirming a diagnosis of oesophageal metastasis of prostate cancer. Subcutaneous endocrine therapy with goserelin (3.6 mg every 28 days) was initiated. Conclusions Oesophageal metastasis of prostate cancer is extremely rare and typically indicates advanced disease with a poor prognosis. The clinical manifestations are nonspecific and often lead to misdiagnosis. A definitive diagnosis relies on histopathology and immunohistochemical markers, such as PSA and P504S. Clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for metastatic prostate cancer in cases of unexplained oesophageal lesions. We hope that this case will increase clinicians’ awareness of metastatic oesophageal cancer. the Songjiang District tackling key science and technology research projects (No. 20sjkjgg32) Shi Yu-Juan pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 Introduction Oesophageal cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Two major pathological subtypes exist: oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and oesophageal adenocarcinoma [ 1 2 3 Prostate cancer is among the most common malignancies in men and is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [ 4 5 Clinically, oesophageal metastases often are asymptomatic or present with nonspecific symptoms such as dysphagia, chest discomfort, or weight loss [ 6 7 Here, we present a rare case of oesophageal metastasis of prostate cancer confirmed by immunohistochemistry, including positive staining for P504S and AR. This report aims to raise clinical awareness of this rare metastatic presentation, discuss the possible mechanisms of dissemination, and highlight the importance of thorough diagnostic evaluation in patients with a history of prostate cancer presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. Case presentation History and physical examination We report an 82-year-old male patient who was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of increased bowel movement frequency. After consuming cold drinks one day, the patient experienced a 5-times increase in the number of stools, which were yellow and lacking form. His maximum body temperature was 37.8℃, with no nausea or vomiting, no abdominal distension, no blood in the stool, and no palpitations or chest tightness. The patient had a 5-year history of hypertension, with a maximum recorded blood pressure of approximately 150/95 mmHg. Antihypertensive therapy with amlodipine (Norvasc) was initiated, resulting in satisfactory blood pressure control. He also had a 3-year history of prostate cancer and a past medical history of syphilis. The patient had no remarkable personal or family history of similar illnesses. He denied any history of contact with infected patients or ill animals, or history of recent foreign travel. The patient’s body temperature was 37.3 °C, blood pressure was 148/80 mmHg, heart rate was 79 beats/minute, and respiratory rate was 23 breaths/minute. There was mild tenderness in the abdomen. No other significant positive signs were identified during physical examination. Diagnostic workup Upon admission, his tumour marker evaluation revealed an elevated CA 19 − 9 level of 31.7 U/mL. The total prostate-specific (tPSA) level was markedly increased at 100 ng/mL, and the free prostate-specific antigen (fPSA) level was 50 ng/mL (Table 1  Table 1 Results of tumour index examination after admission Laboratory tests Result Reference values CEA 3.79 0-6.5 ng/mL CA19-9 31.7 0–27.0 U/mL tPSA 100 0-6.9 U/mL fPSA 50 0.5–4.0 ng/mL fPSA/tPSA 2 CEA: Carcinoembryonic antigen; CA19-9: Carbohydrate antigen-199; tPSA: total prostate-specific antigen; fPSA: free prostate-specific antigen Following admission, contrast-enhanced pelvic CT revealed a space-occupying lesion in the prostate, raising a suspicion of malignancy (Fig. 1 1 1 1  Fig. 1 CT and MRI of this patient. Post-enhanced CT of the prostate suggested a prostatic space-occupying lesion (Figure 1A), and multiple destruction of ribs and vertebral bone, multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneal membrane (Figure 1B), and multiple lymph node metastasis in the abdominal aorta and prostatic enhanced MRI of bilateral iliac vessels (Fig. 1C and D) Following admission, gastroscopy revealed the patient’s oesophageal lumen with smooth, pliable mucosa, preserved vascular markings, and satisfactory peristaltic distensibility. At 37 cm from the upper incisors, a 0.6 cm white, flat mucosal lesion was identified, and biopsy specimens were obtained for pathological analysis (Fig. 2  Fig. 2 Gastroscopy suggested the mucosa was smooth and soft, with a clear vascular texture. On the oesophagus at 37 cm with a diameter of 0.6 cm Haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the oesophageal biopsy specimens revealed tightly packed, irregular glandular structures devoid of a basal cell layer, infiltrating the stroma. The tumour cells had enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Based on these findings, the histopathological examination provided a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma with a possibility of prostatic origin, so IHC was recommended for confirmation (Fig. 3  Fig. 3 Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of oesophageal lesion tissue.

He refused a prostate biopsy and systemic therapy, including hormone or radiation therapy, for personal reasons. This may have contributed to the widespread metastatic presentation observed at the time of admission. After admission, comprehensive examinations were conducted. The patient was treated with Bifidobacterium triple live capsules to regulate the intestinal flora, along with anti-infective and symptomatic supportive therapy. Imaging revealed a malignant prostate tumour with multiple metastases, and elevated PSA levels were noted. A urology consultation was requested. Because the patient tested positive for syphilis, dermatology and venereology consultations were conducted. Routine treatment and regular follow-up were recommended; however, the patient refused treatment. Owing to elevated PSA levels, prostate cancer was suspected, and the patient was transferred to the Department of Urology for further evaluation and treatment. Although a prostate biopsy was recommended to confirm the diagnosis, the patient declined the procedure. After detailed discussions with the patient and his family, subcutaneous endocrine therapy with goserelin (3.6 mg every 28 days) was initiated. The timeline of the patient’s treatment process during therapy is shown in Fig. 4  Fig. 4 The treatment process of the patient during the therapy After the first course of chemotherapy, the patient’s clinical symptoms improved, and the repeated tumour marker evaluation results improved. However, following the initial follow-up, the patient was advised to undergo a second follow-up evaluation. However, the patient declined further treatment thereafter. The patient was still alive after 6 months of follow-up examinations. Discussion Prostate cancer is a common malignancy in men, with a well-established pattern of metastasis predominantly involving the bones, lymph nodes, lungs, and liver [ 8 9 The oesophagus is an extremely rare site of prostate cancer metastasis, and its involvement is often explained through atypical metastatic pathways. Haematogenous spread is a plausible mechanism, particularly via the vertebral venous plexus (Batson’s plexus), which allows retrograde tumour cell dissemination, bypassing the pulmonary circulation [ 10 11 1 1 Another proposed factor is organotropism—the tendency of certain tumour cells to preferentially metastasise to specific organs due to molecular affinity between tumour surface receptors and tissue-specific ligands. However, prostate cancer cells typically lack tropism for oesophageal tissue, which partially explains the rarity of such metastases [ 12 2 Differentiating metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma from primary oesophageal carcinoma is a crucial diagnostic step, especially in cases in which the metastatic lesion presents with poorly differentiated morphology or mimics a primary oesophageal tumour. Routine imaging and histopathology may not be sufficient for an accurate diagnosis; thus, IHC becomes essential. Immunohistochemical markers play a vital role in confirming the prostatic origin of metastatic tumours, particularly when the morphology is ambiguous or when traditional markers such as PSA level are equivocal. Among these, AR and P504S have emerged as important adjunct markers in the pathological evaluation of prostate cancer. AR is a nuclear transcription factor highly expressed in most prostate adenocarcinomas, reflecting the hormone-dependent nature of the disease. Its immunoreactivity supports a diagnosis of prostate cancer, especially in hormone-sensitive tumours. P504S, a prostate-specific transmembrane protein, is localised to the Golgi apparatus. It demonstrates high specificity for prostate tissue and is typically retained even in poorly differentiated tumours or in metastatic settings where PSA expression may be lost. In addition to immunohistochemical staining, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for PSA mRNA can serve as a highly sensitive diagnostic tool, especially when immunohistochemical markers are inconclusive. The presence of PSA-positive mRNA in metastatic lesions, including oesophageal tumours, has been revealed in previous studies, further confirming the prostatic origin of such lesions. PSA is the most used marker for prostate adenocarcinoma, especially in patients presenting with obstructive urinary symptoms. While markedly elevated PSA levels are strongly suggestive of malignancy, it is important to note that certain cases have been reported with normal serum PSA levels despite histologically confirmed prostate cancer [ 13 In clinical practice, a panel-based approach utilising PSA, AR, and P504S enhances diagnostic accuracy in identifying metastatic prostate cancer. The coexpression of AR and P504S, along with the absence of gastrointestinal or squamous epithelial markers (e.g., CK7, CDX2, p63), strongly favours a prostatic origin, particularly in unusual metastatic sites such as the oesophagus [ 14 3 3 Oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma typically expresses CK5 and p63, which indicate squamous differentiation. These markers are highly sensitive and help distinguish ESCC from adenocarcinomas. Oesophageal adenocarcinoma is typically positive for CK7 and, occasionally, CK20, reflecting an intestinal-type glandular origin. We checked that the ICH (F) was negative in this case. However, in this case, IHC revealed that the expression of CK5 (Fig. 3 3 3 Patients often report vague gastrointestinal symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, or chest discomfort, which can be easily misattributed to primary oesophageal pathologies or benign conditions. Radiological imaging, including CT and PET-CT, may reveal oesophageal wall thickening or mediastinal involvement but cannot reliably differentiate between primary and secondary malignancies [ 15 After standardised treatment, individualised monitoring is needed. Serial PSA measurements and periodic imaging studies are generally used to evaluate treatment response and to detect disease progression. Thus, clinicians must remain suspicious of metastasis to unusual sites in prostate cancer patients who present with gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly those with a high tumour burden or treatment-resistant disease. This case highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving urologists, gastroenterologists, and pathologists in ensuring an accurate diagnosis and optimal management. Differentiating between primary oesophageal carcinoma and metastatic prostate cancer is crucial for an accurate diagnosis. These two conditions have distinct origins and biological behaviours and require different treatment approaches. Conclusion Improving clinicians’ awareness of metastatic sites of prostate cancer and exploring metastatic pathways could help guide identification methods, treatment decisions, and follow-up strategies. Increased awareness of such rare metastatic patterns can help avoid misdiagnosis, prevent unnecessary interventions, and facilitate the timely initiation of appropriate systemic therapy, ultimately improving clinical outcomes. Core tip This report describes a case of prostate cancer metastasising to the oesophagus. Breast cancer, lung cancer, and malignant melanoma a very common metastases of metastatic oesophageal cancer. HE staining and IHC revealed positive expression of P504S and AR, confirming the diagnosis of oesophageal metastasis from prostate cancer. Based on this case, we speculate that the patient’s metastatic oesophageal lesion may have originated from retroperitoneal lymph node metastases secondary to prostate cancer, followed by further spread to the oesophagus. Alternatively, direct lymphatic spread to the oesophagus cannot be excluded.
