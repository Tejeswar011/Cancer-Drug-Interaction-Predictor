Introduction Breast cancer (BRCA) represents a significant health issue for women due to its high mortality and morbidity rates. Even with adjuvant chemotherapy, the five-year survival rate for metastatic BRCA remains below 30% [ 1 2 3 4 5 Computational methods have gained significant importance in the design and discovery of new anti-cancer drugs. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) involves the use of computational tools and techniques to identify potential drug targets, screen large molecular databases for potential drug candidates, model and predict interactions between drug molecules and biological targets, and to assess in silico their pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity. The application of computational methods has led to the acceleration of drug discovery by reducing the time and resources needed for experimental evaluation [ 6 7 6 8 The application of computational tools is currently the first approach in the discovery and development of new therapeutic agents. In silico studies provide insights into binding modes and interactions between compounds and biological targets at the atomic level, revealing new pathways or targets for cancer therapy, while estimating binding affinities and the potential efficacy of compounds before experimental evaluation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying BRCA and how a specific receptor contributes to tumorigenesis is a crucial aspect of cancer biology that paves the way toward developing effective anti-cancer drugs and improving treatment outcomes. Nucleotide diphosphate hydrolase type 5 (NUDT5) has been linked to the development of BRCA. Research findings revealed that the elevation of nuclear adenosine triphosphate (ATP), chromatin remodeling, and alterations in gene transcription induced by progestin or estrogen in BRCA cells rely on the activity of NUDT5. Its overexpression is associated with a worse prognosis and a higher risk of recurrence and metastasis [ 9 10 11 The heterogeneity of BRCA represents a major obstacle in diagnosing this disease and determining adequate therapy for the patient [ 12 13 NUDT5 plays a crucial role in the estrogen signaling pathway, suggesting that NUDT5 inhibitors can block this pathway and may therefore exhibit similar therapeutic indications as estrogen antagonists. Quercetin has been identified as one of the inhibitors of the estrogen signaling pathway [ 14 Quercetin (3,3′,4′,5,7-pentahydroxy-2-phenylchromen-4-one) is classified as a flavonol, one of the six subclasses of flavonoid compounds [ 15 Allium cepa Asparagus officinalis Lactuca sativa 16 17 18 19 16 19 20 The poor water solubility, chemical instability, and short elimination half-life of quercetin limit its application in clinical trials [ 21 22 23 Given the urgent need for new therapeutic options in BRCA treatment, it is essential to develop adjuvant agents and drugs with reduced toxicity, fewer adverse effects, higher efficacy, selectivity, and lower risk of resistance. Molecular docking combined with MM/GBSA calculations enables the identification of NUDT5 inhibitors, provides atomic-level insights into NUDT5–ligand interactions, highlights key amino acid residues in the active site, and estimates the stability of protein–ligand complexes. Combined with pharmacokinetic profiling to reduce clinical failure risk, these in silico methods offer a rapid, cost-effective approach to select promising candidates for further in vitro and in vivo studies with an increased probability of success. In this context, the present work aimed to investigate the NUDT5 inhibitory potential of quercetin and its 52 structural analogs using the in silico method of molecular docking and MM/GBSA calculations, as well as predict the absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profile of selected quercetin analogs to propose effective orally active anti-BRCA drug candidates. 2. Results 2.1. Molecular Docking Molecular docking analysis was conducted in order to investigate the anti-BRCA potential of quercetin and its 52 structural analogs ( Table S1 in the Supplementary File 24 Figure 1 24 The conformation characterized by the lowest binding energy for each ligand was regarded as the most favorable. The results of molecular docking analysis for quercetin (L35) and structural analogs (L1–L34) with lower binding energies than quercetin (<−8.0 kcal/mol) are summarized in Table 1 14 Table S2 in the Supplementary File The binding energy values of the analyzed ligands ranged from −11.24 to −7.36 kcal/mol. The lowest binding energy reflects the strongest ligand-macromolecule binding. Data presented in Table 1 2.2. Hydrogen Bond Analysis Due to the essential importance of determining the strength, robustness, and stability of the interactions between the ligands and the target protein, a hydrogen bond analysis was performed. A basic understanding of hydrogen bond strength is made possible by knowing its length and bond angle. Data on the amino acid residues that participate in the construction of the hydrogen bond and the type, length, and angle of the hydrogen bond during the formation of the complex are given in Table 2 2.3. MM/GBSA Binding Free Energy Calculation The MM/GBSA approach for the evaluation of the binding free energy of ligand molecules was applied as a rescoring parameter to further optimize the lead molecules from the hits obtained from the docking studies. The binding free energies determined for the 35 complexes, as well as the reference compounds, are summarized in Table 3 It can be observed that among the studied compounds, L5 displayed the highest binding free energy of −47.83 kcal/mol, followed by L10 (−46.94 kcal/mol). These two compounds demonstrated higher binding free energy in comparison to all three reference compounds (C, T, and R). Ligands L1, L2, L3, L8, L9, L14, and L15 displayed higher binding free energy than the reference drugs T and R. The binding free energy of L4 is equal to that of T but lower than that of R. The mentioned ten ligands, along with ligands L17 and L24, possessed lower binding energy than quercetin. From the MM/GBSA calculations, it can be noted that van der Waals energies contribute the most to the binding free energy of the ligands. The electrostatic energy does not contribute either positively or negatively to the binding free energy. Also, the polar solvation energy did not have a favorable contribution to the total interaction in the docked complexes, while the SASA non-polar solvation energy contributed similarly to the binding free energy, as expected from the compounds of similar size. 2.4. Lipinski’s Rule of Five and ADMET Profile Ligands (L1–L34) with lower binding energy values than that of quercetin (L35), as well as L35 and C, were predicted for drug-likeness according to Lipinski’s rules, and a description of their properties, whether they meet or do not meet the rules, is shown in Table 4 26 27 According to Lipinski’s rules, a molecule is similar to a drug if it has a molecular mass (Mr) ≤ 500 Da, partition coefficient (logP) ≤ 5, number of hydrogen bond acceptors (nHBA) ≤ 10, and number of hydrogen bond donors (nHBD) ≤ 5 [ 28 Table 4 Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic profile of the top-ranking ligands from the MM/GBSA calculations and of those that comply with Lipinski’s rule and are highly Caco-2 permeable (L17, L24, L28, L30, L33), along with L35, C, and the reference drugs, were fully predicted using the pkCSM web tool. Their ADMET profile is given in Table S3 in the Supplementary File 2.5. Toxicity Profile A more detailed toxicity profile of the top-ranking ligands from the molecular docking studies and MM/GBSA calculations, as well as of highly Caco-2 permeable compounds that comply with Lipinski’s, rule was assessed. The results obtained by ProTox 3.0. Web server are presented in Table 5 The results indicated that except for L2, L5, L10, and L35, the other ligands showed high LD 50 50 The results of ligand interactions with various receptors of the nuclear signaling pathway, interactions with proteins related to stress response pathways, and molecular initiating events are presented in Tables S4–S6 in the Supplementary File 2.6. Binding Mode Interactions The binding mode interactions of quercetin (L35) and selected structural analogs were explored in more detail. The two-dimensional representation of the interactions of L1 at the receptor site is given in Figure 2 Analysis of interactions between the selected ligands and the target protein ( Figure 2 Figure 3 24 2.7. Correlation Between Binding Affinity Scores and Physicochemical Parameters A correlation between binding affinity scores and various physicochemical parameters, namely Mr, nHBA, nHBD, logP, solubility, and Caco-2 permeability, was tested. A strong negative correlation between binding affinity and Mr (r = 0.802, p p p 3. Discussion In women, BRCA is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death [ 29 30 9 Analysis of ligand binding interaction by molecular docking is a well-known method of drug discovery worldwide. The results obtained from this study would help understand the inhibitory mode and rapidly and accurately predict the activities of new inhibitors based on docking score. Also, an essential aspect of molecular docking involves identifying the active site on the receptor. The active site refers to the specific region on the surface of the receptor where ligands bind, causing conformational changes that result in a pharmacological effect [ 31 Table 1 Table S2 32 33 p Previous studies by other researchers have also examined the NUDT5 inhibitory potential of selected ligands to discover and develop new drugs for BRCA treatment. Using an in silico approach, Ruswanto et al. (2022) [ 34 34 35 Acquiring detailed information about the interactions between ligands and macromolecules is a prerequisite for elucidating the nature, behavior, and activity of the formed complexes. Amino acid residues of proteins show a tendency to form hydrogen and van der Waals interactions [ 36 37 31 Table 2 38 A study by Page et al. (2018) identified TrpA:28, ArgA:51, TrpB:46, and GluB:47 as key amino acid residues at the active site of the NUDT5 enzyme through which receptor-ligand interactions occur [ 24 14 The “rule of thumb” for drug-like property evaluation, also known as Lipinski’s rule of five, is a generally accepted method for predicting ADMET properties [ 39 40 41 In silico assessment of pharmacokinetic properties plays a key role in selecting potential compounds for experimental studies [ 42 43 44 45 27 26 46 47 47 48 47 The results of ADMET analysis indicate that none of the compounds were a substrate or inhibitor of CYP2D6. Eight of the selected ligands were substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A4, while three (L1, L10, and L33) were substrates for CYP3A4, indicating the possibility of interactions with drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4. Results from toxicity analysis demonstrated that ligands categorized into toxicity classes four and five have high LD50 values, suggesting a potentially wide therapeutic window, i.e., a wider margin between the effective and the toxic dose. However, it is crucial to conduct careful dose-ranging studies to identify the optimal therapeutic dose needed for anti-cancer effects that maximize efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Verifying the selectivity of a compound for the target protein over similar proteins is essential for optimizing its efficacy and safety to prevent off-target interactions that can lead to unwanted side effects, such as toxicity or unintended modulation of biological pathways. Non-selective binding to structurally similar proteins may disrupt normal cellular functions, causing adverse effects. Also, off-target interactions can diminish a compound’s therapeutic efficacy by engaging unintended biological pathways, resulting in unpredictable or counterproductive outcomes [ 13 Based on in silico findings, several structural modifications of quercetin were observed and are suggested to improve the NUDT5 inhibitory activity of compounds. By replacing the catechol structure with a benzodioxin ring, the rigidity of the molecule could be increased, improving target specificity. Substitution of the benzodioxin ring at position 2 (hydrophilic substituent, e.g., hydroxymethyl) and 3 (bulky substituent, e.g., 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) enables hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the enzyme’s active site. Reduction in the C2–C3 double bond of the benzopyran ring changes the electronic properties, stability, and rigidity of the molecule, enhancing its biological activity. Introducing bulky substituents at position 7 of the benzopyran ring provides steric bulk that could improve binding affinity. In summary, the Structure–Activity Relationship (SAR) analysis indicates that structural modifications of quercetin and its analogs, including increased molecular rigidity, introduction of hydrophilic and bulky substituents, and adjustment of the electronic and steric properties of the benzopyran core, are key for enhancing NUDT5 inhibitory activity. Such changes in the quercetin analogs enable the formation of hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions and hydrophobic interactions with key amino acid residues at the NUDT5 active site. These interactions play a crucial role in the formation and stabilization of the ligand–NUDT5 complex, resulting in lower binding energy values and improved target selectivity. The identified structural modifications could guide further lead optimization and development. By integrating the results of molecular docking, MM/GBSA calculations, compliance with Lipinski rules, and ADMET profiling, the two most promising ligands, L1 and L28, were selected. Based on the molecular docking results, MM/GBSA calculations, and ADMET profiling, L1 was identified as a promising NUDT5 inhibitor. Despite its non-compliance with the rules of Lipinski, the compound’s oral activity could be improved by the appropriate drug delivery system, such as nanoparticles or liposomes. Among the ligands that demonstrated higher binding affinity than quercetin in the docking studies and complied with the rules of Lipinski, taking into consideration the high values of Caco-2 permeability and intestinal absorption as the most important absorption parameters, the feature that it is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of CYP and has a high toxicity threshold, L28 is proposed as an orally active BRCA drug candidate with NUDT5 inhibitory potential. It is important to emphasize that these studies rely on in silico approaches, and to corroborate the promising preliminary findings derived from computational methods, further experimental research is mandated. The translation of in silico results into further in vitro and in vivo studies will facilitate the development of these ligands as promising drug candidates, or at least as prototypes for new therapeutic agents in the treatment of BRCA. By experimentally validating their in silico results, numerous studies have shown that computational methods can enable the discovery of BRCA inhibitors. Using molecular docking, scientists demonstrated the ERɑ inhibitory potential of genistein and daidzein and confirmed their in silico results using an ERɑ competitor assay and a luciferase reporter gene assay. These studies confirmed the feasibility of computational methods for predicting the inhibitory potential of ligands [ 49 50 Chiladenus montanus 51 Flavonoids possess the potential to enhance the efficacy of current BRCA therapies, and to reduce both recurrence and chemoresistance in patients [ 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 While this study provides valuable insights into the potential effectiveness of quercetin analogs as anti-BRCA drug candidates, it has several limitations. In database screening, compound libraries are examined to identify small molecules anticipated to interact with the drug target [ 59 13 59 Although in silico methods are powerful tools in drug discovery, there is always the possibility of their improvement to increase their efficiency and precision. Future research that could improve knowledge on this topic should include a more complete determination of the pathogenesis of BRCA, along with an investigation of the interactions among its main participants. While molecular docking, MM/GBSA, and ADMET profiling provide valuable preliminary insights, molecular dynamics simulations could be employed to capture conformational changes and assess the stability of ligand–protein complexes over time, thereby improving the reliability of in silico predictions. Further steps should focus on bridging the gap between in silico predictions and clinical efficacy, given that favorable computational outcomes do not necessarily translate into therapeutic effectiveness. Promising candidates from in silico screening must be validated in vitro to assess their NUDT5 inhibitory activity and cytotoxic effects on BRCA cell lines. In vitro studies would allow the assessment of the specificity, potency, physicochemical properties, stability, and preliminary safety profile of the compounds. For promising candidates such as L1, the development of optimized drug delivery systems should be considered to improve bioavailability and pharmacokinetic properties. After validation and formulation, successful candidates will then progress to in vivo studies to evaluate their anti-cancer effects and ultimately into clinical trials to confirm or reject the potential for developing a new generation of drugs for BRCA treatment—NUDT5 inhibitors. In addition, combining NUDT5 inhibitors with existing chemotherapy or targeted therapies could be explored to enhance therapeutic outcomes. Expanding the scope of this work to include other cancer types that rely on NUDT5 activity may broaden the potential impact of these findings. 4. Materials and Methods The workflow presented in Figure 4 4.1. Preparation of Ligands for Molecular Docking Chemical structures of ligand molecules (L1-L53), two FDA-approved drugs (tamoxifen (T) and raloxifene (R)) used as positive controls, and the co-crystallized ligand (C): 7-[[5-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl]methyl]-1,3-dimethyl-8-piperazin-1-yl-purine-2,6-dione) were taken from the PubChem database ( http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 60 61 Figure 5 Table S1 in the Supplementary File 4.2. Preparation of the NUDT5 Receptor for Docking NUDT5 enzyme is crucial to cellular processes involved in nucleotide metabolism and cancer. Inhibition of NUDT5 can block nuclear ATP synthesis, hormone signaling, and cell proliferation in BRCA [ 24 https://www.rcsb.org/ 24 4.3. Molecular Docking Procedure Molecular docking was performed using the AutoDock 4.2.6 software package (Molecular Graphics Laboratory, La Jolla, CA, USA), according to the standard procedure for a rigid receptor and a flexible ligand, with 25 independent repetitions per ligand. Ligand flexibility parameters, including the central atom (root) and the number of rotatable bonds, were automatically assigned by AutoDock software. The grid was set to a size of 60 points in the x, y, and z directions, and the distance between the grid points was 0.375 Å. The binding coordinates of the co-crystallized ligand were set as the grid center and were 12.294515, −14.443515, and −11.751455 in the x, y, and z directions, respectively. The specified coordinates were used during the docking of each ligand. The grid box files were saved as .gpf files, and the AutoGrid procedure was executed. The co-crystallized ligand (C) and two FDA-approved estrogen receptor-positive BRCA drugs—tamoxifen (T) and raloxifene (R)—were used as positive controls. Docking was performed using the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm method [ 62 The docking procedure was validated by removing the co-crystallized ligand from the complex with NUDT5 and re-docking it to the receptor site using AutoDock 4.2.6. Root mean square deviation (RMSD) calculation included heavy atoms only. The RMSD between the obtained conformation and the original structure being less than 2 Å (0.367 Å) indicated the reliability of the binding ability prediction of new ligands [ 14 4.4. Binding Free Energy Calculations Molecular docking methods may produce false-positive results due to their inadequate consideration of receptor dynamics. Therefore, the validation of docking results through post-docking methods, such as MM/GBSA, provides a more comprehensive evaluation by incorporating solvation effects and entropic contributions. This approach ensures a more reliable and accurate estimation of the binding affinities of the investigated compounds [ 63 64 4.5. Determination of the Key Parameters of Lipinski’s Rule of Five The significant parameters of Lipinski’s rule of five: Mr [g/mol], nHBA, nHBD, and logP were determined by the SwissADME web tool ( http://www.swissadme.ch/ 65 4.6. Prediction of ADMET Profile ADMET properties of the docked ligands were predicted using the pkCSM web tool ( https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/pkcsm/ 43 4.7. Toxicity Analysis The toxicity profile of the top-performing compounds (L1–L15) based on molecular docking results and MM/GBSA calculations was assessed using the ProTox 3.0 web server [ 66 4.8. Statistical Analysis The correlation analysis between binding affinity scores and various physicochemical parameters was performed by IBM SPSS, version 22, and was reported as Pearson’s coefficient. A statistically significant correlation was determined with a level of significance of p 5. Conclusions Despite advances in BRCA treatment, it remains a serious threat to individuals’ physical and mental health, as reflected by high mortality rates. Phytochemicals may provide therapeutic benefits when used alone or together with established anti-BRCA therapies as adjuvants. This study highlights the role of quercetin and its structural analogs in targeting the NUDT5 enzyme and their potential in anti-BRCA drug development. Novel insights into the NUDT5 inhibitory potential of quercetin and its structural analogs were provided through various computational techniques, including molecular docking, MM/GBSA, and ADMET analysis. Molecular docking simulations identified crucial binding interactions between the compounds and the NUDT5 active site, revealing that ligand inhibitory activity is primarily mediated through interactions with four key amino acid residues: Trp28 and Arg51 of chain A and Trp46 and Glu47 of chain B. Quercetin and its structural analogs with higher docking scores than quercetin were subjected to MM/GBSA calculations to support the binding affinity predictions further. Additionally, ADMET profiling enabled the selection of compounds possessing favorable pharmacokinetic properties. The comprehensive computational approach identified ligand L1 as the most promising candidate, suitable for delivery via an appropriate drug delivery system, while L28 emerged as a potential orally administered compound, both supporting further experimental validation. These results support the development of NUDT5-targeted therapeutics as a novel strategy in anti-BRCA research.
