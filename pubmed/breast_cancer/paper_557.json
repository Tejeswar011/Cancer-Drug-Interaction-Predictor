Despite playing a critical role in patient care, nurses face systemic marginalization that curtails their autonomy and limits their ability to educate and advocate for women's health. This commentary applies a postmodern feminist lens to challenge dominant paradigms, particularly logical positivism, and argues for the recognition of contextual, relational, and gendered knowledge. By embracing a more inclusive philosophical framework, nursing knowledge can be elevated and nurses empowered to address disparities in breast cancer screening. Structural reforms and a reimagining of nursing's role are essential to improving patient outcomes and fostering equitable healthcare systems in Qatar. This article proposes nurse-led education initiatives and policy engagement in screening protocols as key strategies for addressing disparities in breast cancer screening. breast cancer screening nursing autonomy postmodern feminism health disparities pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes typesetter ts19 cover-date January-December 2025 Introduction A late-stage breast cancer diagnosis encountered in clinical practice catalyzed this commentary. In Qatar, breast cancer accounts for 17% of all cancer cases among women, yet national screening participation rates remain below 40% ( Ministry of Public Health, 2023 Donnelly et al., 2012 Matin et al., 2021 Ministry of Public Health, 2023 Brief Review Healthcare in Qatar is characterized by hierarchical models that prioritize physician dominance and institutional authority over collaborative, patient-centered care. While expatriate nursing leaders have contributed to educational reform, the day-to-day experience of frontline nurses, many of whom are migrants, remains governed by inflexible structures that discourage initiative and critical engagement ( Felzmann, 2020 Fernandopulle, 2021 Butts, 2021 Park et al., 2020 In contrast, postmodern feminist theory emphasizes the socially constructed nature of knowledge and prioritizes diverse perspectives informed by culture, gender, and lived experience ( Haraway, 2022 Rodgers, 2005 Collins, 2000 Haraway, 2022 Current Insights Nurses are uniquely positioned to support women in breast cancer screening due to their close, ongoing relationships with patients. However, institutional policies in Qatar frequently restrict nurses from initiating health conversations, providing referrals, or exercising professional judgment without direct physician approval ( Hamed et al., 2022 Hwang et al., 2016 Evidence indicates that women who receive breast health education from nurses are significantly more likely to participate in screening activities such as clinical breast examinations and mammograms ( Donnelly et al., 2012 Hamed et al., 2022 A postmodern feminist perspective challenges these constraints by advocating for “power-with” relationships, models of interprofessional collaboration that respect nursing input and promote shared authority ( Fraser, 2014 Gallarotti, 2022 These arguments are further supported by regional policy frameworks, including the Department of Healthcare Professions licensing standards, the Gulf Cooperation Council Strategic Health Plan, and the Qatar National Cancer Framework 2023–2026 ( Department of Healthcare Professions, 2025 Gulf Health Council, 2023 Ministry of Public Health, 2023 Postmodern feminism offers an emancipatory framework to confront the structural marginalization of nurses and reimagine their role in healthcare systems. By challenging hierarchical models and embracing the value of relational, culturally situated knowledge, this paradigm supports a redefinition of nursing roles. Empowering nurses to initiate conversations about breast screening, provide culturally sensitive education, and advocate for patients can significantly enhance the effectiveness of national screening strategies and contribute to improved public health outcomes ( Collins, 2000 Felzmann, 2020 Institutional reform is critical. Policies must reflect an understanding of nurses as autonomous professionals with the expertise to influence patient decisions and healthcare delivery. Nursing curricula should incorporate philosophical inquiry, particularly around epistemology and power, to prepare practitioners who can advocate for systemic change. Conclusion Implications for Nursing Practice and Policy Closing the gap in breast screening participation in Qatar will require more than operational improvements; it demands a fundamental transformation in how nursing knowledge is conceptualized and valued. A postmodern feminist lens provides a compelling framework for understanding and dismantling barriers to nursing autonomy. Recognizing the vital role nurses play in health promotion, particularly in contexts shaped by gender and cultural norms, can lead to more inclusive healthcare practices and better outcomes for women. Ultimately, empowering nurses through policy support, education, and collaborative structures will not only advance breast screening initiatives but also foster a more just and effective healthcare system. Justice, in this context, includes gender equity, decolonized healthcare structures, and equitable participation in leadership. Empowering nurses through inclusive policy frameworks and feminist-informed education can lay the groundwork for a new generation of nursing leaders in Qatar and neighboring MENA countries.
