While gender influences PA behaviors in other cancers, data among HNC survivors remain limited. We investigated gender-specific differences in PA preferences, perceived barriers, and interest in nutrition education among French HNC patients. Methods In June 2023, 400 adult HNC patients at a French cancer center were invited to complete a 24-item online survey assessing sociodemographics, digital device use, PA preferences (modality, intensity, frequency, supervision, duration, social context, location), perceived barriers, and willingness to join a nutrition-integrated education program. Gender differences were analyzed using chi-square/Fisher’s exact tests and t Results Eighty-nine respondents (mean age 62.1 ± 11.5 years; 68.5% male) were included. Seventy-three percent expressed interest in a tailored PA program, and 70.8% felt physically able to participate. Walking was the most preferred activity (80.9%), with moderate intensity, 30–60-min sessions twice weekly. Men favored independent, home- or outdoor-based activities (e.g., biking: 52.5% vs. 21.4% in women; p p p Conclusion Distinct gender-specific patterns in PA and educational preferences exist among HNC survivors. Men may benefit most from autonomous, home- or outdoors-based PA programs, while women appear to engage more readily with supervised, socially interactive formats including targeted nutritional guidance.

Men and women often differ in both their preferences and the challenges they face when engaging in PA [ 26 27 In this context, characterized by substantial inter-individual demographic and clinical variability among patients with HNC, the need to promote adherence to AP programs, and a lack of literature on gender-specific preferences, the present study aimed to explore gender-specific preferences and barriers to adapted PA among French patients affected by HNC. Methods Study design and data source A retrospective, web-based observational study was conducted at Institut Curie in June 2023. An anonymous 24-item questionnaire was developed using REDCap, a secure platform widely used for online surveys and clinical research databases (Appendix 1 28 29 Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Institut Curie (approval #DATA230030, April 4, 2023), in accordance with standards for research involving human participants. Study participants Eligible participants were adult patients diagnosed with head and neck cancer (HNC—malignant tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract, salivary glands, or sinuses; patients treated for thyroid or dermatologic cancers were excluded.), at any stage and with any oncologic event (local, regional, or distant recurrence), whether undergoing diagnostic workup, treatment, or follow-up, and whose initial treatment was carried out at our institution between January 1, 2019, and January 1, 2024. Each patient was also required to have a valid email address. Two email invitations were sent 15 days apart, and each participant was allowed to respond only once to ensure consistency and minimize bias. Data collection Sociodemographic and medical characteristics Collected data included age, gender (female or male), and department of residence. Participants reported their physical condition based on predefined categories, ranging from no limitations to being bedridden. Health-related variables included current weight, target weight, and height (cm), used to calculate body mass index (BMI), which was then categorized as underweight (BMI < 18.5), normal weight (18.5–24.9), overweight (25–29.9), or obese (≥ 30). Participants also indicated whether they were currently undergoing treatment for HNC (yes/no); if not, they reported how many years had passed since treatment completion. Digital use To assess participants’ familiarity with digital tools for health purposes, questions addressed the use of personal computers and mobile phones, including Internet access. Participants were also asked if they would be interested in a remotely delivered PA program, for example, using a wearable activity tracker, live video exercise sessions, or a smartphone application, with response options of yes, no, or maybe. Physical activity preferences Some preference items were presented as forced‐choice questions (select one option), while others permitted multiple endorsements (select all that apply). Participants were initially asked whether they would be interested in capability willingness to participate The questionnaire explored PA modalities locations social preferences Participants indicated their preferred level of supervision Participants selected their preferred PA intensit y Participants indicated their preferences for the structure The questionnaire explored preferred program duration Participants indicated preferred session frequency Preferred times of day Participants indicated preferred session duration Participants selected which factors would motivate them to engage Finally, participants were asked about potential barriers to engaging Therapeutic Education Patients (TEP) Participants were additionally asked about interest in a Therapeutic Education Patients (TPE) program focused on PA. TPE, as defined by the WHO, is a structured, person-centered learning process that empowers individuals living with chronic conditions to self-manage their health by utilizing their own resources. In this context, we inquire about the patient’s experience with TPE focused on PA. Response options included “yes,” “no,” or “maybe.” Those who responded positively were further asked to indicate their preferred delivery format: video conferencing, in-person sessions during hospital visits, or a hybrid model combining both. Statistical analysis Participant responses were analyzed using quantitative content analysis by identifying specific themes or categories and reporting their frequencies and percentages. Quantitative data were summarized using means and standard deviations (SD). Participants missing more than 20% of the primary preference items were excluded from all analyses. For the remaining sample, complete-case analyses were conducted for each variable, such that only available data contributed to each comparison. Statistical comparisons were conducted to evaluate group differences in both categorical and continuous variables. For continuous variables, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was employed to compare two independent groups, while the chi-squared test was used for categorical variables. To control for multiple comparisons, p p All statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.0.4, and results were considered statistically significant at a p Results Participants’ characteristics Of the 400 patients contacted, 96 responded (24%). After excluding five participants due to missing data and three who had not received cancer treatment (but had been treated for benign non-cancerous tumors), 89 participants were included.

While this model encourages initial uptake, requiring ongoing financial contributions could compromise long-term adherence. To bridge the gap between hospital-based care and community services, over 500 Maisons Sport-Santé now operate nationwide, providing largely free or low-cost exercise sessions and formal referral pathways from oncology centers to local health-promotion facilities. Discussion Key findings Our study revealed a strong overall interest in PA among HNC patients, with 73% expressing willingness to engage in a PA program. This rate is higher than the 33–38% reported in some studies in the literature [ 23 30 Baseline preferences and gender-specific differences Overall, most participants—regardless of gender—expressed similar baseline preferences, including walking as the most commonly favored modality and a shared inclination toward moderate-intensity PA. In line with prior research on cancer survivors, walking remains a highly accessible and adaptable form of PA, frequently cited for its minimal equipment requirements and ease of integration into daily routines. Both men and women in our study typically desired PA sessions lasting 30–60 min, about twice per week, over the course of 1 year—usually in the morning—underscoring a general desire for moderate yet consistent engagement. These preferences are partly reflected in the literature, in the form of PA programs lasting less than an hour and a maximum of three times per week [ 30 31 Nevertheless, our findings also underscore important gender-specific nuances. Women were more likely to favor supervised group-based programs, such as yoga and dance, placing higher value on social support and continuous professional guidance—an observation similarly noted in other cancer cohorts, notably among patients with metastatic breast cancer [ 32 Barriers and motivational factors About 36% of respondents reported barriers to PA, with fatigue and lack of motivation being the most common—both well documented in HNC populations [ 33 18 19 34 27 35 36 37 Digital interventions Remote delivery of PA programs (e.g., via mobile applications, wearable trackers, or video sessions) has shown promise in various cancer populations, offering a means to circumvent geographic and time constraints. However, in our study, only 24.5% of participants found videoconferencing appealing, and 27.8% endorsed activity monitoring via connected devices. These findings differ from Twomey et al., who demonstrated acceptable feasibility for phone- and web-based home PA in HNC [ 38 Psychological and social aspects Nearly half of HNC survivors experience depressive symptoms [ 39 40 41 42 43 Prehabilitation, muscle strengthening, and therapeutic education Rehabilitation programs incorporating exercise report enhanced muscular endurance, range of motion, and reductions in pain and fatigue among HNC survivors [ 44 45 46 47 47 In addition to aerobic activities, HNC patients benefit from muscle-strengthening exercises. Sarcopenia—common in this population—is linked to poorer treatment tolerance and higher complication rates [ 48 49 50 Finally, another notable result is that therapeutic patient education, particularly integrating PA, garnered strong interest among women (60.7%) but relatively low acceptance among men (13.1%). In the study by Agnew et al. [ 51 47 Study limitations A few limitations should be considered. The single-center design and email-based recruitment may limit generalizability, particularly among rural or less tech-savvy populations. The 24% response rate—though typical for electronic surveys [ 52 Strengths Despite these limitations, the study presents several strengths. It offers a detailed analysis of gender-specific PA preferences and perceived barriers—an area rarely explored in HNC—which can support more targeted interventions. Beyond activity type, it includes preferences for timing, intensity, logistical constraints, and motivation. By surveying interest in nutrition-focused education alongside exercise preferences, our study provides initial insight into patients’ appetite for multimodal supportive care, laying the groundwork for future combined interventions. These findings provide a valuable foundation for designing or improving prehabilitation and supportive care programs tailored to patients’ diverse needs. Conclusion This survey highlights distinct gender-specific preferences and barriers to PA among HNC patients. While walking was widely favored, men and women differed in their preferences regarding supervision, social context, and activity types, underscoring the importance of tailored interventions. These insights are essential for developing PA programs that address the complex needs of this population, particularly given the risks of malnutrition, sarcopenia, and treatment-related complications. Ensuring adherence remains a key challenge, and programs should prioritize enjoyment and adaptability to fit patients’ lifestyles. Aligning aerobic, strength-based, and nutritional strategies with individual preferences may help counteract deconditioning and improve quality of life. These findings also provide a foundation for implementing prehabilitation or exercise-based supportive care in oncology settings, potentially enhancing both research and patient outcomes.
