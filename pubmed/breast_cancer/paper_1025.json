This study presents an innovative approach for fabricating highly stable and efficient biocatalytic nanomembranes through the co-immobilization of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and glucose oxidase (GOx) within a covalent organic framework (COF) nanocrystal. Capitalizing on the dynamic covalent chemistry of COFs during their self-healing and self-crystallization processes, we achieved simultaneous enzyme immobilization and framework formation. This unique confinement strategy preserved enzymatic activity while significantly enhancing stability. HRP/GOx@COF biocatalytic membrane was prepared through the loading of immobilized enzymes (HRP/GOx@COF) onto a macroporous polymeric substrate membrane pre-coated with a polydopamine (PDA) adhesive layer. At HRP and GOx dosages of 4 mg and 4.5 mg, respectively, and a glucose concentration of 5 mM, the removal rate of bisphenol A (BPA) reached 99% through the combined functions of catalysis, adsorption, and rejection. The BPA removal rate of the biocatalytic membrane remained high under both acidic and alkaline conditions. Additionally, the removal rate of dyes with different properties exceeded 88%. The removal efficiencies of doxycycline hydrochloride, 2,4-dichlorophenol, and 8-hydroxyquinoline surpassed 95%. In this study, the enzyme was confined in the ordered and stable COF, which endowed the biocatalytic membrane with good stability and reusability over multiple batch cycles. biocatalytic membrane immobilized enzyme micropollutant removal the S&T program of Hebei 21372805D 21372804D Baoding science and technology plan projec 2494F016 This research was funded by the S&T program of Hebei (21372805D, 21372804D), and the Baoding science and technology plan project (2494F016). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Various micropollutants (MPs), including antibiotics and endocrine disruptors, are commonly found in industrial and medical wastewater [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 MPs pose formidable control challenges due to their persistent toxicity, environmental stability, and diverse contamination sources. Therefore, MPs require urgent control to reduce their negative impact on both the environment and humans. Current removal strategies include: (1) physical (membrane filtration, adsorption), (2) chemical (advanced oxidation, photocatalysis), and (3) biological (enzymatic degradation) approaches [ 10 11 12 Oxidoreductases can oxidize phenolic compounds, including various drugs and antibiotics, to form free radicals or products such as dimers and trimers, which are generally less toxic than the original phenolic compounds [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 The immobilization of the enzyme on a membrane to form a biocatalytic membrane enhances the enzyme’s environmental tolerance, enables reusability, and allows for the removal of degradation products [ 21 22 23 24 25 26 Currently, widely used amorphous polymer membranes suffer from disordered structures and nonadjustable pores. On the other hand, crystalline covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer ordered networks with precisely tunable pores, high porosity, and large surface areas [ 27 28 29 30 The crystallization process of imine-linked COFs proceeds through an initial formation of low-crystalline polymeric intermediates, which subsequently undergo gradual structural ordering into well-defined crystalline frameworks [ 31 32 33 34 35 Here in this study, HRP and GOx were in situ encapsulated in COF using this strategy, which not only protects enzymes via the initial formation of low-crystalline enzyme-polymer intermediates, but also enables the encapsulation of enzymes with larger size, well preserving the activity and enhancing the stability of enzyme. The prepared HRP/GOx@COF was then employed to fabricate a biocatalytic membrane via polydopamine-assisted self-assembly method, achieving efficient MPs removal through the synergistic effect of catalysis, rejection, and adsorption. Although enzyme immobilization has been successfully achieved using porous crystalline frameworks such as MOFs and COFs as carriers, the current approaches mostly rely on post-synthetic encapsulation methods. In contrast, our self-crystallization approach involves the co-assembly of COF precursors and enzymes during framework formation, enabling a more homogeneous distribution and higher loading efficiency. This approach substantially reduces mass transfer constraints and improves enzymatic stability by leveraging a customized pore, demonstrating clear benefits compared to traditional encapsulation methods. 2.

(Shanghai, China). 2.2. Synthesis of Amorphous COF (aCOF) The synthesis of aCOF was performed using a previously reported method with some adjustments [ 36 n 2.3. Synthesis of HRP/GOx@aCOF First, 200 μL of PBS buffer (pH 6.5, 10 mM) containing HRP and GOx was added to 3 mL of PBS buffer (10 mM) containing pre-dispersed aCOF (10 mg). The resulting mixture was shaken at 500 rpm at room temperature overnight. The product was then centrifuged and washed three times with ultrapure water to remove any loosely adsorbed HRP/GOx, resulting in HRP/GOx@aCOF. 2.4. Synthesis of HRP/GOx@COF First, 3 mL of ACN was added to the centrifuge tube containing the obtained HRP/GOx@aCOF. Then, 0.6 mL of acetic acid (6 M) was added to the mixture. The resulting mixture was placed at 25 °C for 6 h, and the final product was washed twice with ACN and ultrapure water, respectively. The preparation method for COF was the same as for HRP/GOx@aCOF, except that enzymes were not added. 2.5. Synthesis of Biocatalytic Membrane The PAN ultrafiltration membrane was hydrolyzed in a 1 M NaOH solution at 50 °C for 1 h, and the residual NaOH was removed with deionized water to obtain the hydrolyzed polyacrylonitrile (HPAN) membrane. The HPAN membrane was then placed in the ultrafiltration cup with the separation layer facing up. Subsequently, 20 mg of dopamine hydrochloride was dissolved in 10 mL of Tris-HCl buffer (25 mM, pH = 8.8) and mixed ultrasonically. The reaction solution was introduced into the device and incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 4 h. Subsequently, the mixture was decanted, and the membrane was thoroughly rinsed with ultrapure water to eliminate residual dopamine monomers, yielding the polydopamine-coated HPAN (PDA@HPAN) membrane. Then, pour the HRP/GOx@COF solution into the device and filter at 0.1 MPa until no droplets remain. Finally, the obtained HRP/GOx@COF membrane was removed and gently washed three times with deionized water. 2.6. Membrane Performance Evaluation 2.6.1. Pure Water Permeability The membrane to be tested was first mounted in the ultrafiltration cup with the selective layer oriented upward. It was then compacted at 2 bar for 20 min to achieve steady-state hydraulic conditions. After stabilizing the operation pressure at 1 bar, permeate samples were collected at predetermined time intervals. Each membrane was subjected to a minimum of three independent filtration trials to ensure reproducibility. The pure water permeance ( PWP −2 −1 −1 (1) P W P = V A × t × P V t A 2 −3 2 P 2.6.2. Dye Rejection A standard curve of concentration versus absorbance was plotted by measuring the absorbance of dye solutions with varying concentrations at their maximum absorption wavelengths: 668 nm for MEB, 614 nm for MG, 530 nm for CBT, 504 nm for CR, and 600 nm for MB. A 10 mg/L dye solution was used to test dye rejection using the ultrafiltration cup at 1 bar. The absorbance of the permeate solution was measured with an ultraviolet-visible (UV–vis) spectrophotometer, and the concentration was calculated using the standard curve mentioned above. The dye rejection ( R (2) R = 1 − C p C f × 100 % , C p C f 2.6.3. MP Removal Rate A standard curve of BPA concentration versus corresponding peak areas was plotted through the analysis of BPA solutions with varying concentrations via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The chromatographic column used was a C18 column (Eclipse Plus C18, 250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm, Agilent). The analytical conditions were set as follows: mobile phase of methanol: water (8:2), flow rate of 1 mL/min, sample injection volume of 20 μL, and column oven temperature of 30 °C. The detection wavelength for the samples was 278 nm, and the sample retention time was 4.78 min. A 25 mL BPA solution (10 mg/L) was added to the ultrafiltration cup, and the permeate was collected within 4 h at room temperature (25 °C). The enzymatic reaction was quenched by adding 0.1 M HCl. The residual BPA concentration was analyzed by HPLC, and the removal efficiency ( R The removal efficiencies of other micropollutants, including DC (50 mg/L), HQ (20 mg/L), 2,4-DCP (20 mg/L), TC (50 mg/L), 4-NP (20 mg/L), and 8-HQ (50 mg/L) were comparable to that of BPA, with the following exceptions: For DC, the mobile phase was methanol: water (9:1) with a detection wavelength of 280 nm. For HQ, the mobile phase was acetonitrile: water (1:1). For 2,4-DCP, the mobile phase was methanol: water (7:3) with a detection wavelength of 285 nm. For TC, the mobile phase was acetonitrile: water (1:3) with a detection wavelength of 280 nm. For 4-NP, the mobile phase was methanol: water (7:3) with a detection wavelength of 220 nm. For acetaminophen (APAP), the mobile phase was methanol: water (35:65) with a detection wavelength of 243 nm. The concentration of 8-HQ was measured using a UV–vis spectrophotometer at 625 nm. 2.7. Enzyme Activity of Biocatalytic Membrane 2.7.1. The Protein Immobilization Yield The protein immobilization yield was determined by quantifying unbound enzyme in the supernatant post-synthesis. Briefly, the supernatant was collected after centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 10 min) and analyzed via the Bradford assay (λ = 595 nm). The immobilization yield was calculated as: I m m o b i l i z a t i o n  y i e l d  % = C i n i t i a l − C s u p e r n a t a n t C i n i t i a l × 100 % , C initial C supernatant 2.7.2. The Membrane Surface Enzyme Activity First, 2 mL of guaiacol (15 mM), and 1 mL of PBS buffer (pH = 6) were mixed under agitation. The absorbance ( A 0 A 1 U HRP (3) U H R P = A 1 − A 0 T × τ × M × V , T τ −1 −1 M 2.8. Stability and Reusability Test The storage stability of the biocatalytic membrane was evaluated by measuring the BPA removal rate after specific storage periods in ultrapure water. The testing method was the same as for the performance evaluation. The membrane’s reusability was assessed by measuring its BPA removal rate after each reuse cycle. After each cycle, the membrane surface was thoroughly cleaned with ultrapure water three times. 2.9. Sample Preparation for Characterization Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR): FT-IR spectra were recorded on a Bruker GMBH VERTEX 70 spectrometer equipped with a DTGS detector. Samples were prepared by mixing the dry powder with anhydrous KBr (1:100 weight ratio) and pressing into a pellet. Spectra were acquired in transmission mode over the range of 4000–400 cm −1 −1 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS): XPS analysis was performed on a Thermo Fisher Technologies-ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer using a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). Powder samples were mounted on double-sided carbon tape. Survey and high-resolution spectra were collected with a pass energy of 150 eV and 50 eV, respectively, and a step size of 1.0 eV and 0.1 eV, respectively. Charge compensation was applied using a dual-beam flood source. All binding energies were referenced to the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM): AFM measurements were performed on a Bruker Dimension Icon microscope in PeakForce Tapping mode using ScanAsyst-Air probes (Bruker). Samples were prepared by dispersing the powder in ethanol, sonicating for 15 min, and drop-casting onto a freshly cleaved mica substrate. Images were processed and analyzed using Gwyddion software (v. 2.62); the root mean square (RMS) roughness was calculated from at least three different 5 × 5 μm scans. X-ray Diffraction (XRD): Powder XRD patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation ( λ 3. Results and Discussion 3.1.

Conclusions In this study, HRP and GOx were successfully immobilized in a COF through self-healing and self-crystallization, enabled by the dynamic covalent chemical properties of COF. This strategy not only maintains the activity but also enhances the stability of enzymes. The HRP/GOx@COF biocatalytic membrane was successfully prepared through the loading of the immobilized enzymes onto a substrate membrane, using dopamine for adhesion. The effects of dual enzyme amount and glucose concentration on the BPA removal rate of the biocatalytic membrane were investigated. At an HRP dosage of 4 mg, a GOx dosage of 4.5 mg, and a glucose concentration of 5 mM, the BPA removal rate reached 99%. Additionally, the removal efficiency of DC, 2,4-DCP, and 8-HQ exceeded 95%. The removal rate of five dyes with different properties also exceeded 88%. Furthermore, the BPA removal rate of the HRP/GOx@COF biocatalytic membrane remained high under both acidic and basic conditions. Confining the enzyme within an orderly and stable COF resulted in excellent stability for the biocatalytic membrane, which maintained a BPA removal rate of 85% after eight cycles and over 90% after 14 days of storage.
