However, limited data exists on why patients choose Reishi. This study aimed to explore patients’ expectations and barriers to using Reishi. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey study of a cancer population from Mainland China who reported using Reishi. Participants were recruited using a customer database from Zhongke Health International LLC. Patients’ expectations and barriers to Reishi use were assessed using a modified version of the Attitudes and Beliefs Toward Complementary and Alternative Medicine (ABCAM) survey. Multivariable linear regression models were applied to examine whether socio-demographic and clinical factors, as well as Reishi usage patterns, influenced participants’ attitudes toward Reishi. Results: Among 1374 participants, the most common sources of information about Reishi products were friends (49.78%) and family (36.83%). More than half (55.9%) used additional traditional Chinese herbal remedies in combination with Reishi. The most frequently cited expectations for Reishi use were boosting immunity (45% strongly agreed) and improving physical health (41% strongly agreed). 72% identified cost and insurance coverage as the primary barriers to Reishi usage. Approximately 10% considered side effects and limited research evidence as barriers. Stage IV cancer and duration of Reishi use >5 years were significantly associated with higher expectations and lower perceived barriers. Conclusion: This study identified the most common expectations and barriers to Reishi use in cancer care in Mainland China. These findings can help clinicians better understand patient perspectives and integrate herbal supplements more effectively into supportive cancer care.

Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional survey study of Chinese cancer patients and survivors to explore their perceived expectations and barriers regarding Reishi. Furthermore, we aim to understand the sociodemographic and clinical factors that influence these expectations and barriers. By providing insights into these perspectives, our findings offer novel insights into the development of patient-centered integrative cancer care strategies utilizing herbal medicine. They may also help clarify how both specific expectations and broader health beliefs influence the decision to use individual CAM therapies like Reishi. Materials and Methods Sample and Study Design We conducted a cross-sectional survey study involving Chinese cancer patients and survivors using Reishi products between October 2022 to December 2022. Eligible participants included adults with a history of any cancer types or stages, those able to understand written and spoken Mandarin, and individuals who had previously or were currently using Reishi products. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (2022-XLA129-1). We identified potential participants who met the eligibility criteria via information using the Zhongke Health International LLC database. It is a commercial customer registry used to manage product distribution and customer service. When customers purchase Reishi products, they provide basic information such as name, gender, and phone number, which may be used for purposes like refill reminders or follow-up inquiries. Customers were informed and given the opportunity to opt out of the database at any time. Trained research personnel reached out to potential participants to confirm eligibility, explain the study aims and procedures, and obtain oral or written consent using phone or the Chinese messaging tool WeChat. Surveys were completed either online or via phone, depending on preference of the participant. Upon completion of the survey, each participant was given gift of a value of approximately $2. The Chinese survey platform WJX (Changsha Ranxing IT Ltd.) collected the data for this study, for which statisticians at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center conducted the analysis. Study Variables Outcomes: Expectations and Barriers We used a modified version of the Attitudes and Beliefs toward Complementary and Alternative Medicine (ABCAM)—MABCAM instrument to evaluate expectations and barriers of cancer patients and survivors regarding Reishi use. The ABCAM was originally developed by Mao et al,  13  2 Expectations The translated ABCAM has 9 items assessing expectations, including boost my immune system, improve my physical health, help me live longer, reduce symptoms, help me cope with the experience of having cancer, help cure my cancer, prevent future development of health problems, harmonize my mind and body reduce stress reduce fatigue, improve sleep improve appetite 14 16 Barriers The barriers encompass 2 domains: “treatment concerns” and “logistical challenges.” Treatment concerns reflect patients’ concerns about using certain treatments for cancer care, which includes may not be based on scientific research, may interfere with the conventional cancer treatments may have side effects uncertainty on the quality of the product the costs are not covered by insurance, may cost too much money, hard to adhere to long period treatments, lack of professional guidance, hard to taking the supplement hard to tolerate the taste We used a four-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = agree, 4 = strongly agree) to assess the perceived expectations and barriers of cancer patients regarding their Reishi usage. Participants were asked questions about their agreement with statements reflecting their attitudes. Total scores of each domain were calculated by summing the individual items and normalizing them to a value between 0 and 100, with higher scores indicating greater expectations or barriers. Co-Variables Our survey collected socio-demographic (age, gender, education, employment status, and location), and cancer-related clinical factors (cancer type, years since cancer diagnosis, cancer stage, and current cancer treatment status). We also collected data regarding patient Reishi usage, including source of learning about Reishi products, duration of Reishi usage, and whether or not Reishi usage was combined with other TCM usage. Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics were used to assess expectations and barriers scores and items, as well as co-variables (eg, age, gender, and cancer type), using frequencies, proportions and means (standard deviation [SD]). To explore factors that may influence the expectations and barriers of patients toward Reishi, we first conducted ANOVA tests to assess whether perceived expectations and barriers differed by each participant characteristic (demographic, clinical and Reishi utilization). Factors with a significance level of P P Results Characteristics of Participants We received completed surveys from 1374 (85.9%) participants out of the 1600 cancer patients and survivors that we reached out to. Patients were recruited from 22 of the 34 total provincial level administrative regions (70.6%), with the majority of patients from the East region (51.4%). The ages of survey participants ranged from 25 to 100 years, with a mean age of 68.4 years (SD, 10.3 years). The majority were female (891, 64.8%), had less than college education (1122, 81.7%), and were unemployed or retired (1283, 93.4%). The most common types of cancer were breast (27.1%) and lung (20.1%) cancer, with a mean time since diagnosis of 8.2 years (SD, 6.3 years). Two-thirds (930, 67.7%) of participants were classified as having stage I to III cancer ( Table 1 Table 1. Characteristics of Participants and Their Impact on Expectations and Barriers.

Reishi Utilization The most common sources of knowledge of Reishi products were friends (49.78%) and family (36.83%). Other sources of learning about Reishi products were doctors/professionals (20.16%), other patients (16.81%), literature (14.41%), cancer organizations (8.59%), media (4.74%), and pharmacists (1.02%). Participants had most commonly been using Reishi for over 5 years (49.1%), followed by usage for less than 1 year (20.5%), usage for 1 to 3 years (15.9%), and usage for 3 to 5 years (14.5%). The majority (55.9%) of participants used Reishi in conjunction with other TCM herbs. Expectations and Impact Factors Among 1374 participants, the mean score of perceived expectations of Reishi for cancer care was 82.7 (SD, 13.5) out of a possible 100. The most common expectations were that Reishi would boost their immune system (98% agreement, with 45% strongly agreeing) and improve their physical health (98% agreement, with 41% strongly agreeing; Figure 1 Figure 1.

Patients’ barriers toward Reishi. Study reveals reasons for Reishi hesitancy in cancer patients. We further included these 7 potential factors for multivariable linear testing ( Table 2b P P P P Discussion This cross-sectional study is the first to explore patients’ views toward Reishi use in cancer care. Analyzing data from 1374 participants, we identified patterns of Reishi usage, common expectations (boost immune system and improve physical health), common barriers (cost and insurance coverage), and factors influencing patient views toward Reishi use (cancer stage and years since taking Reishi). These findings can help clinicians better understand potential unmet needs—such as insurance coverage, patient-provider communication, and healthcare access—in cancer care that patients are attempting to address through Reishi and possibly other herbs and dietary supplements. In our study, nearly half of patients have used Reishi for more than 5 years, and the top 2 expectations for using it are to boost their immune system and improve physical health. This study contrasts slightly with expectations toward other integrative health modalities, such as acupuncture, for which patients have expectations of benefit for more specific symptoms, like pain or fatigue, rather than global benefits related to immunity and general physical health.  17  2 11 18  19 Our study also found that patients with metastatic and advanced stages of cancer had higher expectation of benefit from Reishi. This population often experiences more cancer- and treatment-related side effects and toxicities but has limited treatment options available. Prior research has shown that higher symptom burden is associated with higher interest in using complementary or integrative health therapies, which could potentially explain these study findings.  20  21 22 24  11 In our study, high costs and lack of insurance coverage were the most common barriers to Reishi use. This is not surprising, as these economic factors are also the most reported barriers to accessing other integrative health modalities, such as acupuncture. 25 26  27 28 29 Meanwhile, surprisingly, only around 10% of patients were concerned about the side effects and research evidence of Reishi. This suggests that patients may use Reishi based on their personal beliefs. It may also be associated with the fact that the study population was relatively older and had lower education levels compared to a nationally representative cancer population.  30 31 32  33 Our study has several limitations. First, our participants were predominantly older and female. Individuals who are younger and male may have varying attitudes and barriers toward Reishi. Second, because the study was conducted in China—where TCM is more culturally and clinically integrated into cancer care—Reishi use may have been influenced by participants’ familiarity with or preference for TCM. As reflected in our findings, over half of the participants took other TCM herbs alongside Reishi. This suggests that Reishi use in this context reflects not only personal choice, but also broader cultural practices in integrative cancer care, which may differ from those in other cultural settings. Third, all participants in this survey were consumers of Reishi products, which may have led to higher expectations and fewer perceived barriers compared to individuals who do not take Reishi. Our study sample was also drawn from a company database with a pre-existing customer relationships, so participants may have been more engaged and willing to respond, as reflected by our high survey response rate relative to other Chinese public health studies. Similarly, since all participants used Reishi products from Zhongke Health International LLC, their attitudes may differ from those who choose products from other companies. The above factors may all affect the generalizability of our findings. Finally, most participants were long-term Reishi users, which may introduce selection bias, resulting in more positive attitudes toward Reishi. However, we examined the impact of duration of Reishi use on patients’ expectations and perceived barriers to account for this potential bias. Despite these limitations, our study utilized a large sample size and validated surveys to examine cancer patients’ attitudes toward Reishi, one of the most widely used herbal supplements in cancer care. The findings may help improve clinician-patient communication by addressing patients’ needs and providing proper education on herbal supplement use. Additionally, the results highlight the need for further research to align with patient expectations, particularly regarding Reishi’s potential effects on immune system support and physical health, to promote evidence-based use of herbal supplements. We are grateful to the participants for their participation and to the research staff for their support in this study.
