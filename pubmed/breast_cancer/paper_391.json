The real-world evidence on demographic characteristics, treatment patterns, and adherence data of DPNP and CIPN is still limited. Methods A multicenter, retrospective, observational study using electronic medical record (EMR) systems involving approximately 600 patients with DPNP and 400 with CIPN from nine hospitals was planned. The study period extended from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2022, which includes the enrollment period, pre-enrollment period, and observation period. Included patients will be adult (aged ≥ 18 years) diagnosed with DPNP or CIPN and receiving at least one index regimen, with index date defined as the initiation date of index regimen. At least one medical record within 12 months after index date will also be required for inclusion. The observation period is defined as the period from the index date to the end of the study data collection for at least 12 months. Planned Outcomes The primary objective is to describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns, including types and proportion of treatment regimens, treatment discontinuation/switching/add-on, restarting after discontinuation, duration of index regimen, and time to treatment add-on. The secondary and exploratory measures include the dosing pattern and real-world adherence of regimens.

The real-world evidence on demographic characteristics, treatment patterns, dosing pattern, and adherence data of neuropathic pain (NP) is still limited. As diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain (DPNP) and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) are the common types of NP, we carried out this study to explore the treatment pattern among these patients in China.  What was learnt from this study? To our knowledge, this study is the first large-sample, multicenter, retrospective study to investigate the real-world treatment patterns and outcomes in Chinese patients with DPNP and CIPN observed between January 2018 and December 2022. This study will provide profound insights into clinical unmet needs of DPNP and CIPN, especially potential treatment gaps between clinical practice and guidelines in China, by evaluating the treatment patterns. Introduction Neuropathic pain (NP) is characterized by chronic pain caused by somatosensory system disease or damage [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 10 First-line treatment for NP typically includes non-opioid medications such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and gabapentinoids are recommended by guidelines. If ineffective, second-line treatment involves tramadol or tapentadol, with third-line treatments including serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, anticonvulsants, and N d 11 13 14 15 16 The dose titration is associated with improved treatment adherence and persistence in patients with NP. A MarketScan database study reported that patients with pregabalin dose titration were 2.6 times more adherent (medication possession ratio [MPR] ≥ 0.8; odds ratio [OR] .59; p 17 18 In this multicenter, retrospective, observational study, we aim to evaluate the real-world treatment pattern of Chinese patients with DPNP and CIPN to further address the current unmet needs for clinical decision-making, optimize treatment algorithms, and ultimately enhance the quality of care. Methods Study Objectives Primary Objective The primary objective is to describe the demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns (Supplementary Tables S1 S2 Types and proportion of treatment regimens, including index regimens and post-index regimens Treatment discontinuation/switching/add-on Restarting after discontinuation Duration of index regimen Time to treatment add-on Secondary Objectives The secondary objective is to investigate the dosing patterns of the key medications in index regimen for DPNP and CIPN with the following indicators: Initial daily dose Maximum daily dose Time to the maximum daily dose Proportion of patients who underwent the daily dose modification Exploratory Objectives The exploratory objective is to investigate the real-world adherence of index regimens for DPNP and CIPN with the following indicators: Real-world time to treatment discontinuation Real-world time to treatment switching Real-world time to treatment add-on Proportion of days covered (PDC) of the targeted medication Additional exploratory objectives for DPNP or CIPN are as follows: For DPNP treatment-naïve patients with specific medications (Supplementary Table S1 Real-world effectiveness, including relief, alleviation, or no improvement in pain symptoms.

Study Design This Real-World Pharmacological Treatment Pattern of Neuropathic Pain in China: A Retrospective, Database, Multicenter Study (ReTARdant, NCT06546202 The design diagram of this study is shown in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Study design Patients will be enrolled in accordance with inclusion and exclusion criteria of DPNP and CIPN separately as shown in Table 1 Table 1 Study eligibility criteria of patients with DPNP and CIPN Patients with DPNP Patients with CIPN Inclusion criteria 1. Patients diagnosed with diabetic neuropathy and who presented with pain between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2021 1. Patients with neuropathy induced by the chemotherapy between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2021, regardless of the presence of pain symptoms (chemotherapy agents were described in Supplementary Table S3 2. Patients who received at least one targeted medication (described in Supplementary Table S1 2. Patients who received at least one targeted medication (described in Supplementary Table S2 3. Patients aged ≥ 18 years on the index date 3. Patients aged ≥ 18 years on the index date 4. Patients with at least one medical visit record within 12 months after the index date 4.

Patients with neuralgia or neuropathy caused by tumor metastasis or non-chemotherapy-induced factors (e.g., radiotherapy, myasthenia gravis syndrome, paraneoplastic syndrome, direct tumor invasion, local tissue compression, postoperative traumatic pain, immune therapy-related pain, comorbidity-induced pain) CIPN DPNP Outcome Assessment Primary Endpoints The primary endpoints of the study include the patient demographics and clinical characteristics as well as treatment patterns of the treatment regimens. The treatment patterns include the proportion of patients receiving different treatment regimens, the proportion of patients who discontinue/switch/add-on treatment and related medication categories, the proportion of patients who restarted treatment after discontinuation, the duration of the current treatment, and the time to treatment add-on. Treatment regimen: S1 S2 Treatment discontinuation: Treatment switching: Treatment add-on: Proportion of patients who restarted treatment after discontinuation Duration of index regimen: Time to treatment add-on Secondary Endpoints The secondary endpoints are to investigate the dosing patterns, including the initial/maximum daily dose, time to the maximum daily dose, and proportion of patients who underwent the daily dose modification. Initial daily dose S1 S2 Maximum daily dose Time to the maximum daily dose Proportion of patients who underwent the dose change Exploratory Endpoints The exploratory endpoints associated with the real-world adherence to the targeted medications for DPNP and CIPN are real-world time to treatment discontinuation/switch/add-on, and PDC of the target medications. Real-world time to treatment discontinuation Real-world time to treatment switching Real-world time to treatment add-on: PDC Definition of adherence: PDC < 20% is defined as no adherence; 20% ≤ PDC < 50% is defined as low adherence, 50% ≤ PDC < 80% is defined as partial adherence, and PDC ≥ 80% is defined as high adherence. The estimated number of days covered by treatment include the following: for outpatient/emergency room (ER) patients, it is calculated using the daily dose and quantity of takeaway medications prescribed to patients. For inpatient patients, it is estimated on the basis of the time interval between the start date and the end date of the prescription during the hospitalization. For those who did not have the prescription end date recorded, the discharge date will be considered as the end date, considering the quantity of takeaway medications prescribed to patients at discharge as well. Statistical Analysis Sample Size Estimation The analysis will be descriptive, and no hypothesis testing will be tested. The sample size and power estimations will focus on the precision of the estimates, which is the half-width of the 95% confidence interval (CI). As shown in Table 2 Table 2 Estimation of the sample sizes considering the precision and assumed proportion of the most common treatment regimen Proportion of the most common treatment regimen Estimated proportion (sample size) 5% precision N N N N 20% 3.9% 3.5% 3.2% 3.0% n 30% 4.5% 4.0% 3.7% 3.4% n 40% 4.8% 4.3% 3.9% 3.6% n 50% 4.9% 4.4% 4.0% 3.7% n 60% 4.8% 4.3% 3.9% 3.6% n Assuming the proportion of the most common index regimen is 50% and precision is controlled within ± 5%, a sample size of 600 patients with DPNP and 400 patients with CIPN is estimated. The final sample size will depend on the accurate number of people who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Analysis Population All patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be included in full analysis set (FAS) and will be analyzed. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Descriptive analysis will be mainly used for this study. Categorical variables will be described using absolute and relative frequencies. Continuous variables will be described using arithmetic mean (mean), standard deviation (SD), median, first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), minimum (min), and maximum (max). Meanwhile, the number of missing variables will be reported for each variable and will not be imputed unless otherwise specified. Primary and Secondary Endpoints Analysis Descriptive analysis will be conducted to summarize the treatment patterns in patients with DPNP and CIPN ( n n Exploratory Endpoint Analysis Time-to-event variables, real-world time to treatment discontinuation, real-world time to treatment switching, and real-world time to treatment add-on will be estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method with the number of patients, number of events, number of censoring, median survival time, and its 95% CI. Subgroup Analysis The subgroup analysis will be conducted in addition to the main analyses mentioned above. The preliminary plan for subgroup analysis is discussed in the sections below. The subgroup variables or the subgroup categories are subject to change based on the real-data condition. Subgroup Analyses for DPNP Subgroup variables for DPNP will include treatment-naïve patients versus previously treated patients, age groups (< 65 years vs ≥ 65 years), duration of diabetes (< 10 years vs ≥ 10 years), treatment-naïve patients treated with specific agent (pregabalin, gabapentin, duloxetine, venlafaxine, or amitriptyline) or not, and pre-VBP versus post-VBP of pregabalin with cutoff date as April 30, 2021. Subgroup Analyses for CIPN Subgroup variables for CIPN will include treatment-naïve patients versus previously treated patients, top three cancer types in patients with CIPN, and CTCAE grade at index date (grade 1, grade 2, and grade ≥ 3). Bias Inherent limitations are introduced as a result of the study design and data sources in this study. Hospital EMR data generated from clinical practice offer possible solutions to conduct the real-world study. However, the original purpose of collecting EMR data is for clinical care management rather than clinical research, leading to certain bias, such as selection bias and information bias. In this study, control for potential biases will be performed at each stage of the study. Methods to Minimize Selection Bias In terms of the selection bias, the geographic coverage will be considered during the selection of study hospitals and patients to reflect the diversity of patients, physicians, and clinical practices in the real world and to improve the representativeness of the sample to the target population. Furthermore, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for study subjects will be set before the data collection to reduce bias. In addition, considering the potential differences among the included hospitals, the study will summarize baseline demographic characteristics of patients from each study site (as an appendix to the results) to explore the potential selection bias and the impact of the study sample on the representativeness of the overall target population. Methods to Minimize Other Bias To address potential information discrepancies caused by variations in the standards, reliability, and completeness of the EMR or health information system (HIS) data across different hospitals, the study will conduct source data verification during the data collection stage to identify and correct possible errors. To control misclassification bias due to study personnel understanding or judgment errors, the study will provide specific and explicit definitions for the study groups, study endpoints, key study factors, and variables that may influence study outcomes before data collection. Meanwhile, all study personnel will be provided with standardized training. Data Collection and Management Data Source This retrospective observational study will leverage data generated from routine clinical practice in hospitals recorded in the HIS, which is widely used in Chinese hospitals as an EMR information management system, which contains all the information related to patients’ diagnosis and treatment process, including basic patient information, disease symptoms, medical history, diagnosis, disease stage, laboratory tests, imaging examination, treatment history, treatment effectiveness and safety information, follow-up, and survival. Data Collection Process Relevant data from eligible patients, including demographic information, clinical characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes, will be retrospectively collected. In line with the patient privacy protection principles, all study data will be anonymous, removing any personal identifiers that may lead to an individual patient being identified when used alone or in combination with other information. Data Management The contract research organization (CRO) delegated by the sponsor will be responsible for data collection and analysis. Upon hospital approval, relevant data will be collected from the HIS per protocol. The data management plan will be prepared, and logic checks will be applied during the data collection process to ensure data quality. Trained researchers will conduct further reviews of extracted data from each hospital to ensure consistency with the study standard. Discussion The chronic nature and diverse treatment responses of NP, particularly DPNP and CIPN, present a significant challenge in clinical management. Understanding patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns is crucial for optimizing management strategies and improving patient outcomes. However, comprehensive studies addressing these aspects, specifically in the Chinese population, are limited, necessitating the need for the current study. The ReTARdant study is the first large, retrospective study leveraging EMR data with a national representative population of Chinese patients with DPNP and CIPN. Existing literature predominantly reports findings from the Western population, which may not capture the unique characteristics and responses to the treatment in Chinese patients with DPNP and CIPN (Table 3 n 19 n 20 n 15 n 14 21 22 23 Table 3 ReTARdant study design compared with similar database studies ReTARdant study PDN-Scope study [ 14 Kim et al.

The risk factors and the clinical impact associated with DPNP were also studied using various pain scale measures. Of the patients with DPNP, 69.5% of patients taking medication for current pain had lower pain scores than those not taking medications [ 19 20 15 14 21 23 22 Currently, the most common clinical drug therapy for NP involves ion channel drugs, for which the response rate is only about 46.3% [ 24 25 14 20 26 Our study will analyze dosing patterns of the targeted medications for DPNP and CIPN including daily dose and maximum daily dose, time to achieve the daily dose, and dose adjustments frequency. It will also evaluate the proportion of patients with changes in daily dose. In a head-to-head comparison of dosing patterns of duloxetine and pregabalin, the mean initial daily dose was 54.3 mg for duloxetine and 171.8 mg for pregabalin. Moreover, individuals initiating pregabalin generally began treatment with a low dose, but a significant number either increased their daily doses up to 264 mg over time or opted to discontinue the medication [ 27 Adherence to prescribed medications is a crucial factor influencing treatment success in NP management. Despite the effectiveness of pain medicines, approximately 40% of the prescription medicines are not taken as prescribed [ 28 29 30 Strength and Limitations To our knowledge, this is the first large-sample, multicenter, retrospective study to investigate the real-world treatment patterns and outcomes in Chinese patients with DPNP and CIPN observed between January 2018 and December 2022. Therefore, this study is expected to reflect current real-world treatment patterns and outcomes. We expect that this study will provide profound insights into clinical unmet needs of DPNP and CIPN, especially potential treatment gaps between clinical practice and guidelines in China, by evaluating the treatment patterns. The present study does have certain limitations. Firstly, as a retrospective observational study, these analyses results will descriptively analyze rather than explore causation, and hence all conclusions should be cautiously interpreted. Secondly, data availability is limited because of accessible information recorded in hospital EMR and the absence of long-term follow-up and therefore may introduce selection bias and missing data. However, this method is optimal and practicable to address the target research questions, especially with the large sample size and geographic representative data. Moreover, variations in clinical practice and medical record-keeping across different hospital types and among physicians in China could increase data heterogeneity and reflect real-world practice, especially for DPNP and CIPN diagnosis. Conclusion This study will address a critical need for detailed characterization of DPNP and CIPN, patient profiles, treatment patterns, medication dosing, and adherence in China. By elucidating these factors, we aim to contribute substantial evidence to the field in ultimately guiding clinicians in making informed decisions tailored to the needs of Chinese patients with NP.
