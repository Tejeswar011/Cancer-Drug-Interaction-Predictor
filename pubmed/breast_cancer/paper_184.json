In humans, GBPs are well‐characterized interferon‐induced GTPases, playing a central role in cell‐autonomous innate immunity against infections, inflammation and cancer. GBPs orthologs have been identified in plants only recently. Despite the limited number of reports describing their functional characterization, plant GBPs share common structural and biological features, as well as functions, with animal GBPs. This review aimed at highlighting the recent knowledge acquired on the critical role of GBPs and the associated mechanisms in plant developmental processes and in plant immunity to biotic aggressions through the control of gene expression. biomolecular condensates Dynamin Superfamily Protein guanylate‐binding protein innate immunity large GTPase plant development stress Agence Nationale de la Recherche 10.13039/501100001665 ANR‐24‐CE20‐5404 Université de Bordeaux 10.13039/501100006251 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date November 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:02.10.2025 Introduction Guanylate‐binding proteins (GBPs) are large GTPases (LGs) that belong to the Dynamin Superfamily Proteins (DSPs; Ramachandran & Schmid, 2018 2019 2019 et al 2006 Among DSPs, the innate immune response to pathogens is another well‐characterized function, mostly assigned to GBPs. GBPs are interferon‐induced GTPases, whose founding member HsGBP1 was identified in human fibroblasts following interferon treatment (Cheng et al 1983 GBPs orthologs were identified in plants only recently. The first article reporting the functional characterization of a plant GBP in tomato was published in 2020 (Musseau et al 2020 Arabidopsis et al 2019 Structure, conformation and subcellular localization of GBPs Protein structure and conformation The human HsGBP1 has been extensively structurally and biochemically characterized, and serves as the structural model of reference for animal GBPs (Prakash et al 2000 c 1a 1b et al 2000 2 et al 2006 et al 2006 et al 2021 et al 2024 et al 2020 et al 2024 et al 2024 et al 2010 et al 2017 Fig. 1 Domain structure of human HsGBP1, Arabidopsis thaliana (At) Solanum lycopersicum Sl https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/protein/UniProt/ https://nls‐mapper.iab.keio.ac.jp/cgi‐bin/NLS_Mapper_form.cgi last Arabidopsis 2019 P32455 Q96PP8 Fig. 2 Three dimensional model prediction of the structure of (a) human HsGBP1, (b) Arabidopsis thaliana Solanum lycopersicum Arabidopsis https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/ 1 Plant GBPs display the conserved LG and GED domains (Figs 1 2 et al 2023 et al 2021 et al 2023 1a Arabidopsis thaliana Solanum lycopersicum 2016 2016 c c 2019 et al 2025 Reimann et al 2023 c c 1b et al 2021 et al 2021 et al 2023 Whether the biochemical and enzymatic attributes found in animal GBPs also contribute to plant GBP conformation and dimerization remains largely uncharacterized. However, AtGBPL3 is able to dimerize via the nucleotide‐dependent self‐association of the LG domain, required for GTPase activity, and via the self‐association of the GED domain (Reimann et al 2023 in planta et al 2021 et al 2025 Subcellular localization of GBPs HsGBPs differ in their cellular localization according to the presence of a CaaX isoprenylation motif at the C‐terminal end serving for membrane anchoring (Fig. 1a et al 2010 et al 2021 et al 2007 et al 2010 The binding of HsGBPs to membranes not only requires the presence of an isoprenyl moiety, but most importantly its accessibility. Indeed, under the closed monomeric conformation, the isoprenyl tail of HsGBP1 is positioned in a hydrophobic pocket of the GED domain, thus preventing its interaction with membranes (Sistemich et al 2021 et al 2017 et al 2021 et al 2020 et al 2024 et al 2024 et al 2014 et al 2016 Plant GBPs lack the C‐terminal CaaX motif found in HsGBP1/2/5. However, Arabidopsis 1a et al 2023 et al 2025 et al 2025 Arabidopsis 1a et al 2021 3a et al 2022 et al 2023 et al 2023 Fig. 3 Subnuclear localization and multifunctional roles of plant guanylate‐binding proteins (GBPs) of the AtGBPL1/3 clade. (a) The ability of plant GBPs to drive liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) according to their nuclear concentration redefines their subnuclear localization. At endogenous levels, GBPs are in dispersed form, mainly localized at the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope (NE). At high protein concentration, upon overexpression, stress or likely endoreduplication, GBPs form condensates of different sizes either localized at the NE (intermediate phase) or in the nucleoplasm (separated phase). (b) The subnuclear localization of GBPs is associated with diverse biological functions in plants. During development, GBPs are localized at the NE. There, GBPs participate in nuclear morphogenesis during interphase, within a complex encompassing CRWN1&4 and KAKU4, at the nuclear pore complex of the NE. The AtGBPL3/CRWN1&4/KAKU4 complex interacts with chromatin, where it recruits chromatin remodelers and participates in the regulation of gene expression and mRNA processing. GBPs are involved in the reformation of the NE during mitosis, as a result of the AtGBPL3/CRWN1&4/KAKU4 complex disassembly and the massive accumulation of AtGBPL3 into speckles at sites of active NE reformation. GBPs play a crucial role in tissue differentiation and cell fate during fruit growth by maintaining endopolyploid cells in a nonproliferative state that affects the cytoskeleton network and/or controls the expression of endoreduplication‐associated and mitosis‐associated genes, respectively, positively and negatively. During innate immunity and in response to stress, GBPs form LLPS‐driven condensates, which localize within the nucleoplasm. Within condensates, GBPs bind directly to promoters of defense‐related genes and recruit transcriptional coactivators of the Mediator complex and RNA polymerase II machinery to ensure the transcriptional reprogramming induced by immune activation. During gametophyte development and pollen grain formation, GBPs localize to the entire nucleoplasm, but the mechanisms and GBP interacting protein network are still undeciphered. Arrows and blunt‐ended arrows represent positive and negative regulation, respectively. GBPs are represented in green; NE, nuclear envelope; OM, outer membrane; IM, inner membrane; EndoR, endoreduplication; OE, overexpression; NPC, nuclear pore complex; TF, transcription factors; PolII, RNA polymerase II. Notably, the distribution of AtGBPL3 in pollen grains and pollen tubes is very singular, as it is absent from NE but accumulates homogeneously in the nucleoplasm (Reimann et al 2023 A remarkable feature of plant GBPs is their ability to form biomolecular condensates, which assemble in dynamic membrane‐less organelles through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) within the nucleus (Huang et al 2021 2022 et al 2023 Arabidopsis et al 2021 et al 2022 et al 2023 3a et al 2021 Plant GBPs belonging to the AtGBPL2 and AtGBPL1/3 clades are either cytosolic or nuclear, respectively. Moreover, different subnuclear localizations have been evidenced for the AtGBPL1/3 clade that seem to influence their diverse biological functions in plants (Fig. 3b Multifunctional roles of GBP in plants According to their pivotal role in cell‐autonomous innate immunity, in response to cancer, inflammation and infection (for reviews see Ngo & Man, 2017 et al 2020 et al 2023 et al 2019 et al 2019 3b Plant GBP and nuclear morphogenesis and activity The NE localization of AtGBPL3 at endogeneous level is due to its interaction with the plant lamins CRWN1, CRWN4 and KAKU4 and the nucleoporin NUP136 of the nuclear pore basket (NB; Reimann et al 2023 et al 2022 3b et al 2022 et al 2023 et al 2024 et al 2019 AtGBPL3 is not only involved in nuclear architecture, but it also plays a major part in chromatin modification and organization, transcription initiation and regulation, and RNA splicing and processing (Tang et al 2022 et al 2010 1a et al 2023 et al 2022 et al 2023 et al 2021 et al 2022 3b et al 2023 In the next section, additional roles of nuclear GBPs during plant development will be described in relation to their subnuclear localizations. GBPs and the control of cell division during plant development AtGBPL3 is highly expressed in the root apical meristem (RAM), where it is required for proper mitosis and is thus essential for root growth (Reimann et al 2023 et al 2023 3b et al 2023 et al 2023 et al 2022 et al 2022 et al 2023 In tomato, SlGBP1 controls fruit growth (Musseau et al 2020 et al 2021 et al 2023 et al 2020 3b et al 2014 et al 2017 2021 et al 2018 et al 2018 et al 2020 Although poorly investigated, another role of plant GBPs seems to emerge during pollen development. While Arabidopsis et al 2021 et al 2022 et al 2023 et al 2023 et al 2023 3b Plant GBPs thus display multifaceted roles during cell division either as a positive actor, likely establishing a structural basis for molecule tethering, or as a negative regulator via gene expression control, both required for proper tissue patterning. In the following section, we will address how GBPs turn out to be major players in biotic and abiotic stress responses. GBPs in plant immunity and response to stress Originally, AtGBPL1 and AtGBPL3 were identified from a proteomic analysis aimed at isolating IDR‐containing proteins that could form LLPS‐driven condensates within the nucleus in response to biotic stress (Huang et al 2021 atgbpl3 et al 2021 atgbpl1 atgbpl3 et al 2021 et al 2021 3a 3b ICS1 et al 2021 ICS1 et al 2022 The formation of nuclear GDACs is reduced at elevated growth temperature, which suppresses the recruitment of AtGBPL3 to the CBP60g SARD1 et al 2022 2021 et al 2017 et al 2022 et al 2021 3a A role in immunity was recently evidenced for plant cytosolic GBP of the AtGBPL2 clade (Pan et al 2025 CONSTITUTIVE EXPRESSION OF PR GENES 5 CPR5 et al 2014 et al 2025 1a cpr5 cpr5 et al 2025 Although the function of the wild‐type AtGBPL2 in immunity is still undeciphered, these findings stress how important the subcellular compartimentalization of plant GBPs is in regulating the plant immune response. Indeed, NES‐containing GBPs from the AtGBPL2 clade are prone to being exported from the nucleus despite the presence of an NLS motif. In the absence of a functional NES, these GBPs are susceptible to intervening in biological processes close to that assigned to GBPs from the AtGBPL1/3 clade, that is Conclusions and future directions Despite evolutionary acquired differences in protein structure and conformation, as well as in subcellular localization, animal and plant GBPs do conserve functional similarities resulting from adaptations within the two phyla. The GTPase activity, the dimerization and formation of highly polymeric structures, the interaction with multiple protein partners and formation of multivalent protein complexes are among the conserved biochemical properties. These properties provide GBPs multifunctional roles in response to developmental and stress stimuli, and in cell‐autonomous innate immunity. GBPs participate in the regulation of cell division with pro‐ and antiproliferative activity, in cell differentiation and organismal development, leading to diseases in animals and altered tissue patterning in plants if impeded. Plant GBPs are able to mediate membrane‐ and/or cytoskeleton remodeling, an activity typical of DSP LGs. However, the ability of AtGBPL3 to interact with chromatin, where it recruits chromatin remodelers, and participates in the regulation of gene expression and mRNA processing, represents the greatest difference between plant and animal GBPs reported so far. In plant immune response, GBP condensates represent a cellular centralized organization aimed at regulating gene expression to protect against phytopathogen infection. This function in plant immunity involves the regulation of SA signaling, a major hormone in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stress, and in plant physiology and development (Rivas‐San Vicente & Plasencia, 2011 2024 So far, the understanding of the biological functions of plant GBPs is only at its dawn. New roles and mechanisms will arise from further investigations addressing, for instance, pollen grain formation or the still poorly characterized GBPs from the AtGBPL2 clade.
