The process generally involves heating the\ncomponents together in a solvent or melt, leading to the formation\nof intermediates, which ultimately cyclize, producing the oxazine\nring. Understanding the chemical structures and compositions of the\ncrude products helps to comprehend the reaction pathway involved in\nthe formation of benzoxazines. Kinetic and mechanistic studies have\nbeen conducted in order to examine the production of the oxazine rings\nduring the synthesis of benzoxazines using phenol, primary amine,\nand formaldehyde as starting materials.     In this work, we carried out a systematic\nstudy focused on identifying\nthe key crude products to enhance the efficiency of the synthesis\nof more conventional benzoxazines at room temperature. To achieve\nthis goal, it was necessary to demonstrate first the feasibility of\nsynthesizing a more conventional benzoxazine, based on bisphenol A,\nhexylamine, and formaldehyde ( BA-hex 2 Experimental Section 2.1 Materials Bisphenol A (97%), hexylamine\n(99%), paraformaldehyde, (95%), all three HPLC grade solvents chloroform,\nethanol, and toluene, magnesium sulfate anhydrous (97%), and sodium\nhydroxide (97%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

The mixture was stirred under refluxing conditions\nfor 96 h. Samples (0.15 mL) were taken from the reaction system at\ndifferent times to monitor the progress of the reaction by means of\nNMR spectroscopy. Results are analyzed by NMR spectroscopy and discussed\nin Section 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Establishing New Synthetic Routes for Synthesizing\nBenzoxazine Monomers at Low Temperatures The present work\nhas the objective of developing synthetic routes that consume less\nenergy than the conventional strategies reported to date. To carry\nout this work, BA-hex BA-hex Scheme 1 Synthesis of the BA-hex This reaction, as most classical benzoxazine\nmonomers have been\nreported, can be possibly carried out in different conditions, such\nas in toluene,  3 3 BA-hex The first\nreaction carried out in this study to synthesize BA-hex 3 1 3,  As previously mentioned, the use of CHCl 3  BA-hex BA-hex A\ntypical 1 3 Figure 1 BA-hex 1 (a) Numbering\nutilized in this work to identify each position on\nthe chemical structure of BA-hex 1 BA-hex 3 3 It has long been assumed that the two small signals,\nwhich are\nrecognized as impurities of the reaction observed in the regions between\n7.12 and 7.05 ppm as well as 6.74 and 6.68 ppm, belong to BA. This\nis the main reason for carrying out the basic extractions, since deprotonation\nof the phenolic −OH groups would enhance water solubility,\nfacilitating the extraction of BA from the organic phase. As seen\nin Figure Simultaneously with what was observed in the aromatic region, it\nwas also detected that in the region from 4.00 and 3.90 ppm, there\nwas another highly overlapped signal in addition to the one belonging\nto BA-hex 4 H 2 N Figure The manner in which the mentioned signals, those at 7.08, 6.71,\nand 3.93 ppm, were present at each step during the course of the reaction\nmade us understand that they were related, in addition to being related\nto other overlapped signals. Importantly, not knowing the chemical\nstructure of the impurity made it impossible to calculate the percent\ncomposition of the mixture by 1 3.2 Identification of the Reaction Intermediates Knowing that the formation of the oxazine ring is not a concerted\nchemical reaction and that the two phenolic −OH of BA might\nnot necessarily react simultaneously, there may be a number of intermediates\nparticipating in the formation of BA-hex 1 Figure 1 BA-hex 2  1 BA-hex 3 The 1 BA-hex Figure 3 Figure S1 Figure  THT Experimental Section THT 1  13 Figure Figure Figure 1 Figure THT 7 13 THT Figure 7 6 1 1 THT Figure 7 7 1 13 THT Figure –1 THT 1 THT d THT Supporting Information, Figure S2 THT Supporting Information, Figure S3 3 (a) Chemical\nstructure of THT 1 13 THT 1 1 THT 7 6 1 13 THT 7 7 3 THT As shown in Figure Figure 2 H 2 N Figure Figure S4 BA-hex Figure Further\ndetailed analysis of all 1 BA-hex BA-hex Figure Figure Figure Figure ) para mono-BZX-BA Scheme 4 Expanded region of the 1 3 2 Proposed Reaction Pathway for the Synthesis of BA-hex 3.3 General Reaction Pathway for the Synthesis\nof BA-hex Based on the results presented in\nthis work, a reaction pathway leading to the formation of BA-hex Scheme Despite\nbeing a one-batch reaction system among three components, hexylamine\n(hex), formaldehyde, and bisphenol A (BA), different reactions occur\nat different times. The first two compounds to react are hex and formaldehyde,\nefficiently forming the first intermediate ( HM   1 THT  THT 1 Figure THT  SB Scheme SB 1 ortho para oAP-BA Scheme 1 mono-BZX-BA oAP-BA 1 mono-BZX-BA Experimental Section SB BA-hex oAP-BA SB ortho oAP-BA-oAP Scheme 1 Figure S5 SB oAP-BA oAP-BA-oAP BA-hex 2 H 2 N 4 H 2 N BA-hex mono-BZX-BA H 2 2 ortho 1 Figure S6 .
