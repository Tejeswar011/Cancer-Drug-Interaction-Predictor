While anthracycline‐based regimens have proven effective in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)‐positive breast cancer, their efficacy may be reduced in HER2‐negative patients due to the lack of co‐amplification of DNA topoisomerase IIα, the primary target of anthracyclines. This study compared the efficacy and safety of the regimen of docetaxel, anthracycline, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) versus a novel regimen consisting of docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, and capecitabine (TCX), hypothesizing that replacement of anthracycline with capecitabine could offer superior outcomes in this patient population. Methods In this open‐label, randomized controlled trial, 204 patients with pT1‐3, node‐positive or high‐risk node‐negative, HER2‐negative early‐stage breast cancer were enrolled between May 2011 and December 2013 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01354522 n n Results With a median follow‐up of 124.4 (range, 19.5‐147.8) months, TCX did not significantly improve the 10‐year DFS rate over TAC (71.5% ± 5.6% vs. 67.6% ± 4.0%, P P = P = P = P Conclusion TCX may provide superior long‐term survival and a more favorable safety profile compared to TAC for patients with high‐risk HER2‐negative breast cancer, warranting further investigation in larger cohorts. adjuvant chemotherapy capecitabine disease‐free survival her2‐negative breast cancer overall survival National High Level Hospital Clinical Research Funding 2022‐PUMCH‐B‐038 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date September 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:29.09.2025  Song Y Wang Y Cao X Xu Y Zhou Y Sun Q Adjuvant capecitabine in combination with docetaxel and cyclophosphamide versus anthracycline plus docetaxel and cyclophosphamide regimen in women with high‐risk, HER2‐negative breast cancer: An open‐label, randomized controlled trial Cancer Commun 2025 45 1113 1122 10.1002/cac2.70041 PMC12479128 40491042 Abbreviations AE adverse event CI confidence intervals DDFS distant disease‐free survival DFS disease‐free survival DSS disease‐specific survival G‐CSF granulocyte colony‐stimulating factor ER estrogen receptor HER2 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 HRs hazard ratios OS overall survival PR progesterone receptor PUMCH Peking Union Medical College Hospital TAC docetaxel, anthracycline, and cyclophosphamide TCX docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, and capecitabine TNBC triple‐negative breast cancer TNM tumor, node, and metastasis staging 1 Background Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignant neoplasm globally and remains the leading cause of cancer‐related mortality in women [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Capecitabine, an oral prodrug of 5‐fluorouracil, undergoes tumor‐selective activation by thymidine phosphorylase, which is highly expressed in tumor tissues [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 2 Patients and Methods 2.1 Patients Eligible participants included female patients aged 18 to 70 years. The tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging of the patients was performed according to the system defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (the 7 th 2.2 Study design This open‐label, randomized, and controlled prospective trial was conducted by the Department of Breast Surgery in Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), Beijing, China. Based on the confirmed pathological and baseline characteristics, patients were evaluated and randomized into two cohorts of either TAC or TCX adjuvant chemotherapy regimen in a 2:1 ratio, which was chosen primarily for ethical reasons. Since TAC represented the established standard‐of‐care with proven efficacy, while TCX was an investigational regimen with uncertain benefit at the time of trial initiation, a higher proportion of patients were assigned to the TAC arm to ensure that most participants received guideline‐recommended treatment. Enrollment and randomization must have been finished within 30 days after the final surgery. Randomization was performed using a computer‐generated sequence, and allocation was concealed through a centralized web‐based system to minimize selection bias. Stratification was applied according to tumor size and lymph node status to ensure balanced distribution across both treatment groups. Patients in the TAC group received an intravenous regimen of docetaxel (75 mg/m 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 21 th The primary endpoints of this study were DFS and OS. DFS was defined as the time from the date of surgery to locoregional or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy, or death, whichever occurred first. OS was defined as the time from the date of surgery to the date of death from any cause. Secondary endpoints included distant disease‐free survival (DDFS), disease‐specific survival (DSS), and adverse events (AEs). DDFS was defined as the time from surgery to distant recurrence of breast cancer, excluding local recurrence, regional recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, and secondary non‐breast primary tumors. DSS was defined as the time from surgery to death caused by breast cancer. AEs were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 [ 22 This trial was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier NCT01354522 2.3 Statistical analysis The sample size calculation was based on pre‐trial estimates, assuming a 10‐year DFS rate of 75% for the TCX group and a 10‐year DFS rate of 65% for the TAC group. To achieve a target power of 80% and a two‐sided significance level of 0.05, the total required sample size was calculated to be 582 participants, with 194 allocated to the TCX group and 388 to the TAC group. However, due to slower‐than‐anticipated enrollment, the study was concluded after enrolling 204 participants. Qualitative variables were compared using a Chi‐squared test. All comparisons were performed using Fisher's exact test. The Kaplan‐Meier method was used to estimate DFS, DDFS, OS, and DSS. The survival curves were compared using the log‐rank test with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Cox proportional‐hazards models, with stratification factors considered, were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. The α level of 0.05 was used to include variables into the multivariate Cox model. Statistical analyses were performed using R software R‐3.5.2 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria). All tests were two‐tailed, and a P 3 Results 3.1 Patients Between May 2011 and December 2013, a total of 246 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 204 patients were randomized and included in the intention‐to‐treat analysis at PUMCH. No patients were lost to follow‐up. All patients underwent radical surgery and were randomized to adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, with 136 patients assigned to the TAC group and 68 patients to the TCX group (Figure 1 P 1 FIGURE 1 CONSORT flow diagram showing patient enrollment, randomization, treatment allocation, and follow‐up for the TAC ( n n TABLE 1 The baseline clinicopathological characteristics of patients with HER2‐negative breast cancer in the TAC and TCX groups.

No patients withdrew from the study or declined protocol therapy (Figure 1 4 Discussion This study aimed to assess the long‐term efficacy and safety of substituting anthracycline with capecitabine in the standard TAC regimen for HER2‐negative breast cancer patients. Over a 10‐year follow‐up, the TCX group demonstrated significant improvements in both OS and DSS compared to the TAC group, with a more favorable toxicity profile. Although the difference in DFS between the two groups did not reach statistical significance, TCX exhibited a borderline significant advantage in DDFS, highlighting its potential for reducing distant recurrences. As treatment strategies for HER2‐negative breast cancer evolve, balancing efficacy with manageable toxicity becomes increasingly critical. Capecitabine, an oral prodrug of 5‐fluorouracil, exemplifies this balance through its tumor‐selective activation by thymidine phosphorylase, an enzyme that is highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues [ 17 23 24 15 16 17 25 The TCX regimen significantly improved OS and DSS compared to TAC, though no significant difference was observed in DFS. Among DFS events, the TAC group had 48 events, including 1 case of contralateral breast cancer and 7 cases of secondary non‐breast primary tumors, while the TCX group had 20 events, including 3 cases of contralateral breast cancer and 5 cases of secondary non‐breast primary tumors (Table 2 13 14 The adverse effects of chemotherapy can significantly disrupt treatment continuity and diminish treatment adherence in breast cancer patients. In particular, the toxicities associated with anthracycline‐based regimens have garnered increasing attention in recent clinical research, due to their pronounced impact on both hematologic and cardiac function [ 4 5 26 27 28 29 P 3 30 31 32 The lengthy follow‐up period is a notable strength of our study, as it allows for a comprehensive evaluation of long‐term outcomes and provides valuable insight into late‐onset events. It is important to acknowledge certain limitations of the study. While the sample size was relatively small, it may have been inadequate to detect significant differences in DFS. Additionally, the open‐label design could introduce bias, particularly in reporting AEs. Furthermore, the absence of patient‐reported outcomes and quality‐of‐life assessments limits the study's ability to fully capture the impact of the two regimens on patient well‐being. Future studies should focus on expanding sample sizes to confirm TCX's efficacy in specific patient subgroups and explore quality‐of‐life outcomes, particularly for those experiencing severe AEs. Furthermore, given the observed benefit of TCX in subgroups with aggressive tumor features, such as pT2, histological grade 2, TNM stage III, PR negativity, and those with a Ki67 index ≥ 14, future biomarker studies are warranted to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from TCX. Biomarkers such as thymidine phosphorylase expression, which is crucial for capecitabine's efficacy, could help guide personalized treatment strategies and optimize the use of TCX in clinical practice. 5 Conclusions This study demonstrated that the TCX regimen, replacing anthracycline with capecitabine, provides a more favorable safety profile and superior survival outcomes compared to TAC in patients with high‐risk HER2‐negative breast cancer. While the DFS benefit did not reach statistical significance, TCX significantly improved OS and DSS, with fewer grade 3‐4 AEs. Although hand‐foot syndrome was more frequent in the TCX group, it did not lead to treatment discontinuation. These findings support TCX being considered as a promising alternative to anthracycline‐based regimens, with improved outcomes and reduced toxicity. Further investigations were warranted to validate these findings and assess their applicability across other subgroups.
