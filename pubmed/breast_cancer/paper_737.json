This study identifies key determinants and develops a predictive model using advanced machine learning technique. Methods A total of 13,136 children aged 6–59 months from the 2018 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) were analysed. Sixteen machine learning algorithms were evaluated on the basis of their ability to predict childhood anaemia using a wide range of individual, community and environmental factors. The Extra Trees (ET) classifier, demonstrating the highest predictive performance, was used to identify the top 10 predictors of childhood anaemia. A fairness and demographic bias assessment framework was incorporated to evaluate the model's performance across different regions, wealth index categories, ethnic groups and gender. Results The ET classifier achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8319, an accuracy of 0.7565 and a recall of 0.7565. The top 10 predictors identified by the model included the number of under‐five children in the household, birth order, child age, media access, maternal health‐seeking behaviour, child gender, proximity to water, money problems, day land surface temperature and all population count. The demographic bias assessment revealed variations in model performance across different subgroups, with the lowest AUCs observed in the north‐east region (0.79), the poorest wealth index category (0.80) and the Hausa/Fulani ethnic group (0.81). Conclusion This study shows that machine learning can accurately predict childhood anaemia in Nigeria and identify key risk factors, supporting targeted interventions. Future work should focus on refining models and integrating AI‐based interventions to reduce anaemia. Childhood anaemia affects about 60% of Nigerian children aged 6–59 months. Using nationally representative data, we applied 16 machine learning models to identify key predictors.

Uthman Predicting Childhood Anaemia in Nigeria: A Machine Learning Approach to Uncover Key Risk Factors Public Health Challenges 4 4 2025 e70135 10.1002/puh2.70135  Funding: 1 Introduction Childhood anaemia remains one of the most pressing global health challenges, affecting approximately 269.7 million children under 5 years worldwide, with the highest burden concentrated in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs) [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 The adverse effects of childhood anaemia extend far beyond immediate health concerns, creating cascading impacts on child development, educational outcomes and long‐term economic productivity. Physiologically, anaemia impairs oxygen transport capacity, leading to reduced cellular metabolism and compromised organ function [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 The immunological consequences of anaemia are equally concerning, as iron deficiency compromises immune system function, increasing susceptibility to infectious diseases and prolonging recovery periods [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Traditional approaches to anaemia prediction and risk assessment have relied primarily on conventional statistical methods, including logistic regression (LR) and survival analysis, which often fail to capture complex, non‐linear relationships among multiple risk factors [ 23 24 25 26 27 k k 27 Building on this foundation, subsequent research has expanded both methodologically and geographically. Tesfaye et al. [ 28 28 29 Despite these methodological advances, several critical gaps remain in the literature. First, most existing studies have been limited to specific geographic contexts, primarily South Asian and East African settings, with limited representation from West African populations where anaemia burden is highest [ 29 30 30 31 26 32 To address these gaps, this study aims to develop and validate a comprehensive ML framework for predicting childhood anaemia in Nigeria using data from the 2018 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS). Our specific objectives are to: (i) systematically evaluate 16 ML algorithms to identify the optimal predictive model for childhood anaemia; (ii) incorporate comprehensive individual, household, community and environmental predictors to develop a holistic prediction framework; (iii) implement rigorous fairness and demographic bias assessment to ensure equitable model performance across different population subgroups; and (iv) identify key risk factors that can inform targeted intervention strategies. Given the complex interplay of socio‐economic, environmental, maternal and child‐related factors influencing childhood anaemia in Nigeria, and the demonstrated superiority of ML approaches in handling multidimensional health data, this study was designed to test specific hypotheses regarding the predictive capacity of these factors. We hypothesized that a combination of individual‐level factors such as child age, gender and birth order; household‐level factors, including wealth index, media access and number of under‐five children; maternal‐level factors such as education and health‐seeking behaviour; and environmental factors, including land surface temperature and proximity to water, can accurately predict childhood anaemia in Nigerian children aged 6–59 months using ML algorithms. Additionally, we hypothesized that advanced ensemble ML algorithms would demonstrate superior predictive performance compared to traditional LR models for childhood anaemia prediction. To address these hypotheses, this study sought to answer three key research questions. First, which ML algorithm provides the highest predictive accuracy for childhood anaemia among Nigerian children? Second, what are the most important risk factors for childhood anaemia when analysed through ML approaches? Third, does model performance vary across different demographic subgroups, including regions, wealth categories, ethnic groups and gender? By addressing these questions, this research aims to bridge existing knowledge gaps and provide evidence‐based insights for developing targeted interventions to reduce the burden of childhood anaemia in Nigeria. 2 Method 2.1 Study Setting Nigeria, spanning about 923,768 square kilometres, is Africa's most populous country [ 5 33 5 Nigeria has three distinct tropical climate zones: monsoon climate in the south, savannah in the central regions and hot, semi‐arid climate in the north. Rainfall varies greatly: around 2000 mm falls annually in the south and 500 mm in the north [ 34 34 2.2 Study Design and Sampling Technique This is a population‐based cross‐sectional study using data from the 2018 NDHS [ 5 5 The 2018 NDHS used a stratified two‐stage sampling method. First, Nigeria's 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory were divided into urban and rural areas, creating 74 sampling strata. From each stratum, 1400 EAs were selected on the basis of the size. In the second stage, 30 households were systematically selected from each EA, resulting in 41,668 households. 2.3 Data Collection The NDHS gathered data through in‐person interviews, achieving a 99% response rate, using structured questionnaires covering topics on biodata, demographics, socio‐economic and biomarkers [ 5 This study utilized data from the children's record (KR) file of the 2018 NDHS, with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria established to ensure data quality and relevance to the research objectives. Children were included in the analysis if they were aged 6–59 months at the time of survey, had undergone haemoglobin (Hb) testing during the survey with complete Hb measurements recorded, and whose mothers provided complete demographic and socio‐economic information from households that completed the full NDHS questionnaire. Conversely, children were excluded if they were under 6 months of age, as WHO anaemia thresholds are not applicable to this age group, or if they were aged 60 months and above. Additionally, children with missing or invalid Hb measurements, incomplete outcome data, or from households with incomplete survey responses for key variables were excluded from the analysis. 2.4 Data Preprocessing and Quality Control All data preprocessing and ML analyses were conducted using PyCaret, an open‐source, low‐code ML library in Python that automates many aspects of the ML workflow. The preprocessing pipeline included several critical steps to ensure data quality and model performance. Missing data handling was implemented through PyCaret's automated imputation strategies. For continuous variables, missing values were imputed using mean imputation, whereas categorical variables utilized mode imputation. Categorical variables were encoded using one‐hot encoding to convert them into numerical format suitable for ML algorithms. This process created binary dummy variables for each category while avoiding the dummy variable trap. Continuous variables were standardized using z The dataset was randomly split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets using stratified sampling to maintain the proportion of anaemic and non‐anaemic cases in both subsets. Feature scaling and transformation were applied only to the training set to prevent data leakage, with the same transformations subsequently applied to the test set. 2.5 Recruitment of Eligible Participants This study analysed data on children aged 6–59 months from the 2018 NDHS. Of the approximately 14,000 eligible children who underwent anaemia testing across 42,000 surveyed households, only those with complete Hb data were included. After excluding 864 children with missing Hb measurements, a total of 13,136 children were retained for analysis. 2.6 Study Variables 2.6.1 Outcome Variable According to the WHO, children aged 6–59 months are considered anaemic if their Hb level is below 11.0 g/dL [ 35 2.6.2 Explanatory Variables Literature review informed the choice of variables for analysis, confirming direct links between individual factors and anaemia [ 36 37 38 39 2.6.2.1 Individual‐Level Factors Variables included (i) child‐specific factors like age, gender, birth order and diet quality; (ii) mother‐specific factors like age, education, ethnicity, religion, health insurance, decision‐making power and head of household status; and (iii) household‐specific factors like livestock ownership, wealth, access to media, water and sanitation. 2.6.2.2 Community‐Related Factors These are place of residence (rural or urban area), geopolitical region, ethnic diversity, community poverty, illiteracy and unemployment rates. 2.6.2.3 Environment‐Related Factors These are average rainfall, diurnal temperature range, proximity to water and drought episodes. Because the variables are continuous, mean values served as the reference for the analysis. 2.7 Ethical Consideration This study uses publicly available secondary datasets from the DHS Programme, Nigeria. No additional ethical approval is needed. However, permission to use the data for research purposes was requested and granted before the commencement of this study. The DHS follows strict ethical standards to protect respondents’ privacy and confidentiality. The survey has been approved by the Ethics Committee of ICF Macro, USA, which is involved in its management, and the National Ethics Committee in the Ministry of Health in Nigeria. All participants gave informed consent before participating, ensuring that the data are ethically sourced and respect their rights by protecting the privacy of the DHS survey respondents. 2.8 Statistical Analysis 2.8.1 Modelling Approaches/Multiple ML Approaches The 16 ML algorithms employed in this study were categorized into two distinct types based on their underlying learning mechanisms (Box 1 BOX 1 Explaining the machine learning (ML) algorithms  Type of algorithms List of the ML algorithms and justification for use Ensembling machine learning algorithms  Random forest classifier (RF), AdaBoost classifier (ADA), Gradient Boosting classifier (GBC), Extra Trees classifier (ET), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and CatBoost classifier (CatBoost), belong to ensemble learning, which can be used to solve classification and regression, and when combined can result in strong learners with high prediction accuracy [ 40 Ensemble learning consists of many base learners. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches in which only one learner is trained with a single learning algorithm, ensemble learning consists of many base learners [ 41 42 Non‐ensembling machine learning algorithms  Non‐Ensembling ML Algorithms, by contrast, make predictions using a single model, such as K 43 RF and ETs were used to handle data complexity and feature importance, and AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting improved model performance by focusing on errors in previous models. Advanced techniques such as XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost ensured high performance and processed large data sets efficiently [ 43 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Ensembling ML algorithms combine multiple base learners to create stronger predictors through collective decision‐making. These algorithms reduce prediction errors by leveraging model diversity and include RF classifier, Extra Trees (ET) classifier, AdaBoost classifier (ADA), Gradient Boosting classifier (GBC), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and CatBoost classifier. Ensemble methods operate through two main strategies: (i) bagging (e.g., RF and ET), where multiple models are trained on different data subsets and results are averaged, and (ii) boosting (e.g., AdaBoost and XGBoost), where models are trained sequentially to correct previous models’ errors. Non‐ensembling ML algorithms rely on single model architectures to learn patterns and make predictions independently. These include k k Ensemble methods were included for their superior handling of complex feature interactions and robustness to data noise, particularly important given the multifactorial nature of childhood anaemia risk factors. Non‐ensemble algorithms served as benchmarks and provided interpretable alternatives, ensuring comprehensive evaluation across different learning paradigms. This dual approach enabled identification of the optimal predictive model while providing insights into algorithmic performance variations for childhood anaemia prediction. 2.8.1.1 Hyperparameters Tuning, Model Development and Algorithm Comparison Hyperparameter tuning: To achieve optimal performance from the ML models, hyperparameter tuning was conducted for each algorithm. The tuning process was carried out using a 10‐fold cross‐validation technique to ensure reliable and unbiased model evaluation. Model development: Data preprocessing included handling missing values by replacing missing values with their mean, encoding categorical variables and splitting data into 70% and 30% for training and test sets, respectively. Each model was trained using the optimized hyperparameters to learn the anaemia risk factors. Algorithm comparison and variable ranking: All the algorithms were compared to select the best. Their performance was assessed using metrics sensitive to imbalance, including precision, AUC, recall, Kappa, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), TT and F K 1 FIGURE 1 Steps followed in machine learning analysis. 2.8.1.2 Statistical Analysis Pair‐wise corrected resampled t 3 Result 3.1 Sample Characteristics The final analytical sample comprised 13,136 children aged 6–59 months, with 7799 (59.4%) classified as anaemic and 5337 (40.6%) as non‐anaemic (Table 1 TABLE 1 Characteristics of the respondents.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. In contrast, the SVM‐linear and QDA algorithms showed the lowest predictive power with AUCs of 0.4962 and 0.5074, respectively. These results highlight the importance of selecting the most appropriate algorithm for the task at hand, as the choice of algorithm can significantly affect the accuracy and reliability of predictions. To further evaluate the prediction performance of the ET classifier, a confusion matrix was constructed (Figure 2 FIGURE 2 Confusion matrix for the best performing model—Extra Trees (ET) classifier. From a performance perspective, the presence of misclassifications highlights the importance of continually refining and improving the model. Future research could explore strategies to reduce false positives and false negatives, such as incorporating additional relevant features, optimizing model hyperparameters, or using ensemble methods that combine the strengths of multiple algorithms. 3.3 Ranking of Important Variables for Predicting Childhood Anaemia Although identifying the best performing algorithm is critical, understanding the key factors driving anaemia in children in Nigeria is equally important for developing targeted interventions and public health strategies. Figure 3 FIGURE 3 Ranking of important variables for predicting childhood anaemia. 3.4 Demographic Bias Assessment Central to the development of this predictive model is the incorporation of a fairness and demographic bias assessment framework.The results, as depicted in Figure 4 FIGURE 4 Demographic bias assessment results. Figure 4A Figure 4B The model's performance across different ethnic groups is shown in Figure 4C Finally, Figure 4D 4 Discussion 4.1 Main Findings This study leveraged advanced ML techniques to identify the key determinants of childhood anaemia in Nigeria and developed a predictive model with high accuracy and generalizability. The ET classifier emerged as the best‐performing model, achieving an AUC of 0.8319, an accuracy of 0.7565 and a recall of 0.7565, significantly outperforming traditional LR and other ML algorithms. The model identified the top ten predictors of childhood anaemia, which include household‐level factors such as the number of under‐five children and birth order, individual‐level factors such as child age and gender, maternal health‐seeking behaviour and environmental factors such as proximity to water and land surface temperature. These findings underscore the multifaceted nature of childhood anaemia, highlighting the interplay between individual, household and environmental determinants. Importantly, the study revealed variations in model performance across different demographic groups, with lower predictive accuracy observed in the north‐east region, the poorest wealth index category and the Hausa/Fulani ethnic group. These disparities suggest that socio‐economic, cultural and environmental factors significantly influence the risk of childhood anaemia and must be considered in the design of targeted interventions. The successful application of ML in this study demonstrates its potential to enhance our understanding of complex public health challenges and provides a robust framework for developing data‐driven solutions to reduce the burden of childhood anaemia in Nigeria and beyond. 4.2 Comparison With Other Studies Our study's performance metrics align well with the existing literature, though some variations in performance metrics exist across different studies and contexts. The consistent identification of similar risk factors across studies (such as maternal education, wealth index, child age and geographic region) reinforces the validity of our findings and suggests that these factors are indeed fundamental predictors of childhood anaemia across different populations. Several studies have applied ML algorithms to predict childhood anaemia with varying degrees of success. Khan et al. [ 27 k 28 More recent studies have shown enhanced performance through advanced methodological approaches. Yimer et al. [ 29 k 44 45 Several methodological and contextual factors contribute to the observed differences in performance across studies: Studies varied considerably in sample sizes, from 2013 children [ 27 29 29 44 45 The observed variations in performance metrics across studies highlight the importance of methodological considerations in ML applications for health prediction. Our study contributes to this growing body of evidence by providing a robust predictive framework using the ET classifier (AUC = 0.8319) on a large Nigerian dataset, incorporating innovative demographic bias assessment to evaluate model fairness across different population subgroups and identifying novel environmental predictors such as day land surface temperature alongside traditional socio‐demographic factors, while acknowledging that continued methodological refinements and larger datasets may further enhance predictive accuracy in future research. 4.3 Implications for Policy and Future Research The findings of this study have significant implications for policy and future research aimed at reducing the burden of childhood anaemia in Nigeria. Although individual‐level factors are important, the study highlights the significance of household‐level factors (e.g., number of under‐five children and media access) and maternal factors (e.g., health‐seeking behaviour). This suggests that interventions should not only focus on the child but also consider the broader family and community context. Future research could explore the effectiveness of integrated interventions that simultaneously address multiple risk factors at different levels. Policymakers should focus on improving mothers’ education and health knowledge because these factors have been shown to positively affect children's health in an Indian study [ 46 Moreover, the study's findings on demographic bias in model performance have important implications for ensuring equitable healthcare delivery. The variations in model performance across regions, wealth index categories, ethnic groups and sex highlight the need for tailored approaches that consider the unique socio‐economic, cultural and environmental factors influencing childhood anaemia in different subpopulations. Policymakers should prioritize efforts to reduce disparities in healthcare access and quality across these demographic groups. This may involve targeted resource allocation, culturally sensitive interventions and the engagement of local communities in the design and implementation of anaemia prevention and control programmes. Furthermore, the successful application of ML techniques in this study highlights the potential for AI‐based approaches to revolutionize anaemia risk prediction and management. Future research should explore the integration of these predictive models into clinical decision support systems and mobile health applications. By providing healthcare workers with real‐time risk assessments and personalized recommendations, these tools could greatly enhance the early detection and timely management of childhood anaemia. However, the implementation of AI‐based interventions in low‐resource settings may face challenges related to infrastructure, technical expertise and cultural acceptability. Future research should therefore focus on developing strategies for the ethical and responsible deployment of these technologies, ensuring that they are accessible, affordable and aligned with local needs and values. 4.4 Strengths and Limitations of the Study This study presents several methodological and analytical strengths that enhance the reliability and validity of our findings. First, we utilized a large, nationally representative dataset from the 2018 Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey comprising 13,136 children aged 6–59 months, providing substantial statistical power and ensuring findings are generalizable to the Nigerian population. The comprehensive nature of the NDHS data allowed for the inclusion of diverse predictors spanning individual, household, community and environmental factors, enabling a holistic understanding of childhood anaemia determinants. Our methodological approach demonstrates several strengths in ML application. We implement mted and compared 16 different ML algorithms, providing a robust evaluation framework to identify the optimal predictive model. The systematic application of advanced data preprocessing techniques, including comprehensive feature selection and data balancing methods, ensured optimal model performance. The incorporation of rigorous cross‐validation procedures and hyperparameter optimization through grid search enhanced model reliability and prevented overfitting. A notable strength of this study is the integration of fairness and demographic bias assessment, which represents an innovative approach in health prediction modelling. By evaluating model performance across different regions, wealth categories, ethnic groups and genders, we ensured equitable prediction capabilities and identified potential disparities in model accuracy across population subgroups. This approach addresses critical concerns about algorithmic bias in healthcare applications and promotes health equity considerations. The study's analytical rigour is further strengthened by the identification of novel environmental predictors, including day land surface temperature and proximity to water sources, which expands the traditional understanding of anaemia risk factors beyond conventional socio‐demographic variables. The use of geospatial and environmental data provides new insights into the complex interplay between environmental conditions and childhood anaemia risk. Despite these strengths, several limitations must be acknowledged. The cross‐sectional nature of the NDHS data limits our ability to establish causal relationships between identified predictors and childhood anaemia. Although we can identify associations and develop predictive models, temporal relationships and causality cannot be definitively established, requiring cautious interpretation of findings for intervention design. The reliance on secondary data presents inherent constraints, as we were limited to variables available in the NDHS dataset. Important clinical variables such as detailed dietary intake, specific micronutrient deficiencies, parasitic infections and chronic disease status were not available, potentially limiting the comprehensiveness of our predictive model. Additionally, some variables relied on self‐reported information, which may introduce recall bias and measurement error. The generalizability of our findings may be limited to the Nigerian context and similar sub‐Saharan African settings. Although the model demonstrated strong performance within the study population, external validation in different geographic contexts, healthcare systems or time periods would be necessary to confirm broader applicability. Cultural, socio‐economic and healthcare infrastructure differences across countries may affect model performance and predictor importance. Technical limitations include the potential for algorithmic bias despite our fairness assessment efforts. Although we evaluated performance across major demographic subgroups, more granular analyses of minority populations or specific vulnerable groups may reveal additional disparities. The ML models, while achieving good predictive accuracy, remain ‘black box’ approaches with limited clinical interpretability for some algorithms, potentially hindering adoption in clinical practice. Data quality considerations include the potential for missing data patterns that may not be completely random, despite our imputation strategies. The standardized NDHS protocols, while ensuring consistency, may not capture local variations in anaemia determinants or cultural factors specific to different Nigerian regions. The study's focus on prediction rather than intervention limits its immediate clinical utility. Although the identified risk factors provide valuable insights, translating these findings into actionable intervention strategies requires additional research on the effectiveness and feasibility of targeting specific predictors. Finally, the temporal gap between data collection (2018) and analysis may limit the currency of findings, particularly given potential changes in healthcare policies, economic conditions and environmental factors that could affect anaemia prevalence and risk factor patterns. Future studies should consider more recent data and longitudinal designs to address these limitations and enhance the clinical utility of ML approaches for childhood anaemia prediction and prevention. Despite these limitations, this study provides valuable contributions to the understanding of childhood anaemia prediction using advanced analytical methods and establishes a foundation for future research incorporating more comprehensive clinical data and intervention studies. 5 Conclusion This study highlights the utility of ML techniques in accurately predicting childhood anaemia in Nigeria while identifying key risk factors that could guide targeted public health interventions. After evaluating various ML algorithms, ET was chosen for superior predictive accuracy and AUC. Consequently, an ET‐based anaemia prediction model for Nigerian children was successfully developed, and its performance across different demographic groups was assessed to ensure equitable risk prediction. The model could be ready for implementation following external validation. Future research should prioritize refining this predictive model to improve its precision and applicability across diverse populations, as well as integrating it into broader health systems for real‐time monitoring and decision‐making. Additionally, efforts should be directed towards designing and evaluating comprehensive, AI‐driven intervention strategies that address the immediate causes of childhood anaemia and the underlying socio‐economic and environmental determinants. Scaling these innovations across similar settings could significantly advance global efforts to reduce the burden of childhood anaemia and improve child health outcomes in resource‐constrained regions.
