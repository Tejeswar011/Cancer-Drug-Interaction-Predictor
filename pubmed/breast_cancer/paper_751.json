These molecules possess a wide range of biological activities, including antitumor, 5 6 7 8 9 On the other hand, imidazolium salts have attracted considerable attention in the research community owing to their diverse biological and pharmacological activities, 10 11 12 Fig. 1 50 50 13 Fig. 1 50 14 Fig. 1 15 Fig. 1 16 Fig. 1 Representative structures of imidazolium salts. In recent decades, the progress of drug discovery has become increasingly linked to advancements in synthetic organic chemistry. 17 18 In this context, we investigated the SAR of imidazolium salt derivatives 15 a Results and discussion Chemistry To achieve the synthesis of novel steroid-based imidazolium salt derivatives, we utilized commercially available imidazole derivatives that were alkylated with esterified 3-hydroxy steroids, which were synthesized from naturally abundant precursors, including diosgenin, cholesterol, and dehydroepiandrosterone. As depicted in Scheme 1 Scheme 1 Synthesis of diosgenin-, cholesterol- and dehydroepiandrosterone-imidazolium salt derivatives. Finally, a total of thirty-six imidazolium salt derivatives based on diosgenin, cholesterol, and dehydroepiandrosterone (7a–f/8a–f, 9a–f/10a–f, 11a–f/12a–f) were synthesized by coupling the corresponding imidazolyl-substituted steroidal derivatives with alkyl and phenacyl bromides in refluxing toluene with excellent yields of 87–96%. The structures of these derivatives are presented in Table 1 Table 1 Structures and cytotoxic activities of steroid-based imidazole and imidazolium salt derivatives in vitro b 50 a Entry Compound no.

Biological evaluation and structure–activity relationship analysis The cytotoxic potential of all newly synthesized steroid-based imidazole and imidazolium salt derivatives against three human cancer cell lines including breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231), liver carcinoma (HepG2) and prostate carcinoma (22RV1) were determined using the MTS assay. Cisplatin (DDP), Taxol, diosgenin (1), cholesterol (2), and dehydroepiandrosterone (3) were selected as positive controls for efficacy comparison. The results are listed in Table 1 As shown in Table 1 via in vitro Nevertheless, the steroid-based imidazolium salt derivatives (entries 10–45) demonstrated significantly enhanced cytotoxic activities. This can be attributed to the changes in molecular structure, charge distribution and water solubility. 19 50 in vitro 50 50 50 For linkers such as acetyl or propionyl, the influence on the cytotoxic activities of steroid-based imidazolium salts was not significant. In the case of the imidazole ring, steroid-based imidazole derivatives (7a–f/9a–f/11a–f) with an imidazole ring exhibited moderate inhibitory activity. Among these compounds, diosgenin derivatives demonstrated stable cytotoxic activities with IC 50 50 50 For the substituent at position-3 of the imidazole ring, imidazolium salts bearing phenacyl or 4-bromophenacyl substituent, such as 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9a, 11b and 12a, exhibited relatively weak inhibitory activities against three tumor cell lines. However, compound 12b demonstrated significantly higher cytotoxic activities compared to DDP with IC 50 50 50 50 The results indicate that the presence of a substituted 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole ring and the substitution at the imidazolyl-3-position with either a 1-naphthylmethyl or 4-methylbenzyl group may play a crucial role in enhancing cytotoxic activity. Furthermore, the structure–activity relationship (SAR) results are presented in Scheme 2 Scheme 2 Investigation of structure–activity relationships for steroid-based imidazolium salt derivatives. Compound 12f induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HepG2 cells To investigate whether the proliferation-inhibitory effect of steroid-based imidazolium salt 12f was attributable to cell cycle arrest, propidium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry analysis were conducted on HepG2 cells treated with various concentrations of 12f (0.625, 1.25, and 2.5 μM). As illustrated in Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Compound 12f induces G0/G1 phase arrest in HepG2 cells. (A) Cells were treated with 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 μM of compound 12f for 24 hours. The cell cycle was analyzed using PI staining in combination with flow cytometry. (B) The percentages of cells in different phases were quantified. At least three independent experiments were performed, and the data from a representative experiment are shown. (C) The percentages of cells in different phases were quantified. (D) The protein level of Cyclin D1 was detected with western blot analysis with β-actin was used as a loading control. The imidazolium salt 12f-induced cell apoptosis was assessed using Annexin V-FITC/PI double-labeled flow cytometry. As illustrated in Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Compound 12f caused significant apoptosis of HepG2 cells. (A) Cells were treated with 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 μM compound 12f for 48 hours. Cell apoptosis was determined by Annexin V-FITC/PI double-staining assay. (B) The quantification of cell apoptosis. (C) The protein level of apoptosis related proteins of Bcl-2, total and cleaved-caspase 3 and PARP-1 were detected with western blot analysis with β-actin was used as a loading control.

Proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 13 δ Synthesis of compounds 4/5/6 Diosgenin 1 (4.2 g, 10.0 mmol), cholesterol 2 (3.9 g, 10.0 mmol), and dehydroepiandrosterone 3 (2.9 g, 10.0 mmol) were dissolved separately in dichloromethane (30.0 mL). Subsequently, 3-chloropropanoyl chloride (1.1 mL, 12.0 mmol) and triethylamine (2.8 mL, 20.0 mmol) were added to the solutions of 1 and 2, respectively, while 2-chloroacetyl chloride (0.9 mL, 12.0 mmol) and triethylamine (2.8 mL, 20.0 mmol) were introduced into the solution of 3 at 0 °C. The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 8 hours. The reaction progress was monitored using TLC. A small amount of water was added and the mixture was stirred for 15 minutes. The aqueous phase was washed with CH 2 2 2 4 Synthesis of compounds 7–8/9–10/11–12 A mixture of the previously obtained chlorinated product (3.0 mmol) and imidazole or 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (15.0 mmol) was refluxed in toluene (20.0 mL) for 12–24 hours under continuous stirring, with reaction progress monitored by TLC. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was concentrated, and the residue was diluted with EtOAc (20.0 mL). The organic layer was washed with water (20.0 mL) and brine (20.0 mL), dried over anhydrous Na 2 4 3 Synthesis of compounds 7a–f/8a–f/9a–f/10a–f/11a–f/12a–f A mixture of imidazole compounds 7–8/9–10/11–12 (0.2 mmol) and phenacyl bromide or alkyl bromides (0.4 mmol) was refluxed in toluene (10.0 mL) for 24–48 hours under continuous stirring. An insoluble substance was formed. Upon completion of the reaction, as confirmed by TLC, the precipitate was filtered through a short Celite pad and rinsed with ethyl acetate (3 × 10.0 mL), followed by drying to yield imidazolium salts 7a–f/8a–f/9a–f/10a–f/11a–f/12a–f in 87–96% yields. See the SI file for characterization data. Cytotoxicity assay The assay was conducted using three types of cell line: MDA-MB-231, HepG2, and 22RV1. The cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 H Cell cycle analysis To analyze the DNA content by flow cytometry, cells were harvested and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were fixed with 70% ethanol overnight. Following fixation, the cells were rinsed with PBS and subsequently stained with a solution containing 50 μg per mL propidium iodide (PI) and 50 μg per mL RNase A for 30 minutes at room temperature. Fluorescence intensity was assessed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). The percentages of cells in different phases of the cell cycle were determined using FlowJo Version 7.6.1 software. Cell apoptosis analysis Cell apoptosis was evaluated using the Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Kit (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 3.0 × 10 5 Western blot analysis The western blot analysis was performed as previously. 16 Author contributions G. G. D. and L. M.
