Introduction With the continuous advancement of biomedical technologies and the growing demand for high-performance biomaterials, natural polymers such as chitosan (CS), hyaluronic acid (HA), sodium alginate (SA), cellulose, gelatin, and xanthan have emerged as a research focus due to their excellent biocompatibility, low toxicity, and biodegradability [ 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 SA is a linear polysaccharide composed of poly-β-D-mannuronic acid (M) and poly-α-L-guluronic acid (G) units linked via 1,4-glycosidic bonds [ 18 19 20 2+ 2+ 21 22 7 23 4 24 25 26 27 28 29 Based on the above background, this review systematically summarizes the latest research progress on SA-based hydrogels in the field of multifunctional biomedical materials, with a focus on analyzing strategies for performance optimization, functionalization methods, and their applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering, biosensing, and other areas ( Scheme 1 2. Gelation Mechanism and Preparation Methods of SA-Based Hydrogels 2.1. Gelation Mechanism The gelation process of SA-based hydrogels primarily relies on the interactions between crosslinking agents and the molecular chains of SA, forming a three-dimensional network structure. Based on the crosslinking mechanism, gelation methods can be categorized into ionic, covalent, and physical crosslinking. 2.1.1. Ionic Crosslinking Ionic crosslinking is the primary mechanism for the gelation of SA-based hydrogels. By introducing divalent or multivalent metal ions (e.g., Ca 2+ 2+ 30 31 21 32 33 2+ 2+ 2.1.2. Covalent Crosslinking Covalent crosslinking involves the formation of covalent bonds between polymer chains, where functional groups on different polymer segments interact to generate new functional groups [ 34 35 36 37 38 39 3 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 2.1.3. Physical Crosslinking Physical crosslinking primarily relies on hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, or electrostatic interactions to form gel structures [ 48 49 50 51 2.1.4. Comparison of Three Gelation Mechanism The mechanical properties of SA-based hydrogels are highly dependent on their gelation mechanisms. And the comparison of the three crosslinking mechanisms is presented in Table 1 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 The selection of the crosslinking mechanism essentially represents a trade-off among mechanical properties, stability, and dynamic functionality. Ionic crosslinking has become a mainstream choice for biomedical applications due to its favorable biocompatibility and tunability. In scenarios where extreme mechanical strength and long-term stability are required, covalent crosslinking or a hybrid approach combining it with ionic crosslinking is more suitable. Conversely, physical gelation is appropriate for applications that prioritize reversible responsiveness over high mechanical performance. In practical research, hybrid crosslinking strategies are frequently employed to leverage the advantages of each method, thereby enabling the fabrication of composite hydrogels that exhibit both excellent bioactivity and superior mechanical properties. 2.2. Preparation Forms of SA-Based Hydrogels To meet diverse application requirements, the preparation forms of SA-based hydrogels have been continuously developed and optimized. The following are several common preparation forms: 2.2.1. Traditional SA-Based Hydrogels Traditional hydrogels are prepared by dripping an SA solution into a solution containing a crosslinking agent (e.g., CaCl 2 62 63 64 3+ 2.2.2. SA Hydrogel Microspheres SA hydrogel microspheres are prepared by dispersing sodium alginate solution into microdroplets via ion spraying or emulsification techniques, followed by contact with a crosslinking agent to form microspheres. This method produces microspheres with stable and uniform particle sizes and short gelation times, effectively preventing the deactivation of active substances within the gel microspheres [ 65 66 67 2 3 68 65 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 2.2.3. 3D-Printed SA Hydrogel Scaffolds 3D printing technology enables the preparation of hydrogel scaffolds with complex shapes and precise structures by layer-by-layer deposition of SA solution, followed by reaction with a crosslinking agent [ 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 Cryogenic (freezing) printing technology is also noteworthy. By rapidly freezing deposited filaments to lock their geometry and utilizing ice crystals as templates, cryogenic printing enables the creation of anisotropically ordered or graded channels, thereby achieving high shape fidelity and strong interlayer bonding [ 89 90 91 92 93 94 3 3 3 3 In conclusion, with the rapid advancement of modern manufacturing strategies, the controllability and scalability of sodium alginate hydrogels have been significantly improved. Microfluidic technology allows precise manipulation of single-droplet gelation processes, yielding microspheres or microcapsules with adjustable sizes and uniform structures. Meanwhile, 3D printing and cryogenic printing techniques enable the accurate fabrication of customized scaffolds with complex architectures and hierarchical porosity, while preserving cell viability and achieving controlled multi-material integration. Combining these advanced processes, hydrogels now exhibit enhanced mechanical properties and biocompatibility, while also meeting clinical demands for large-scale, standardized, and personalized production. Overall, these systematic advances in gelation mechanisms, controlled release functionality, and manufacturing processes have laid a more solid foundation for the clinical translation of sodium alginate hydrogels in tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery. 3. Performance Optimization Strategies for SA-Based Hydrogels Despite the significant application potential of SA-based hydrogels in the biomedical field, their weak mechanical properties, limited functionality, and stability issues in complex biological environments restrict their broader applications. Consequently, modification and functional enhancement through performance optimization strategies have become a key focus of current research. The following sections discuss performance optimization strategies for SA-based hydrogels from three perspectives: mechanical property enhancement, functionalization modification, and degradation rate regulation ( Table 2 3.1. Mechanical Property Enhancement 3.1.1. Combining Polymers The combination of SA with other natural or synthetic polymers is a common strategy to enhance its mechanical properties. For instance, compositing SA with materials such as chitosan [ 32 105 106 12 95 107 Figure 1 108 3.1.2. Reinforcement Nanomaterials The incorporation of nanomaterials provides new avenues for optimizing the mechanical properties of SA-based hydrogels. For instance, adding nanomaterials such as nanocellulose, graphene oxide (GO), silica nanoparticles, or hydroxyapatite (HA) can significantly enhance the rigidity, compressive strength, and wear resistance of hydrogels. The core advantage of this strategy lies in its exceptionally high reinforcement efficiency, where even minimal incorporation can lead to a drastic improvement in mechanical properties, while simultaneously conferring additional functionalities such as electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, or antibacterial activity to the hydrogel. Lu et al. [ 26 2+ 96 109 110 111 2+ Figure 2 112 In recent years, the incorporation of photoluminescent nanomaterials into SA hydrogels has garnered significant attention to substantially broaden their functional applications. The integration of such nanomaterials—including quantum dots (QDs) [ 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 However, the drawbacks of this strategy are equally pronounced: nanoparticles are highly prone to aggregation, which can introduce structural defects and compromise the reinforcement effect. Moreover, the biosafety and long-term toxicity of certain nanomaterials remain poorly understood, raising concerns for clinical translation. This strategy is primarily employed in applications demanding stringent mechanical performance or specialized functionalities, such as high-load bone regeneration, flexible electronic sensors, and wearable devices. 3.1.3. Constructing Dynamic Cross-Linking Networks By introducing dynamic crosslinking mechanisms, such as reversible dynamic covalent bonds or physical interactions, hydrogels can achieve enhanced strength while gaining self-healing capabilities [ 121 122 123 124 125 Figure 3 126 127 2+ 97 128 3.2. Functionalization Modification 3.2.1. Intelligent Responsive Modification Smart responsive hydrogels represent a key direction in the functionalization of SA-based hydrogels. By incorporating molecules or materials sensitive to external stimuli, hydrogels can be endowed with responsiveness to pH, temperature, light, electric fields, or magnetic fields [ 129 130 98 3 4 131 Figure 4 99 2+ Four-dimensional (4D) printing integrates conventional 3D printing with “smart materials”, enabling 3D-printed structures to undergo programmed morphological changes over time in response to external stimuli [ 132 133 134 135 3.2.2. Surface Functionalization Surface functionalization of SA-based hydrogels through chemical modification can significantly enhance their bioactivity. For instance, introducing cell adhesion peptides (e.g., RGD sequences) or growth factors (e.g., VEGF, TGF-β) on the hydrogel surface can improve cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. Leach et al. [ 100 101 136 Figure 5 3.2.3. Drug Loading and Controlled Release Design Functionalization modification can also achieve efficient drug loading and precise controlled release by adjusting the internal structure and pore distribution of hydrogels [ 26 137 138 139 140 102 141 123 Figure 6 103 2+ 3.3. Regulating Degradability The degradation properties of SA-based hydrogels are critical for their biomedical applications, and the degradation rate can be significantly influenced by adjusting the type and concentration of crosslinking agents [ 142 104 143 144 2+ 145 3+ 2 2 2 2 Figure 7 4. Multifunctional Applications of SA-Based Hydrogels Based on their application forms and functional characteristics in specific scenarios, the multifunctional applications of SA-based hydrogels can be categorized into drug delivery, tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, and biosensing and diagnostics. To provide clearer guidance for the selection of optimization strategies in practical applications, we have summarized the correspondence between the performance optimization strategies discussed in Section 3 Table 3 As illustrated in Table 3 The following subsections will elaborate on each application area, with a focus on how these optimization strategies have been implemented to address specific biomedical challenges. 4.1. Drug Delivery SA-based hydrogels, through various functional designs, have emerged as versatile platforms for intelligent drug delivery, which can be primarily categorized into the following three strategies. The controlled release mechanism primarily relies on the intrinsic physicochemical properties of hydrogels, such as swelling-contraction behavior and ionic crosslinking degradation, forming the fundamental basis for constructing stimuli-responsive delivery systems. SA-based hydrogels can achieve sustained drug release through swelling-contraction behavior and the degradation process of ionic crosslinking. For instance, the swelling properties of hydrogels enable stable drug release over a specific period, while adjusting the crosslinking agent ratio to control hydrogel porosity significantly affects drug release behavior. The introduction of porous structures accelerates drug release rates, whereas non-porous hydrogels result in slower drug release, enabling precise control over drug release behavior [ 149 13 150 151 Active targeting strategies represent a crucial development direction in precision medicine, significantly enhancing therapeutic efficiency while reducing systemic side effects through precise drug delivery to lesion sites. Combining SA hydrogels with magnetic nanoparticles or surface-modified targeting ligands enables targeted drug delivery. For example, Yu et al. [ 152 153 154 Furthermore, compositing SA hydrogels with nanoparticles or other polymers enables the development of multi-level drug delivery systems for staged release of multiple drugs, which is significant for combination therapies in complex diseases. Xie et al. [ 155 156 Figure 8 4.2. Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine SA-based hydrogels, with their three-dimensional network structure and cell-friendly properties, serve as ideal scaffold materials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine [ 82 102 105 146 157 158 159 2+ 2+ 2+ 3 4 Figure 9 By compositing SA hydrogels with HA or other inorganic components, the resulting composite materials not only exhibit excellent mechanical strength but also promote osteoblast adhesion and mineralization, thereby accelerating bone tissue regeneration [ 160 161 162 146 163 4.3. Biosensing and Diagnostics By compositing conductive materials such as graphene or carbon nanotubes, SA-based hydrogels can serve as functional materials for flexible biosensors [ 164 165 147 3+ 2+ − − 3+ 2+ −1 148 2+ 2+ Figure 10 166 SA-based hydrogels can serve as diagnostic platforms for capturing and detecting target molecules or cells. Gram-positive bacteria are the primary pathogens causing wound infections and suppuration. Liu et al. [ 167 168 2+ 3+ 165 Figure 11 169 5. Conclusions SA-based hydrogels, as a widely available and high-performance natural polymer material, exhibit broad application prospects in the biomedical field due to their excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and versatile functionalization capabilities. By continuously expanding the application forms and functionalities of SA hydrogels, their multifunctionality in biomedical applications has been comprehensively demonstrated, spanning drug delivery, tissue engineering, wound repair, and biosensing. The multifunctionality and adaptability of SA hydrogels position them as key candidate materials for addressing complex medical challenges. These applications not only highlight the diversity of their material design but also provide efficient and safe solutions for tackling intricate medical problems. In recent years, through performance optimization and composite modification, the mechanical properties, degradation rates, and functionalization levels of SA hydrogels have been significantly improved. However, challenges remain in areas such as insufficient mechanical strength, precise control of degradation behavior, stability in complex environments, and industrial-scale production. To overcome these challenges, future research should focus on intelligent material design, refinement of fabrication processes, and diversification of application scenarios. Additionally, through interdisciplinary collaboration and further advancement of clinical trials, the translation of SA hydrogels from laboratory research to clinical applications can be accelerated. Looking forward, several emerging strategies are poised to further advance the development and application of sodium alginate (SA)-based hydrogels. High-throughput screening approaches enable rapid evaluation of large libraries of SA formulations and crosslinking conditions, facilitating the identification of optimal compositions for specific biomedical applications. Meanwhile, machine learning-based material design provides a powerful tool to predict hydrogel properties, optimize formulation parameters, and accelerate the discovery of novel SA-based composites with tailored mechanical, biological, and drug release characteristics. In addition, scale-up manufacturing strategies, including automated microfluidic platforms and advanced 3D printing techniques, promise reproducible, high-throughput production of hydrogel constructs with precise architecture and batch-to-batch consistency. Integrating these approaches could significantly enhance the translational potential of SA hydrogels, enabling more efficient, predictable, and clinically relevant biomedical applications. In summary, the research and application of SA hydrogels not only provide new insights for innovation in the field of biomedical materials but also offer efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable solutions for addressing current complex medical challenges. With continuous technological advancements and deeper exploration of applications, these materials are poised to play an increasingly significant role in the future of biomedical fields.

Property Physical Crosslinking Ionic Crosslinking Covalent Crosslinking Mechanical Strength Low Moderate High Weak physical forces and entanglements are easily disrupted. Strength depends on ion type and concentration. High energy covalent bonds form a strong, stable 3D network with high load-bearing capacity. Stiffness Low Highly Tunable High (and Tunable) Soft and brittle, with low modulus. Precisely adjustable via ion type, concentration, and crosslinking time. Typically exhibits high elastic, adjustable via crosslinker density. Toughness Low Moderate High (but can be brittle) Prone to irreversible fracture with low energy absorption. Exhibits energy dissipation via the reversible rupture and reformation of ionic bonds. The network itself is often brittle. Self-Healing Excellent Good Poor (Typically Irreversible) Physical interactions can reversibly reassemble, allowing for rapid self-healing. The dynamic nature of ionic bonds allows for inherent self-healing capability after damage. Covalent bonds, once broken, are permanently lost, no inherent self-healing ability. (Excluding dynamic reversible covalent crosslinking.) Stability Poor (Sensitive) Moderate (Ion-sensitive) Excellent (Stable) Highly sensitive to temperature, pH, and ionic strength; very unstable. Susceptible to ion exchange and dissolution in high ionic strength solutions or chelating agents. High chemical stability, resistant to solvents, ionic erosion, and degradation.
