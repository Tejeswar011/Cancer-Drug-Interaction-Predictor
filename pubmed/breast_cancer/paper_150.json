Compression and cryotherapy are potential preventive measures, yet their mechanism of acral temperature reduction remains unclear. This study aims to unravel the effects of pressure-adjusted static compression (PSC) on aerobic metabolic and endothelial responses in patients undergoing chemotherapy (CTX). Methods Cancer patients with CTX above the CIPN-threshold dose ( n n 2 Results PSC, in contrast to undersized surgical gloves (SG), uniformly creates pressure on hands and leads to a more pronounced reduction of hand temperature. Furthermore, PSC significantly increased microvascular perfusion, O 2 2 p 2 p p p 2 2 p p Conclusions Reduction of oxygen demand represents an important mechanism in interventions targeting prevention of CIPN. PSC, comparable to cryoapplication and IPC attenuates energy metabolism and enhances tissue oxygenation. PSC’s impact on the combination of vascular and energy metabolism suggests its potential to alleviate CIPN burden. These findings support PSC’s role in reducing acral CIPN through distinct mechanisms.

NIRS signals reflect both haemoglobin (in microvascular erythrocytes) and myoglobin (in muscle fibres) within superficial tissues [ 22 24 24 24 27 Materials and methods Participants The study population of this clinical-experimental, prospective, controlled pilot/exploratory study comprised a total of 53 subjects randomly recruited in three centres between March 2020 and December 2023. Participants recruited for the study were (a) 21 healthy middle-aged controls and (b) 24 cancer patients with different cancer types and chemotherapy doses above the threshold for CIPN-association [ 28 Materials and methods Compression and cooling products: Two undersized surgical gloves (SG; GAMMEX Latex, Ansell Healthcare, Belgium) were applied for hand compression, as described previously [ 5 8 S1 Measuring instruments: Pressure was measured with a PicoPress pressure gauge/manometer (3 cm diameter, M-1200, Microlab Elettronica, Italy) at the respective region of interest (ROI). Subjective perception was quantified with a standardised, validated visual analogue scale (VAS). Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was performed using a time-resolved spectroscopy (NIRO-200, Type: C8686; Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Japan) adapted to solve problems of absorption, scattering coefficient and mean path length [ 29 30 27 22 24 Oxygen supply (O 2 22 Intervention protocols All investigations were conducted under similar controlled conditions and following a standard protocol regarding preparation and conduction of investigations (see suppl. Methods S3). After standard preparation, compression or cooling was applied for 90 min followed by a further recording period of 10 min. Investigations with CTX patients were performed during chemotherapy administration. For each investigation, NIRS and pressure were measured simultaneously. Interventions were applied unilaterally with randomisation to the dominant or non-dominant hand. To maintain a consistently low temperature, frozen gloves were changed once after 45 min. Pressure was quantified at four specific sites, i.e. dorsum of the hand, palm, lateral edge, ventral wrist. Subjects were asked about their subjective well-being during the investigations and subjective perceptions were recorded after the interventions. To differentiate the effects of PSC on local blood flow from venous occlusion, distal venous wrist compression was performed using a blood pressure cuff on the wrist with 30 mmHg cuff (suppl. Methods S4) [ 31 With a vascular occlusion test (VOT) the endothelial function was quantified by the desaturation rate (measuring O 2 24 27 All investigations were conducted by trained personnel. Analysis of NIRS-signals NIRS parameters were continuously recorded with 1 Hz. To avoid technical artifacts and interferences automatic data smoothing was performed using the ongoing median over 5 measurement values (custom-written Visual Basic for Application in Excel, Microsoft, Version 2021, USA). All values were corrected for derivations from Zero prior to the investigation (baseline). Changes related to baseline were evaluated 5, 30, 60 and 90 min after investigation start and respectively 2 and 10 min after investigation completion each in 2-minute intervals (median and interquartile range (IQR) of measurement intervals).

To analyse whether chemotherapy might influence manner and magnitude of responses to PSC, these were evaluated in CTX (patients with and without CIPN) and compared to controls. Statistically significant and similar changes in CTX compared to controls were seen only in the effect of PSC on oxygen demand (HHb: -0.5 µM/s [-5.7–0.7], p 5  Fig. 5 Effect of pressure-adjusted static compression (PSC) in controls ( n n A 2 B C D Statistics: Analyses of differences over time in each group by Friedman test (controls: $, CTX: #, p p p p PSC reduces aerobic metabolism In controls muscle oxygen consumption (VO 2 p 6  Fig. 6 Reduced aerobic metabolism in controls ( n 2 2 Statistics: Wilcoxon test (2-sided), * p Discussion In this study addressing the mechanism of action of an alternative therapeutic option for primary and secondary prevention of CIPN, the primary findings are: (1) compression therapy for CIPN prevention reduces cellular oxygen demand and increases tissue oxygenation; (2) chemotherapy chronically impairs not only aerobic metabolism but also vascular, more specifically, endothelial cell function comparable to atherosclerotic artery disease with reduced oxygen supply; (3) PSC with higher pressure in the region of interest showed more pronounced effects on tissue oxygenation and was superior regarding comfort compared to the currently used surgical glove compression; and (4) compression therapy, cryotherapy and IPC have completely different working mechanisms, albeit all three interventions reduce aerobic metabolism demand. Vascular and energy metabolism with bioenergetics failure components have been implicated in the complex pathogenesis of CIPN with resultant endoneuronal hypoxia being sufficient to cause functional alterations [ 2 3 5 6 9 14 17 38 Reproducing previous effects of SG compression on temperature reduction [ 5 6 9 14 Whereas PSC and SG compression showed similar reduction in temperature in the ipsilateral hand, higher pressure in the region of interest with PSC induced more pronounced changes in oxygen supply and consumption, perfusion and tissue oxygenation during compression. Evidencing reduced energy consumption with PSC, this is the most likely reason for reduction of limb temperature in compression therapy. Thus, the effect of CTX on cellular energy metabolism contributing to CIPN [ 20 21 Additionally, the above-mentioned changes persist after the actual compression period in PSC only, suggesting a yet unidentified underlying mechanism. This should be considered, when discussing the duration of compression therapy, which logically should not be restricted to the duration of application of the different substances with much longer half-times, but should consider the potential underlying mechanisms and the needs of patients. Since the predominant effect of cryoapplication was blood flow reduction, simultaneous reduction of oxygen supply prevented optimisation of tissue oxygenation. The administration of chemotherapy induces vascular rarefaction, contributing to CIPN [ 2 3 39 40 41 42 Our findings are in line with results from compression used in other fields to improve perfusion [ 15 38 Based on these data, for patients undergoing chemotherapy with CIPN, PSC could be a therapeutic option for CIPN-prevention. This work provided indications for the proof of principle and since our investigations were done in a group of patients with and without CIPN, the use of PSC could be relevant for both, primary and secondary prevention of CIPN. Furthermore, modification of all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and investigating the effect of e.g. vascular protection in these patients is needed in well-designed prospective clinical trials [ 43 45 In perspective, our results encourage further research into the causal relation of vascular and moreover, endothelial damage in CIPN progression, into prevention of CIPN by reducing mitochondrial metabolism, and open the field to vascular, and more specifically, for endothelial protection, i.e. statin therapy, with the hope of offering therapy to prolong symptom-free and high-quality life expectancy [ 44 19 21 Strengths and weaknesses Careful attention was always given to sex distribution and age matching in the control groups. However, the patient group consisted of older individuals leading to an age mismatch between healthy controls and patients. Since age is likely to be a contributing factor, this heterogeneity represents a limitation. Moreover, the sample size was small, as the investigation was a clinically-experimental pilot study and no a priori power calculation was possible. Future studies with larger cohorts based on these data and accounting for an even age distribution will be necessary to confirm and extend these observations and prove the generated hypotheses with adequate statistical power. The uniform application of all study procedures, using state-of-the art standard procedures and protocols for the measurement of physiological variables with NIRS with iterative protocols and independent investigations with randomisation of intervention and control for each step, and using automatic analysis are key elements of this work. Choice of the NIRS system, optode characteristics and placing them into the ROI [ 29 30 24 46 Duration of occlusion was chosen to be as convenient as possible for later CTX-patients as compromise between the shorter, but reliable time frame of 3 min and discomfort to the subjects, the true zero plateau was not required for this scientific purpose. Clearly, the clinical nature of our studies precludes further insight into the interdependence of the metabolic and vascular defects in the pathogenesis of this condition. Influenced on reduction of EF parameters by 90 min PSC point towards a reduction of NO bioavailability that might be caused by release of NO during PSC with consequent reduced reactive hyperaemia amplitude and duration, comparable to the effect seen by repetitive VOT [ 47 The investigations focused on evaluating the mechanisms of action, and only single applications without prolonged observation periods and repeated treatments were analysed. Future studies should also focus on evaluating the clinical symptoms of CIPN before and after PSC treatment at different frequencies and durations of use in order to assess the clinical course of CIPN, and to draw conclusions on the potential of PSC usage for primary and secondary prevention of CIPN. In this context, it would be interesting to examine the various compression methods in terms of their effect on the clinical endpoint of CIPN and thus gain resilient information about the optimal application. Conclusion In conclusion, our findings highlight the critical role of reducing cellular oxygen demand as a central mechanism in interventions aimed at preventing the incidence and progression of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). PSC, alongside cryotherapy and IPC, demonstrates efficacy in reducing aerobic metabolism, although each employs distinct mechanisms. Ultimately, PSC emerges as a promising therapeutic option by enhancing tissue oxygenation and microvascular perfusion, underscoring the importance of vascular health in CIPN prevention and suggesting avenues for further research into endothelial protection and neuroprotection strategies.
