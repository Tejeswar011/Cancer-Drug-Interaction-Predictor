Hence, interest in research topics related to biosensors development, especially for point-of-care devices, is as high as it can be. To develop an electrochemical biosensor that meets technical requirements such as miniaturization and compactness in a single piece, many researchers have transitioned from a classical three-electrode system with the typical glass electrochemical cell equipped with large and separated electrodes to screen-printed electrodes (SPEs) and their corresponding accessories, allowing for small sample volume. Gold SPEs can be easily fabricated in large quantities and modified with various biological molecules through the formation of self-assembled monolayers, providing extremely sensitive responses to electrochemical signals and making them an attractive candidate for biosensor designs. In this work, an important pretreatment step, electropolishing in sulfuric acid, was investigated for gold SPE supplied by Metrohm, product BT220. Electrochemical capacitance spectroscopy (ECS) was employed to determine capacitance, which was correlated with changes in surface area, thereby providing insight into how various parameters of cyclic voltammetry (CV) used in electropolishing influence the reproducibility of the pre-treatment process. To optimize the electropolishing process of gold SPE, we have found that (a) the number of CV cycles during electropolishing should be set to ensure that all electrodes reached the same gold reduction peak current, which provides both the very low RSD for electrochemical quantitate of a baseline electrode (i.e., capacitance and active surface area below 2.9% and 1.9%, respectively) (b) the reference electrode incorporated in SPE is not stable in ferricyanide/ferrocyanide solutions, which are frequently used as a standard redox probe in electrochemical biosensors; and (c) this type of SPE should not be used in solutions containing ethanol, the solvent commonly used to dissolve thiolate blocking agents. This analysis provides insight into how to optimize the SPE’s pre-treatment, ensuring the sensor platform is consistent and the surface is reproducible before biological modifications, which in turn yields more steadfast results for biosensor development. gold screen printed electrode electropolishing electrochemical capacitance spectroscopy electrode stability biosensor The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Searching for the keyword “screen printed electrodes” in peer-reviewed literature databases (such as Scopus or Scifinder) can retrieve as many as 2,500 articles and review papers published between 2019 and 2024. One reason behind the rise in popularity of SPE is the ease of fabrication in large quantities compared to classical disk electrodes. Zamani et al. (2023) Among all the different types of screen printed electrodes (SPE), gold SPEs are typically preferred for the development of biosensors. This is primarily attributed to the ease with which a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of a thiolated compound forms on a gold surface. SAM is the spontaneous adsorption of molecular monolayers on a solid substrate ( Redondo-Gómez et al., 2024 Grönbeck et al., 2000 Alves et al., 1992 Bürgi, 2015 Cossaro et al., 2008 Grönbeck et al., 2000 Fischer et al., 2009 Nowinski et al., 2012 Barou et al., 2012 Enomoto et al., 2018 Liu et al., 2010 Monteiro and Koper, 2019 Brinãs et al., 2012 Nowinski et al., 2012 One crucial step before running an electrochemical experiment on gold surfaces is the pretreatment process. This is to enhance the surface quality by removing any contamination that may impact the results during electrochemical studies ( Fischer et al., 2009 Fischer et al., 2009 Monteiro and Koper, 2019 2 4 2 2 Fischer et al., 2009 Liu et al., 2010 Barou et al., 2012 Fischer et al., 2009 Enomoto et al., 2018 Fischer et al., 2009 2 4 Table 1 TABLE 1 Parameters used during electrochemical pretreatment via cyclic voltammetry (CV) for a gold Metrohm BT220 screen printed electrode in H 2 4 Year H 2 4 No. of CV cycles Potential range (V) Scan rate (V/s) 2014 ( Martín-Fernández et al., 2014  a 0.5 Until stable 0.00 to 1.25 0.1 2015 ( Fátima Barroso et al., 2015 0.1 Until stable 0.00 to 1.60 0.1 2015 ( Yu et al., 2015 0.1 N/A 0.00 to 1.25 0.1 2018 ( García-Mendiola et al., 2018 0.1 10 −0.20 to 1.20 0.1 2018 ( Manzano et al., 2018  b 0.5 10 −0.10 to 1.20 0.1 2019 ( Díaz-Fernández et al., 2019  a 0.5 10 0.00 to 1.30 0.1 2019 ( Guerrero et al., 2019 0.1 10 0.00 to 1.25 0.1 2021 ( Sánchez-Salcedo et al., 2021  a 0.5 About 10 0.00 to 1.30 0.1 2022 ( Zamani et al., 2022 0.5 10 −0.10 to 1.30 0.1 2022 ( Zargartalebi et al., 2022 0.5 30 0.00 to 1.10 0.1 2023 ( Jamal et al., 2023 0.5 22 −0.20 to 1.20 0.1 2024 ( Asaei et al., 2024  a 0.5 6 −0.20 to 1.30 0.1 2024 ( Kim et al., 2024 0.5 N/A 0.00 to 1.20 N/A 2024 ( Kavetskyy et al., 2024  c 0.5 30 0.00 to 1.70 0.1 2024 ( Martínez-Periñ et al., 2024 0.5 10 −0.20 to 1.20 0.1  a Electrodes were cleaned with EtOH, and water, and dried under nitrogen gas BEFORE, performing CV.  b Electrodes were rinsed with EtOH, and water AFTER, performing CV.  c The Ag reference electrode and the counter electrode were disconnected, and external reference and counter electrodes were used instead. In this study, we investigated how changes in experimental settings used for the electrochemical polishing (pretreatment) of the gold working electrode can directly affect the gold surface and thus influence the results of electrochemical testing. A deeper look and evaluation of the effect of electropolishing conditions should enable other users of similar electrodes to tune the surface confidently, prepare the sensor platform for their experiments, and reduce inconsistencies in experimental results. 2 Materials and methods Potassium hexacyanoferrate (II) trihydrate (99%), potassium hexacyanoferrate (III, 98%), magnesium chloride hexahydrate (99%), and phosphate buffer saline (PBS, 10X) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Sulfuric acid (98%) was purchased from Thermo Fischer Scientific. Ethanol (95% vol) was purchased from Commercial Alcohols. These chemicals were used without further purification. Screen-printed gold electrodes (C220BT) were purchased from Metrohm DropSens. SEM images were taken at the UNB Microscopy and Microanalysis Facility with a JEOL JSM-6400 Scanning Electron Microscope. The microscope has an EDAX Genesis 4,000 Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDS) analyzer. EDS analysis was performed at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV and a beam current of 1.5 nA, with a working distance of 14 mm and a collection time of 50 s per analysis point. All electrochemical experiments were carried out using a PalmSens4 potentiostat. The SPEs were connected to the potentiostat via Metrohm Dropsens cable connector for SPEs (catalog code: CAC). The experiments were controlled using the PSTrace software (version 5.9.4515). After removing the SPEs from the box, they were first examined for any visible scratches on their surface. Before the experiments, the electrodes were rinsed with 4 mL of DI water to remove dust, followed by blow-drying with a gentle stream of N 2 2 4 2 The surface area of the working electrodes was calculated following the method proposed by Trasatti and Petrii (1992) 2 2 PalmSens Compact Electrochemical Interfaces, 2021 To acquire electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), 100 μL of PBS (1X) with 5 mM of MgCl 2 Supplementary Figure S1 Equation 1 Chang (2022) C a p a c i t a n c e = R s Y 0 1 n R s (1) Where R  s Y  0 n R  s Y  0 Further analysis and calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel (see raw data). The standard deviation was estimated using the ‘= STDEV.S’ function, and the error percentage was calculated by dividing the average by the standard deviation for each set of data. All graphical images in this article were generated from Microsoft Excel and Origin 2018 software. 3 Results To better understand the surface of the working electrodes before any pretreatment, 15 SPEs were first rinsed with 4 mL of DI water, dried with N 2 2 Figure 1A 2 4, Figure 1B 2 2 2 Figure 1 FIGURE 1  (A) (B) Graph A shows various electrodes' performance with curves representing capacitance, labeled from one to fifteen using different colors.

Electrode 1 exhibits the highest capacitance. 3.1 An effect of the cyclic voltammetry conditions on the gold surface evaluation 3.1.1 An effect of the number of CV cycles Since CV is used to alter the surface of the electrode, understanding how different parameters of the pretreatment process will affect the surface area is equally important. Firstly, the number of CV scans in the electropolishing was correlated with the electrochemically active surface of the electrodes. An increase in the absolute change in the gold reduction peak current, δI Figure 3A Equation 3 δ I = I n − I 1 (3) FIGURE 3  (A) δI δSA (B) Graph A shows changes in current and charge over cycle numbers, with current increasing from 0 to 20 microamperes and charge from 0 to 25 microcoulombs.

Chart A shows three bars for scan rates of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 volts per second, with capacitance decreasing from 4.2 to 3.8 percent. Chart B presents three bars for upper potential values of 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 volts, showing capacitance values ranging from 4.2 to 16.1 percent. Each bar displays both capacitance and surface area values. While analyzing the trend in Figure 4A  Figure 4B Equation 1 Tajparast and Glavinović, 2018 Based on the observations, the surface area of the working electrode can be controlled to some extent during the pretreatment process, provided that the reduction current values remain constant. To demonstrate this, five SPEs underwent a pretreatment process with the same parameters (an upper potential of 1.1 V at a rate of 0.1 V/s). The number of CV cycles was varied to ensure that all electrodes reached the same reduction peak current ( Figures 5A, B Figure 5B 2 FIGURE 5  (A) (B) Graph A displays C'' versus C' for electrodes one to five, with similar peak shapes. Graph B shows current versus voltage, with a noticeable dip around 0.6 volts for each electrode. An inset provides a magnified view of this dip. Both graphs highlight the performance of different electrodes using various colored lines. 3.2 Stability of electrode 3.2.1 Reference electrode A mixture of ferricyanide and ferrocyanide is a standard redox probe used during the electrochemical analysis of fabricated biosensors ( Chun et al., 2013 Gong et al., 2009 Keighley et al., 2008 Ferreira et al., 2021 Figures 6B–D Figure 6B Figure 6D Supplementary Tables S1, S2 FIGURE 6 SEM images of the silver electrode surface of BT220 fresh from the box (A) (B) (C) (D) SEM micrographs and spectra of materials. Image A shows a smooth, interconnected, porous surface, while image B shows a rough surface with rod-like structures. Graph C is an X-ray energy spectrum with peaks at 2990 and 3170 keV, indicating element presence. Graph D shows similar peaks with additional peaks at 720 and 7100 keV, suggesting a more complex composition. 3.2.2 An exposure to organic solvent Some of the SPE modifications require the use of organic solvents, which are not recommended by the electrode manufacturer. For example, 11-Mercapto-1-undecanol (MCU) is one of the blocking agents that can be potentially used as a gold backfilling solution to prevent the attachment of non-target biomolecules to the gold surface. This is particularly important for SPE-based biosensors intended for use with body fluids that contain additional proteins with a high affinity for gold due to the presence of sulfur-containing moieties (e.g., blood, urine, saliva). For this reason, we also investigated the stability of the electrode in ethanol, a solvent that is compatible with most currently used thiolated blocking agents. A considerable change in capacitance was observed after immersing electrodes in different mixtures of alcohol and water ( Figure 7A 2 Figure 7B FIGURE 7  (A) (B) Panel A shows a bar chart comparing capacitance before and after dipping in different solvents (water, 30%, 60%, and 95% solutions). Red bars represent capacitance before dipping, and blue bars represent after dipping. Panel B shows a close-up image of a test strip labeled \"C220BT\" with a blue surface. 4 Conclusion To optimize the electropolishing process of gold SPE, we have found that (a) with increasing numbers of CV scans, the morphology of most outer deposits becomes very similar, resulting in low RSD and reproducible electrochemically active surface area (b) both the surface area and capacitance increase as the upper potential limit of the CV increases (c) the number of CV cycles during electropolishing should be set to ensure that all electrodes reached the same gold reduction peak current, which provides both the very low RSD for electrochemical quantitate of a baseline electrode (i.e., capacitance and active surface area below 2.9% and 1.9%, respectively). The reference electrode incorporated in SPE is not stable in ferricyanide/ferrocyanide solutions, which are frequently used as a standard redox probe in electrochemical biosensors. In addition, this type of SPE should not be used in solutions containing ethanol, the solvent commonly used to dissolve thiolate blocking agents (like MCH or MCU). This result has significant implications for researchers using thiolated backfilling agents dissolved in ethanol. Two practical takeaways from this work that are essential for users of these SPEs (a) the Ag pseudo-reference electrode is unstable in this common redox probe, and (b) these electrodes cannot be exposed to ethanol.
