Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) facilitate therapeutic resistance through exosome secretion, yet the role of CAF-derived long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in tamoxifen resistance remains underexplored. This study investigates the mechanism by which CAF-secreted exosomal lncRNA modulates tamoxifen resistance in ER + breast cancer. Methods CAFs from ER + breast cancer patients and normal fibroblasts (NFs) from healthy control were isolated and cultured ex vivo. Exosomes were extracted from the supernatant of cultured cells using ultracentrifugation. RNA sequencing identified PRKCQ-AS1 as a candidate lncRNA, validated in tamoxifen-sensitive and resistant tumors. Functional assays (qPCR, RNA-seq, dual-luciferase reporter, and in vivo xenografts) elucidated the role of PRKCQ-AS1/miR-200a-3p/MKP1 axis in tamoxifen resistance. Prognostic correlations were assessed in clinical cohorts ( n Results LncRNA PRKCQ-AS1 was markedly upregulated in tamoxifen-resistant tumor samples and was associated with poor prognosis in tamoxifen-treated ER + breast cancer patients but not in those treated with aromatase inhibitors. Exosomal PRKCQ-AS1 derived from CAFs transferred to ER + breast cancer cells, suppressing tamoxifen-induced apoptosis via MKP1 upregulation. Mechanistically, PRKCQ-AS1 acted as a molecular sponge for miR-200a-3p, relieving miR-200a-3p-mediated repression of MKP1. Elevated MKP1 inactivated the MAPK/JNK pathway, attenuating apoptosis. In vivo, PRKCQ-AS1 overexpression accelerated ER + breast tumor growth despite tamoxifen treatment. TGF-β-driven CAF transformation upregulated PAX5, a transcription factor enhancing PRKCQ-AS1 expression. Conclusions This study identifies CAF-derived exosomal LncRNA PRKCQ-AS1 as a key mediator of tamoxifen resistance via the miR-200a-3p/MKP1 axis. Targeting this pathway may offer novel therapeutic strategies to overcome endocrine resistance in ER + breast cancer.

The intercellular crosstalk between cancer cells and CAFs is mediated by multiple factors, including cytokines, growth factors and chemokines [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Among the molecular cargo within exosomes, non-coding RNAs play a pivotal role in epigenetic regulation, such as acting as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) or a molecular sponge for miRNAs, which is implicated in various oncogenic processes [ 14 15 16 17 18 In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of CAF-derived exosomes in mediating tamoxifen resistance in ER + breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate mechanisms by which lncRNA contributes to tamoxifen resistance and to identify novel therapeutic targets within CAF-derived exosomal lncRNAs to overcome tamoxifen resistance in ER + breast cancer. Materials and methods Patient samples and clinical assessments Tumor tissues from 471 ER + breast cancer patients were collected through surgery at the Comprehensive Breast Health Center, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, between July 2010 and July 2021 and then preserved by paraffin embedding. Among these, 68 tumor specimens from patients before adjuvant tamoxifen treatment were matched by clinicopathological features of patients, including tumor size, molecular subtype, histology, histological grade and Ki-67 index. Four paired frozen tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer samples were tested simultaneously to identify upregulated lncRNAs associated with tamoxifen resistance using bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (Fig. S1 Isolation and culture of CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) CAFs were isolated from seven human ER + breast cancer tissues before adjuvant tamoxifen treatment and NFs were isolated from the breast glandular tissue of three patients who underwent reduction mammaplasty. The culture process followed previously reported methods [ 19 Cell culture and reagents Human breast cancer cell lines (MCF7 and T47D) and HEK293T cells were obtained from the Shanghai Cell Bank, Chinese Academy of Sciences. All cells were cultured in DMEM high-glucose medium (BasalMedia, L110KJ) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% PS solution. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Plasmid and transfection The full-length human lncRNA PRKCQ-AS1 was cloned into pcDH-CMV vectors to create the pcDH-CMV-PRKCQ-AS1 plasmid. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) plasmids targeting MKP1 were constructed by inserting target oligonucleotides into pLKO.1. Lentivirus was packaged by co-transfecting the plasmids with packaging vectors (pMD2.G and psPAX2) into HEK293T cells. The lentivirus was used to infect target cells to create stable transfecting cell lines. Primers for plasmid construction are listed in Table S1 S2 RNA extraction and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis Total RNA from fresh tissue samples and cultured cells was extracted using Trizol reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #AM9738). Total RNA from paraffin-embedded tissue was extracted using the PureLink™ FFPE RNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #K1560-02). Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and lncRNAs were reverse transcribed to complementary DNA (cDNA) with the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #4387406). The reverse transcription of miRNAs was performed using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara, #RR037a) with specific stem-loop primers. RNA expression was assessed in triplicate using real-time quantitative PCR on an Applied Biosystems QuantStudio™ 5 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A34322) with SYBR Green Master buffer (ROX) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #A25742). qPCR method for analyzing exosomal RNA, U6 was used as the internal control. For analyzing RNA in cells and tissues, expression levels of mRNAs and lncRNAs were normalized to GAPDH, and U6 was used as an internal control for miRNA expression. Primers for amplifying mRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs are listed in Table S3 Western blotting (WB) Total proteins were extracted from cell lysates using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #89900) supplemented with 1% phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #36978). Protein concentrations were quantified using the Pierce BCA kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #23225). Denatured proteins (20 µg/lane) were subjected to 10% SDS polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #88518). Membranes were blocked with 5% fat-free milk (BD Biosciences, #232100) solution for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:3000, Cell Signaling Technology, #98164) or goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:3000, Cell Signaling Technology, #91196). Protein detection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Millipore, WBKLS0500). The primary antibodies used for WB are listed in Table S4 RNA sequencing (RNAseq) RNA was extracted using the Universal RNA Extraction CZ Kit (RNC643, ONREW). RNA concentration was measured using Qubit 4.0 (Invitrogen), and quality was assessed by electrophoresis on a denaturing agarose gel. RNA libraries were prepared using the VVAHTS ® https://sourceforge.net/projects/skewer/files/?source=navbar http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html P Exosomes extraction and transmission electron microscope As previously described [ 19 Immunofluorescence microscopy CAFs and NFs were seeded onto glass coverslips and cultured for 48 h. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h, and incubated overnight at 4 °C overnight with primary antibodies (listed in Table S4 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor sections were rehydrated, and blocked with rabbit serum. The slides were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, #98164) at 37 °C for 1 h. Primary antibodies are listed in Table S4 In situ hybridization (ISH) FFPE tumor specimens were sectioned and subjected to ISH to detect PRKCQ-AS1 expression using a specific digoxigenin (DIG) labeled PRKCQ-AS1 probe. Images were captured using an optical microscope. The sequences for the DIG-labeled PRKCQ-AS1 probe are listed in Table S5 The definition criteria for high and low PRKCQ-AS1 and MKP1 expression levels were determined based on the ISH (PRKCQ-AS1) and IHC (MKP1) pathological score in Ruijin cohort. IHC and ISH evaluations were conducted independently by at least two experienced pathologists from the Department of Pathology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. IHC staining intensity was graded as: 0 (no staining), 1 (weak staining), 2 (moderate staining), and 3 (strong staining). The proportion of positively stained tumor cells was also assessed. The staining index (SI) was calculated by multiplying the staining intensity score by the proportion of positive tumor cells, yielding a final score ranging from 0 to 3. And scoring method of ISH is consistent with that of IHC. We used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in R software to analyze the optimal cut-off value of PRKCQ-AS1 (0.65) and MKP1 (1.22). Besides, the criteria for GEO cohort was the optimal cut-off value of PRKCQ-AS1 (-2.34) and MKP1 (-1.86) using ROC curve. Breast cancer samples with PRKCQ-AS1 or MKP1 score higher than cut-off value were regarded as high levels, and vice versa as low levels. Cell-viability assays and colony-formation assays Cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo ® Flow cytometry Apoptosis was assessed using the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (MultiSciences, AT-101) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis was performed using a CytoFLEX FACS instrument (Beckman Coulter) and data were analyzed using FlowJo software. Dual-luciferase reporter assay Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed as previously described [ 20 In vivo assays All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. Estrogen pellets (0.72 mg, 60-day slow release, Innovative Research of America) were implanted subcutaneously into the neck of female, 4-week-old NCG (NOD/ShiLtJGpt-Prkdc em26Cd52 Il2rg em26Cd22 /Gpt) mice (GemPharmatech Co., Ltd, Jiangsu, China). After one week, 35 NCG mice were randomly assigned to 5 groups. Briefly, 5 × 10 6 6 6 6 2) 3 Statistical analysis All experiments were performed in triplicate, and data are presented as means ± standard deviations (SDs). Statistical analyses were conducted using Student’s t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and two-way ANOVA. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression model were used to evaluate disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics software (version 21.0), R software (version 3.6.3), and GraphPad Prism (version 8.0). A two-side P Results PRKCQ-AS1 predicts poor prognosis in tamoxifen-treated ER + breast cancer patients To systematically identify differentially expressed genes between tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant tumor tissues, bulk RNA-seq was performed on 4 tamoxifen-sensitive breast cancer samples and 4 tamoxifen-resistant ones. 5 up-regulated and 14 down-regulated lncRNAs in tamoxifen-resistant tumors were identified (Fig. 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  Fig. 1 LncRNA PRKCQ-AS1 is associated with poor prognosis in tamoxifen-treated ER + breast cancer patients. A. B C D E-F p G GSE9195 p H-I p P CAF-derived Exosomal PRKCQ-AS1 decreases tamoxifen sensitivity in ER + breast cancer cells To explore the resource of PRKCQ-AS1, we isolated seven CAFs from ER + breast tumors and three NFs from healthy controls and detected the content of PRKCQ-AS1 among CAFs, NFs, ER + breast cancer cells MCF-7 and T47D. qPCR assays demonstrated elevated expression levels of PRKCQ-AS1 in CAFs compared to NFs or tumor cells (Fig. 2 2 2 2 2  Fig. 2 CAF-derived exosomal LncRNA PRKCQ-AS1 induces tamoxifen resistance of ER + breast cancer cells. A B C D-E F G-H I J-K L-M P P To assess the functional consequences of PRKCQ-AS1 overexpression, MCF-7 and T47D cells were infected with lentivirus to stably overexpress PRKCQ-AS1, as confirmed by qPCR (Fig. 2 2 2 PRKCQ-AS1 upregulates MKP1 expression to promote tamoxifen resistance To identify genes regulated by PRKCQ-AS1 that may contribute to tamoxifen resistance, RNA-seq was performed on MCF7 and T47D cells with or without PRKCQ-AS1 overexpression, with or without tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 3 AL691482.3 S5 S6 3 S6 3 S4 S4 3 S6  Fig. 3 LncRNA PRKCQ-AS1 induces tamoxifen resistance via upregulating the expression of MKP1. A B C D E F GSE9195 G H I-J K-L P P To further validate the role of MKP1 in tamoxifen resistance, shRNA-mediated knockdown of MKP1 was performed in MCF-7 and T47D PRKCQ-AS1 OE cells, with knockdown efficiency confirmed via qPCR and WB (Fig. 3 3 S7 S7 PRKCQ-AS1 upregulates MKP1 expression via serving as a molecular sponge of miR-200a-3p LncRNAs could function as ceRNAs [ 21 22 4 4 S8 S8 4 4 4 S9  Fig. 4 LncRNA PRKCQ-AS1 upregulates the expression of MKP1 via acting as a sponge of miR-200a-3p.

L-M P P P To further elucidate the interaction among PRKCQ-AS1, miR-200a-3P, and MKP1, we conducted dual-luciferase reporter assays as previously reported [ 23 24 4 4 4 . MKP1 modulates MAPK/JNK pathway to suppress tumor apoptosis and promote tamoxifen resistance To explore the mechanism by which PRKCQ-AS1 induces tamoxifen resistance in ER + breast cancer cells, GSEA of RNA-seq data from MCF-7 and T47D cells was performed. The apoptosis pathway was significantly downregulated in tamoxifen-treated MCF-7 and T47D PRKCQ-AS1 OE cells compared to NCs (Fig. 5 S10 5 25 26 5 S9  Fig. 5 MKP1 upregulation inactivates MAPK/JNK pathway and reduces tamoxifen induced ER + breast cancer cells apoptosis. A-B C-D E-F G n H n I n J n K n L n P PRKCQ-AS1 induces tamoxifen resistance in vivo To investigate the role of PRKCQ-AS1 in tamoxifen resistance in vivo, NCG mice were inoculated with MCF-7, MCF-7 PRKCQ-AS1 OE cells, MCF-7 cells mixed with CAFs or NFs, then were treated with tamoxifen or placebo. CAFs co-injection accelerated tumor growth than NFs despite tamoxifen, indicating that CAFs contribute to tamoxifen resistance in vivo (Fig. 5 5 5 S11 5 PAX5 upregulates PRKCQ-AS1 expression in CAFs To explore the mechanisms underlying PRKCQ-AS1 upregulation in CAFs within the breast cancer TME, we utilized JASPAR, hTFtarget, and human TFDB databases to predict potential transcription factors in CAFs. Paired box 5 (PAX5), transcription factor activating enhancer binding protein 2 α (TFAP2A), runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) and androgen receptor (AR) were identified as candidate transcription factors with possible transcriptional activity for PRKCQ-AS1 (Fig. 6 6 S12 6 S13 6 S13 6 6  Fig. 6 PAX5 upregulates LncRNA PRKCQ-AS1 expression and induces NFs transformation into CAFs. A. B. C. D. E. F. G. H. I-J. K-L P P P Previous studies have demonstrated that NFs tend to transition into CAFs under the influence of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) within the TME [ 27 6 6 6 In conclusion, TGF-β promotes the conversion of NFs into CAFs in the breast cancer TME, accompanied by an increase in PAX5 and lncRNA PRKCQ-AS1 expression. CAFs transfer PRKCQ-AS1 to breast cancer cells via exosomes, where PRKCQ-AS1 upregulates MKP1 expression by serving as a molecular sponge of miR-200a-3p. This process reduces the phosphorylation levels of the MAPK/JNK pathway, thereby inhibiting tumor apoptosis and promoting resistance to tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 7  Fig. 7 Summary diagram of CAFs contributing tamoxifen resistance in ER + breast cancer via exosomal lncRNA PRKCQ-AS1/miR-200a-3p/MKP1 axis. In breast cancer TME, NFs undergo transformation into CAFs under the influence of TGF-β, leading to the upregulation of PAX5 and PRKCQ-AS1. CAFs confer tamoxifen resistance to breast cancer cells by transferring exosomal lncRNA PRKCQ-AS1, which acts as a molecular sponge of miR-200a-3p, thereby upregulating MKP1 expression. Since tamoxifen primarily induces apoptosis in breast cancer cells, MKP1 counteracts this effect by reducing the phosphorylation of the MAPK/JNK pathway, ultimately attenuating apoptosis and promoting tamoxifen resistance Discussion Drug resistance has become severe challenges in cancer therapy [ 28 30 31 19 32 33 Tamoxifen resistance remains a significant clinical challenge [ 34 9 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 Recent studies have elucidated multiple mechanisms by which lncRNAs regulate tumor progression, including modulating chromatin state and methylation, protein and complex stability, or serving as a molecular sponge of specific miRNAs to regulate the expression of target mRNAs [ 35 42 44 45 25 46 48 49 50 26 51 52 LncRNAs and their target mRNAs have been recognized as prognostic biomarkers in various cancers [ 53 54 55 56 57 58 Conclusion This study demonstrates that during the transformation of NFs into CAFs, PAX5 upregulates the expression of CAF-secreted exosomal lncRNA PRKCQ-AS1. PRKCQ-AS1 drives tamoxifen resistance in ER + breast cancer by upregulating MKP1 expression and reducing tamoxifen-induced apoptosis through serving as a molecular sponge of miR-200a-3p. Targeting CAF-derived exosomal PRKCQ-AS1 offers a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome tamoxifen treatment resistance in ER + breast cancer patients.
