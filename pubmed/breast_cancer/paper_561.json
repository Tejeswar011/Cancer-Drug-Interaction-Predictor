Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is associated with defective DNA repair leading to extreme ultraviolet sensitivity and a very high risk of cutaneous neoplasias.  What does this study add? We report a patient with XP with numerous cutaneous and ocular malignancies, including metastatic melanoma diagnosed in 2014. Treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab for 1 year led to a rapid and complete response of the metastatic melanoma and also to a very dramatic regression of all cutaneous malignancies. In addition, a corneal conjunctival malignancy also regressed. No marked toxicity or immune-related diseases ensued with the ICI. Response was maintained 6 months post-ICI discontinuation. ICI anti-programmed cell death protein 1 shows marked activity in patients with XP and should be studied prospectively, perhaps earlier in these patients. Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by defective DNA repair following ultraviolet (UV) damage. This defect leads to extreme sensitivity to UV radiation and a dramatically increased risk of developing cutaneous malignancies. 1 2 2 2 3 1 4 5 XP-associated skin cancers have a high mutational burden, 3 6 7 4 8–10 Case report We report the case of a dramatic response to pembrolizumab in a patient with XP, metastatic cutaneous melanoma and numerous skin carcinomas. The patient, a woman diagnosed with XP in childhood, has been under care at the Hospital das Clínicas, University of São Paulo (HCFMUSP), since 1998. Her medical history includes multiple cutaneous and ocular malignancies. In 2013, the patient presented with a pigmented lesion on her scalp, which was surgically excised in June. Histopathological analysis revealed nodular malignant melanoma with a Breslow thickness of 14 mm, subcutaneous invasion, ulceration and positive margins, consistent with stage pT4b disease. In August of the same year, she underwent margin expansion surgery, revealing no viable neoplasia. Concurrently, partial glossectomy was performed to treat a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. In 2014, metastatic melanoma was confirmed in a left axillary lymph node. A positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET-CT) scan revealed multiple subcutaneous nodules suggestive of disease implants. Given the unresectable lesions, systemic chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and dacarbazine (CVD regimen) was initiated. Partial treatment response was achieved, but treatment was discontinued due to severe toxicities, including febrile neutropenia, gastrointestinal symptoms and septic shock. Between 2018 and 2022, the patient experienced progressive left axillary lymphadenopathy and the emergence of nodules in the thoracic wall and right breast. Axillary lymphadenectomy confirmed melanoma metastases. She remained under regular follow-up until 2023, when a large dorsal nodule emerged (Figure 1 Figure 1 Dorsal nodule consistent with metastatic cutaneous melanoma and xeroderma pigmentosum-related hyperpigmented skin lesions before treatment with pembrolizumab. The patient was included in an institutional clinical trial evaluating the monoclonal antibody anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD1) pembrolizumab for a maximal duration of 1 year, or 17 cycles (as opposed to the standard 2 years). It is important to note that immunotherapy is not yet available routinely for any indication in the Brazilian public health system. Following pembrolizumab initiation, the patient exhibited excellent tolerance, with mild toxicity limited to rash and skin peeling, managed conservatively. A notably rapid regression of the metastatic melanoma lesion was observed after only two doses of pembrolizumab. This early response was subsequently followed by a progressive remission of the numerous cutaneous lesions suggestive of carcinomas, as well as XP-associated hyperpigmented skin lesions. After 17 cycles, the patient achieved complete clinical remission of the dorsal metastatic melanoma (Figures 2 3 Figure 2 Rash and skin peeling during treatment with pembrolizumab.

Discussion A literature review identified two previously reported cases on the use of immunotherapy in patients with metastatic melanoma and XP. 8 9 9 8 10 Despite the potential risks associated with ICIs, including severe autoimmune complications, our patient did not experience significant immune-related toxicity. Although DNA repair deficiency in patients with XP raises concerns about potential long-term immune toxicity, no increased risk has been reported in the few available cases. Nevertheless, long-term safety data for ICIs in patients with XP are still lacking. This case highlights the potential efficacy of ICIs in treating advanced malignancies in XP, where the high mutational burden may enhance sensitivity to immunotherapy. Pembrolizumab led to a rapid and complete clinical and radiological remission without significant adverse effects, reinforcing its role as a promising therapeutic option for this vulnerable population. Although combination regimens such as anti-PD1 with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 typically show higher response rates, 7 8–10 Acknowledgements We would like to thank the patient and her family for consenting to the publication of this case.
