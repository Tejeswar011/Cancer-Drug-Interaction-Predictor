Chronic exposure to elevated levels of manganese (Mn) causes a neurological disorder referred to as manganism, resembling pathological symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) induces neuroprotection in several neurological disorders, including PD and Mn toxicity. Tamoxifen (TX), a selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been shown to afford neuroprotective effects in various experimental models and increase REST expression via the non-genomic estrogen receptor (ER)/Wnt signaling in Cath. a-differentiated (CAD) neuronal cultures. The present study investigated whether TX enhances REST transcription through the genomic estrogen receptor (ER) pathway in CAD cells, using a combination of Western blotting, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), promoter activity assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and site-directed mutagenesis. The findings showed that the REST promoter sequences contained half-site estrogen response elements (ERE) motifs.

Our findings demonstrate that the REST promoter contains the half-site ERE, and that TX upregulates REST transcription by activating the genomic ER-α pathway, which involves increasing ER-α binding to this ERE in the REST promoter. TX also alleviated the Mn-induced decrease in REST transcription via the same ER-α-mediated mechanism in CAD cells. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials Manganese (II) chloride (MnCl₂), TX, REST antibody (07–579), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were obtained from MilliporeSigma (Burlington, MA, USA). The selective ER agonists propylpyrazole triol (PPT) and diarylpropionitrile (DPN) were purchased from BioTechne, Tocris (Minneapolis, MN, USA). Cell culture reagents, including trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), Minimum Essential Medium (MEM), Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12), and cell culture components were sourced from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (Waltham, MA, USA). Antibodies against ER-α (sc-543), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) response element (CREB)-binding protein (CBP)/p300 (sc-32244), Sp1 (sc-17824), and β 2.2 Cell culture The catecholaminergic mouse CAD cell line (catalog no. 08100805) was obtained from MilliporeSigma. Cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 × GlutaMAX™, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Neuronal differentiation was induced by switching to serum-free medium. Cells were dissociated using 0.125% trypsin and 0.1 g/L EDTA, then seeded into 6-well or 24-well plates for functional assays, or into 100 mm × 20 mm or 150 mm × 20 mm culture dishes for promoter activity, RNA, or protein analyses. Cultures were maintained at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO₂ and 95% air. 2.3 Transient transfections Cells were transfected with plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine™ 3,000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasmid vectors were introduced at a concentration of 0.1–1.0 μg per 5.0 × 10 5 2.4 Measurement of promoter activity CAD cells were transfected with the human REST promoter plasmid vectors, followed by overnight incubation. Transfected cells were treated with various compounds, and REST promoter activity was measured using the Bright-Glo™ Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 2.5 Western blot Following treatment with the indicated compounds, CAD cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail. Lysates were collected, and equal amounts of protein were separated on 10% sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels for subsequent Western blot analysis. Primary antibodies were applied at a 1:1,000 dilution, while HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at dilutions ranging from 1:2,500 to 1:5,000. Protein bands were visualized using the West Pico PLUS chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA), and signal detection and quantification were performed using the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc Imaging System and ImageJ software (Bethesda, MD, USA) as described previously ( Pajarillo et al., 2020 2.6 Immunocytochemistry (ICC) CAD cells were cultured on poly-L-lysine–coated glass coverslips in 6-well plates for immunostaining as previously described ( Pajarillo et al., 2020 α α 2.7 Nuclear fractionation and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) Cells were lysed in a fractionation buffer composed of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl₂, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, and 1 mM DTT, supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail. Mechanical disruption was performed using a syringe, followed by centrifugation at 720 g Pajarillo et al., 2020 2.8 Quantitative RT-PCR Following the appropriate treatment, samples from CAD cells were prepared for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). To extract total RNA from each group, three samples were processed using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Purified RNA (2 μg) was then subjected to reverse transcription using the high-capacity complementary DNA (cDNA) reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to generate cDNA. Real-time qPCR was performed on the Bio-Rad CFX96 instrument (Hercules, CA) using the Bio-Rad iQ SYBR Green Supermix and 0.4 μM primers. The reaction volume for each sample was 25 μL, with 1 μL of cDNA template included. The following primers for mouse were utilized: REST forward: 5′-ACT TTG TCC TTA CTC AAG CTC-3′, reverse: 5′-CAT TTA AAT GGC TTC TCA CCT G-3′; GAPDH forward: 5’-CTC ATG ACC ACA GTC CAT GC-3′, reverse: 5’-CAC ATT GGG GGT AGG AAC AC-3′. The qPCR parameters consisted of 1 cycle at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95°C for 15 s and 60–65°C for 1 min. mRNA levels were analyzed using Bio-Rad CFX Manager Version 3.1, with GAPDH as the internal control. 2.9 Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay The ChIP assay was conducted using the EZ-ChIP kit from MilliporeSigma, following the manufacturer’s instructions, as previously described ( Pajarillo et al., 2020 2.10 Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) EMSA was conducted using a LightShift chemiluminescent kit from Thermo Fisher Scientific, following the manufacturer’s instructions, as previously described ( Pajarillo et al., 2020 2.11 Site-directed mutagenesis The half-site ERE binding sequence in the human 5’UTR REST promoter was mutated using the Q5 mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The 5′UTR REST promoter (−3,390/+1) subcloned into the pGL3 basic vector was used as the original template for mutation. The primers used for ERE mutant (ERE-mut) were 5′-GGG CCC CAC TCC CTT TCT-3′ and 5′-GCC TCT TTT CTC AGC TAA GGG CAG G-3′. The ERE mutant clones were confirmed by Primordium sequencing. 2.12 Statistical analysis All data were expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of the mean. Statistical analyses were performed using either Student’s t- Sidak’s post-hoc p p 3 Results 3.1 The REST promoter contains the half-site ERE sequences, and ER- α The REST promoter sequences have been shown to contain cis-regulatory elements for several TFs, including Sp1 ( Ravache et al., 2010 β Digman et al., 2025 Figure 1A Petz and Nardulli, 2000 α Figure 1B Figures 1C D Supplementary Figure S1 α Figure 1E α Figure 1 The ER- α (A) (B) (C,D) (C) (D) (E) p p p t Sidak’s post-hoc n Diagram A showing the structure of the REST promoter with labeled exons and ERE (estrogen response element), and four bar graphs depicting experimental results.

Next, we tested if TX activated the genomic ER-α pathway to attenuate Mn effects, given that the REST promoter sequences contain the half-site ERE motifs. The results showed that TX increased ER-α protein levels in whole-cell lysates ( Figure 3A Figure 3B Figure 3C α Figure 3C α Figure 3 TX enhanced the ER-α expression and its nuclear translocation in CAD cultures.

The accompanying bar graph quantifies colocalization of ER-α with DAPI. 3.3 TX increased ER-α binding to the ERE in the REST promoter and attenuated Mn effects in the reduction of REST transcription in CAD cells Since the nuclear ER-α was primarily involved in TX’s effects on the transcriptions of the ER’s target genes, we tested if TX recruited epigenetic coactivators, particularly histone acetyltransferases (HATs), CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300, to interact with ER-α, as previously demonstrated in HeLa cells ( Kraus and Kadonaga, 1998 Waddell et al., 2021 Yi et al., 2017 α Figure 5A α Petz and Nardulli, 2000 Figure 5B Figure 5 TX increases ER-α binding with CBP/p300 and Sp1 in the nucleus of CAD cells.

Below, a Western blot analyzes the interaction of ER-α with CBP/p300 and Sp1 over a time course of TX treatment, showing different protein bands corresponding to nuclear ER-α, histone H3, CBP/p300, and Sp1. Next, we determined if TX and/or Mn modulates the binding of ER-α to the half-site ERE in the REST promoter by conducting DNA-protein interaction assays using ChIP and EMSA.

TX upregulates ER-α expression, promoting its translocation to the nucleus. The nuclear ER-α interacts with coactivators CBP/p300 and Sp1, enhancing its binding to the half-site ERE on the REST promoter. This interaction increases REST transcription in CAD neuronal cells. Conversely, Mn downregulates ER-α expression, reducing its nuclear translocation, resulting in decreased REST expression. Blue and red colors indicate TX- and Mn-induced effects, respectively. Diagram showing the effects of TX and Mn on ER-α in a neuron. TX increases ER-α levels, while Mn decreases them. In the nucleus, ER-α, CBP/p300, and Sp1 interact at the Half-site ERE (-2969) to regulate REST expression. Arrows indicate upregulation by TX and downregulation by Mn. REST transcription is known to be regulated by several TFs, including Sp1 ( Ravache et al., 2010 Digman et al., 2025 α Joseph et al., 2010 Bourdeau et al., 2004 Joseph et al., 2010 α α Petz and Nardulli, 2000 Ravache et al., 2010 α α α cis Klinge, 2001 Porter et al., 1997 α Vyhlidal et al., 2000 The second ERE half-site (TGACC) appears to play a more critical role in target gene expression than the first half-site, as shown in the c-jun promoter, where it facilitates c-jun transcription via ER-α binding ( Hyder et al., 1995 Figure 7C α β Digman et al., 2025 As a SERM, TX induces ER-α agonistic effects in the brain in several experimental models ( Zou et al., 2015 Lim et al., 2018 Figure 3 Ihionkhan et al., 2002 α Supplementary Figures S2, S3 Hall and McDonnell, 1999 Gruvberger-Saal et al., 2007 Mn decreased ER-α protein levels in CAD neuronal cultures ( Figure 4 Pajarillo et al., 2018 D'Astous et al., 2004 Gelinas et al., 2004 Activation of the genomic ER pathway has been identified as a critical mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of several SERMs. Bazedoxifene has been shown to improve cognitive deficits in ovariectomized mice via genomic ER signaling in the brain ( Hill et al., 2020 Karki et al., 2014 Pietrzak et al., 2023 Although the current study using TX showed potential for the development of neuro-SERMs that activate the ERs only in the brain, there is a limitation to the TX-REST axis as a neuroprotection mechanism because of the lack of in vivo Chen et al., 1998 Huang et al., 2019 In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that TX enhances REST expression by activating genomic ER-α signaling, thereby counteracting Mn-induced suppression of this pathway.
