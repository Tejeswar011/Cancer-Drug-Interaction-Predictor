Therefore, it is essential to identify novel therapeutic targets. By integrating multi-omics data from cohorts of patients with melanoma treated with ICBs, a positive correlation is observed between tumor CD137L expression and the efficacy of PD-1 blockade. Functionally, CD137L induction in cancer cells significantly enhances anti-tumor immunity by promoting CD8 + CD137L CD137L CD137L Immune checkpoint blockade is an effective therapy in melanoma, but response is highly variable between patients. Here, the authors show that Inducing co-stimulatory immune checkpoint CD137L expression in melanoma cells enhances T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity.

Notably, CD137L expression was lower in melanoma compared to normal pigmented nevi. Exogenous overexpression of CD137L CD137L CD137L CD137L CD137L Results CD137L expression levels were correlated with the efficacy of PD-1 mAb therapy in patients with melanoma Immune response is co-regulated by both inhibitory and co-stimulatory checkpoints. To investigate whether co-stimulatory checkpoints correlate with their sensitivity to immunotherapy, we analyzed the correlation between the TNF superfamily of co-stimulatory checkpoints and sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy. We found that the expression level of ligand-receptor group CD137/CD137L ( TNFRSF9/TNFSF9 1a 1 CD274 1b 2 1c 1d 1e Fig. 1 CD137L expression levels were correlated with the efficacy of PD-1 mAb therapy in melanoma patients. a TNFSF9/TNFRSF9 p 1 b TNFSF9/TNFRSF9 CD274 CD8A CD8B c d e f GSE189889 + − g + − 2 + − ; 2 h i d h d h e i d n n h n n The expression pattern of CD137L CD137L 1f CD137L 1lg 1h 1i Overexpression of CD137L enhanced cancer immune surveillance both in immune-competent mice and melanoma cells To investigate the role of CD137L in melanoma, CD137L 1A CD137L 2a, b 1C CD137L 2c–e 1D + 2f + + + + CD137L + 2g–j 1E, F + CD137L 2k, l 2m CD137L 2n Fig. 2 Induction of CD137L enhanced cancer immune surveillance both in immune-competent mice and melanoma cells. a b c d e f g j + g + h + i + + j k l + + + + m t n a c g j, l n b d e t a d g j l n m n k n n a d g j n e HLTF functioned as a negative regulator controlling CD137L transcription The results above indicate that CD137L expression is low in melanoma, and its upregulation could represent a promising therapeutic strategy.

Melanoma cells were treated with AICAR, and transcriptomic analysis revealed increased activation of AMPK-related pathways, including MAPK and cAMP signaling (Supplementary Fig. 4A, B 4l 2 4m–o 4C–E 4F–J 4K CD137L CD137L 4p, q CD137L 4r 4L–O 4P CD137L 4s 4t CD137L Synergistic effect of CD137L inducer and PD-1 mAb or CTLA-4 mAb therapy in melanoma preclinical mouse models The application of CTLA-4 and PD-1 monoclonal antibodies has marked significant progress in tumor immunotherapy, however, there remains potential for further enhancing therapeutic efficacy. Combining different therapeutic agents is a promising strategy to enhance treatment outcomes. As a co-stimulatory checkpoint independent of both the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways, CD137L emerges as a potential target for combination therapy. AICAR, a specific AMPK agonist, is currently in clinical use for the treatment and protection against cardiac ischemic injury. To assess the potential of AICAR in melanoma immunotherapy, a low dose of AICAR was combined with clinically approved immune checkpoint inhibitors, anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies. Results demonstrated that AICAR alone suppressed tumor growth, and, notably, when combined with the anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies, tumor growth was significantly more inhibited than with the single-agent treatments in immunocompetent mice (Fig. 5a–c 5 6A 5d 5e + + + + + 5f, g + + + + + 5h + 6B–L Fig. 5 Synergistic effect of CD137L inducer and PD-1 mAb or CTLA-4 mAb therapy in melanoma preclinical mouse models . a b c d e f g f g + + + + h + + + + + + + + d g h d g h e n f g n c e h Discussion CD137L, primarily expressed on APCs, co-stimulates T-cell activation through binding to CD137. While it has been identified in tumor cells and plays varying roles across different cancer types, its function in melanoma remains unclear. In this study, activated AMPK can phosphorylate HLTF to enhance CD137L expression, thereby activating T cells to eliminate melanoma cells (Fig. 6 Fig. 6 HLTF binding at the CD137L promoter inhibits CD137L expression in melanoma. The AMPK agonist, AICAR, activates AMPK binding to HLTF and leads to its phosphorylation at the Ser398 position, which in turn releases HLTF from the CD137L promoter and induces CD137L expression, transforming tumor cells from mediating the immunosuppressive type to stimulating the immune activation type. Created by Biorender. Human CD137 and CD137L expression extends beyond immune cells; some tumors exploit the CD137-CD137L pathway to promote tumor progression 16 19 20 21 17 19 21 22 CD137L HLTF, a member of the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermenting (SWI/SNF) family, plays a critical role in chromatin remodeling 23 23 24 25 26 30 HLTF CD137L CD137L Previous studies have shown that HLTF can be regulated by ubiquitination 31 CD137L 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 36 39 41 41 42 CD137L CD137L 43 44 45 46 Despite the dramatic improvement in patient survival with the clinical application of PD-1 antibodies, the overall response rate remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for reliable biomarkers to predict treatment efficacy. AICAR-induced upregulation of CD137L significantly enhances the anti-tumor effect of PD-1 antibodies, suggesting a correlation between CD137L expression and PD-1 treatment response. Tumor analysis further revealed that patients with elevated CD137L expression exhibited better prognoses after PD-1 mAb therapy. While PD-1 mAb prevents T-cell exhaustion, CD137L promotes T-cell activation and survival, potentially contributing to improved patient outcomes. However, clinical trials evaluating CD137-specific monoclonal antibodies, and first-generation agonists have been halted due to adverse effects like intolerable hepatotoxicity (urelumab) and low efficacy (utomilumab) 10 11 + + 47 48 49 50 52 53 54 55 57 Methods Ethical statement All human and animal studies were conducted in compliance with the relevant ethical guidelines and approved by the appropriate ethics committees.
