Introduction Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) represent a class of incurable and progressive disorders characterized by the gradual degeneration of the structure and function of the nervous system, particularly the brain and spinal cord [ 1 1 Several classifications exist regarding neurodegenerative diseases [ 2 3 4 Regarding Clinical Manifestation the neurodegenerative disorders could be classified as cognitive disorders (AD, frontotemporal dementia) [ 5 4 6 7 8 9 1 The NDDs affect different predominant brain regions: hippocampus (AD), basal ganglia (Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease), and motor neurons (ALS) [ 10 APP PSEN1 HTT 1 NDDs involve the progressive loss of neurons, the building blocks of the nervous system. This loss is often irreversible and occurs through various mechanisms, including protein misfolding, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and chronic inflammation. Many NDDs are associated with the accumulation of misfolded or abnormal proteins, such as amyloid-β in Alzheimer’s disease, α-synuclein in Parkinson’s disease, and huntingtin protein in Huntington’s disease. These proteins aggregate in brain tissue, forming plaques or tangles that disrupt neuronal communication and trigger cell death. At present, NDDs remain incurable. The therapeutic strategies are primarily focused on alleviating symptoms and decelerating disease progression. Pharmacological interventions are frequently employed to manage clinical symptoms—acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are prescribed for AD, while levodopa remains the standard treatment for motor symptoms in PD. A major challenge still remains detecting NDDs in early stage and distinguishing between similar conditions due to overlapping symptoms [ 11 12 13 Ginkgo biloba Bacopa monnieri Salvia officinalis Curcuma longa Rosmarinus officinalis Melissa officinalis Galanthus nivalis Lepidium meyenii Centella asiatica 12 13 A range of innovative therapeutic approaches is currently under investigation, such as stem cell-based therapies, gene-editing platforms such as CRISPR, and immunotherapies directed at pathogenic proteins. Moreover, phytochemicals such as β-caryophyllene and xanthohumol have demonstrated significant neuroprotective potential in preclinical models. These natural agents exert multifaceted effects by modulating neuroinflammatory pathways, oxidative stress responses, and aberrant protein aggregation—pathological mechanisms that are central to the development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive synthesis of current scientific findings on the neuroprotective potential of the natural compounds β-caryophyllene and xanthohumol. By examining their biological effects and recent advancements in optimization through nano- and microscale drug-delivery systems, current work offers a better understanding of their therapeutic relevance. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Studies Evaluating β-Caryophyllene Activity on NDDS β-Caryophyllene (BCP) is a naturally occurring bicyclic sesquiterpene ( Figure 1 Syzygium aromaticum Zingiber nimmonii Helichrysum Callistemon linearis Salvia verticillata Humulus lupulus Stachys lanata The compound is a selective agonist of cannabinoid type 2 receptors (CB2-R). Unlike the compounds that interact with cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1), BCP lacks psychoactive effects due to its minimal CB1 affinity. Among its diverse biological roles, BCP demonstrates anti-inflammatory properties by suppressing key inflammatory mediators, including inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and cyclooxygenases COX-1 and COX-2. Furthermore, its actions are partly mediated through activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, particularly PPAR-α and PPAR-γ. Based on several in vivo and in vitro studies, it can be concluded that BCP possesses significant neuroprotective activity ( Table 1 Figure 2 Ojha, Shreesh, et al. demonstrated that the neuroprotective effect of the cannabinoid in a model of PD was mediated by its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities [ 27 33 26 36 28 Some in vitro studies demonstrated the neuroprotective activity in SH-SY5Y cell lines, as BCP enhanced cell viability, reduced the release of lactic dehydrogenase, decreased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and altered Caspase 3 activity [ 17 23 20 18 21 24 29 31 34 Askari, Vahid Reza, and Reza Shafiee-Nick demonstrated that BCP at low doses exerted its effects through CB2 receptors, while at higher concentrations the protective activity decreased and the PPAR-γ pathway was activated [ 19 15 2.2. Studies Evaluating Xanthohumol Activity on NDDS Xanthohumol (( E Figure 3 Humulus lupulus 38 XAN has been shown to counteract cognitive impairments caused by a high-fat diet [ 39 Hop extracts containing XAN promote sleep and neuroprotection, with enhanced potential for antioxidant and neuroprotective activity [ 40 Xanthohumol, a prenylchalcone, shows significantly lower activity in stimulating neuronal differentiation in adult neural stem cells compared to pyranochalcones, suggesting that the pyrano ring is a key structural element. However, XAN has been reported to possess neuroprotective properties [ 41 42 43 Xanthohumol has attracted significant attention for its neuroprotective potential in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD and PD. In vitro and in vivo studies are presented in Table 2 The findings summarized in the Table 2 Figure 4 A key neuroprotective mechanism of XAN involves the inhibition of pathological protein aggregation. XAN has been shown to directly inhibit the fibrillization tau protein and disaggregate existing fibrils, effectively reducing tau-induced apoptosis in cellular models of AD [ 48 52 67 Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are pivotal contributors to neurodegeneration, and XAN has been consistently shown to activate the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, enhancing antioxidant defenses and reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels [ 45 49 50 56 58 62 54 55 56 58 XAN also modulates several key signaling pathways associated with neurodegeneration. For instance, it regulates kinases such as GSK3β and phosphatases such as PP2A, which are involved in tau hyperphosphorylation, and influences endoplasmic reticulum stress and proteasome function [ 47 63 44 59 Beyond its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic roles, XAN modulates the adenosinergic system by enhancing A1 receptor expression, which may reduce excitotoxicity—a critical process in AD progression [ 51 53 46 Emerging evidence also implicates the gut–brain axis in XAN’s neuroprotective mechanisms. Studies demonstrated that XAN modulates gut microbiota composition and metabolite profiles, thereby contributing to improved cognition and reduced neuroinflammation in AD models [ 53 55 64 Despite its therapeutic promise, XAN’s clinical translation is hindered by poor oral bioavailability and limited BBB penetration. To address these limitations, several formulation strategies have been developed. Nanostructured lipid carriers, solid dispersions, self-emulsifying drug-delivery systems (SNEDDSs), and cyclodextrin complexes have significantly enhanced XAN’s solubility, stability, and brain bioavailability, resulting in improved cognitive and motor function in animal models [ 46 62 65 68 XAN exhibits a broad spectrum of neuroprotective activities relevant to the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. Its ability to target oxidative stress, inflammation, protein misfolding, synaptic dysfunction, and neurotransmitter imbalance makes it a compelling candidate for future therapeutic development. Continued research, particularly well-designed clinical studies and optimized drug-delivery systems, will be critical to unlocking XAN’s full potential in treating AD, PD, and related disorders. Despite the promising neuroprotective potential of XAN in the management of PD, its clinical application is hindered by poor solubility, low bioavailability, and limited permeability across the BBB, ultimately resulting in reduced therapeutic efficacy. To address these challenges, a solid dispersion formulation of XAN was developed. This strategy significantly enhanced the delivery of XAN to the brain, leading to increased dopamine levels and reduced oxidative stress and inflammation—critical pathological features implicated in PD progression [ 69 Similarly, XAN has demonstrated both neuroprotective and senolytic properties in the context of AD, yet its therapeutic impact remains constrained by the same pharmacokinetic limitations. To overcome these barriers, a self-nanoemulsifying drug-delivery system (SNEDDS) was formulated. In vivo studies demonstrated that XAN-loaded SNEDDS significantly improved cognitive and motor functions while reducing AChE activity, Aβ levels, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation in rat models of AD [ 40 2.3. Drug-Delivery Systems for β-Caryophyllene The pharmacological potential of β-caryophyllene as a neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic agent has generated considerable interest in developing effective delivery systems to overcome its inherent limitations, including low aqueous solubility, high lipophilicity, chemical instability, and extensive first-pass metabolism. In recent years, a variety of advanced carriers ( Table 3 Figure 5 Lipid-based nanocarriers are among the most widely investigated, leveraging BCP’s lipophilic nature. Nanostructured lipid carriers combine solid and liquid lipids into a matrix that entraps BCP, resulting in high encapsulation efficiency (87%), particle sizes of 200–250 nm, and sustained release profiles. These nanostructures enhance solubility, protect BCP from volatilization and oxidation, and improve membrane penetration, offering superior pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties compared to conventional formulations [ 70 71 72 ® 73 74 Emulsion-based carriers have also been extensively employed for BCP delivery. Both nanoemulsions and microemulsions, which are isotropic oil–surfactant–water mixtures with nanodroplets typically less than 200 nm, improve BCP stability, controlled release, and tissue distribution. Incorporating nanoemulsions into hydrogels enhances their handling and residence time at the target site, resulting in improved penetration and anti-inflammatory activity [ 75 76 77 78 79 80 Cyclodextrin-based delivery systems have been explored to enhance the solubility and biological activity of BCP. Complexes of BCP with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) increased solubility approximately tenfold, protected it from degradation, and enhanced its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and gastric protective effects in vivo [ 81 82 In addition to lipid- and cyclodextrin-based carriers, niosomes have been adapted for BCP delivery. PLGA-modified, pH-sensitive niosomes achieved high encapsulation efficiency, controlled release in acidic environments, and enhanced cytotoxicity against triple-negative breast cancer cells, demonstrating their potential as advanced, responsive delivery systems [ 83 Polymeric nanoparticles are another promising approach, offering controlled and targeted delivery. When modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG), nanoparticles stabilize BCP in a hydrophilic matrix, achieving 98% encapsulation and forming uniform particles (<150 nm), with potential for brain targeting [ 29 84 85 Beyond conventional carriers, other innovative delivery platforms have been reported. Intranasal nanoemulsions demonstrated efficient brain delivery of BCP in a seizure model, with high encapsulation efficiency, stability, and anticonvulsant effects [ 86 Apart from its role as an active compound, BCP has been investigated as a natural penetration enhancer. Studies have demonstrated that BCP fluidizes and disrupts stratum corneum lipids, increasing the permeability of hydrophilic drugs with minimal irritation [ 87 88 molecules-30-03702-t003_Table 3 Table 3 Drug-delivery systems for β-Caryophyllene, where ↑—increase and ↓—decrease.

Drug-Delivery Systems for Xanthohumol Due to its poor biopharmaceutical characteristics, mainly its low solubility in water, XAN exhibits insufficient oral resorption due to the restricted dissolution in body fluids [ 90 43 In general, enhancing the solubility of XAN is one of the most commonly used methods for improving its biopharmaceutical characteristics, namely the incorporation of XAN in a complex with cyclodextrins. They are cyclic oligosaccharides with a hydrophobic interior cavity and hydrophilic exterior. They are well-established carriers for enhancing the solubility of hydrophobic drugs and that of natural compounds [ 91 92 Another popular method for overcoming the poor biopharmaceutical characteristics of XAN is its incorporation in different nanoparticulate systems. They present a great opportunity to increase the solubility, bioavailability and stability of XAN, as well as alter its pharmacokinetics [ 93 Figure 6 2.4.1. Polymeric DDS for Xanthohumol Polymeric nanoparticulate systems have been broadly studied as carriers of XAN. The most common technique used is the micellar incorporation of XAN. In a recent study, Khayyal et al. developed micelles consisting of polysorbate 80, with incorporated XAN. The resulting micelles were compared in vivo for their anti-inflammatory effects with pure diclofenac sodium and non-micellized XAN. They reported a significantly higher anti-inflammatory effect of the micellar XAN compared to the native form, which was found not only to reduce the paw volume in arthritic rats but also to decrease the serum levels of cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. The effect was not significantly different from the effect of pure diclofenac sodium, which shows that the incorporation of xanthohumol in micelles significantly increases its efficacy due to the enhancement of its biopharmaceutical characteristics [ 94 95 Apart from micellar incorporation, several other polymer-based drug-delivery systems have been developed as potential carriers of XAN. Poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid has been broadly utilized as a carrier for several classes of drugs due to its versatility, biocompatibility, and biodegradability [ 96 97 97 Similar nano-sized structures have been developed by Ghosh et al.; however, they were developed as a tool for the protection of the corneal epithelial cells. They reported that the formulated structures had a cytoprotective effect in in vitro oxidative stress injury in human corneal epithelial cells and significantly improved dry eye disease symptoms in a mouse model [ 98 A polysaccharide-based drug-delivery system was also used as a potential carrier of xanthohumol. Hanmantrao et al. developed a guar gum/pectin based self-nanoemulsifying system for the colon-targeted drug-delivery of xanthohumol. The developed formulation showed increased xanthohumol solubility in water due to the transformation of its structure from crystalline into amorphous form. In addition, the formulation showed a 1.5-fold increase in the cytotoxic effect of XAN against Caco-2 cells, compared to free xanthohumol [ 99 All the above-mentioned studies underscore the potency of polymer-based drug-delivery systems for XAN, enhancing its biopharmaceutical characteristics and its therapeutic potential. 2.4.2. Lipid-Based DDS for Xanthohumol Apart from polymeric systems, different lipid-based formulations, such as liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles, have also been reported as potential carriers of XAN. Solid lipid nanoparticles were found to be extensively utilized due to their advantages, including high colloidal stability, biocompatibility, and non-toxicity. Harish et al. developed xanthohumol-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles, which were reported to be in the 100 nm-range in terms of their size and high entrapment efficiency of XAN, around 80%. DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) and PXRD (powder x-ray diffraction) analyses showed that the xanthohumol structure shifted from a crystalline to an amorphous form; however, the release of xanthohumol was significantly slow; at 92 h, only 28% of the drug was released, which was probably due to the immobilization of xanthohumol in the lipid matrix. Although the drug release was slow, the formulated xanthohumol-loaded structures showed enhanced pharmacokinetic properties compared to non-encapsulated XAN [ 100 In a recent study, Khandale et al. successfully addressed the issue of slow drug release by developing a novel solid lipid nanoparticle structure which showed a 5-fold increase in the in vitro drug release rate, compared to native xanthohumol. The formulation was tested in vivo in AlCl 3 66 Liposomal carriers of xanthohumol have also been developed previously. Buczek et al. investigated the effect of cyclodextrins on characteristics of xanthohumol-loaded liposomes. They reported that the complexation of xanthohumol with cyclodextrin modulates the temperature-dependent release of XAN from the synthesized structures [ 101 2.4.3. Inorganic Carriers for Xanthohumol While less studied compared to polymeric and lipidic DDSs, inorganic carriers receive great attention from the scientific community due to their unique optical and magnetic properties. They can be utilized for targeted drug delivery and for diagnostic purposes, which makes them highly versatile carriers of different active substances [ 102 Iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles are one of the most extensively researched inorganic carriers for magnetically assisted drug delivery. Matthews et al. developed xanthohumol-loaded iron oxide nanoparticles coated with polyethylene glycol-block-allyl glycidyl ether, as a potential tool for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The prepared structures showed a high loading efficiency of 80%. The in vitro dissolution assay showed that <5% of xanthohumol was released after 48 h, whereas after stimulation for 15 min, > 40% of the incorporated xanthohumol was released. The developed structures showed high cytotoxic effects against multiple myeloma cells, which was additionally amplified by the generation of reactive oxygen species from the iron carriers [ 103 Mesoporous silica nanoparticles are another attractive drug-delivery tool, possessing numerous advantages due to their porous structure and relatively high surface area, biocompatibility, and non-toxicity. Their pore-size is easily controlled and allows extensive surface modification, providing stimuli-responsive behavior, control of the drug release process, targeted delivery of genes, and diagnostic capabilities [ 104 Krajnovic et al. developed XAN-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles and studied their cytotoxic effects against melanoma cells. They reported a relatively low entrapment efficiency of XAN, ranging between 8 and 17%. They tested the formulation in vitro for its antitumor activity. It was determined that the cell-death effect induced by the xanthohumol-loaded mesoporous particles involves inhibition of cell proliferation and an autophagic cell death mechanism, whereas free XAN induces apoptosis. This shows that the incorporation of xanthohumol in mesoporous silica nanoparticles can alter the antitumor effect of xanthohumol qualitatively as well as quantitatively [ 105 2.5. Clinical Trials and Future Perspectives Despite their promising biological effects, both BCP and xanthohumol are not yet FDA-approved pharmaceuticals, which may be related to some of their poor biopharmaceutical characteristics [ 93 106 107 Table 4 Although β-caryophyllene and xanthohumol are generally considered safe and are available as dietary supplements, their long-term safety profiles in patients with neurodegenerative diseases are not well characterized. Preclinical and early clinical data suggest that these compounds have low toxicity; however, they both interact with important metabolic pathways. β-Caryophyllene acts as a CB 2 Regarding neuroprotection, research on β-caryophyllene and xanthohumol is still predominantly at the in vitro or in vivo animal study stage. To translate these findings into clinical practice, well-designed human trials are essential to confirm safety, efficacy, and optimal dosing. Achieving regulatory approval will require not only robust clinical evidence but also advanced formulation strategies to overcome bioavailability limitations. Polymer- and lipid-based nano/microsystems, micellar carriers, and self-emulsifying drug-delivery systems offer promising solutions. Future work should also explore biomarker-driven studies and potential synergistic effects in combination therapies. By integrating formulation science, clinical pharmacology, and neuroscience, the therapeutic potential of β-caryophyllene and xanthohumol could be fully realized, paving the way for novel strategies in neurodegenerative disease management. 3. Materials and Methods The literature search aimed to identify studies investigating β-caryophyllene and xanthohumol as neuroprotective agents. The search strategy employed a combination of relevant keywords, including β-caryophyllene, xanthohumol, neuroprotective agents, neuroprotection, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, structure–activity relationship, drug-delivery systems, animal studies, cell culture studies and clinical trials. Only studies that specifically addressed NDDs and DDSs in relation to these two phytochemicals were considered eligible for inclusion. After the initial screening and removal of duplicates, the selected articles were read in full to confirm their relevance. 4. Conclusions Neurodegenerative diseases currently have no cure, but β-caryophyllene and xanthohumol show promise as natural therapeutic agents. Preclinical studies suggest BCP may effectively target Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis by activating the CB2 receptor and PPAR-γ, which modulate neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and blood–brain barrier integrity. It also reduces amyloid-β neurotoxicity and tau aggregation, although evidence for Alzheimer’s disease is less comprehensive. Conversely, XAN consistently demonstrates efficacy in Alzheimer’s models by inhibiting amyloid-β and tau aggregation, reducing excitotoxicity, activating the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway, and modulating cholinesterase activity. While both compounds share neuroprotective mechanisms, such as anti-inflammatory signaling and antioxidant defense, BCP primarily targets immune pathways, whereas XAN focuses on protein aggregation and redox balance, guiding disease-focused development. At present, BCP and XAN cannot yet be classified as established therapeutic drugs. Rather, they should be regarded as bioactive natural modulators with pronounced neuroprotective properties, holding promise as lead structures or precursors for rational drug design. While no pharmaceutical drug products based on these molecules have yet been registered, β-caryophyllene and xanthohumol are already available as dietary supplements, and the interest in them is steadily growing. This is further supported by the numerous studies in recent years aiming to confirm their efficacy and to develop suitable drug formulations that can enhance their pharmacokinetic characteristics. In this regard, polymer- and lipid-based nano- and microscale drug-delivery systems have emerged as particularly promising carriers for β-caryophyllene and xanthohumol. It is probably only a matter of time before these formulations successfully pass clinical trials and become effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Study Objectives Study Design Main Results Mechanism of Action Ref. To evaluate the protective effects of BCP against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in C6 glioma cells. Cells: C6 rat glioma cells (ATCC CCL-107). Treatments: Glu-induced cytotoxicity: Cells exposed to 0.05–10 mM Glu for 24 h. BCP co-administration: Glu (1 mM) + BCP (0.5–1 µM) for 1 or 24 h. BCP pretreatment: BCP (0.5–3 µM) for 24 h before Glu (1 mM) exposure. BCP inhibited ROS production and reestablished the mitochondrial membrane potential (CB2R/Nrf2 signaling pathway), which led to the prevention of C6 glioma cell line from Glu-induced cytotoxicity. BCP activated Nrf2 and improved antioxidant defenses, partly via CB2 receptor activation. [ 14 To investigate whether BCP promotes neuritogenesis independently of CB2 receptor activation. Cell lines: PC12 and SH-SY5Y. Treatment: PC12 cells treated with BCP (10–50 μM) ± NGF or K252a (TrkA inhibitor) for 72 h; SH-SY5Y cells treated with BCP (10 μM) ± retinoic acid for 72 h. BCP stimulated the process of neuritogenesis and synaptogenesis in PC12 cells through a mechanism that did not involve CB2 receptors. Activation of NGF-specific receptor trkA. Neuritogenesis and axonal protein upregulation, independent of CB2 or NGF expression. [ 15 To investigate whether trans-caryophyllene (TC) protects against Aβ1-42-induced neuroinflammation in microglial cells, relevant to AD. BV-2 microglial cells were pretreated with TC (10, 25, 50 μM) and then stimulated with Aβ1-42. Cytotoxicity, NO/PGE2 production, iNOS/COX-2 expression, pro-inflammatory cytokines, TLR4 expression, and NF-κB signaling were assessed. Pretreatment of BV2 microglial cells with BCP before Aβ stimulation resulted in inhibition of NO, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, as well as secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Activated overexpression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, nuclear translocation of p65, and transcriptional activity of NF-κB, induced by Aβ1-42 were reduced. - [ 16 To evaluate the neuroprotective effects of BCP against MPP+-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. SH-SY5Y cells were treated with MPP+ (50 μM) ± BCP (1 or 2.5 μM) for 24 h. BCP enhanced cell viability, reduced the release of lactic dehydrogenase, and decreased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). BCP protects via CB2R activation, reducing oxidative stress, preventing apoptosis, and modulating HO-1/JNK pathways. [ 17 To investigate the protective effects of BCP against LPS-induced oligodendrocyte toxicity and the involvement of CB2, Nrf2, PPAR-γ, and SMase pathways. OLN-93 oligodendrocyte cells treated with LPS; BCP tested at low (0.2–1 μM) and high (10–50 μM) concentrations; effects on ROS, NO, TNF-α, GSH, and signaling pathways were measured; SMase inhibitors (imipramine, fluoxetine) tested for synergy. The protective effects of BCP are mediated through the CB2 receptor in different pathways at high and low concentrations. BCP prevented the increased production of nitric oxide (NO), ROS, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α). BCP protects oligodendrocytes via CB2 activation, modulating Nrf2/HO-1 (low dose) and PPAR-γ (high dose), with additional benefit from SMase inhibition. [ 18 To evaluate the protective effects of BCP, a selective CB2 agonist, on LPS-induced microglial inflammation and M1/M2 imbalance and to identify signaling pathways involved (CB2, PPAR-γ, SMase). Cells: Primary microglia isolated from adult C57BL/6 mice. Treatments: BCP dose-response: 0.2–25 µM or JWH-133 (1 µM) ± LPS (1 µg/mL) for 24 h. CB2 involvement: Pre-incubation with AM630 (1 µM) 30 min before BCP/JWH-133 + LPS. A low concentration of BCP showed selective anti-inflammatory activity. BCP modulated microglia and could affect neuroinflammatory conditions and microglial cells. - [ 19 To evaluate the anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of Viphyllin, a standardized BCP extract, in macrophages and neuronal cells under oxidative stress. Cells: RAW 264.7 (macrophages), SH-SY5Y (neuroblastoma). Viability: RAW 264.7: 5–50 μg/mL Viphyllin, 24 h; SH-SY5Y: 12–24 μg/mL Viphyllin ± H 2 2 Regulated LPS-mediated inflammation in macrophages and exerted an antiapoptotic effect against neuronal damage induced by H 2 2 Anti-inflammatory effects via MAPK pathway inhibition and neuroprotection through anti-apoptotic modulation under oxidative stress. [ 20 To investigate whether BCP exerts neuroprotection in an AD cell model. PC-12 cells overexpressing amyloid-β precursor protein. Groups: control, empty vector, APP overexpression, and BCP (5, 10, 20 μM). BCP enhanced the viability of PC-12 cells while protecting cell morphology and counteracted the neurotoxic effects of amyloid-β. BCP protects neurons by inhibiting the JAK2-STAT3-BACE1 signaling pathway, reducing Aβ-induced toxicity. [ 21 To evaluate whether α-asarone and BCP can inhibit tau fibrillation, disassemble tau fibrils, and protect neuronal cells against tau-induced toxicity. Tau aggregation and fibrillation were assessed using SDS-PAGE, AFM, ThT/ANS fluorescence, and β-sheet content analysis; SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to 5 μM tau samples treated with α-asarone or BCP for 24 h. BCP inhibited tau fibrillation and aggregation, leading to the formation of various structural and morphological intermediate species. BCP enhanced cell viability. - [ 22 To investigate the neuroprotective effects of BCP against rotenone-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. In silico: molecular docking of BCP with GSK-3β, NRF2, HO-1. In vitro: SH-SY5Y cells pretreated with rotenone. BCP (100 µg/mL) tested for effects. BCP increased cell viability, reduced ROS levels, and altered cellular pathways associated with inflammation, redox processes, and apoptosis. BCP protects cells by modulating the GSK-3β/NRF2/HO-1 axis, reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. [ 23 To evaluate the immunomodulatory and therapeutic effects of BCP in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Splenocytes from MS-induced C57BL/6 mice treated with BCP (4, 20, 40 μM) were assessed in vitro. In vivo, MS-mice received oral BCP (25 or 50 mg/kg/day). In vitro and in vivo BCP inhibited the production of NO, H2O2, TNF- α, and Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). BCP administered orally at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day showed a reduction in the number of inflammatory infiltrates and attenuated neurological damage in the CNS. - [ 24 To evaluate the anxiolytic, antioxidant, and toxicity effects of BCP in vitro and in vivo. Swiss albino mice were tested for anxiolytic activity using elevated plus-maze, rota-rod, light/dark, and hiding sphere models. BCP—10, 25, and 50 mg/kg, intraperitoneally. Antioxidant activity was assessed via DPPH, ABTS, and S. cerevisiae BCP exerted dose-dependent anxiolytic and antioxidant effects on experimental animals. It has not shown toxicity in A. salina S. cerevisiae - [ 25 To evaluate whether BCP prevents cognitive decline and neuroinflammation in an APP/PS1 Alzheimer’s disease model and to determine the roles of CB2 and PPARγ pathways. APP/PS1 transgenic mice received oral BCP (BCP—16, 48, or 144 mg/kg, orally, 10 weeks). CB2 (AM630) and PPARγ (GW9662) antagonists were used to confirm pathway involvement. BCP exhibited anti-inflammatory activity, related to the activation of CB2 and PPARγ receptors, which resulted in enhanced memory and cognitive function, a decrease in β-amyloid accumulation, and the suppression of gliosis, as well as the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. BCP exerts effects through CB2 receptor activation and subsequent engagement of the PPARγ pathway. [ 26 To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of BCP against rotenone-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in a rat model of PD. Male Wistar rats. BCP administered once daily for 4 weeks at 50 mg/kg body weight prior to rotenone challenge (2.5 mg/kg body weight). BCP restored dopaminergic neurons, reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and inflammatory mediators, restored antioxidant enzymes, and prevented lipid peroxidation and the depletion of glutathione. - [ 27 To investigate the neuroprotective effects and mechanisms of BCP in an MPTP-induced murine model of PD. PD induce mice model: BCP 10 mg/kg, 5 days (i.p. or oral). BCP improved motor function, protected dopaminergic neurons, reduced glial activation, and lowered inflammatory cytokines via CB2R. - [ 28 To investigate the therapeutic effects of BCP on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a murine model of multiple sclerosis, and to explore the underlying immunomodulatory mechanisms. C57BL/6 mice were treated with BCP (25 or 50 mg/kg, twice a day, orally). The immunomodulatory effect of BCP is associated with the inhibition of microglial cells, CD4+ T-lymphocytes, CD8+ T-lymphocytes, and protein expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. BCP reduced axonal demyelination and modulated the Th1/Treg immune balance. Neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects are mediated via CB2 receptor activation. [ 29 To evaluate the effects of a β-caryophyllene–hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD/BCP) inclusion complex on cognitive deficits in a vascular dementia rat model and to investigate underlying mechanisms. VD rats were treated i.p. for 4 weeks with HPβCD/BCP (16–144 mg/kg), AM630 (3 mg/kg), or saline. HPβCD/BCP reduced cognitive impairment and nerve fiber loss, enhanced cerebral blood flow, and inhibited neuronal cell death in rats. BCP demonstrated its neuroprotective properties by stimulating the CB2 pathway. [ 30 To assess the effects of BCP on IL-17, transcription factors (T-bet, GATA-3), and remyelination in mice as a model of MS. EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice and treated with BCP (25 or 50 mg/kg/day) by gavage from day 10 post-induction. CNS tissue was analyzed after 9 days of treatment for cytokines, transcription factors, and remyelination. BCP administered at a daily dose of 50 mg/kg resulted in reduced levels of IL-17 in the brain, medulla, and cerebellum; a reduction in T-bet was observed in both the medulla and cerebellum, while GATA-3 levels increased in the cerebellum. Anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects via modulation of Th1/Th17 (T-bet/IL-17) and Th2 (GATA-3) responses. [ 31 To evaluate the neuroprotective effects of BCP against dementia induced by neuroinflammation and aging in animal models. Male SD rats: AlCl 3 At a dosage of 100 mg/kg, BCP had a protective activity against dementia caused by neuroinflammation but did not influence neuronal aging related to mitochondrial dysfunction. - [ 32 To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of BCP against MPTP-induced Parkinsonism. Male C57BL/6J mice; 4 groups: 1. saline control, 2. MPTP (5 mg/kg i.p. × 7 days), 3. BCP (10 mg/kg p.o. × 7 days), 4. MPTP + BCP (BCP from day 4 onward, 7 days). BCP inhibited oxidative stress-induced cell death of dopaminergic neurons and simultaneously increased the expression and enzymatic activity of NQO1. - [ 33 To evaluate the protective effects of low-dose BCP in an EAE mouse model of MS and explore its CB2-dependent immunomodulatory mechanisms. Female C57BL/6 mice were immunized with MOG 35–55 Low doses of BCP influenced EAE, which is a chronic model for MS. The protective impacts of BCP are facilitated by the CB2 receptor. BCP modulated the adaptive (lymphocytes) and innate (microglia) immune systems from an inflammatory (Th1/Th17/M1) to an anti-inflammatory (Th2/Treg/M2) phase. Protective effects were CB2 receptor–dependent. [ 34 To evaluate the neuroprotective effects of BCP on dopaminergic neurons. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups: Sham, 6-OHDA, BCP (10 mg/kg, oral, 5 days), and 6-OHDA + BCP. BCP was administered orally either alone or after 6-OHDA. Treatment with BCP improved motor dysfunction; exhibited a neuroprotective effect on dopaminergic neurons; and decreased expression levels of NLRP3, caspase-1, and malondialdehyde (MDA). BCP protects dopaminergic neurons by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation and reducing oxidative stress. [ 35 To test whether CB2 receptor agonism via BCP can correct blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability in the MPTP mouse model of PD. MPTP-induced PD mouse model (male C57BL/6J); 4 groups n BCP reduced the permeability of the BBB, likely by altering the expression of TJ proteins and decreasing oxidative stress levels. BCP activation of CB2 reduces BBB disruption and oxidative stress, protecting dopaminergic neurons. [ 36 To determine the effect of BCP supplementation on cognitive function and quality of life in older adults with memory complaints. Prospective, randomized 8-week trial; 52 participants (mean age 67 ± 5 years, classified obese by BMI); randomized to receive BCP 90 mg ( n n BCP is suggested to improve cognitive function in an elderly population. – [ 37 molecules-30-03702-t002_Table 2 Table 2 In vitro and in vivo studies on the neuroprotective potential of xanthohumol.

[ 48 Identify XAN analogues that activate Nrf2 and protect against oxidative stress in neurodegeneration. PC12 cell model, H 2 2 Two analogues with removed prenyl group showed low toxicity and rescued cells from oxidative injury. Activation of Nrf2 pathway via nuclear translocation and protection abolished by Nrf2 knockdown. [ 49 Investigate neuroprotective effects of XAN and quercetin against corticosterone-induced cytotoxicity in cortical cells. Primary cortical cultures from postnatal day 1 Sprague Dawley male rats were prepared. Quercetin (0.03–3 µM) and XAN (0.2–5 µM) were added for 24 h, then replaced with 200 µM corticosterone for 96 h. Both polyphenols prevented corticosterone-induced loss of cell viability and restored Bdnf mRNA levels. XAN neuroprotection is mediated via Nrf2 activation. [ 50 Assess hops and XAN effects on oxidative stress and adenosine receptors. C6 and SH-SY5Y cells treated with 500 μL hops extracts, XAN 10–100 μM, and/or 50 μM H 2 2 Hops reversed oxidative stress-induced cell death; XAN did not but modulated adenosine receptors. Modulation of adenosine A1 and A2 receptors. [ 51 Investigate how XAN and related prenylflavonoids interact with Aβ1-42 oligomers to modulate amyloid aggregation. Structural and molecular analysis of prenylflavonoids with Aβ1-42 and evaluation of anti-amyloidogenic properties at molecular level. XAN is tested with 0.5 μM, 0.15 mM and without defined concentrations. XAN strongly inhibited Aβ1-42 aggregation at low concentrations, stabilized amorphous aggregates, and prevented β-sheet fibril formation. XAN forms stable complexes with Aβ1-42 oligomers via conformational flexibility, redirecting aggregation toward less toxic forms. [ 52 Investigate the effect of XAN on the adenosinergic pathway, potentially involved in AD pathology. Cell culture study using C6 (rat glioma) and SH-SY5Y (human neuroblastoma) cells treated with 10 µM XAN. XAN may protect against AD by enhancing A1 receptor-mediated inhibition of excitotoxicity and modulating adenosine metabolism. XAN increased A1 receptor levels. No effect on A2A receptors or adenylate cyclase activity. CD73 (5′-nucleotidase) significantly decreased in C6 cells. [ 53 Investigate the neuroprotective effects of XAN in rats with MCAO-induced cerebral ischemia. Rats were treated with XAN (0.2–0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) 10 min before MCAO. Reduced infarct size and improved neurobehavior. Suppressed HIF-1α, TNF-α, iNOS, and caspase-3 expression. Inhibited platelet aggregation and hydroxyl radical formation. [ 54 Investigate the neuroprotective effects of XAN on age-related brain inflammation and apoptosis. Male SAMP8 mice (aging model) treated with XAN (1 or 5 mg/kg/day) for 30 days and comparisons made with young/old SAMR1 controls. Anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, and preservation of synaptic markers suggest XAN protects against aging-induced neurodegeneration. XAN reduced expression of pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1β) and pro-apoptotic (AIF, BAD, BAX) markers. A dose of 5 mg/kg restored synaptic proteins (BDNF, synapsin, and synaptophysin). [ 55 Investigate the neuroprotective effects of XAN in ischemic stroke. Male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into sham, MCAO, and XAN (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) groups (n = 12). MCAO and XAN groups underwent 60 min middle cerebral artery occlusion with 24 h reperfusion; sham rats had surgery without occlusion. XAN reduced brain infarct size, improved neurological function, and reduced oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis. Inhibition of p38-MAPK phosphorylation and activation of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant response. [ 56 Assess the protective effects of XAN against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to 6 groups: control, XAN 10 or 50 mg/kg, kainic acid (KA) 15 mg/kg, and XAN + KA. XAN was given i.p. 30 min before KA. Seizures were monitored for 4 h. XAN reduced KA-induced seizures, glutamate elevation, and neuronal death in the CA3 region of the hippocampus. XAN upregulated mitochondrial fusion protein Mfn-2 and antiapoptotic Bcl-2, inhibited Apaf-1 and caspase-3 activation, preserving mitochondrial function and promoting neuron survival. [ 57 Evaluate the protective effects of XAN against LPS-induced depressive-like behaviors via neuroinflammation and oxidative stress pathways. Mice were pretreated with XAN (10/20 mg/kg) before LPS (1 mg/kg) induction, behavior tests. XAN reduced neuroinflammation. XAN activates Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidant pathway and inhibits NF-κB signaling. [ 58 Assess whether XAN improves memory. Male APP/PS1 and 10 C57BL/6J mice, divided into 5 groups: CON, APP/PS1, APP/PS1 + NAC (100 mg/kg), APP/PS1 + XAN-L (30 mg/kg), APP/PS1 + XAN-H (90 mg/kg) for 6 days/week for 2 months. XAN improved memory performance, increased SOD, reduced IL-6 and IL-1β, decreased hippocampal Aβ deposition, and promoted autophagy and anti-apoptotic signals. It shows anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Activation of mTOR/LC3 (autophagy) and Bax/Bcl-2 (apoptosis inhibition) pathways. [ 59 Examine how XAN modulates gut microbiota and cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice as a potential AD treatment. APP/PS1 and C57 WT mice; preventive (2-month-old) and therapeutic (6-month-old) studies; 4 groups per study: WT + corn oil, WT + XAN (5 mg/kg), APP/PS1 + corn oil, APP/PS1 + XAN (5 mg/kg) for 90 days. XAN shows protective role in regulating gut microbiome composition and metabolism in an animal model of AD. - [ 60 Investigate how XAN repairs cognitive impairment caused by estrogen deprivation. Thirty C57BL/6J female mice divided in 5 groups: sham-operated, OVX + saline (vehicle), and OVX + xanthohumol at 10, 25, or 50 mg/kg. XAN was administered intraperitoneally every 2 days. XAN improved learning and memory in OVX mice; miR-532-3p was downregulated, and Mpped1 expression was restored; overexpression of Mpped1 improved cognition. XAN inhibits miR-532-3p, thereby restoring Mpped1 expression in the hippocampus to reverse cognitive impairment. [ 61 Evaluate the neuroprotective effects of HLE and XAN against iron-induced nerve damage. Male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to 8 groups: control, iron dextran plus vehicle, iron dextran + humic acid (0.1 mg/kg/day), iron dextran + N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg/day), iron dextran + low-dose hawthorn leaf extract (3 g/kg/day), iron dextran + high-dose hawthorn leaf extract (9 g/kg/day), iron dextran + low-dose XAN (30 mg/kg/day), and iron dextran + high-dose XAN (90 mg/kg/day). HLE and XAN improved memory, reduced oxidative stress, and increased antioxidant enzyme activity. Activation of AKT/GSK3β and Nrf2/NQO1/HO-1 signaling pathways. [ 62 Explore how XAN prevents memory loss in AD. APP/PS1 mice: wild-type, Alzheimer’s disease model (AD), or AD + XAN, 0.5 mg/kg groups for 90 days. Inhibited excitotoxicity, enhanced mitochondrial function, regulated systemic glutamate. Reduced excitatory receptor expression, boosted ATP and mitophagy, lowered glutamate levels. [ 63 Explore the preventive and therapeutic mechanisms of XAN in AD using metabolite analysis. APP/PS1 mice. Animals received XAN (5 mg/kg, gavage, every other day, 90 days), corn oil (vehicle), or memantine (5 mg/kg, positive control). XAN improved cognition in older mice. XAN influences cognition via endogenous metabolite regulation. [ 64 Identify therapeutic targets of different XAN doses in early Alzheimer’s using proteomics and microbiomics. APP/PS1 mice Treated with 0.5 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg XAN. 0.5 mg/kg XAN improved memory, neurogenesis and reduced inflammation. XAN modulates neurodegeneration pathways and gut microbiota. Low dose may optimize brain–gut signaling and cognitive benefits. [ 65 Improve oral bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of XAN for AD. AD was induced by AlCl 3 Enhancements in cognitive and motor performance, along with decreased levels of AChE, Aβ, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. - [ 66 molecules-30-03702-t004_Table 4 Table 4 Clinical trials on β-caryophyllene and xanthohumol (clinicaltrials.gov).
