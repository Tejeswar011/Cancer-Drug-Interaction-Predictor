Introduction Edible insects are increasingly recognized as a sustainable source of protein, offering high nutritional value with a lower environmental footprint. Compared to conventional livestock, they require substantially less land, water, and feed and emit fewer greenhouse gases [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Protaetia brevitarsis seulensis 10 11 12 Pharmacological studies have reported that ethanol extracts of P. brevitarsis 13 14 15 16 Despite increasing interest in its pharmacological effects and industrial potential, chemical studies on P. brevitarsis 17 18 P. brevitarsis 19 In this study, we isolated a primary constituent from P. brevitarsis P. brevitarsis P. brevitarsis 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. General Experimental Procedures For column chromatography (CC), normal-phase silica gel (Kieselgel 60, 70–230, and 230–400 mesh; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) was used. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on pre-coated silica gel 60 F 254 254 v v 2 4 Medium-pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) was carried out on an Isolera One system fitted with SNAP KP-SIL and SNAP Ultra C18 cartridges (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden). Recycling preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (Recycling preparative HPLC) was performed using an LC-9130G NEXT instrument equipped with a JAI GEL-GS310 column (20 × 500 mm; Japan Analytical Industry Co., Tokyo, Japan). Proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were obtained using a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz spectrometer ( 1 13 EP-grade solvents used for extraction, fractionation, and isolation were obtained from DAEJUNG Chemicals & Metals Co., Ltd. (Siheung, Republic of Korea). HPLC- and MS-grade methanol (MeOH), acetonitrile (ACN), water, and formic acid (FA) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA, USA).

Isolation of the Major Compound Preliminary HPLC screening of the P. brevitarsis Scheme 1 n n n n n 3 v v 2 v v 2 v v The structural elucidation of the isolated major compound was performed using 1 13 3 J L-Tryptophan: 11 12 2 2 m z + 1 2 δ J J J J J J 13 2 δ 2.4. Preparation of Standard Solutions and Samples A stock solution of the standard compound was prepared by dissolving it in MeOH to a concentration of 1000 μg/mL. For sample preparation, PBE and PBE-B were dissolved in MeOH at final concentrations of 20 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL, respectively. Prior to analysis, all solutions were filtered through a 0.22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) syringe filter (Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany). 2.5. Chromatographic Conditions Quantitative analysis of L-tryptophan in the PBE and PBE-B samples was performed using a Thermo Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped with a binary pump, auto-sampler, column oven, and diode array detector (DAD). Chromatographic data were collected and processed using the Chromeleon™ 7 chromatography data system (version 7.2.2.6394; Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). Chromatographic separation was carried out on a Thermo Acclaim™ Polar Advantage II column (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The column temperature was maintained at 30 °C, and the injection volume was set to 5 µL. UV detection was performed at 280 nm. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% ( v v The chromatographic method was validated in accordance with ICH (Q2) guidelines. Standard solutions of L-tryptophan were subsequently diluted in MeOH to obtain final concentrations of 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 μg/mL. Calibration curves for the quantification of L-tryptophan were prepared using these standards. Linearity over this range was evaluated by calculating the correlation coefficient (r 2 y ax b y x 3. Results and Discussion 3.1.

Isolation and Structural Characterization Chromatographic separation of PBE-B (6.81 g) by VLC on silica gel yielded six fractions (A–F), among which fraction E was further separated by MPLC to yield three sub-fractions (EA–EC). Subsequent purification of sub-fraction EB by recycling preparative HPLC yielded a single compound (70.0 mg), corresponding to the major peak previously observed in the PBE-B fraction. NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the chemical structure of the isolated compound. The 1H NMR spectrum (400 MHz, D 2 Figures S5 and S6 17 Figure 1 3.3. Optimization of HPLC Conditions for Quantitative Analysis Prior to establishing the optimized analytical conditions, the identity of the isolated compound was confirmed by comparing its retention time and UV spectrum with those of the L-tryptophan reference standard using HPLC-DAD analysis. These results are shown in Figure 2 Optimized HPLC-DAD conditions for the quantification of L-tryptophan in PBE were established as follows: To improve chromatographic resolution, 0.1% ( v v 20 3.4. Quantitative Determination of L-Tryptophan in PBE The developed method enabled accurate quantification and reliable identification of the marker compound in PBE. As shown in Figure 2 t R As shown in Table 1 2 Table 1 21 22 The analyte was clearly detected without interference, and the results demonstrated\nhigh reproducibility across replicates. 4.
