See: https://creativecommons.org/Licenses/by-nc/4.0/ BACKGROUND Although gastroscopy is a commonly used diagnostic and therapeutic technique, postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction is prone to occur. Traditional Chinese medicine theory suggests that postoperative gastrointestinal disorders are related to spleen and stomach weakness. This study hypothesizes that the combination of acupoint application at the Ziwu Liuzhu acupoint and percutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation can promote postoperative gastrointestinal function recovery and alleviate stress reactions. AIM To investigate the effects of acupoint application of Ziwu Liuzhu combined with percutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation on postoperative gastrointestinal function recovery and stress response in patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy surgery. METHODS A total of 120 patients who underwent gastroscopy surgery were selected and treated between October 2024 and January 2025. This study used a stratified block randomization method, and then allocated groups using computer-generated random number sequences (SAS 9.4 software). The groups were divided into two groups: A control group of 60 patients who received routine postoperative intervention measures, and an observation group of 60 patients who received acupuncture point application combined with transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation therapy. The therapeutic effects were compared after 3 days of treatment. RESULTS The mean time of first defecation was 3.20 ± 1.04 days, the mean first eating time was 2.55 ± 0.72 days, and the mean length of hospital stay was 5.57 ± 0.09 days ( P P P CONCLUSION The combination of percutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation in gastroscopy patients has been demonstrated to be both highly safe and effective. The benefits of this approach include the promotion of postoperative gastrointestinal function, the reduction of stress response, the attainment of optimal results, and the enhancement of patient satisfaction.

Despite the remarkable efficacy of this technology, as evidenced by the increasing volume of related research[ 1 2 Conventional Western medicine has been demonstrated to alleviate symptoms, but the overall efficacy of this approach is not optimal. From the perspective of Chinese medicine, postoperative gastrointestinal disorders are classified as 'intestinal paralysis' or 'intestinal knot', primarily resulting from deficiencies in the spleen and stomach, innate endowment insufficiency, gastrointestinal chemotaxis and disharmony, and flatulence[ 3 4 Acupressure is a simple, non-invasive, cost-effective Chinese medicine technology that can promote the operation of qi and blood, harmonise the functions of the internal organs, and help the spleen and stomach return to normal physiological function[ 5 6 7 MATERIALS AND METHODS General materials Through previous pre-experiments, the difference in first defecation time between the two groups was 0.8 days (3.98 ± 1.12 days vs t d  Inclusion criteria:  Exclusion criteria: Research methods The control group would undergo the conventional postoperative intervention. In the context of tracheal general anaesthesia, the urinary catheter was removed either six hours or the following day after the operation. Moreover, patients were encouraged to move around as soon as possible. For patients undergoing transoral small enteroscopy and gastric mucosal dissection surgery for early gastric cancer, it is necessary to prolong the retention time of the gastric tube, usually 1-3 days. The bleeding situation must be observed and the patient must be kept fasting for 48-72 hours. Following the resumption of diet, a gradual transition from fluid to solid food is required. Commencing from the first postoperative day, acupoint plastering was administered to Shenque, Zhongkou, Tianshu, and Shusanli, with the group formula comprising Qingpi, Houpu, and raw rhubarb, which were proportionally modulated. The formula was then transformed into a medicinal ointment, with the addition of Huangjiu, and administered four times per day for three consecutive days. This was accompanied by clockwise abdominal massage, two times per day, with each session comprising 20-30 Laps. Observation group in the control group on the basis of joint Meridian flow injection acupoints paste treatment, according to the Meridian flow injection points, opening and closing time, formula preparation: Qingpi, thick park, raw rhubarb according to the ratio of 2:2:1 grinding, plus yellow wine modulation into a thick paste, each paste contains 0.3 g/cm², made of 3 cm × 3 cm paste. Hour selection basis: According to the theory of Meridian flow injection, the spleen Meridian seasonal hour for the Si time (9:00-11:00), this time the spleen Meridian qi and blood is the most prosperous, stimulate the Shenque (Ren vein), in the epigastric (stomach collection point), the center of the sky (intestinal collection point), foot Sanli (joint point) can maximize “cultivate the earth to generate gold” effect. Stomach Meridian seasonal time for the hour (7:00-9:00), double hour stimulation in line with the “spleen rise stomach fall” physiological characteristics, combined with bilateral foot Sanli percutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation, the use of QX265-type therapeutic instrument, bilateral foot Sanli input symmetrical biphasic square wave, frequency 2/100 Hz alternating, the current intensity from 1 mA incremental to the patient's tolerance threshold (an average of 3.5 ± 0.8 mA), each time! Each treatment consisted of 5 minutes of basic stimulation + 25 minutes of rhythmic modulation, the treatment time was 30 minutes. the current was gradually transitioned from weak to strong, until the patient felt an obvious sense of tremor in the local area, and the treatment was continuous for 3 days. Observation indicators  The following three observation indicators were considered: Evaluation of therapeutic efficacy An excellent rate was defined as an excellent rate in conjunction with a good rate. Postoperative outcomes are categorised as follows: (1) Excellent: Return of normal bowel sounds within one day of surgery, with no complications, fever or discomfort after resumption of eating or drinking; (2) Good: Defecation within two days of resumption of eating after surgery, mild abdominal distension, weakened bowel sounds, reflux and acid reflux symptoms after eating or drinking, which can be alleviated by bedside activities or self-massage of the abdomen, and low-grade fever; and (3) Poor: Postoperative complications, including but not limited to hyperthermia, bleeding, and perforation, as well as bowel sounds of 0-2 beats per minute, still require fasting, gastrointestinal decompression, and abdominal distension is obvious after drinking water or no bowel movement after resumption of food for > 2 days[ 8 Statistical analysis The statistical analysis of the data was conducted using SPSS 22.0 software. The count data were expressed as a percentage [ n χ 2 t P RESULTS The results of the study revealed no statistically significant differences between the two groups with regard to gender, age, weight, operation time, and disease diagnosis ( P 1 Table 1 General information, n  Group   n  Gender  Age (years)  Weight (kg)  Operation time (minute)  Disease diagnosis  Male  Female  Gastric lesions  Colorectal lesions  Esophageal lesions Observation group 60 37 (61.67) 23 (38.33) 56.93 ± 11.88 59.98 ± 6.35 54.85 ± 6.66 36 (60.00) 13 (21.67) 11 (18.33) Control group 60 28 (46.67) 32 (53.33) 55.85 ± 12.89 59.70 ± 6.38 55.42 ± 40 (66.67) 14 (23.33) 6 (10.00)  χ 2 t - 2.719 0.479 0.244 0.512 1.718  P - 0.099 0.633 0.808 0.610 0.424 Comparison of improvement in symptoms There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to the time of recovery of bowel sounds and the time of first defecation ( P P 2 Table 2 Improvement in symptoms  Group   n  Recovery of bowel sounds  The time of first defecation  The first bowel movement  First feeding time  Hospitalisation time Observation group 60 1.55 ± 0.57 1.87 ± 0.50 3.20 ± 1.04 2.55 ± 0.72 5.57 ± 0.89 Control group 60 1.65 ± 0.52 1.93 ± 0.36 3.98 ± 1.27 2.96 ± 0.82 6.30 ± 1.45  t - 1.013 0.833 3.701 2.894 3.333  P - 0.313 0.406 0.001 0.005 0.001 Levels of gastrin expression Prior to the commencement of treatment, no statistically significant disparities in gastrin levels were observed between the two groups ( P P 3 Table 3 Expression levels of gastrin  Group   n  Gastrin (pg/mL)  Before treatment  After 3 days of treatment Observers 60 241.65 ± 25.61 161.15 ± 16.75 Control group 60 240.86 ± 26.84 205.33 ± 18.64  t - 0.165 13.655  P - 0.869 < 0.001 Excellent rate The excellent rate of the observation group was found to be higher than that of the control group ( P 4 Table 4 Excellent rate in both groups, n  Group   n  Excellent  Good  Poor  Excellent rate Observation group 60 40 (66.67) 16 (26.67) 4 (6.67) 56 (93.33) Control group 60 30 (50.00) 15 (25.00) 15 (25.00) 45 (75.00)  χ 2 - 7.566  P - 0.006 Total satisfaction rate of patients The total satisfaction rate of patients in the observation group was higher than that of the control group ( P 5 Table 5 Total satisfaction rate of patients in the two groups, n  Group   n  Very satisfied  Satisfied  Generally dissatisfied  Unsatisfied  Overall satisfaction rate Observation group 60 32 (53.33) 23 (38.33) 5 (8.33) 0 (0.00) 55 (91.67) Control group 60 25 (41.67) 16 (26.67) 18 (30) 1 (1.67) 41 (68.33)  χ 2 - 10.208  P - 0.001 Postoperative stress reaction Prior to treatment, there was no statistically significant difference in stress reaction levels between the two groups ( P rd P 6 Table 6 Postoperative stress in two groups of patients  Group   n  Norepinephrine (pg/mL)  Cortisol (μg/L)  Aldosterone (pg/mL)  Before treatment  After 3 days of treatment  Before treatment  After 3 days of treatment  Before treatment  After 3 days of treatment Observation group 60 256.64 ± 23.32 125.53 ± 17.78 275.32 ± 32.65 142.16 ± 19.55 68.64 ± 9.61 51.14 ± 5.39 Control group 60 256.79 ± 23.41 176.33 ± 19.85 275.76 ± 32.48 196.08 ± 17.44 68.71 ± 9.22 68.83 ± 4.47  t - 0.035 14.766 0.074 15.942 0.041 19.569  P - 0.972 < 0.001 0.941 < 0.001 0.968 < 0.001 Postoperative complications In the observation group, there were 4 cases of fever, 5 cases of abdominal distension and nausea, 0 cases of perforation, and 1 case of haemorrhage in the postoperative period, totalling 16.67% (10/60); in the control group, there were 8 cases of fever, 10 cases of abdominal distension and nausea, 2 cases of perforation (including intraoperative), and 3 cases of haemorrhage in the postoperative period, totalling 38.33% (23/60).

DISCUSSION Gastroenteroscopy is indicated for a wide range of abdominal diseases and has become the preferred option for a wide range of such diseases as the surgical modality continues to be refined and improved. Despite the notable efficacy of this approach, post-surgical signs of gastrointestinal dysfunction have been observed in some patients[ 9 10 11 In the context of TCM, postoperative gastrointestinal impairment falls within the diagnostic category of 'depression' and 'abdominal pain'. These symptoms can arise due to a variety of factors, including spleen dysfunction and the reversal of yin and yang. The liver's loss of excretion, and the lack of ascension of clear Yang, result in loss of moistening. This, in turn, leads to weakness of the spleen and stomach, and abdominal organ qi rebellion. These factors contribute to abnormalities in the function of the stomach and intestines[ 12 13 14 The results of this study showed that gastrin improved in both groups after treatment compared with the pre-intervention period in the same group, which may be related to the enhancement of the release of acetylcholine and vasoactive intestinal peptide from the mesenteric plexus of the enteric nervous system induced by electroacupuncture stimulation[ 15 16 via 17 18 19 20 As demonstrated in some studies, surgery, as a potent stressor, instigates the body's stress response, stimulates the excitation of the sympathetic nervous system, releases norepinephrine, and elevates aldosterone, thereby exerting a certain impact on postoperative recovery. While analyzing the present results, both groups showed better improvement in postoperative stress response after treatment than before intervention in the same group, which was consistent with the mechanism that electrical stimulation activates the solitary tract nucleus-medullary vagal complex pathway and inhibits excessive activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The improvement of norepinephrine, cortisol, and aldosterone in the observation group was better than that in the control group 3 days after treatment. According to the principles of TCM, the application of Meridian flow injection acupoint application can promote the flow of qi and blood, regulate the function of internal organs, and thus improve the stress state of the organism by conforming to the physiological rhythm of qi and blood circulation in the human body. This process involves the stimulation of local acupoints and Meridian conduction. Acupoint application can regulate the nutritional balance of the organism and affect the excitatory parasympathetic function. The application of acupoints has been demonstrated to regulate the nutritional balance of the body, affect the excitation of parasympathetic nerves and inhibit nerve excitation[ 21 CONCLUSION In summary, Meridian flow injection acupoint taping combined with TAES is more able to play a synergistic role, and is used in gastroenteroscopy patients with significant effects, effectively promoting gastrointestinal mucosal damage repair, improving gastric dynamics, reducing the traumatic stress response, and improving the clinical efficacy. However, there are some shortcomings in this study. Firstly, as a single-center study, the sample size was only 120 cases and the follow-up period was only 3d, so the short-term observation may cover up the delayed changes of stress hormones, which could not fully reflect the long-term efficacy; secondly, there was no separate acupressure or transcutaneous electrical stimulation group for control, so the long-term effect has not yet been demonstrated, which needs to be explored through more high-quality studies in the future.
