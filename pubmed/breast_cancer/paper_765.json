Neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that breast cancer-related pain is associated with specific brain alterations, including changes in activation, connectivity, and structure of pain-processing regions. This review synthesizes findings on functional and structural brain changes related to chronic pain in breast cancer and compares them with non-cancer chronic pain patterns. By integrating recent evidence, it proposes a conceptual framework to advance the understanding of pain mechanisms and supports personalized pain management strategies to improve quality of life.

Despite the high prevalence of breast cancer-related pain, critical gaps remain in the systematic characterization of its neuroimaging signatures, the distinction from non-cancer chronic pain mechanisms, and the clinical translation of neuroimaging findings. This review aims to bridge these gaps by analyzing current evidence to enhance the clinical understanding of the underlying neural mechanisms and to support the development of personalized pain management strategies. In addition, these findings may offer translational insights for understanding pain mechanisms in other cancer types. The methodological framework of this review aligns with standard neuroimaging workflows used in chronic pain research among breast cancer survivors. Figure 1 Figure 1 Illustrates the study design framework commonly used in neuroimaging investigations of chronic pain among breast cancer survivors. The workflow includes participant recruitment and group allocation (MBSR vs control), neuroimaging acquisition (resting-state fMRI, DTI), data preprocessing, and multi-level analysis of functional connectivity, gray matter volume (GMV), and white matter integrity (FA). Breast Cancer Pain Pain affects most breast cancer patients during their illness, 17 18 19 20 Cancer-related pain develops through several mechanisms: the primary tumor invading surrounding tissues, metastatic spread to distant sites, or nerve compression. Treatment interventions like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation can also induce pain by damaging tissues or nerves. 21 22 23 The ICD-11 classification system identifies seven chronic pain subtypes, including chronic cancer-related pain, chronic neuropathic pain, and chronic post-surgical pain. 24 25 Chronic Pain and Brain Function Brain Activation Pain is a complex, conscious experience involving both sensory processing and emotional appraisal, as described by Baliki et al. 26 27 28 29 30 Mioduszewski & Hatchard’s fMRI study 31 The MBSR intervention produced significant neural changes, including reduced activation in visual (precuneus, lingual gyrus), temporal (middle temporal gyrus), frontal (middle/inferior frontal gyri), and sensory (postcentral gyrus) processing areas, along with decreased activity in left hemisphere pain-modulation regions (ACC (the anterior cingulate cortex), MCC (middle cingulate cortex)). These findings, measured pre-intervention and 2-week post-intervention while controlling for medication effects through the stabilization period, demonstrate MBSR’s capacity to induce beneficial functional reorganization in pain-processing circuits. The study’s optimized minimization randomization and blinded design strengthen the evidence for these intervention-specific neural changes in breast cancer survivors with treatment-resistant neuropathic pain. Functional Connection Chronic pain involves significant central nervous system reorganization. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies consistently show altered functional connectivity (FC) in chronic pain patients, which can be broadly categorized into intra-network and inter-network changes. 32 33 34 35 The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is a key hub of the default mode network (DMN), critical for cognitive integration and consciousness regulation. 36 37 38 39 The findings demonstrate MBSR’s capacity to selectively modulate PCC connectivity patterns, ie, strengthening integration within cognitive-emotional networks while reducing sensorimotor system coupling. This dual mechanism may underlie its therapeutic effects in treatment-resistant neuropathic pain, with the stratified randomization (moderate vs severe pain) and blinded assessment ensuring robust detection of these intervention-specific neural changes. The precentral gyrus, which houses the primary motor cortex, is involved in motor planning, emotion-driven behavior, and inhibitory control. Its inverse relationship with DMN activation indicates that weaker integration between sensorimotor and default-mode systems may underlie persistent pain. Based on these findings, Smith et al and Mioduszewski et al hypothesized that altered FC may reflect disrupted coordination between motor control and pain processing circuits. However, the precise neural mechanisms remain unclear, warranting further research into dynamic network interactions. Recent resting-state studies have reported both increases and decreases in FC within the DMN and salience network (SN) during chronic pain states. Figure 2 Figure 2 Depicts alterations in functional connectivity (FC) observed before and after mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). Increased connectivity is represented with solid red lines (eg, between PCC and mPFC), while decreased connectivity is marked with dashed blue lines (eg, between PCC and sensorimotor regions). The color gradient bar quantifies connectivity strength. (Self-plotted in this study). Recent brain imaging studies are helping us understand how chronic pain changes brain connections. One rs-fMRI study examined 46 women with post-mastectomy pain compared to 20 pain-free controls. The scans revealed important differences, ie, patients showed weaker communication between the MPFC and two right brain regions (the inferior frontal and temporal areas). Interestingly, while the MPFC had stronger links to visual and cerebellar areas, its connections to attention and salience networks were weaker. 40 The S1 region, which often shows changes in chronic pain patients, works closely with S2 to identify pain location, intensity, and type, ie, what scientists call sensory discrimination. 41 42 43 Morphological Changes in the Brain Cancer-related neuropathic pain (CNP), including chemotherapy-induced polyneuropathy (CIPN), arises from mechanisms such as paraneoplastic activity, tumor progression, or neurotoxic effects of chemotherapy. 44 45 Translating these findings to humans, breast cancer patients with CIPN exhibit dynamic brain changes. The study cohort included 47 female patients (24 receiving standard chemotherapy and 23 without chemotherapy), all with non-metastatic disease (stage 0-III). In the acute phase (one month after chemotherapy), arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI detected detected increased cerebral blood flow in regions including the bilateral superior frontal gyri, cingulate cortex, and left medial/middle frontal gyri. Interestingly, those with greater gray matter (GM) loss in the left cingulate and right superior frontal gyrus showed smaller increases in blood flow, implying a link between structural degeneration and vascular response. However, these changes were not evident at one-year follow-up (n=18 chemotherapy, n=19 no chemotherapy), possibly due to the lack of longitudinal symptom tracking beyond the first month. 46 In terms of chronic phase intervention, Hatchard et al 47 Beyond these functional and volumetric changes, chronic pain is increasingly linked to broader neuroanatomical alterations, involving both gray and white matter degeneration. Figure 3 Figure 3 Shows structural brain differences in chronic pain patients. The left panel displays increased gray matter (GM) volume in regions such as the parahippocampal gyrus and angular gyrus (highlighted in red). The right panel illustrates decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in major white matter tracts, such as the corpus callosum (highlighted in yellow), reflecting compromised white matter integrity. Functional Brain Changes in the Acute Phase Two key brain networks—the salience network (SN) and dorsal attention network (DAN)—play vital roles in the experience and regulation of pain. The salience network, anchored in the anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula, facilitates the detection and integration of pain-related sensory and emotional signals. It also mediates dynamic switching between the default mode and central executive networks, enabling flexible responses to noxious stimuli. 48 49 Chronic Pain and Cerebral White Matter The brain operates as an interconnected system where white matter plays a crucial role in information processing and interregional communication. 50 51 Early research by Melzack and Casey emphasized that pain processing engages limbic structures, particularly the hippocampus and amygdala. 52 53 40 54 Mindfulness-based interventions, such as MBSR, appear to influence this pain-affective network. In a study of 23 female breast cancer survivors (13 in MBSR group, 10 controls) with chronic neuropathic pain (BPI>4 for >6 months post-treatment), Mioduszewski et al 52 To further illustrate these structural and functional changes, Table 1 Table 1 Neuroimaging Comparison Between MBSR and Non-Intervention Groups Region / Metric MBSR Group Mean Control Group Mean Statistic (t/Z) p-value Prefrontal Functional Connectivity (FC) 0.68 0.45 2.83 0.006 Hippocampal Gray Matter Volume (GMV) 2.45 cm³ 2.12 cm³ 2.15 0.036 Corpus Callosum Fractional Anisotropy (FA) 0.52 0.48 1.98 0.048 Default Mode Network Activation ↑up ↓down 3.21 0.002 Pain Score Change (VAS) −2.1 −0.5 2.91 0.005 Notes Table 1 Finally, supporting these findings, Bukkieva et al 40 Chronic Pain and Emotions Human pain is a complex experience composed of two primary components: the sensory/somatic aspect and the affective/distress aspect. 54 55 On the other hand, the emotional or affective dimension of pain is processed in a different neural pathway. The central thalamic nuclei, particularly the mediodorsal nucleus, play a key role in generating the emotional response to pain. From here, information is sent to several brain regions involved in emotional regulation and pain perception, including the amygdala, dorsal ACC, anterior insula, lateral prefrontal cortex, and posterior parietal regions. These regions integrate the sensory and emotional aspects of pain, leading to a unified experience. 56 57 Research has highlighted the significance of functional brain connectivity in the perception of pain, particularly in how the somatic and affective pain pathways interact. When either of these pathways is disrupted, it can result in decreased connectivity within important pain-processing networks, potentially impairing the overall pain experience. 58 Following MBSR, Hatchard et al 31 59 56 26 43 Bukkieva et al 40 Breast Cancer Bone Metastasis Pain and Brain Function Connections Bone metastasis pain represents a chronic pain condition that includes neuropathic, inflammatory, and injury-related components. 60 61 62 63 64 Another prospective study investigated the effects of anti-nerve growth factor therapy on FC in mice with cancer-induced bone pain following mammary carcinoma tumor cell implantation. The results showed that the interaction between the amygdalar and thalamic regions, as well as midbrain areas, was most significantly disrupted. FC changes in midbrain structures were mainly observed in motor-related regions and the PAG. Additionally, alterations were found in the connectivity between cortical areas, particularly between the temporal associative/insular regions and the cingulate cortex. Changes were also noted in the FC between striatal regions and both midbrain and thalamic areas. The study further revealed significant FC impacts in the amygdalar regions opposite the tumor site, as well as in the thalamic, dorsal hippocampus, and S1 regions. In the Tumor+Vehicle group, notable FC changes were observed between the ipsilateral motor-related epithalamus and the amygdala, the anterior PAG and S2, and the posterior PAG and limbic cortex. These changes were characterized by a consistent decline in FC across all the mentioned brain regions. 65 Discussion Pain associated with breast cancer is often chronic, 66 67 68 69 Our comprehensive analysis of neuroimaging studies investigating breast cancer pain reveals the involvement of multiple functional brain networks, with the SN, frontoparietal network (FPN), and DMN demonstrating significant structural and functional alterations. The DMN, comprising core regions such as the MPFC, PCC, and precuneus, plays a crucial role in higher-order cognitive functions, including self-referential processing, autobiographical memory retrieval, and prospective thinking. 70 71 72 73 74 Several studies on chronic non-cancer pain have shown changes in the SN and the DMN. 75 76 77 78 79–81 82 83 82 84 The MPFC is also involved in psychiatric conditions often seen with chronic pain. 85 86–90 90 40 The precuneus, another key DMN region, regulates emotions and pain processing. Research conducted by Buvanendran et al 82 91 92 93 31 The ACC is involved in both the DMN and SN, playing a role in pain and emotional processing. 94 95 96 97 The anterior insula and ACC are key regions in the SN and limbic systems, involved in emotional pain processing and sensory integration. 98–100 Reduced DMN activity is linked to increased SN activity in chronic pain, 101 102 103 40 38 52 104–107 40 42 108 109 Research on brain structure changes in breast cancer pain is limited. Nudelman et al, 46 47 110–118 Moreover, emerging evidence suggests neuroanatomical changes in chronic pain may be reversible. Studies show GM normalization in treated patients, including breast cancer patients with CNP after MBSR therapy. 119 120 Conclusions While functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have advanced significantly, research on breast cancer-related chronic pain still faces several key limitations. Current studies face multiple methodological challenges, including a lack of controlled experiments to verify core findings, small sample sizes, inconsistent research methods, and an overreliance on subjective pain assessments (eg, VAS and NRS scales). 121 Nevertheless, existing evidence, though limited, has uncovered distinct functional abnormalities in key brain networks (including the default mode network and salience network) of breast cancer pain patients. These abnormalities show remarkable similarities to neural mechanisms observed in non-cancer chronic pain conditions, providing valuable insights into the complex pathophysiology of breast cancer pain. Moving forward, research must prioritize well-designed controlled experiments and incorporate advanced multimodal techniques like cortico-spinal imaging. 122 Acknowledgments All the authors are thankful to the support from Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College.
