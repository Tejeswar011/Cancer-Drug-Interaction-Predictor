Our predictive model, validated through tumor grading and staging, corresponds with enrichment analysis results and is further supported by PCR findings. Target gene predictions highlight the role of calcium ion transport and basement membrane functionality, with links to critical signaling pathways like JAK-STAT, cGMP-PKG, and sphingolipid, which play crucial roles in biological processes. Patients with higher levels of hsa-miR-21-5p show reduced responses to immunotherapy. In contrast, drug sensitivity analysis reveals increased vulnerability to drugs such as axitinib, sunitinib, and cabozantinib. This extensive investigation reveals the molecular complexities of ccRCC and suggests potential therapeutic options. In conclusion, upregulation of hsa-miR-21-5p in ccRCC is closely associated with tumor initiation and progression, indicating a poor prognosis. Its impact on the tumor microenvironment impairs the efficacy of immune therapies, contributing to adverse prognostic outcomes.

These sequences typically range from 20 to 22 base pairs in length [ 24 25 26 27 30 31 32 5 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 ccRCC is increasingly recognized as a metabolic disease, characterized by profound metabolic reprogramming including altered glycolysis, impaired mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), and dysregulated lipid metabolism [ 42 43 Materials and methods Compilation of transcriptomic, clinical, and MiRNA data The transcriptome data were obtained from the TCGA database, and the dataset was systematically organized by aligning sample names with their respective gene contents. The clinical information was acquired using a download process, wherein patient identifiers were cross-referenced with relevant clinical features such as survival time, survival status, age, sex, grade, and stage. Using the miRBase database, we successfully established a connection between mature miRNA names and sample identifiers, enabling us to obtain miRNA expression levels in each respective sample. Independent prognostic analysis and selection of ROC curves The clinical data were structured with a focus on key parameters (age, survival time, and status). R software (v4.2.2) was used to correlate the clinical data with the miRNA profiles ( P Extraction and differential analysis of pancancer data The focal gene chosen for our subsequent analysis was hsa-miR-21-5p. miRNA expression data for 33 unique tumour types were obtained from the TCGA database. Using Perl software, we conducted calculations to determine the expression levels of the target genes across a range of tumour types. In this study, we utilized the functionalities of R software to generate visual representations that successfully depict the pancancer expression data and their associated graphical insights. Survival and independent prognostic analyses with Kaplan–Meier and ROC curves P values were obtained by correlating the miRNA expression profiles with clinical variables (age, survival time, and survival status). R software was used to generate survival curves. Univariate analysis compared miRNA expression with clinical parameters for survival time and status, yielding p values. Multivariate analysis integrated all attributes to assess their correlation with survival, yielding p values. A forest plot was used to visualize the results. After establishing the miRNA‒survival correlation, survival data were removed, and age, sex, grade, and TNM stage were retained. Missing values were marked as “unknown.” R was used to generate column line charts and calibration curves. pROC in R generated visualizations based on miRNA expression. A combined dataset produced a predicted ROC curve using R packages such as survival, sura miner, and timeROC for prognostic ROC visualizations. Differential expression analysis of miRNAs To validate the miRNAs identified using RNA sequencing, total RNA was extracted using the Animal Tissue Total RNA Extraction Kit (DP451) from Tiangen Biotech. Reverse transcription was performed with the PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara), and cDNA amplification was conducted using TB Green ® −ΔΔCt 1  Table 1 This table lists the sequences of primers we used Gene The sequence of primers ZNF367 GGCTTCAGCGACTTCATGGT FASLG TGCCTTGGTAGGATTGGGC ST3GAL6 ACTGCATTGCATATTATGGGGAA YOD1 ATGTTTGGCCCCGCTAAAGG KRIT1 GCCACCACCCTAGTCTCCTA TIMP3 GAAGAGAGTACCGGCATCGG IL-12 A GCACAGTGGAGGCCTGTTTA GATAD2B GAGCTAGCCGGGAGTTACAC GTPBP10 ACAGCAAATTCCCAAATGCTGG hsa-miR-21-5p UAGCUUAUCAGACUGAUGUUGA Predicting miRNA target genes The homepage of the TargetScanHuman 8.0 database can be accessed via its official website, where users have the option to choose “human” as the designated species.

Clinical statistics, coexpression analysis and coexpression heatmap Individual miRNA expression data and structured clinical input files are needed to conduct the analysis. R’s BiocManager and ggpubr packages were used to create informative box plots, and a chi-square test was performed (considered significant at a p value < 0.05). The files used included individual miRNA and mRNA expression files and target gene information. Correlation visualizations are generated using various R packages, such as BiocManager, ggpubr, tidyverse, ggplot2, and ggExtra. After coexpression analysis results were obtained, they were visualized by combining coexpression analysis files and creating heatmaps using BiocManager and the ComplexHeatmap package. GO, KEGG, and GSEA enrichment analyses The coexpression analysis results file required the installation of several essential packages, including BiocManager, ComplexHeatmap, DOSE, cluster profile, enrich plot, org.HS.eg.db, colorspace, stringi, ggplot2, circlize, and RColorBrewer. The significance level was set at P Additionally, we conducted a comprehensive study using sample files, individual miRNA expression data, and gene set files. We generated graphical representations skilfully with essential R packages such as BiocManager, DOSE, org.HS.eg.db, enrichplot, limma, and clusterProfiler while applying a filtering threshold of 1. These visual representations effectively highlighted the dataset’s most significantly enriched functions and pathways. Tumour microenvironment analysis and differential analysis In addition, we utilized sample files, individual microRNA expression data, and gene set files to conduct a comprehensive study. We skilfully generated graphical representations by employing essential R packages such as BiocManager, DOSE, org.HS.eg.db, enrichplot, limma, and clusterProfiler, while implementing a filtering threshold of 1. The visual representations successfully emphasized the dataset’s most notable enhanced functions and pathways. Immune cell infiltration, correlation, and immunotherapy analysis Transcriptome data, R pkgs BiocMgr, limma, and preprocessCore were used to analyse immune cell infiltration. The results were combined with miRNA data to generate scatter plots in R using BiocMgr, limma, ggpubr, vioplot, and ggExtra. Input files extracted from TIDE db ( http://tide.dfci.harvard.edu/ ) Drug sensitivity and differential analysis In this study, we used sample files, expression data from databases, and drug sensitivity scoring files. To conduct our analyses, we employed packages such as BiocManager, limma, OncoPredict, and other relevant tools. The next phase involves evaluating drug sensitivity for multiple drugs using available resources. We carefully assessed drug responsiveness using single miRNA expression inputs and drug sensitivity rating files. An iterative approach allowed us to identify medications with significant sensitivity. After installing necessary packages such as BiocManager, limma, ggplot2, and ggpubr and applying a filtering threshold of pFilter = 0.05, we used R to create box plots. The iterative methodology involved cycling through the numerous medications mentioned in the accompanying documents. Importantly, specific approaches and package instructions can be tailored to match the unique characteristics of the study and dataset at hand. Results Differential miRNA selection A filtering method based on the criteria of |logFC| >1 and an adjusted p value (FDR) < 0.05 was used in this study. This strategy increased the accuracy of selecting miRNAs that exhibited differential expression. Next, we focused on visualizing the top 100 upregulated and downregulated miRNAs (Fig. 1 1  Fig. 1 Heatmap of 100 differentially expressed miRNAs. The figure displays the top 100 significantly upregulated and downregulated miRNAs. Red represents high expression, while blue represents low expression Differential gene analysis and validation A rigorous methodology was employed for the selection of the target gene, integrating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and findings from an independent prognostic study, which included Kaplan–Meier (K–M) survival curves and the Cox proportional hazards model. Consequently, hsa-miR-21-5p emerged as the primary candidate for further investigation. As shown in Fig. 2 p P 2 2 2 P 2 P 2  Fig. 2 Screening of differential miRNAs.

A higher AUC indicates increased accuracy in differentiating between normal and malignant samples using hsa-miR-21-5p.

Data are presented as mean ± SD. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. Discussion Hsa-miR-21-5p is a well-established oncomiR, reported to be overexpressed in diverse malignancies such as breast cancer [ 38 41 44 45 In this study, we found that miR-21-5p expression is markedly higher in ccRCC tissues than in normal kidney, confirming prior observations. Consistent with these reports, our PCR validation showed robust overexpression of miR-21-5p in tumor samples [ 46 47 Functionally, miR-21-5p behaves as an oncogenic microRNA in ccRCC. Previous studies (and our model) indicate that increased miR-21-5p levels promote tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis while inhibiting apoptosis. These effects are characteristic of oncomiRs and help explain the link between miR-21-5p and tumor progression. Indeed, high miR-21-5p expression has been correlated with advanced stage, higher grade, and worse patient survival in ccRCC [ 48 49 50 51 Indeed, ccRCC is now recognized as a paradigmatic metabolically reprogrammed 42 52 53 54 55 53 56 57 58 In this metabolic setting, miR-21-5p itself may act as a modulator of cellular metabolism. Emerging evidence indicates that miR-21-5p can shift the balance between glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation. In cultured cells, miR-21-5p was found to target PPARα, a key regulator of lipid metabolism, thereby altering the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis. Experimentally, overexpression of miR-21-5p attenuated cellular lipid uptake and reduced lipid content, while its inhibition had the opposite effect. Moreover, modulation of miR-21-5p levels changed mitochondrial function: both overexpression and knockdown of miR-21-5p increased basal respiration, but overexpression blunted the oxidative response to lipid substrates and shifted cells toward glycolytic metabolism [ 59 In addition to metabolic effects, miR-21-5p appears to influence the immune landscape of ccRCC. The ccRCC tumor microenvironment (TME) is highly immunogenic: tumors are often densely infiltrated by immune cells [ 60 61 62 60 46 63 46 immunoflogosis 64 65 High miR-21-5p may contribute to this immunosuppressive microenvironment. Recent analyses of ccRCC (KIRC) datasets have linked miR-21-5p to immune cell infiltration. In particular, Wang et al. identified a miR-21-5p/PRKCE regulatory axis: tumors with elevated miR-21-5p and concomitantly low PRKCE showed altered patterns of immune infiltration, and PRKCE expression was strongly associated with immune cell content [ 46 However, additional investigations are needed to comprehensively understand the specific function of hsa-miR-21-5p in the development of ccRCC. The identification of other target genes and signalling pathways modulated by hsa-miR-21-5p will enhance our understanding of its biological roles in the context of ccRCC [ 44 51 Few prognostic miRNA models have been established for KIRC. Compared with previous models, our model uses more statistical methods to obtain prognostic miRNAs. Under this model, the Kaplan–Meier curve revealed that the low-risk group had a better survival rate. ROC analysis revealed that this risk model contributed to predicting KIRC patient prognosis. In addition, clinical features were integrated into this miRNA model in KIRC to construct a nomogram, which is the first report of such a model. Furthermore, miRNA expression was examined in KIRC tissues, and these findings should be confirmed in studies with larger sample sizes. In the future, more clinical databases should be used to verify the accuracy of the miRNA model. In conclusion, our study reinforces the view of miR-21-5p as a key oncogenic driver in ccRCC. We have confirmed that miR-21-5p is upregulated in tumors and associated with adverse pathological features and outcomes. Importantly, we also highlight new dimensions of miR-21-5p function in ccRCC: its likely involvement in metabolic reprogramming and immune modulation. MiR-21-5p may promote ccRCC progression by enhancing glycolysis and lipid accumulation – core hallmarks of this cancer – as well as by shaping a pro-tumorigenic inflammatory milieu. These insights align with our functional predictions (e.g. PPAR and glycolysis pathways) and with emerging evidence of miR-21–mediated metabolic and immunological effects [ 46 59 Conclusions In this work, a comprehensive investigation was undertaken to examine the biological functions of hsa-miR-21-5p in ccRCC. These findings revealed the potential of hsa-miR-21-5p as an independent prognostic factor and diagnostic biomarker for individuals with ccRCC. In addition, our research investigated the intricate immune evasion processes in ccRCC and analysed drug sensitivity. These findings provide valuable insights into potential avenues for immune-based therapies in ccRCC patients, particularly those exhibiting increased hsa-miR-21-5p expression levels. In conclusion, our research enhances our understanding of the diverse functions of hsa-miR-21-5p in ccRCC, including its involvement in tumour formation, evasion of the immune system, and response to therapeutic drugs.
