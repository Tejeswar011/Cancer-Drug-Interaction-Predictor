This research investigates the roles of chemokines and their receptors (CaCRs) across multiple cancers and establishes a reliable CaCRs-based prognostic model for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Methods Gene expression data were sourced from the UCSC-Xena platform and the GEO database. The chemokine score was calculated using the ssGSEA algorithm. A CaCRs-based prognostic signature was constructed and validated for LUAD. Expression levels of signature genes in lung cancer tissues were verified. Results Dysregulation of CaCRs expression was observed in multiple cancers. The chemokine score has shown prognostic features in various tumors. In the LUAD cohort, a seven-gene signature of CaCRs (CCR2, CCR4, CCR6, XCR1, CCL20, CXCL17, and XCL2) was constructed as a prognostic model, identifying a poorer prognosis for high-risk groups. mRNA levels of CCR2, CCR4, CCR6, and XCR1 were significantly reduced in lung cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, while CCL20 was markedly overexpressed in tumor tissues. Furthermore, CCL20 promoted A549 cell proliferation via the MAPK pathway, with JNK inhibitors effectively blocking CCL20-induced proliferation. Conclusion This study highlights the substantial role of CaCRs in immunity and prognosis. The identified seven-gene signature of CaCRs provides a new prognostic tool for LUAD.

Although tremendous developments have been made in cancer treatment, the long-term survival of patients remains dismal. 1 2 3 + 4 5 Chemokines are small (8–12 kDa) chemoattractant proteins that play essential roles in regulating cell migration, adhesion, positioning, and interaction through specific receptor binding. 6 7 8 9 9 + 10 + 11 12 13 Thus, the chemokine network within the TME represents a complex system involving diverse cell types and signaling pathways that regulate tumor growth, invasion, metastasis, and immune responses. Given the importance of CaCRs in cancer progression and immune response, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to investigate their prognostic value across multiple cancers. We also developed a chemokine score to assess its relationship with prognosis and immune cell infiltration patterns in specific tumors. Notably, in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the chemokine score demonstrated strong prognostic relevance. Building on this, we identified a CaCRs-based signature to predict overall survival and immune characteristics in the LUAD cohort. Materials and Methods Data Source Gene expression data for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Pan-Cancer cohort were retrieved from the UCSC Xena platform ( https://toil.xenahubs.net GSE72094 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ CaCRs Expression and Survival Analysis CaCRs gene expression across various cancers were analyzed using the limma package in R. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tumor and normal tissues were identified using linear models and empirical Bayes methods. Log2 fold change (FC) values were visualized via heat maps, while box plots illustrated gene expression differences. Only cancer types with a minimum of five para-cancerous samples were included to ensure statistical reliability. To assess the prognostic significance of CaCRs expression, samples were categorized into high- and low-expression groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Log rank tests, implemented through the survival package in R, were used to compare survival outcomes between these groups. Identification of the Relationship of CaCRs Chemokine receptors interact with ligands to mediate various biological processes. Correlation coefficients between ligand-receptor and corresponding significance were calculated for global pan-cancer samples. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) were predicted via the STRING database, and Cytoscape software (v3.4.0) was used to construct interaction networks. Network connectivity was analyzed using the CytoNCA plug-in. Survey of Drug Sensitivity Regression models were developed to predict IC50 values of chemotherapeutic drugs based on gene expression profiles from GDSC and TCGA. Significant associations between CaCRs expression and drug IC50 values were identified using Pearson correlation coefficients (|r| > 0.3, p < 0.05). Pathways Involved in CaCRs Using 51 HALLMARK gene sets from the MSigDB database, pathway enrichment scores were calculated via GSVA. Spearman correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values were computed to link CaCRs expression levels with specific pathways. Analysis of Immune-Related Functions, Immune Infiltration, and Immune Checkpoints The ESTIMATE algorithm was employed to calculate stromal, immune, and ESTIMATE scores based on CaCRs expression. Heat maps showed Spearman correlations between CaCRs and these scores. Immune cell infiltration levels and immune checkpoint expression were also analyzed in relation to CaCRs across TCGA pan-cancer samples. Construction of Chemokine Score The ssGSEA algorithm was used to calculate chemokine scores for each sample. Associations between chemokine scores and prognosis were examined using univariate Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Score distributions were compared between cancerous and normal tissues. Construction and Validation of the Prognostic Gene Signature of CaCRs in LUAD Prognosis-related CaCRs genes were identified using univariate Cox regression in the TCGA-LUAD cohort. We then applied the LASSO Cox regression model with 20-fold cross-validation to further refine the selection of prognostically relevant genes. The final prognostic model was established using the selected genes and their corresponding regression coefficients. This multi-step approach, incorporating stringent cross-validation, was designed to minimize overfitting and enhance the robustness of the model. Risk scores were calculated for each patient, and their association with survival outcomes was validated in external cohorts ( GSE72094 Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) The present study was conducted in full compliance with the ethical principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of Yichang Central People’s Hospital (Protocol No. 2023–245-01). Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Thirty-one non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens and adjacent normal tissues were collected. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and gene expression quantification were performed using standardized protocols, with expression levels calculated via the 2 −ΔΔCt Supplementary Table 1 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) CCL20 expression in LUAD and adjacent tissues was assessed through IHC. After antigen retrieval and blocking, sections were incubated with an anti-hCCL20 antibody (dilution 1:200, Proteintech, 26527-1-AP), visualized using DAB, and counterstained with hematoxylin. Cell Culture and Cell Viability Assays A549 cells were cultured under standard conditions and treated with CCL20, either alone or in combination with inhibitors (SP600125, PD98095). Cell viability was assessed using the CCK-8 reagent. Western Blot Protein expression was analyzed using SDS-PAGE and PVDF membrane transfer. Specific antibodies targeting GAPDH (dilution 1:5000, Proteintech, 10494-1-AP), phosphorylated and total JNK (dilution 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, 4668, 9252), ERK (dilution 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, 4370, 4695), and p38 (dilution 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, 4511, 8690) were used. Chemiluminescence and ImageJ software were employed for visualization and densitometry. 5-Ethynyl-2’deoxyuridine (EdU) Proliferation Assay Cell proliferation was evaluated using an EdU incorporation assay. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and treated with a click reaction solution, followed by nuclear staining with Hoechst 33342. EdU-positive cells were subsequently visualized and recorded using a fluorescence microscope. Statistical Analysis Bioinformatics analyses were conducted using R software (R3.6.1). Experimental data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) or mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). One-way ANOVA or t Results CaCRs Level in Different Cancers First, 45 chemokine genes and 24 chemokine receptor genes ( Supplementary Table 2 Figure 1 Figure 1 Expression features of CaCRs in multiple cancers. The Relationship Between CaCRs Expression and CaCRs-Related Pathways We explored the regulation of CaCRs gene expression by transcription factors (TFs). Notably, RELA, NFKB1, SP1, STAT6, and STAT1 emerged as key regulators, each predicted to influence three or more CaCRs genes ( Supplementary Figure 1 Figure 2A Figure 2A B Figure 2C Figure 2 Correlation of CaCRs transcription levels and involved functional pathways. ( A B C D Next, we calculated the enrichment pathway scores for the HALLMARK gene sets in each sample and analyzed their correlation with the expression levels of CaCRs. Enrichment pathways positively associated with most chemokines included TNFA-signaling, allograft-rejection, IL-6-JAK-STAT3-signaling, interferon γ-response, interferon-α-response complement, IL2-STAT5-signaling, and inflammatory response, whereas MYC-targets, glycolysis, mTORC1 signaling, and E2F-targets were negatively correlated ( Figure 2D Prognostic Potential of CaCRs in Cancers The prognostic value of most CaCRs in human cancers remains unknown. Therefore, we analyzed the prognosis of each CaCR gene in each cancer. Most CaCRs have prognostic value in SKCM ( Figure 3A Figure 3A Figure 3B Figure 3 Prognostic roles of CaCRs. ( A B CaCRs and Immune Features Recent studies have shown that TME-associated alterations can serve as predictors of clinical outcomes. We calculated the stromal score, immune score, and ESTIMATE score across various cancer types to investigate the association between CaCRs expression and these scores. Most CaCRs exhibit positive correlations with stromal score ( Supplementary Figure 2 Supplementary Figure 3 Supplementary Figure 4 + Figure 4 Figure 4 Supplementary Figure 5 Figure 4 The relationship between CaCRs and the levels of infiltration of 22 immune-related cells. **p < 0.01.

Diagnostic and Prognostic Significance of Chemokine Score Here, gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was conducted in the R programming environment to calculate a chemokine score for each sample. Tumor tissues generally exhibited lower chemokine scores compared to normal tissues in a pan-cancer context ( Figure 6A Figure 6B Figure 6C Figure 6D Figure 6D Figure 6E Figure 6F Figure 6 Chemokine score distribution and prognostic value.

Construction and Validation of a CaCRs-Based Signature in LUAD Cohorts It is well known that lung cancer has a high morbidity and mortality rate. 1 Figure 8A Figure 8B Table 1 Figure 8C Figure 8D Figure 8E Figure 8F Figure 8G Figure 8H Table 1 Details of the Seven CaCRs in the Prognostic Mode Gene name Coefficient HR HR.95 L HR.95 H P value CXCL17 −0.1033 0.9019 0.8608 0.9450 1.45E-05 CCR2 −0.0645 0.8349 0.7542 0.9243 5.09E-04 CCR6 −0.0072 0.8968 0.8393 0.9582 1.27E-03 CCR4 −0.0378 0.8787 0.8084 0.9551 2.37E-03 XCR1 −0.0154 0.8999 0.8372 0.9672 4.18E-03 CCL20 0.1011 1.0971 1.0279 1.1709 5.28E-03 XCL2 −0.0384 0.9158 0.8544 0.9816 1.30E-02 Figure 8 Construction and validation of a novel seven-gene signature of CaCRs in LUAD cohorts.

Consistent with expectations, stromal, immune, and ESTIMATE scores were significantly higher in patients belonging to the low-risk group compared to those in the high-risk group ( Figure 8N + + Figure 8O Figure 8O Independent Prognostic Analysis and Construction of a Nomogram Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to assess the impact of clinicopathological characteristics (age, tumor stage, sex, T stage, N stage, and M stage) and the CaCRs-based signature risk score on the overall survival of LUAD patients in the TCGA cohort ( Figure 9A B Figure 9C Figure 9D Figure 9E Figure 9 Construction of a nomogram and survival analysis of the seven-gene signature of CaCRs in LUAD cohorts. ( A B A B C D E Validation of Seven CaCRs Gene Expressions in Clinical Samples We obtained 31 non-small cell lung cancer tissue samples and 31 adjacent normal tissues to evaluate the mRNA expression of seven core genes ( Supplementary Table 3 Figure 10A–G Figure 10H Figure 10 Validation of seven prognostic genes in clinical samples. ( A G H t CCL20 Promotes A549 Cells Proliferation by Activating the MAPK Signaling Pathway The CCL20 gene is one of the seven identified prognostic markers, demonstrating significant overexpression in NSCLC tissues compared to normal tissues. Experimental evidence indicates that silencing CCL20 suppresses the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reduces cell proliferation in lung adenocarcinoma cells. 14 15 Figure 11A Figure 11B–E Figure 11F G Figure 11H I Figure 11 CCL20 promotes A549 cells proliferation by activating the MAPK signaling pathway. ( A B E F G H I Discussion The TME, composed of cancer, stromal, and immune cells, exhibits a diverse profile of CaCRs. 6 7 8 16 17 + 17 18 19 20 21 22 Chemokines remodel the TME by recruiting immune and stromal cells, thereby influencing responses to therapies. 23 24 25 26 27 28 28 Our analysis provides further evidence that the chemokine score is significantly associated with clinical outcomes in LUAD. Based on these insights, we propose the construction of a chemokine-related risk score model to comprehensively evaluate its prognostic value and potential utility in characterizing the immune landscape of LUAD. We developed a seven CaCRs-based (CCL20, CCR6, CXCL17, CCR2, CCR4, XCR1 and XCL2) signature that stratified LUAD into low- and high-risk groups. Across both internal and external cohorts, patients in the low-risk group showed significantly better overall survival compared to those in the high-risk group. Additionally, the low-risk group exhibited increased infiltration of immune cell subsets, particularly CD8 + 29 Consistent with earlier research, elevated CCL20 levels in NSCLC are associated with a poorer prognosis. 30 31 14 32 33 16 34 35 For CXCL17, lower expression in LUAD associates with poorer clinical outcomes, whereas CXCL17 overexpression in A549 enhances invasion and migration. 36 37 CCR2 and CCR4 have been identified as potential prognostic markers for LUAD. 38 39 + 40 41 42 XCR1 (also known as GPR5) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that specifically binds the chemokine XCL1 and is predominantly highly expressed on conventional dendritic cell type 1 (cDC1). 43 + + 18 + + + 44 45 46 XCL2 has progressively revealed its pivotal functions in tumorigenesis and progression. Existing studies have identified upregulated XCL2 expression in multiple malignancies, including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma 47 48 49 50 Despite its contributions, this study has some limitations. First, the analysis relied solely on data from public databases, which may have limited the specificity of the results. Second, some tumor types, such as GBM, have fewer corresponding adjacent tissue samples, which may lead to insufficient statistical power. Third, clinical tissue specimens are still limited, and larger-scale validation in well-characterized patient populations is still needed to further confirm the prognostic value of the identified chemokine markers. Fourth, this prognostic model demonstrated moderate predictive accuracy in LUAD cohort, which may be due to dataset heterogeneity, limited sample size, and technical variability. Future studies should validate this model in larger, multicenter cohorts and integrate more omics data to improve its performance. Lastly, the chemokine network exhibits diverse roles across various tumor types, highlighting the need for further validation in specific tumor settings. Conclusion In summary, we developed a chemokine score for pan-cancer analysis, which demonstrated strong prognostic value for patients with ACC, KIRC, LAML, LUAD, SARC, SKCM, and UVM. We identified a seven-gene signature derived from CaCRs that demonstrated robust accuracy and applicability in predicting clinical survival outcomes for patients with LUAD. Additionally, we found that exogenous CCL20 promotes the proliferation of A549 cells by activating the MAPK signaling pathway.
