Since 1981, global temperatures have increased at an approximate rate of 0.2 °C per decade[ 3 4 6 7 9 A study conducted in Adelaide, South Australia, by Borg et al 10 10 11 12 13 15 16 Agricultural workers are considered one of the most vulnerable groups to the adverse health effects of increasing global temperatures[ 17 18 19 20 A case-crossover study of outdoor construction workers reported that each 1 °C increase in daily maximum humidity elevated the risk of accident-related injuries by 0.5% [adjusted odds ratio: 1.005 (95%CI: 1.003-1.007)][ 21 22 23 24 25 Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of ubiquitous proteins found in a wide range of tissues across almost all organisms[ 26 27 28 29 30 26 30 31 Studies have emphasized the crucial role of HSP27 in protecting the kidneys under adverse conditions, particularly in proximal tubular cells and collecting ducts in the renal medulla[ 32 33 34 35 36 37 Not only in Viet Nam but also worldwide, there remains a paucity of research on the effect of renal function in the context of increasing temperatures associated with climate change, especially as 2024 has been officially recognized as the hottest year on record. Therefore, this review focuses on the effects of heat stress induced by global climate change on renal function, emphasizing the relationship between climate change and the risk of kidney injury, particularly among vulnerable populations, through a comparative analysis of clinical features, investigative findings, manifestations, and prognostic implications. Although previous studies have documented the relationship between heat stress and kidney injury related to HSPs such as HSP27, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and specific roles of these HSPs are being discussed. This review aims to clarify the biological effects of HSPs on heat-induced kidney injury, with a particular emphasis on their role in regulating inflammatory responses and tubular epithelial cell damage. Remarkably, HSP70 has been demonstrated to protect renal cells from heat-induced apoptosis and mitigate thermal injury, an area that remains underexplored in previous reviews. MOLECULAR STRUCTURE AND CANONICAL ROLES OF HSPS IN RESPONSE TO HEAT STRESS HSPs constitute a highly conserved family of proteins essential for cellular stress response and cytoprotection, particularly within the renal system, where they maintain cellular homeostasis and structural integrity under diverse stressors, including thermal stress, toxic insults, and oxidative stress. Acting as molecular chaperones, HSPs facilitate appropriate protein folding and mitigate misfolded protein aggregation, a critical function in the densely packed renal cellular environment[ 38 Small HSPs, a subgroup predominantly located in the cytosol, lack an ATPase domain and are characterized by a conserved α-crystallin domain (ACD) flanked by variable N-terminal domains (NTDs) and C-terminal domains (CTDs). These small proteins (12-43 kDa) stabilize injured proteins, preventing misfolded protein interactions and aberrant aggregation by interacting with exposed hydrophobic residues[ 39 Extensive research has revealed the dual protective and pathological roles of HSPs in kidney disease. For instance, in ischemic kidney injury, HSPs contribute to cell viability by stabilizing cellular architecture and function and inhibiting apoptosis, a programmed cell death mechanism[ 38 40 41 42 43 via 38 HSPs exhibit complex, context-dependent roles, acting as chaperones and antiapoptotic modulators in response to proinflammatory and prooxidative stress. Intracellular and extracellular HSPs exhibit distinct functions during injury[ 44 45 i.e 45 HSP27 HSP27, a member of the small HSP family (12-43 kDa), is a multifunctional protein exhibiting chaperone, antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and actin cytoskeletal regulatory activities, thereby influencing diverse disease states with both protective and detrimental effects[ 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 61 1 62 67 Figure 1  Molecular structure of heat shock protein 27[ 62 * https://www.rcsb.org/structure/4MJH Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A Supplementary material HSP60 The highly conserved molecular chaperone HSP60 is critical for maintaining cellular equilibrium, particularly under stress conditions such as hyperthermia. Predominantly located within mitochondria, HSP60 assembles into a characteristic double-ring structure, formed by two heptameric rings[ 68 69 68 70 HSP60 collaborates with its cochaperone, HSP10 (synonymous with HSP10 or Cpn10), to facilitate the appropriate folding of newly imported mitochondrial proteins and mitigate the aggregation of misfolded polypeptides[ 71 72 72 73 74 Beyond its established role in protein folding, HSP60 has been implicated in diverse cellular processes, including mitochondrial DNA replication and the import of proteins into mitochondria[ 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 72 81 2 72 82 86 Figure 2  Molecular structure of heat shock protein 60[ 82 * https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8G7M Nat Struct Mol Biol Supplementary material HSP70 The 70 kDa HSP70 family comprises a highly conserved group of molecular chaperones essential for maintaining cellular proteostasis under both physiological and stress conditions. These proteins exhibit a modular architecture consisting of the following three principal functional domains: (1) An N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD); (2) A substrate-binding domain (SBD); and (3) A CTD. The NBD, which is responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis, is characterized by two lobes separated by a deep cleft accommodating ATP and ADP[ 87 89 90 91 88 HSP70 interacts with extended peptide segments and partially folded proteins, preventing aggregation and promoting appropriate folding. In the absence of the substrate, HSP70 is typically in an ATP-bound state with low intrinsic ATPase activity. Upon the emergence of nascent polypeptide chains from ribosomes, the SBD recognizes and interacts with the exposed hydrophobic amino acid sequences. This reversible interaction stimulates the ATPase activity of HSP70, thereby accelerating ATP hydrolysis to ADP, which triggers the closure of the C-terminal lid and tight binding of the peptide chain. J-domain co-chaperones, such as HSP40 in eukaryotes and DnaJ in prokaryotes, further stimulate the ATPase activity of HSP70 and deliver unfolded proteins. After the completion of protein synthesis, a nucleotide exchange factor, such as GrpE in prokaryotes and BAG1 and HSPBP1 in eukaryotes, stimulates ADP release and ATP binding, opening the lid and releasing the appropriately folded protein[ 92 93 Beyond protein folding, HSP70 participates in other cellular processes, including assisting in transmembrane protein transport by stabilizing partially unfolded proteins for translocation across membranes. Posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, can modulate the function of HSP70 by altering its interactions with substrates and cochaperones[ 94 96 97 98 99 Furthermore, HSP70 also directly inhibits apoptosis through multiple mechanisms, including inhibiting apoptosome complex formation, thereby preventing caspase activation[ 100 101 102 102 In the context of hyperthermia and its effect on renal function, the cytoprotective roles of HSP70 are particularly important. Elevated temperatures induce protein denaturation and aggregation in renal cells, compromising function and potentially resulting in cell death. HSP70 mitigates these effects by preventing protein aggregation, promoting refolding, and preserving cellular proteostasis, which is crucial in the metabolically active and stress-susceptible kidney. Research has demonstrated HSP70 upregulation in renal cells in response to heat stress, protecting against heat-induced damage[ 103 104 105 106 105 107 108 107 109 110 112 3 91 113 117 Figure 3  Molecular structure of heat shock protein 70[ 113 * https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1S3X Structure Supplementary material HSP90 The highly conserved HSP90 family, present in almost all organisms except archaea, comprises the following five subfamilies: (1) Cytosolic HSP90A; (2) ER-localized HSP90B (GRP94 in humans); (3) Chloroplast HSP90C; (4) Mitochondrial TNFR-associated protein; and (5) Bacterial high-temperature protein G (HtpG)[ 29 29 29 118 119 29 HSP90A is the largest, most widespread, and best-investigated subfamily, often exhibiting multiple paralogous genes ( e.g 120 121 122 123 122 124 125 126 121 126 121 127 130 127 131 132 133 134 4 114 116 117 135 136 Figure 4  Molecular structure of heat shock protein 90[ 135 * https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8AGI Int J Mol Sci Supplementary material To summarize, although all these HSPs act as molecular chaperones, they differ considerably in their sizes, structures (especially ATPase domains), primary subcellular localizations, specific client protein repertoires, reliance on co-chaperones, and distinct roles in other cellular processes such as apoptosis, immune signaling, and cytoskeletal dynamics. HSP27 is a small, versatile chaperone with antioxidant and antiapoptotic roles. HSP60 is primarily a mitochondrial protein chaperone. HSP70 is a general and robust chaperone involved in nascent protein folding to degradation, and stress response. HSP90 is a more specialized chaperone vital for the maturation and stability of key signaling proteins. RENAL FUNCTION RESPONSES TO HEAT SHOCK AT THE ORGANISMAL LEVEL Heat stress profoundly affects renal function through a complex interaction between inflammatory and noninflammatory mechanisms. These mechanisms, triggered by factors such as strenuous muscle work, increased metabolic demands, and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system, can initiate a cascade of events culminating in a spectrum of renal dysfunction, ranging from transient changes in GFR to severe conditions such as AKI and potentially contributing to the progression of CKD. These pathways are often intertwined, generating a complex feedback loop that can considerably compromise kidney health. Non-inflammatory pathways primarily involve physiological responses to fluid loss and circulatory changes, operating independently of direct immune system activation. A central component of this response is the precise regulation of fluid balance orchestrated by the antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and RAA system. Dehydration resulting from sweating, a crucial thermoregulatory mechanism in hot environments, triggers the release of ADH from the posterior pituitary gland[ 137 138 139 140 5 137 146 Figure 5  Non-inflammatory pathways of renal function in heat shock conditions. Concurrent with ADH release, the decrease in extracellular fluid volume and the subsequent reduction in renal perfusion pressure activate the RAA system. This hormonal cascade is initiated by the release of renin from juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys, which are sensitive to changes in renal perfusion pressure and sympathetic nerve activity[ 143 142 144 141 5 137 146 Beyond these noninflammatory hormonal responses, strenuous muscle work in hot environments initiates a cascade of inflammatory events that can further compromise renal function. Strenuous muscle work dramatically increases metabolic demands, requiring a corresponding increase in oxygen and nutrient delivery to the working muscles. In hot environments, thermoregulation through sweating causes decreased blood volume and potentially reduced cardiac output, which can compromise oxygen delivery to muscles. This mismatch between oxygen supply and demand can cause muscle ischemia, cellular stress, and potential muscle injury[ 147 148 149 The increased metabolic rate associated with both exercise and the inflammatory response further elevates cellular oxygen demand, potentially exacerbating tissue hypoxia, especially in the kidneys, which have inherently high metabolic activity due to their role in filtration and reabsorption[ 150 151 152 154 The combination of muscle injury, hypoxia, and metabolic stress triggers a systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6[ 155 156 146 157 158 159 6 146 155 168 Figure 6  Inflammatory pathways of renal function in heat shock conditions. The effects of heat stress on renal function are not solely attributable to either inflammatory or noninflammatory mechanisms but rather represent a complex and dynamic interaction between these pathways. Dehydration and circulatory changes trigger noninflammatory responses involving ADH and the RAA system, which can predispose the kidneys to injury. Concurrently, muscle work, increased metabolism, and the resulting inflammatory response further exacerbate renal stress through cytokine release, hypoxia, and potentially the NSAID use. This combined insult can result in a spectrum of renal dysfunction, ranging from transient decreases in GFR to severe AKI and potentially contributing to CKD progression in susceptible individuals. Therefore, understanding these complex interactions is vital for developing effective preventive and therapeutic strategies to alleviate the risk of kidney complications associated with heat stress and physical exertion. Proper hydration, appropriate electrolyte replacement, careful consideration of NSAID use, and strategies to minimize muscle injury are essential for maintaining kidney health in these challenging conditions. THE COMPREHENSIVE EFFECT OF HEAT STRESS ON RENAL FUNCTION: FROM AKI TO CHRONIC CONDITIONS Heat stress and AKI Heat stress considerably increases the core body temperature, particularly when accompanied by dehydration. This physiological response results in increased vascular resistance and reduced blood volume, exacerbating conditions that may contribute to kidney disorders. AKI is among the most severe consequences and is commonly defined as a sudden decline in renal function[ 43 160 161 162 et al 162 et al 163 11 10 Heatstroke is often accompanied by electrolyte imbalances, as evidenced by a study involving individuals with exertional heatstroke, in which 91% developed AKI along with various electrolyte disturbances, including hyponatremia and hypokalemia[ 164 165 The trend of the increasing incidence of nephrolithiasis can be attributed to climate change-related temperature increases[ 166 167 168 169 Occupational exposure, at-risk populations, and AKI incidence The effect of heat stress on kidney health in vulnerable populations, detailing systemic and organ-specific clinical manifestations, investigation findings, and prognosis supported by scientific literature. Outdoor workers exposed to prolonged high temperatures and physical exertion may present with fever, dizziness, dehydration, fatigue, and hypotension, often exhibiting flank pain, reduced urine output, and peripheral edema. Studies typically reveal elevated creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, decreased estimated GFR (eGFR), and proteinuria, resulting in a high risk of AKI and CKD[ 163 170 168 169 162 164 165 171 170 172 173 175 176 177 1 163 170 179 Table 1 Effect of heat stress on renal function in high-risk populations: Clinical, investigation, manifestations, and prognostic implications  High-risk populations  Systemic clinical manifestations  Organ-specific clinical manifestations  Investigation  Prognosis  Ref.

Study design and population characteristics  Primary methods for heat stress assessment  Primary methods for kidney injury/health assessment  Key findings related to kidney injury/health Koh[ 171 A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among kitchen workers in Kampar, Malaysia WBGT, thermal work limit, ambient temperature, humidity, questionnaire, workload observation Urinalysis dipstick (10 parameters: Leukocytes, nitrites, glucose, potential of hydrogen, protein, ketones, specific gravity, blood, bilirubin, and urobilinogen) preshift and postshift; self-reported kidney-related symptoms In a study conducted across 14 kitchen settings in Kampar, WBGT was recorded at 27.2 ± 1.0 °C, exceeding the recommended action level of 25 °C. These findings classify kitchen workers as being at a medium risk of heat stress. A total of 38.7% of kitchen workers reported symptoms of heat-related illness, with excessive sweating (45.1%), thirst (25.8%), and fatigue (24.2%) being the most commonly reported symptoms. Prolonged exposure to such heat stress conditions may increase the risk of dehydration-related kidney injury, particularly among workers with inadequate fluid intake or preexisting health conditions Venugopal et al 180 A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 442 workers across 18 organized and unorganized workplaces in India WBGT measurements, work intensity judgment by an industrial hygienist, HOTHAPS questionnaire on perceived heat exposure, and coping Self-reported heat-related health effects via A comprehensive evaluation of 18 Indian workplaces, spanning both organized and unorganized sectors, found that most workers were exposed to heat levels exceeding the recommended WBGT thresholds. Those engaged in physically demanding outdoor tasks reported more heat-related health issues, including skin rashes, dehydration, heat syncope, and urogenital discomfort. Statistical analysis revealed considerable associations between workload intensity and adverse health outcomes ( χ P χ P Chapman et al 7 A quasi-randomized crossover experimental trial was conducted involving 13 healthy adult participants Controlled laboratory exercise (2 hours) in heat (39.7 °C, 32% relative humidity) under 4 conditions (control, water, cooling, and water + cooling); core temperature, skin temperature, body weight loss Urinary AKI biomarkers (albumin, NGAL, IGFBP7, and TIMP-2) pre-exercise, post-exercise, 1-hour post-exercise, and 24-hour post-exercise This study is the first to report the distinct urinary biomarker responses of IGFBP7 and TIMP-2 following physical exertion under heat stress conditions. These findings indicate site-specific kidney injury, probably affecting the proximal tubules, where IGFBP7 is predominantly secreted. Occupational heat stress, particularly when accompanied by hyperthermia and dehydration, was found to remarkably elevate AKI biomarkers such as urinary albumin, NGAL, and IGFBP7 in the absence of thermoregulatory interventions such as hydration and cooling Johnson et al 181 This review examines the current literature on the effect of increasing global temperatures on kidney health, focusing on heat-related acute kidney disease and CKD, nephrolithiasis, and Urinary tract infections. Data were drawn from studies involving vulnerable populations such as outdoor workers and elderly individuals, particularly in tropical and low-resource settings Environmental monitoring ( e.g. e.g Monitoring serum creatinine levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate; performing urinalysis to detect proteinuria, hematuria, or crystalluria; and measuring urinary biomarkers such as leukocytes or indicators of tubular injury, electrolyte sodium, and potassium Global temperature rise and renal implications: The global rise in temperature has led to more frequent extreme heat events, increasing health risks. The kidneys are vital for thermoregulation and fluid-electrolyte balance. However, they are highly vulnerable to damage from heat-related stress. Heat-induced AKI: High ambient temperatures can increase the core body temperature, cause dehydration, and increase plasma osmolality. Both clinical and subclinical heatstroke contribute to AKI through rhabdomyolysis, inflammation, and renal hypoperfusion. CKD linked to heat stress: Repeated heat exposure and dehydration can cause progressive tubular damage, resulting in CKD. This may account for the increasing CKD rates in hot regions, especially among laborers with poor access to cooling and hydration Glaser et al 173 This review provides a global perspective with particular emphasis on rural agricultural communities residing in hot-climate regions Review of existing literature; analysis of temperature trends in CKD epidemic regions Discussion of CKD of nontraditional origin epidemics; proposed pathophysiology of heat stress nephropathy A novel form of CKD, unrelated to traditional causes such as diabetes and hypertension, has been increasingly identified among populations exposed to repeated occupational heat stress and inadequate hydration. This condition, often referred to as CKD of nontraditional origin, has shown geographic clustering in hot, rural regions such as Central America, South Asia, and parts of Africa, primarily affecting manual laborers with limited access to rest, shade, and clean water. Climate change is believed to exacerbate the problem through rising temperatures and more frequent extreme heat events, along with reduced water availability AKI: Acute kidney injury; CKD: Chronic kidney disease; HOTHAPS: High Occupational Temperature Health and Productivity Suppression; IGFBP7: Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 7; NGAL: Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin; TIMP-2: Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2; WBGT: Wet-bulb globe temperature. Heat stress and CKD Recurrent episodes of AKI, particularly those induced by heat-related illnesses, can considerably contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of CKD. Prolonged exposure to high ambient temperatures and chronic dehydration remain pivotal drivers of this serious condition. Numerous epidemiological and occupational health studies have increasingly documented CKD prevalence in hot-climate regions, even among individuals without traditional risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension, indicating a novel climate-sensitive nephropathy[ 173 177 182 A study conducted in Taiwan demonstrated that patients exposed to high ambient temperatures over extended periods-either continuously or intermittently at an increased risk of developing CKD, with an incidence rate of 8.83% compared with 4.38% after 13 years of follow-up[ 182 Emerging global data further support the need to widen the geographic focus when evaluating heat stress-related kidney disease. In Latin America, particularly along the Pacific Coast of Central America, a phenomenon termed CKD of nontraditional causes has been recognized, affecting thousands of sugarcane and agricultural workers. A landmark study in El Salvador demonstrated that 20%-30% of male laborers in the sugarcane industry developed CKD, with recurrent subclinical AKI episodes believed to play a causative role[ 181 183 181 183 7 Pathophysiologically, repeated AKI episodes induce nephron dropout, promote renal interstitial fibrosis, and impair tubular regeneration capacity. This sequence results in maladaptive repair processes, progressive glomerulosclerosis, and a decline in renal functional reserve. Studies in animal models and human histopathology confirm that heat stress leads to glomerular hypoperfusion, increased oxidative stress, and microvascular rarefaction, all of which accelerate renal parenchymal scarring[ 169 178 Additionally, a pivotal study conducted in Nicaragua reported a remarkable association between outdoor manual labor and CKD incidence, with workers from brick manufacturing facilities exhibiting elevated creatinine levels and reduced eGFR after heat wave exposure[ 184 179 185 186 187 180 7 Older adults represent another vulnerable population. During a heat wave, individuals aged ≥ 65 years experienced a disproportionate increase in hospitalizations and mortality, with renal dysfunction being a key contributor. Reduced thirst sensation, impaired renal concentrating ability, and baseline comorbidities exacerbate susceptibility to heat-induced AKI[ 174 188 189 Future directions Considering the growing effects of global warming on kidney health, future research should emphasize integrative approaches to mitigate the burden of heat stress-induced renal dysfunction. Clinically, it is imperative to develop risk stratification models that combine environmental exposure data, patient comorbidities, and physiological parameters to proactively identify high-risk individuals, particularly outdoor workers, elderly individuals, pregnant women, and those with preexisting CKD. From a mechanistic perspective, further investigation of the protective role of HSPs (HSP27, HSP60, HSP70, and HSP90) is warranted to clarify their contributions in maintaining renal cellular homeostasis under thermal stress. Identifying reliable biomarkers-such as NGAL, IGFBP7, and TIMP-2-may facilitate earlier detection and monitoring of kidney injury in vulnerable populations. A truly effective response to heat stress-induced kidney injury requires a deeply integrated, multidisciplinary framework that brings together both core and complementary disciplines. Nephrologists play a vital role in clarifying the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of heat-induced kidney injury and optimizing clinical management, including the identification and validation of early biomarkers for heat-related renal dysfunction. Environmental scientists contribute by improving the accuracy of localized heat exposure forecasting, quantifying the effects of urban heat islands, and characterizing environmental cofactors that exacerbate renal stress. Public health professionals are integral to the design and implementation of targeted interventions, including population-level heat adaptation strategies, early warning systems, and occupation-specific safety guidelines for vulnerable outdoor workers. In parallel, other specialties provide essential extensions to this foundation. Surgical and transplant teams are crucial for managing irreversible kidney failure, especially in resource-limited regions. Obstetricians address heat-related renal risks in pregnant women, a uniquely susceptible population. Geriatricians manage age-related renal vulnerability and tailor interventions for elderly individuals. Artificial intelligence improves early detection and personalized risk stratification through real-time data integration. Stem cell therapies hold promise for renal tissue regeneration in the aftermath of cumulative injury. Furthermore, traditional and complementary medicine may support functional recovery through culturally appropriate, integrative strategies that promote hydration, reduce oxidative stress, and improve physical and mental resilience. The synergy among these diverse disciplines not only strengthens diagnostic, prognostic, and preventive efforts but also advances equitable, long-term functional recovery-strengthening the need for holistic, climate-adaptive kidney health systems in a warming world. On a broader scale, interdisciplinary efforts must focus on the integration of heat-related kidney protection into clinical guidelines, occupational health policies, and national public health programs. The implementation of heat alert systems, hydration strategies, and education campaigns is vital to reducing the incidence of heat-related AKI and chronic kidney injury. Collaborative research frameworks across nephrology, environmental science, and public health will be essential to address this emerging global health challenge. CONCLUSION This review underscores heat stress-intensified by the ongoing rise in global temperatures, as exemplified by 2024 being the hottest year on record-as a significant and multifactorial contributor to renal pathology, including AKI, CKD, and nephrolithiasis. The pathophysiological mechanisms implicated include dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and activation of neurohormonal pathways such as the RAA system and ADH axis. At the molecular level, HSPs exhibit a dual role: While they provide cytoprotection under transient stress, their dysregulation during prolonged exposure may promote maladaptive cellular responses, inflammation, and fibrosis. Vulnerable populations-including outdoor laborers, the elderly, pregnant individuals, and those with pre-existing renal impairment disproportionately affected. In light of these findings, there is an urgent need for integrated clinical and public health responses. This includes increased clinical vigilance, risk stratification, and targeted education, as well as policy interventions aimed at environmental risk mitigation, occupational safety reform, and public health preparedness. Furthermore, the development and implementation of early detection tools, such as validated renal biomarkers, and the promotion of interdisciplinary research are critical to advancing preventive strategies. A globally coordinated effort across clinical, policy, and research domains is essential to address the escalating burden of heat-related kidney disease and mitigate its anticipated impact on global health systems.
