Millions of people worldwide suffer from chronic and devastating autoimmune disorders, challenging contemporary medicine. These disorders develop when the immune system attacks its own tissues, causing inflammation and damage. Traditional treatments have focused on widespread immunosuppression, which can relieve symptoms but has serious adverse effects and does not address immunological dysregulation. This review discusses the current and future trends in immunotherapy for the management of autoimmune diseases, including advancements such as CAR T-cell therapy, bispecific antibodies, next-generation immune checkpoint modulators, targeted cytokine therapies, and microbiome-based interventions. The discussion is grounded in current scientific literature, focusing on mechanisms of action, recent breakthroughs, limitations, and potential future directions. Each of the related sections presents cutting-edge advancements, current challenges, and future opportunities for research and clinical translation. autoimmunity immunotherapy CAR T-cells bispecific antibodies checkpoint modulators cytokine therapy microbiome interventions The authors declare that no financial support was received for the research, and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-in-acceptance Autoimmune and Autoinflammatory Disorders : Autoimmune Disorders 1 Introduction Autoimmune diseases represent a significant challenge in modern medicine, being chronic and debilitating conditions affecting millions of individuals worldwide. These diseases occur when the immune system targets the body’s own tissues, leading to inflammation and tissue damage ( 1 2 Conventional therapy for autoimmune diseases has primarily focused on broad immunosuppression, which can alleviate symptoms but often has significant side effects and does not address the underlying immune dysregulation ( 3 5 6 7 8 This review focuses on recent breakthroughs in immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases, including the adaptation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy, the development of bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), advancements in next-generation checkpoint inhibitors, targeted cytokine therapies, and microbiome-based interventions. Each of the related sections presents cutting-edge advancements, current challenges, and future opportunities for research and clinical translation. 2 Chimeric antigen receptor T-Cell therapy in autoimmune diseases CAR T-cell therapy has shown promise against treatment-resistant autoimmune diseases ( 9  Figure 1 7 Figure 1 CAR T cell production model. Leukapheresis of the patient is the first step in producing CAR T cells, followed by T cell activation and enrichment. To help introduce and occasionally permanently integrate the CAR transgene, activated T cells are transduced (e.g., by a lentiviral vector). After expansion in either static or dynamic culture, gene-modified T cells are cryopreserved and reinfused into the patient. This figure is adapted from ( 10 https://BioRender.com/1glnsej Flowchart depicting the CAR T cell therapy process. Steps include: 1) Leukapheresis: blood collection from a patient. 2) T cell selection and activation. 3) Genetic modification with a virus to create CAR T cells. 4) CAR T cell expansion. 5) Quality control check. 6) Conditioning therapy and CAR T cell infusion. Dose ranges are specified for diseases: SLE and SS (~1 million cells/kg), Myositis/Dermatomyositis (10 million or 25 million total cells). 2.1 Breakthroughs Recent studies show that CD19 CAR T-cell therapy can induce drug-free remission in refractory SLE and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, with only mild, short-lived cytokine release syndrome as a well-tolerated side effect ( 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22  Table 1 Table 1 CAR-T cell therapy currently in clinical trials for autoimmune diseases.

As with all therapeutic agents, CAR T-cell therapy entails some risk of adverse events like CRS, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, and B-cell aplasia ( 31 32 6 2.3 Future directions One potential avenue involves generating universal or “off-the-shelf” CAR T cells using CRISPR/Cas9 genome-editing techniques to create allogeneic T cells that lack endogenous T-cell receptors and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) to prevent graft-versus-host disease and host rejection ( 33 34 35 36 37 38 40 3 Bispecific antibodies for immune modulation bsAbs are engineered molecules that can simultaneously engage 2 distinct targets, providing a unique mechanism of action that modulates immune responses more precisely than traditional monoclonal antibodies ( 41 42 43 3.1 Breakthroughs Several in vivo 44 45 + 46 45 Furthermore, A study demonstrated the first use of blinatumomab, a bispecific anti-CD3/CD19 antibody, as a B-cell depletion therapy for systemic sclerosis, revealing profound B-cell depletion with no increase in infection risk, along with an improvement in clinical manifestations ( 47 bsAbs offer mechanistic advantages over monoclonal antibodies by enabling simultaneous modulation of multiple immune pathways ( 48 49 50 51 In the context of T1D, a bsAb targeting both cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) on T cells and Glucose Transporter Type 2 (GLUT2) on pancreatic β cells has shown potential in preserving β-cell function. By binding to GLUT2 on pancreatic cells and interacting with CTLA-4 on autoreactive T cell, it can promote tolerance and delay the onset of diabetes without apparent adverse effects, thus providing a potential therapeutic strategy for T1D ( 52 NCT06812988  Table 2 Table 2 Bispecific antibodies currently in clinical trials for autoimmune diseases.

With such approaches, conditionally active bsAbs may need inflammatory biomarkers or a particular tissue microenvironment to be activated ( 43 56 57 58 4 Next-generation checkpoint inhibitors Inhibitory pathways, like programmed cell death-1 (PD-1), CTLA-4, and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), are crucial for maintaining the balance of tolerance to self and prevention of autoimmune pathology through the inhibition of overactive T cells ( 59 60 61  Figure 2 Figure 2 Checkpoint schematic pathway. Mechanisms of LAG-3, Tim-3, TIGIT, and VISTA inhibitory pathways in T cells: (A) (B) (C) (D) 62 63 https://BioRender.com/r2iqbmx Illustration showing pathways involved in the inhibition of TCR signaling and activation. Four immune checkpoint receptors depict different interactions: LAG-3 with KIEELE and EP motifs, Tim-3 with phosphorylated Y256, TIGIT with IL-10 and IL-12 involvement, and VISTA with SH2 and SH3 domains. Arrows indicate activation of PI3K and inhibition of TCR signaling. APC, CD4, and other molecules are labeled. 4.1 Breakthroughs LAG-3 is an immune checkpoint receptor that inhibits T-cell activation, proliferation, and contributes to immune homeostasis. In autoimmune-prone animal models, genetic deletion or pharmacologic blockade of LAG-3 exacerbates disease severity, underscoring its immunoregulatory role ( 64 + 65 NCT03965533 NCT02195349 NCT03893565 IL-17A IL-17F IFNγ S100A12 66 NCT06637865 Tim-3, an immune checkpoint receptor that is highly expressed on immune cells and induces immunological tolerance by suppressing T cell activation and promoting apoptosis. Tim-3 and MHC-II dysregulation are associated with MS and other autoimmune diseases. Mechanistically, Tim-3 suppresses MHC-II–mediated autoantigen presentation and CD4+ T-cell activation by downregulating MHC-II expression in macrophages via the STAT1/CIITA signaling axis. In murine models of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), overexpression of Tim-3 reduced MHC-II levels and ameliorated disease severity, while its inhibition led to increased MHC-II expression and worsened clinical outcomes. These findings suggest that targeted modulation of the Tim-3 and MHC-II pathway, potentially through Tim-3 agonists, may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for restoring immune tolerance in MS ( 67 68 TIGIT is a newly identified co-inhibitory receptor, that modulates the immune system. CD226 promotes positive signals, whereas TIGIT transmits negative signals, forming a route comparable to the CD28/CTLA-4 signaling pathway ( 69 70 71 72 73 73 In a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, VISTA, a novel negative checkpoint receptor, functions as a negative immune regulator, thereby preventing excessive immune activation ( 74 75 76 + + + 77 78 77 4.2 Challenges There are major obstacles to the therapeutic promise of next-generation checkpoint agonists. Of primary concern is the risk of extended immunosuppression, which may lead to opportunistic infections or malignancies in recipients ( 79 + 80 77 73 81 82 4.3 Future directions Next-generation approaches, focusing on the tissue-restricted or cell-targeted delivery of checkpoint modulators, are being developed to tackle the above issues. Nanoparticle-based systems and antibody-drug conjugates are being evaluated for the localized delivery of PD-1 or CTLA-4 agonism to inflamed tissues such as pancreatic islets or synovial membranes to minimize systemic exposure ( 83 84 81 5 Targeted cytokine therapies Cytokines are considered key mediators in the immune system, regulating the recruitment, activation, and differentiation of various immune cells ( 85 86 5.1 Breakthroughs Monoclonal antibodies targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines have revolutionized the treatment of autoimmune diseases, offering precision without broad immunosuppression. Among the most widely used are IL-6 inhibitors, such as tocilizumab and sarilumab, which have demonstrated clinical efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and giant cell arteritis ( 87 88 89 Box 1 90 91 92  Table 3 Box 1 FN-γ neutralization in primary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Primary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) results from a defect in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells' abilities to kill infected cells by perforin-mediated cytotoxicity. The uncontrolled activation of CTL and NK cells increases cytokine production that, in turn, hyperactivates macrophages and induces cytokine storm, where IFN-γ plays a particularly key role in the development of HLH. Emapalumab is a monoclonal antibody that functions by neutralizing IFN-γ by blocking its activity. It helps to reduce the excessive inflammation and immune activation associated with HLH. This therapeutic approach highlights the potential of IFN-γ inhibitors (e.g., Emapalumab) in managing macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), a severe complication of autoimmune diseases ( 89 Table 3 Cytokine based therapy currently in clinical trials for autoimmune diseases.

A major reason is cytokine redundancy, wherein, since most cytokines have overlapping functions, blockade of a single cytokine leads to the compensatory upregulation of parallel pathways ( 93 94 95 Candida 96 97 5.3 Future directions The above barriers have led to multifunctional approaches to next-generation cytokine therapies. Dual-cytokine inhibitors that target 2 cytokines synergistically are an interesting tool. An example is bimekizumab, which inhibits IL-17A and IL-17F, leading to superior efficacy over IL-17A blockade alone in psoriasis and spondyloarthropathies ( 98 99 100 101 102 6 Microbiome-based therapy Microbiome-based therapy has recently become a promising approach in immunotherapy. The human gut microbiome is a major regulator of immune function. The microorganisms that populate the gastrointestinal tract greatly influence immune development, tolerance, and responsiveness ( 103 104 105 106 107 6.1 Breakthroughs Probiotics and prebiotics are interventions designed to modulate immune responses through dietary measures. Preclinical studies that include animal models and in vitro Lactobacillus rhamnosus Bifidobacterium longum Ruminococcaceae Lachnospiraceae 108 109 110 111 Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) now shows great promise in autoimmune contexts, particularly in ulcerative colitis (UC) ( 112 Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Akkermansia muciniphila 113 114 115  Table 4 Table 4 Microbiome - Clinical trial no.

The predominant obstacle constitutes individual variation, wherein every person has a unique microbial fingerprint shaped by genetics, environment, diet, and antibiotic use. Thus, some therapies may work for an individual or cohort but be useless, or worse, harmful, to another ( 116 117 118 119 120 121 6.3 Future directions The future of microbiome therapeutics is in precision modulation interventions targeted to the individual’s specific microbial and immunological landscape. Next-generation sequencing and metagenomic profiling allow for the deep characterization of microbial communities and their functional potential and the identification of dysbiosis biomarkers and predictive response signatures ( 122 in situ 123 124 7 Conclusion Immunotherapy for autoimmune diseases is undergoing a transition, shifting from immunosuppression to immune modulation. This trend can be observed in the advanced fields of CAR T-cell therapy, bsAbs, checkpoint agonists, cytokine targeting, and microbiome interventions, which reflect a new system of rapid change in therapeutics. Each has distinct advantages but presents challenges to safety, cost, scale, or regulatory approval. The future integration of such therapies into certified care as they advance in preclinical and clinical studies will depend on interdisciplinary research, technological refinements, and personalized approaches concerning patients’ various immune profiles (  Figure 3 Figure 3 Innovative Horizons in Next-Generation Therapeutic Approaches for Autoimmune Diseases. This figure demonstrates the emerging schemes directed at immune modulation. These include CAR T-cell therapy, bispecific antibodies, next-generation immune checkpoint modulators, targeted cytokine therapies, and microbiome-based interventions, representing the foreground of therapeutic advancement in autoimmunity.
