Animal handling followed regulatory compliance under the approved Texas Tech University IACUC protocol number 19021‐02. A total of 64 female C3H mice were obtained at 4 weeks old from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and allowed 1 week to acclimate. Mice were housed four per cage under controlled temperature and humidity and in 12 h‐light/dark‐cycle rooms. Half of the mice were then given a high‐fat casein (HFC) diet (46% kcal fat) and the remainder were given a reference (CC) diet (11% kcal fat), for up to 18 months. Diets and water were supplied ad libitum for the duration of the study. Mice were weighed and given assessments of health weekly. At cross‐sectional time points of 6, 12, and 18 months, three mice were sacrificed from each diet group via CO 2 16 2.3 Chromatographic Conditions The liquid chromatography system used in this study was a Shimadzu CBM‐20A Nexera X2 series LC system (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a degasser (DGU‐20A), two binary pumps (LC‐30AD), an autosampler (SIL‐30AC), and a column oven (CTO‐30A). The autosampler was maintained at 10°C. Various chromatographic conditions were evaluated by modifying the column type, mobile phase, temperature, and separation gradient to optimize the separation of oxysterols. When a 150 mm C18 column (Acquity Premier Vanguard FIT BEH 1.7 µm, 150 × 2.1 mm C18) was used, two mobile phase systems were explored: an ACN/water system and an MeOH/water system. ACN/water mobile phase system consisting of mobile phase A (MPA, 0.1% formic acid in water) and mobile phase B (MPB, 0.1% formic acid in ACN). The chromatographic flow rate was set at 0.4 mL/min. The gradient elution program started with 75% of MPB for the first 2 min, then 98% MPB at 15 min maintained until 23 min, then returned to 75% MPB at 23.1 min until the end of the run at 25 min; the MeOH/water mobile phase system consisting of MPA (0.1% formic acid in water), and MPB (0.1% formic acid in MeOH). The chromatographic flow rate was set at 0.3 mL/min. The gradient elution program started with 75% MPB for the first 2 min, 98% MPB at 22 min, and was maintained to 30 min. Then return to 75% MPB at 30.1 min and keep that until the end of the chromatographic run at 33 min. When a 100 mm C8 column (Acquity UPLC BEH C8 1.7 µm, 100 × 2.1 mm column from Waters) was used, the same mobile phase system components were used as described for the C18 column. In both mobile phase systems, the gradient elution program started with 70% of MPB for 0.5 min, 80% MPB at 8.5 min, and 98% MPB by 9 min and was maintained until 10.5 min, then returned to 70% MPB at 10.6 min and maintained until the end at 12 min. The chromatographic flow rate was set at 0.4 mL/min. 10 µL oxysterol samples and 5 µL cholesterol samples were injected in all experiments. Column temperatures at 25°C, 40°C, and 55°C were evaluated. 2.4 Mass Spectrometry Conditions The mass spectrometric system consisted of a SCIEX QTRAP 6500+ mass spectrometer (Redwood, CA, USA) equipped with a Turboionspray ionization source. Quantitative mass spectrometric conditions equipped with positive ion electrospray ionization in MS/MS detection. The gas parameters included nebulizer gas at 50 psi, auxiliary gas at 60 psi, curtain gas at 45 psi, and CAD gas set to medium. The ion spray voltage of the source was set to 5500 V, and the temperature was set to 550°C. The compound‐specific parameters were listed in Table S1 2.5 Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry Analysis Liver and brain tissues were lysed in Pierce IP lysis buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor (one Roche cocktail tablet per 10 mL buffer) and butylated hydroxytoluene (5 mg/mL) in DMSO at a tissue‐to‐buffer ratio of 100 mg: 500 µL. The mixture was homogenized using a mechanical probe in a 2.0 mL round‐bottom centrifuge tube for 30 s at 10 000 rpm. Cholesterol and oxysterol primary stocks were made in chloroform at a concentration of 1 mg/mL, stored at −80°C. All working stock solutions and further dilutions were also made in MeOH and stored at −20°C and used within 15 days. Isotopically labeled IS stock solutions were prepared and handled in similar fashion. The calibration curve standards as well as quality control (QC) standards were prepared in MeOH with 0.1% formic acid at concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 ng/mL for each oxysterol, and 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL was used for cholesterol. The concentrations of low‐quality control (LQC) standard, medium‐quality control (MQC) standard, and high‐quality control (HQC) were prepared at 15, 150, and 600 ng/mL for each oxysterol and were prepared at 1.5, 15, and 150 µg/mL for cholesterol. Each 85 µL CC/QC sample or 85 µL tissue homogenate was spiked with 10 µL of IS mix (500 ng/mL d7/d6 each labelled oxysterol and 50 µg/mL for cholesterol d7) and 5 µL BHT (100 mg/mL in DMSO). Then 100 µL of LC‐MS grade MeOH and 200 µL of dichloromethane (DCM) were added to this and thoroughly mixed on the benchtop vortex mixer for 1 min. 100 µL of LC‐MS grade water was added to the mixture and vortexed for 10 s, then the glass tubes were kept at room temperature for 15 min for phase separation. Then the samples were centrifuged at 4000 × g 2.6 Computational Methods Calculations model the relative retention times (RT) of oxysterols in terms of predicted hexane:water partition coefficients logP hw 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 3 Result and Discussion 3.1 Chromatography Optimization 3.1.1 Selectivity of C18 Versus C8 Columns Reversed‐phase high‐performance liquid chromatography (RP‐HPLC) relies on hydrophobic stationary phases, typically composed of alkyl chains. C18 columns, with longer chains, exhibit greater hydrophobicity compared to C8 columns, which can influence separation efficiency and selectivity. While analytes generally elute in order of increasing hydrophobicity, oxysterol isomers often exhibit unexpected selectivity differences between C18 and C8 columns. In our experiments, we observed differing selectivity for isomer pairs on C8 (Figures 2A–C 3A–C 2D–F 3D–F 2A–F 3A–F 2A–F 3A–F HW S2 R S 2D–F 3A–C FIGURE 2 Separation of oxysterols using an acetonitrile mobile phase under different column types and temperatures. FIGURE 3 Separation of oxysterols using a methanol mobile phase under different column types and temperatures. 3.1.2 Column Temperature Column separation temperature has a large effect on retention, selectivity, and column efficiency and has long been accepted as an important parameter in liquid chromatography (LC). Despite this fact, temperature optimization has not been very actively utilized in the past. The temperature impact on analyte retention and selectivity differs with each analyte and depends on the properties of the mobile and stationary phases. The relative RTs of 7α‐OHC and 7β‐OHC are highly sensitive to column temperature. Our results indicate that their separation improves at lower column temperatures (Figure 2C,F 2C,F 3C,F R S 2C,F 3C,F S S S2 R S 3.1.3 Solvent System Selectivity ACN and MeOH are the most frequently used organic solvents in RPLC, but their different polarities can lead to distinct separation patterns for the same analytes. The primary factor is the solvent's “elution strength,” which describes its ability to remove analytes from the stationary phase; a stronger solvent will elute analytes faster. ACN is generally considered a stronger eluting solvent than MeOH, meaning it will elute analytes faster at the same concentration. The solvent system had a relatively minor effect on the separation of the sterol ring oxidized cholesterol 7α‐/7β‐OHC and 5,6α‐/5,6β‐EC isomer pairs, with MeOH (Figure 3A–F 2A–F R S S R 2C,F S R 3.7.4| Summary Overall, a lower column temperature at 25°C provided better separation for most of the oxysterols that we have studied. At this column temperature, we achieved the best separation of 7α‐ and 7β‐OHC on a C8 column in an ACN‐based mobile phase (Figure 2C 3F 2F R S S S S R Together, these findings highlight the critical role of optimizing column selectivity, column temperature, and mobile phase composition in achieving reliable separation of oxysterol isomers using reversed‐phase HPLC. Such optimization is essential for accurate quantification in biological samples. 3.2 Oxysterol Levels in Brains of Reference‐Diet and High‐Fat Diet Mice The C3H mouse strain is a robust model for studying obesity in a long‐term chronic model for age‐related, DIO [ 16 In the study by Barr and Gollahon [ 16 n n 4 5 FIGURE 4 Liver cholesterol and oxysterol concentration. Note the changes in concentrations for the oxysterols as demonstrated by changes in the Y Based on our optimized LC‐MS method measurement to achieve the best separation of all eight oxysterol isomers at a low column temperature of 25°C, cholesterol levels in the liver and brain remained relatively consistent across different ages and diet groups, showing small variations. However, cholesterol levels detected in the brain are approximately 10 times higher than in the liver. In contrast, the levels of 7α‐OHC, 7β‐OHC, 7‐KC, and 27‐OHC were comparable between brain and liver tissues. Slight variations were observed across different age and diet groups; however, these differences were not statistically significant (Figure 4 5 FIGURE 5 Brain cholesterol and oxysterol concentration. Note the changes in concentrations for the oxysterols as demonstrated by changes in the Y 24 S 5 S S S S Additionally, 5,6α‐EC levels in the brain decreased with increasing age only if the mice were on a high‐fat diet. In contrast, in the liver, 5,6α‐EC level increased with age only on high‐fat diet, thus it influenced by both age and dietary factors 4 Conclusion At a low column temperature of 25°C, 7α‐ and 7β‐OHC achieved the best separation on both the C8 and C18 columns using an ACN‐based mobile phase, while 5,6α‐ and 5,6β‐EC were well resolved on a C18 using either an ACN‐ or MeOH‐based mobile phase. Optimal separation of 24 R S S The follow‐up computational prediction of oxysterol chromatographic behavior, based on current examples, will be expanded to a broader range of lipids using machine‐learned RT models. This approach has the potential to advance de novo RT prediction across various chromatographic methods and, in turn, guide more effective optimization of separation conditions.
