Methods Data were collected from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority Data Collaboration Laboratory (HADCL) from 2000 to 2020. Cox proportional hazards regression, survival tree, LASSO Cox regression, boosting, and random survival forest (RSF) were utilized to develop predictive models for survival. Key risk factors were identified through Shapley Additive Explanations analysis, whereas the AutoScore‐Survival package facilitated the development of a risk scoring system. Results This cohort study included 2047 uterine cancer patients with T2D. The average survival time was 100.82 (standard deviation: 72.75) months. The RSF model demonstrated the strongest predictive performance, achieving a time‐dependent area under the curve (AUC) of 0.823 and a C Conclusion This study leveraged machine learning to identify key survival predictors and develop a clinically interpretable risk scoring system for uterine cancer patients with T2D. Key predictors, including age at cancer diagnosis, duration of T2D, creatinine levels, serum potassium levels, LDL‐C levels, BMI, and triglycerides levels, effectively stratified survival risk. These findings demonstrate the potential of data‐driven models to enhance individualized prediction and inform targeted clinical management. diabetes mellitus machine learning random survival analysis risk score uterine cancer pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  C.

A meta‐analysis of prospective cohort studies showed that diabetes was associated with around an 81% increased risk of uterine cancer [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 Some studies attributed the relationship between T2D and uterine cancer to their shared risk factors, such as obesity, physical inactivity, and aging [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 15 16 18 19 6 7 20 21 Existing prognostic studies have explored the impact of different risk factors on the survival of uterine cancer, considering reproductive factors, physical inactivity, hypertension, and family history of uterine cancer (especially among close relatives) [ 22 23 24 4 25 Traditional statistical methods have limitations in analyzing high‐dimensional datasets that integrate diverse risk factors and outcomes. Machine‐learning (ML) techniques offer a promising solution by enabling the identification of complex patterns and relationships in large datasets [ 26 2 Methods 2.1 Study Design and Data Source This retrospective, territory‐wide cohort study utilized data from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority Data Collaboration Laboratory (HADCL) [ 27 28 2.2 Study Population and Data Collection The study population comprised adult patients diagnosed with both uterine cancer and T2D between 2000 and 2020. Uterine cancer cases were identified using the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition (ICD‐O‐3) and the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD‐10, code C55) [ 29 30 31 To ensure accuracy, only patients with uterine cancer listed as their “principal diagnosis” in the Diagnosis Progress dataset were included. Patients diagnosed with other cancers, type 1 diabetes, or gestational diabetes, as well as those lost to follow‐up, were excluded. The index date was defined as the date of uterine cancer diagnosis, with patients followed until death or the study endpoint (December 2020). Mortality data, including deaths occurring within or outside public hospitals, were sourced from the Hong Kong Death Registry. Other data included laboratory test results, medication details, procedures, and health behavior variables closest to the uterine cancer diagnosis date. These baseline measurements were used for analysis to ensure consistency and to reflect patients' physiological status at a clinically relevant stage. Variables with less than 90% completeness were excluded, and missing data for the remaining variables were imputed using the k‐nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm. To standardize data, nonbinary variables were transformed into dummy variables, and continuous variables were categorized based on clinically relevant thresholds. 2.3 Statistical Methods and Modeling Baseline patient characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics. Cox proportional‐hazards (CoxPH) regression was employed to assess the relationship between individual variables and survival time, with Kaplan–Meier curves plotted for significant predictors to visualize their effects. A multivariable Cox regression model was then used to identify independent predictors of survival, adjusting for confounders and potential interactions. For survival prediction analysis, five ML algorithms were implemented: CoxPH model, penalized Cox model with LASSO penalty, CoxBoost, survival tree (ST), and random survival forest (RSF). Data were split into 70% for training and 30% for testing. The characteristics for patients in the training set were contrasted with patients in the testing set, and the chi‐squared test or Fisher exact test was used to assess the validity of random distribution as appropriate. Hyper‐parameter optimization for the ML models was performed using a grid search strategy (details provided in the Supporting Information C 2.4 Risk Scores Development An interpretable risk scoring system was developed using AutoScore‐Survival, an extension of the AutoScore framework tailored for time‐to‐event outcomes. AutoScore‐Survival integrates Cox regression modeling and ML to generate parsimonious survival models using right‐censored data [ 32 β Individual risk scores were calculated by summing the scores for selected variables, resulting in a total risk score ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores corresponded to greater mortality risk. AutoScore‐Survival also allowed for customization of cutoff points based on clinical standards, ensuring alignment with professional norms and real‐world applicability. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted on the training set to evaluate overall model performance, with AUC values calculated. To assess predictive accuracy at specific time points, time‐dependent AUC (AUC( t C 2.5 Ethical Approval This study was approved by the Survey and Behavioral Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (approval no. SBRE‐22‐0303A) and the joint CUHK and NTEC Clinical Research Ethics Committee (CREC) (2024.423). As the data utilized in this retrospective analysis were de‐identified and contained no personal details, the committee waived the requirement for informed consent. 3 Results 3.1 Patient Characteristics The cohort included 2047 uterine cancer patients with T2D. Patient characteristics, laboratory results, and treatment details are summarized in Table S1 2 Regarding comorbidities, 1714 patients (83.73%) had central obesity, 121 (5.91%) had coronary heart disease, and 106 (5.18%) had a history of stroke. Laboratory test results revealed a mean cholesterol level of 4.54 mmol/L (SD: 0.96 mmol/L), mean HbA1c of 7.21 mmol/L (SD: 1.30 mmol/L), and mean fasting glucose of 7.56 mmol/L (SD: 2.16 mmol/L). In terms of treatment regimens, 199 patients (9.72%) were using insulin, 1719 patients (83.98%) were on antidiabetic medications, 1634 patients (79.82%) were prescribed antihypertensive drugs, and 1219 patients (59.55%) were receiving anti‐lipid drugs. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the training and test datasets. 3.2 Survival Analysis The survival functions estimated using Kaplan–Meier analysis are shown in Figure 1 S2 p p p p p p p p p p p p p p FIGURE 1 Kaplan–Meier curve plots for significant variables in univariable Cox regression.

In this study, we found that the RSF model outperformed all other ML algorithms, including CoxBoost, CoxPH, CoxNet, and ST models, and showed the best predictive performance for predicting the prognosis of uterine cancer patients with T2D, with the highest mean AUC and the best C 4.2 Possible Explanations and Comparisons With Previous Literature Our findings underscore the significant role of various risk factors and the developed risk score system in predicting survival among uterine cancer patients with T2D. Specifically, the association of age at diagnosis with increased mortality risk corroborates findings from previous studies [ 4 4 33 34 35 A longer duration of T2D has been associated with an increased risk of mortality. Prior research has similarly identified an association between prolonged diabetes duration and increased mortality risk, with a relative risk of 3.98 for women with diabetes duration exceeding 13 years compared to nondiabetic counterparts [ 4 36 37 22 38 36 Serum potassium, triglycerides, and creatinine levels emerged as significant predictors of survival in this cohort. Elevated serum potassium levels have been implicated in various cancer types and may have prognostic implications, particularly when altered by immunotherapy [ 39 40 41 42 43 43 44 4.3 Strengths and Limitations This study possesses several strengths. First, the large sample size of 2047 uterine cancer patients with T2D enhances the statistical power and generalizability of our findings. Second, the use of both univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses highlighted significant risk factors, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive patient evaluation. Third, the integration of multiple ML algorithms facilitated the development of a robust predictive model for survival outcomes, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to traditional approaches. Last but not least, the practical and interpretable risk score system proposed in this study allows for straightforward application in clinical practice. However, several limitations should be acknowledged. Notably, the study did not include variables that may potentially influence survival, such as tumor subtype, FIGO stage, or histologic subtype, treatment modalities, and adherence to treatment guidelines due to the unavailability of the data in the dataset [ 45 4.4 Implications for Practice and Research The developed risk score system offers a systematic method for stratifying patients based on individual risk profiles, enabling personalized medical strategies. Healthcare professionals can use this system to provide evidence‐based recommendations, such as lifestyle modifications for patients with elevated BMI, to improve clinical outcomes. As diagnostic and treatment practices continue to evolve, future updates using contemporary data will be essential to maintain the model's accuracy and applicability across changing patient populations. For research, the incorporation of ML algorithms in our predictive model underscores the potential of advanced analytical techniques in cancer research, suggesting avenues for future studies in various cancer types. Furthermore, the limitations identified in this study emphasize the necessity for ongoing research. Future studies should aim to incorporate more complete clinical data—including tumor characteristics and treatment‐related variables—to refine the risk score system and evaluate the added value of ML across broader uterine cancer cohorts. Moreover, the development of an open‐access web calculator could support clinical implementation and allow further testing of model generalizability across populations. By performing ML prediction models, this population‐wide cohort study retrospectively assessing 2047 uterine cancer patients with T2D found that the RSF model outperformed all other ML algorithms, including CoxBoost, CoxPH, CoxNet, and ST models. Age at cancer diagnosis, duration of T2D, BMI, and creatinine were found to be positively associated with the risk of mortality and identified central obesity to be negatively associated with the risk of mortality. A risk score system was developed with 31.4% of patients categorized as high‐risk, which corresponded to a 5‐year survival probability of 43.5%. Further studies are expected to assess the applicability and validity of our risk score system in different settings and investigate the underlying mechanisms further.
