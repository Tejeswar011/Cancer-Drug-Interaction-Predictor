Cav-1 is expressed in various cells, especially in white adipocytes and endothelial cells. Cav-1 plays an important physiological role in regulating substance transport, signal transduction, and multiple metabolic pathways in the body. Autophagy degrades damaged organelles within cells and recycles them, thus playing an important role in maintaining homeostasis of the internal environment. Previous studies have found that Cav-1 is involved in the occurrence and development of multiple systemic diseases by regulating autophagy. In addition, autophagy can also affect the expression level of Cav-1 by degrading it. Therefore, there is a close regulatory relationship between Cav-1 and autophagy. Based on recent research progress, this article provides a detailed overview of the importance of the crosstalk between Cav-1 and autophagy in various systemic diseases such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and digestive systems. It aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the interaction between Cav-1 and autophagy, in order to promote further research and achieve clinical applications as soon as possible. caveolin-1 autophagy disease mechanisms molecular regulation signaling pathways National Natural Science Foundation of China 10.13039/501100001809 The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

The caveolin family comprises three members (Cav-1, Cav-2, Cav-3). Structurally, all caveolins adopt a hairpin-like topology, and all isoforms contain the core structural domains: an “N-terminal oligomerization domain (residues 1-101)”, a “scaffolding domain (residues 82-101)”, and a “C-terminal transmembrane domain (residues 135-178)”. Cav1 and Cav2 sequences are 60% homologous and mainly expressed in non-muscle tissue, while Cav3 is 65% homology to Cav1 and mainly expressed in striated muscle tissue ( 1 3 4 7 8 9 10  Figure 1 3 11 12 2 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Figure 1 The protein structure of caveolin and the subcellular distribution of Cav-1. (A) (B) Diagram showing the structure and localization of caveolin-1. Part A illustrates the caveolin-1 protein embedded in a lipid bilayer, with labeled regions: scaffolding domain, intermembrane domain, and tyrosine 14 (Typ14). Part B shows caveolin-1 (Cav-1) present in endothelial cells, adipocytes, and fibroblasts. Autophagy is a metabolic process that plays an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, regulating nutrient metabolism and energy production, and resisting internal environmental imbalances caused by diseases. Autophagy is a process of catabolism that plays an important role in regulating metabolism and maintaining internal environmental. Autophagy can be divided into three types: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) ( 20 21 22 23 24 25 28 29 30 In recent years, multiple literatures have reported the crosstalk between Cav-1 and autophagy which has been proven to play a role in multiple systems such as cardiovascular, digestive, respiratory, urinary, mammary reproductive, and endocrine systems. These diseases share pathological hallmarks such as oxidative stress, metabolic dysregulation and inflammation, which are centrally modulated by Cav-1-autophagy interactions. In order to enable researchers to fully understand the research progress on the relationship between Cav-1 and autophagy, and to promote the clinical application and translation of research results, we provide a review of the impact of the interaction between Cav-1 and autophagy on the occurrence and development of various systemic diseases. 2 Cav-1 and autophagy in cardiovascular diseases Researches have found that in cardiovascular diseases, the targets regulated by Cav-1 and autophagy are mainly ECs and cardiomyocytes. Cav-1 regulates autophagy in ECs, affecting oxidative stress, metabolism, inflammatory response levels, and deposition of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) beneath the endothelium, thereby affecting vascular function. Multiple studies have shown that the absence of Cav-1 can activate autophagy ( 31 34 31 31 33 32 32 28 28 6 29 35 11 11 In addition to acting on ECs, Cav-1 can also target cardiomyocytes and cardiomyoblasts to affect myocardial function by regulating autophagy. By observing the ultrastructure of cardiomyocytes from Cav-1 knockout mice, numerous large autophagosomes have been found in some cardiomyocytes which indicating increased autophagy in these cells ( 36 in vitro 37 38 39  Figure 2 Figure 2 Cav-1 and autophagy in cardiovascular diseases. In endothelial cells, Cav-1 modulates autophagy, oxidative stress, and metabolic reprogramming. Cadmium may promote autophagy at low concentrations by severely interfering with caveolae and reducing Cav-1 levels. Deletion of Cav-1 reduces atherosclerosis and inflammation by promoting the release of ATG5 from caveolae and activating autophagy. SS impairs mitophagy through the Cav-1/miR-7-5p/SQSTM1 axis, leading to oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Under high glucose conditions, the acetylation of Cav-1 (caused by less nuclear translocation of Sirt6) hinders the recognition of LC3B by Cav-1, inhibits autophagic degradation, promotes LDL transport and vascular lipid deposition. In GDM, suppressed AMPK-mTOR-PIK3C3 pathway inhibits CAVIN1-LC3B-mediated autophagic degradation of Cav-1. Notably, the interaction between different domains of Cav-1 and LC3B regulates autophagy in a bidirectional manner (inhibiting when bound to CSD and activating when bound to IMD). In cardiomyocytes, decreased expression of Cav-1 can activate autophagy and aggravate cardiac hypertrophy or cardiac dysfunction.

Flowchart illustrating the effects of Cav-1 on endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes in the circulatory system. It shows pathways including autophagy, oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and atherosclerosis formation. Various models, from bovine aortic ECs to diabetic models, depict cellular processes like autophagic flux, mitophagy, and endothelial dysfunction. In cardiomyocytes, models demonstrate effects on myocardial hypertrophy and dysfunction. Key molecules like miR-7-5p, SGSTMI, and TRPC1 are involved, impacting cellular processes and disease progression. 3 Cav-1 and autophagy in respiratory diseases In recent years, studies have found that Cav-1 plays an important role in the occurrence and development of respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hyperoxia induced lung injury, and pulmonary fibrosis by participating in autophagy of lung epithelial cells. Deletion of Cav-1 has been shown to increase starvation induced autophagy in Beas-2B cells, a type of human bronchial epithelial cell. The potential mechanism is that Cav-1 can bind to ATG5, ATG12, ATG12-ATG5 complex, and LC3B in Beas-2B, and regulate the expression of ATG16L. However, knockdown of Cav-1, starvation, and other stimuli can lead to dissociation with these complexes, and activated ATG12-ATG5 complex subsequently triggers autophagy, thereby aggravating lung epithelial damage ( 40 41 42 in vivo ( 43 44 in vitro 45 46 in vivo 46 In the study of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH), it has been found that Cav-1 can also participate in regulating autophagy of pulmonary vascular related cells. Lee SJ et al. have found that in PH, the expression levels of autophagy protein LC3B and its transcription factor Early growth response-1 (Egr-1) are increased in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) and human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC). Under normoxia, Cav-1 can colocalize with LC3B and Egr-1 on the cell membrane, while under hypoxia, Cav-1 can dissociate from LC3B and Egr-1, accompanied by activation of autophagy. This suggests that Cav-1 may be involved in the early stages of autophagy during PH ( 47 In addition, Cav-1 can also act on lung cancer-related cells, altering tumor progression and patient prognosis by affecting autophagy processes. In cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a decrease in Cav-1 expression can upregulate the transcriptional activation of its downstream molecule E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) and the expression of mitophagy marker BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), leading to metabolic changes and inducing metabolic reprogramming pathways in tumor cells ( 48 49 50 50 Cav-1 and autophagy are also involved in the process of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in lung cancer. In cisplatin-treated lung cancer cells, mitochondrial stress signaling has been induced, and excessive mitochondrial dysfunction triggers the activation of mitophagy, thereby attenuating the pro-apoptotic effect of cisplatin on A549 cells and leading to the occurrence of drug resistance. However, this process may involve the Cav-1/Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 1 (ROCK1)/Parkin axis. The expression levels of Cav-1, ROCK1 and Parkin in lung cancer cells treated with cisplatin are increased, and Cav-1 knockdown can inhibit ROCK1, downregulate Parkin related mitophagy. Therefore, intervening in the Cav-1/ROCK1/Parkin axis can improve resistance to cisplatin in cancer treatment by inhibiting mitophagy ( 51 52  Figure 3 Figure 3 Cav-1 and autophagy in respiratory diseases. Knockdown of Cav-1 enhances the formation of the ATG12-ATG5 complex in lung epithelial cells, thereby promoting autophagy and leading to cellular damage. In COPD, Cav-1 modulates the equilibrium between apoptosis and autophagy by altering LC3B-Fas interactions. When the balance is disrupted, it leads to a simultaneous increase in autophagy and apoptosis, In contrast, in the hyperoxia-induced lung injury model, disruption of the Cav-1/Fas axis results in divergent changes in autophagy and apoptosis. During ALI, Cav-1 knockout enhances autophagy by inhibiting AKT/mTOR and activating the AMPK pathway, thereby alleviating inflammation. In pulmonary hypertension (PH), Cav-1 dissociation from LC3B/Egr-1 under hypoxic conditions triggers autophagy and exacerbates disease progression. In lung cancer, resveratrol promotes the formation of the Fas/Cav-1 complex, initiating apoptosis via autophagy activation. Furthermore, Cav-1 mediates resistance to cisplatin and radiotherapy by regulating the ROCK1/Parkin/mitophagy axis or IRGM/autophagy pathways, respectively; targeting these mechanisms can potentially reverse treatment resistance.

It covers pathways in lung epithelial cells, lung injury models, lung vascular cells, and lung cancer cells, highlighting effects of treatments like starvation, COPD, hyperoxia, ALI, and various compounds. Key elements include Cav-1, LC3B, ATG5-ATG12, AMPK, AKT/mTOR, IRGM, ROCK1, and parkin, with effects on autophagy, apoptosis, inflammatory factors, and mitochondrial damage, influencing cell survival and resistance mechanisms. 4 Cav-1 and autophagy in digestive diseases Previous studies have shown that Cav-1 can act on digestive organs such as liver, stomach and colorectum by regulating autophagy. The role of Cav-1 and autophagy in the liver is mainly reflected in reducing lipid accumulation and inflammatory response. Cav-1 expression is reduced in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) mice and L02 cells treated with alcohol and oleic acid (A/O). Mechanistically, Cav-1 overexpression alleviates autophagy inhibition by suppressing Akt/mTOR signaling, and then degrades lipid droplets and reduces liver steatosis ( 53 54 55 56 In addition, Cav-1 can play roles in various digestive tumors by regulating autophagy. Studies on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) suggest that Cav-1 can inhibit autophagy, promote proliferation, migration and angiogenesis of cancer cells. The clinical data has also revealed that expression level of Cav-1 is positively correlated with the malignancy of HCC and negatively correlated with the overall survival and recurrence time of patients ( 57 58 59 60 61 62  Figure 4 Figure 4 Cav-1 and autophagy in digestive diseases. In the NAFLD, Cav-1 knockdown has been shown to aggravate lipid deposition by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway and inhibiting autophagy. In an acetaminophen-aggravated alcoholic fatty liver disease model, Cav-1 knockdown inhibits PINK1/parkin-mediated mitophagy, leading to increased lipid accumulation and exacerbated liver injury. SPIONs can enhance autophagy and alleviate LPS-induced liver injury through activation of the Cav-1/Notch1/HES1 pathway. In intestinal fibrosis, overexpression of Cav-1 inhibits autophagy and reduces fibroblast activation by promoting SQSTM1/p62 accumulation. In digestive tumors, Cav-1 inhibits HCC autophagy and promotes HCC proliferation and metastasis. Specifically, in gastric cancer, the circBIRC6/miR-488/GRIN2D axis upregulates Cav-1 expression, which subsequently inhibits autophagy and promotes tumor progression. In advanced CRC, Cav-1 promotes disease progression by inhibiting the AMPK/autophagy pathway and enhancing glycolysis. Notably, in BRAF V600E CRC, HSPA8 facilitates CMA-mediated degradation of Cav-1, thereby activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and driving disease progression.

Each section represents different experimental models or conditions like NAFLD, APAP-treated AFL, and TGF-B1-treated fibroblasts, displaying the regulatory impact on disease mechanisms. 5 Cav-1 and autophagy in endocrine diseases The regulation of autophagy and Cav-1 plays a certain role in endocrine diseases such as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, diabetes, congenital lipodystrophy and abnormal fat metabolism. Analysis of microarray data and experimental verification obtained from Cav-1 knockdown NIT-1 cell lines and mouse islets have indicated that Cav-1 can inhibit the proliferation and promote the production of pro-apoptotic cytokines. In the protein microarray, it has also been found that autophagy-related factors such as LC3A, LC3B and p62 are altered, but the change trend is inconsistent. Therefore, further research is needed on the mechanisms involved ( 63 64 65 66 9 67 68 69  Figure 5 Figure 5 Cav-1 and autophagy in endocrine diseases. In Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, reduced expression of Cav-1 results in diminished levels of LC3B-II and suppressed autophagic activity. Overexpression of Cav-1 mitigates DACD by enhancing mitophagy via the activation of AMPK signaling pathway, and PINK1 and ULKI pathways. In Cav-1 deficient mice and humans, loss of Cav-1 induces autophagy activation and facilitates protein degradation. Conversely, overexpression of Cav-1 in obesity models inhibits bone formation by promoting mitophagy and oxidative stress through inhibition of the Sirt1/FOXO1 and Sirt1/PGC-1α pathways.

Diagram of endocrine system models showing disease and cell models. The disease model includes Hashimoto's thyroiditis with decreased Cav-1 and LC3B-II leading to reduced autophagy. T2DM model shows Cav-1 overexpression increasing p-AMPK, resulting in increased mitophagy and alleviation of DACD. Obesity mice model and FFA-treated osteoblasts show increased Cav-1 and interaction with Sirt1, affecting mitophagy, oxidative stress, and osteogenesis. The cell model includes Cav-1 deficient adipocytes and shCav-1 adipocytes, where autophagy increases, leading to protein degradation. 6 Cav-1 and autophagy in neurological diseases Cav-1 and autophagy affect the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the function of astrocytes by acting on cerebral vascular ECs and astrocytes, thereby regulating the integrity of cerebral vascular and neural functions, and participating in the occurrence, development, and treatment of related diseases such as cerebrovascular diseases and cranial nerve dysfunction. Crucially, Cav-1 and autophagy engage in bidirectional regulation. On the one hand, Cav-1 as an autophagy inducer: Under ischemic injury or oxidative stress, Cav-1 undergoes phosphorylation at Tyr14. The phosphorylated Cav-1 binds to the BECN1/VPS34 complex and translocates into mitochondria, where it further induces autophagy, thereby alleviating cerebral infarct damage in a mouse cerebral ischemia model ( 70 71 Cav-1 and autophagy can influence the progression of stroke by disrupting tight junction proteins (TJPs). The integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is highly dependent on TJPs, including Claudin-5, ZO-1, and Occludin. Previous studies have shown that in stroke, Cav-1 and autophagy are key factors in the disruption of these proteins. In brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) from stroke patients, Cav-1 mediates the endocytosis and autophagic degradation of TJPs. Upregulation of Cav-1 promotes the endocytosis and cytoplasmic translocation of Claudin-5 and ZO-1 from the cell membrane ( 72 73 72 74 75 75 72 1 2 76 73 74 In summary, Cav-1 and autophagy form a tightly interconnected regulatory axis that critically governs BBB integrity and neurovascular function in stroke through their bidirectional interaction and modulation of TJPs. This multifaceted involvement positions the Cav-1–autophagy axis as a highly compelling therapeutic target for stroke intervention (  Figure 6 Figure 6 Cav-1 and autophagy in neurological diseases. p-Cav-1 interacts with the BECN1/VPS34 complex to induce autophagy, thereby alleviating brain injury in cerebral ischemia models. However, under conditions of high lipid exposure or PA stimulation, autophagy-mediated degradation of Cav-1 is enhanced, leading to astrocyte apoptosis and inflammation. In hypoxic conditions, activation of autophagy in cerebral microvascular endothelial cells mitigates hypoxia-induced blood-brain barrier dysfunction by regulating the redistribution and degradation of claudin-5 and promoting Cav-1 degradation. In the OGD model simulating ischemia, increased NO levels can promote Cav-1-mediated redistribution of claudin-5 and enhance autophagy-lysosomal-dependent degradation of claudin-5, which contributing to the disruption of the internal blood-brain barrier. Reperfusion hyperglycemia induces autophagy activation, resulting in increased Cav-1-mediated translocation and lysosomal degradation of ZO-1, thereby exacerbating brain injury.

Flowchart of pathological models in the nervous system. It shows various conditions like ischemia, hypoxia, and high glucose affecting different cell types. These lead to processes such as autophagy and degradation of Cav-1, resulting in outcomes like brain injury alleviation, inflammation promotion, apoptosis, and blood-brain barrier breakdown. 7 Cav-1 and autophagy in urinary diseases Cav-1 and autophagy play a role in the occurrence and development of urinary system diseases such as prostate cancer (PCa), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), tubulointerstitial fibrosis and kidney stones. Cav-1 plays a tumor-promoting role in PCa. Cav-1 secreted by PCa cells can stimulate cell proliferation and promote angiogenesis ( 77 78 79 80 80 81 82  Figure 7 Figure 7 Cav-1 and autophagy in urinary diseases. In prostate cancer, Cav-1 facilitates tumor proliferation and angiogenesis via conventional exosomal secretion and autophagy-dependent pathways. In ccRCC, TRPM3 promotes tumor growth by activating the CAMKK2/AMPK/ULK1 pathway, thereby enhancing autophagy. While, the expression of TRPM3 is regulated by miR-204 and Cav-1 which is another target of miR-204. In a model of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis, RAB7 knockdown and Cav-1 knockdown increase MMP-2 activity, thereby enhancing ECM degradation and alleviating fibrosis.

Hypoxia-treated renal proximal tubular epithelial cells show effects of RAB7 and Cav-1 knockdown on MMP-2 activity and ECM accumulation, affecting renal fibrosis. 8 Cav-1 and autophagy in breast and reproductive diseases Among breast related diseases, reports on Cav-1 and autophagy mainly focus on breast cancer. Autophagy enhancement and downregulation of Cav-1 expression have been observed in human breast cancer cell lines and cancer tissues, and these two changes were mutually regulated. On the one hand, autophagy activation leads to the degradation of Cav-1 in tumor cells, resulting in downregulation of Cav1 expression; On the other hand, Cav-1 deficiency can activate autophagy by promoting lysosomal function and autophagy lysosome fusion, thereby providing survival advantages for breast cancer cells, facilitating cell survival under stress conditions such as starvation, and thus promoting the development of cancer ( 83 84 85 86 87 In addition to tumor tissue itself, tumor microenvironment is also the key to affect the invasion and metastasis of breast cancer. Cancer cells recruit supportive stromal cells from nearby endogenous tissue to promote tumor formation, making them an important component of the tumor microenvironment. When hypoxia or oxidative stress occurs during tumor growth, autophagy of the tumor matrix is activated, providing nutrients for tumor cells and reshaping the tumor microenvironment. Autophagy activation leads to the degradation of Cav-1 in tumor stromal cells ( 88 89 90 90 91 92 88 90 91 93 97 98 Cav-1 and autophagy have also been found to be associated with reproductive system diseases. Zeng et al. have demonstrated that low expression of Cav-1 and high expression of the autophagy marker ATG4C independently indicate reduced overall survival in epithelial ovarian cancer patients, and a positive correlation between Cav-1 and ATG4C protein expression in cancer cells and stromal cells is confirmed, so Cav-1 and ATG4C may serve as monitoring targets or signaling molecules for tumor progression. However, only statistical analysis of clinical data and immunohistochemistry analysis have been performed in this study, and no in-depth mechanism research is conducted on the relationship between Cav-1 and autophagy ( 99 100  Figure 8 Figure 8 Cav-1 and autophagy in breast and reproductive diseases. In breast cancer, the downregulation of Cav-1 enhances tumor cell survival by facilitating lysosomal-autophagy fusion. The reduction in p-Cav-1 influences tumor progression by promoting mitophagy via interactions with Mfn2 and Drp1, or by activating autophagy through the ROCK/AMPK signaling pathways. E2 can stimulate tumor cell growth by enhancing the activation of the HMGB1/Cav-1 pathway, thereby promoting autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis. SA exerts an antitumor effect in breast cancer by suppressing Hif-1α/Cav-1 signaling, which subsequently inhibits autophagy. When CAFs are co-cultured with breast cancer cells, increased oxidative stress induces autophagy in CAFs and accelerates Cav-1 degradation, thereby promoting tumor cell survival. The decline in Cav-1 levels can also enhance glutamine secretion and remodel the metabolic microenvironment. In ovarian cancer, BRCA1 mutations can activate stromal autophagy and promote Cav-1 degradation, which driving metabolic coupling between stromal and epithelial cells.

The chart also illustrates the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and BRCA1-null ovarian cancer cells in influencing tumor microenvironment through oxidative stress, glutamine production, and stromal epithelial metabolic coupling. 9 Cav-1 and autophagy in blood diseases So far, the research on Cav-1 and autophagy in diseases of blood system is still very limited, and the relevant content is only mentioned in two articles on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and osteosarcoma. CML is a malignant myeloproliferative tumor characterized by the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome caused by the reciprocal translocation t ( 9 22 94 101 102  Figure 9 Figure 9 Cav-1 and autophagy in blood diseases. When realgar NPs act on CML cells, the overexpression of Cav-1 can enhance autophagy activity, increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to treatment, and inhibit cell proliferation. In the context of osteosarcoma resistance mechanisms, the expression of Cav-1 is downregulated in taxol-resistant human osteosarcoma cells, while the autophagy level is elevated via activation of the PI3K/AKT/JNK signaling pathway, thereby promoting drug resistance.

Right: Taxol-resistant human osteosarcoma cells show decreased Cav-1, increased PI3K/AKT/JNK pathway, increased autophagy, and increased Taxol resistance. 10 Cav-1 and autophagy in other diseases In addition to participating in the above-mentioned systemic diseases, Cav-1 is also related to the pathogenesis of other diseases. Cav-1 is involved in the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (SSc). In Castello Cros et al.’s study, it has been found that Cav-1 expression is lower in affected tissues of SSc patients compared with normal tissues, and restoration of Cav-1 expression in vitro -/- -/- 103 104 105  Figure 10 Figure 10 Cav-1 and autophagy in other diseases. In SSc, the low expression of Cav-1 can activate autophagy/mitophagy and enhance the infiltration of inflammatory cells. In the glaucoma model, acteoside inhibits autophagy and protects RGC by up-regulating Cav-1 and activating PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Adhesion ability is decreased and autophagy markers are increased in Cav-1 deficient TM cells. PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; AKT: protein kinase B; RGC, retinal ganglion cell. Flowchart illustrating “Other Systems\": Left, systemic sclerosis mice model shows decreased Cav-1, promoting autophagy, mitophagy, and increased inflammatory cell infiltration. Center, glaucoma model with acteoside administration leads to increased Cav-1, activating PI3K/AKT, reducing autophagy and oxidative stress, and relieving RGC loss. Right, Cav-1-deficient TM cells show decreased Cav-1, leading to reduced adhesion ability and increased expression of autophagy-associated markers. 11 Conclusion This review systematically explores the complex interactions between Cav-1 and autophagy in cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, endocrine, nervous, urinary, breast and reproductive, blood systems, and other diseases (such as systemic sclerosis and glaucoma) (  Figure 11  Table 1 Figure 11 The Cav-1-autophagy interaction modulates the pathogenesis of diseases across multiple organ systems – including cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, endocrine, nervous, urinary, breast and reproductive, and blood through common mechanisms such as oxidative stress, inflammatory cascade, metabolic reprogramming, and cell barrier function.
