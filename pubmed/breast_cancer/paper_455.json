All three models performed well, with some improvement with the re-estimation of predictor coefficients. Models have the potential to improve clinical decision making, and future research should evaluate their clinical effect. Background Patients with kidney failure undergoing noncardiac surgery are at high risk of adverse cardiac events and mortality; however, existing perioperative risk prediction tools for these outcomes are not valid in these patients. Recently, three models were developed from a kidney failure cohort in Alberta, Canada. In this study, we evaluated these Alberta models in a kidney failure cohort that had surgery in Manitoba, Canada. Methods The cohort included adults from Manitoba, Canada (18 years or older), with preexisting kidney failure (eGFR <15 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 Results We identified 12,082 surgeries performed in 4175 participants; 569 outcomes were observed (4.7%). All three models performed well with both approaches, with AUC-ROC ranging from 0.821 (model 1) to 0.874 (model 3) using the models with Alberta coefficients. Calibration slopes were 1.32, 1.40, and 1.24 for models 1, 2, and 3, respectively. On refitting, AUC-ROC ranged from 0.830 (model 1) to 0.861 (model 3). Calibration slopes approximated one across all the re-estimated models. Brier scores remained <0.1 across all original and re-estimated models. Conclusions Our external validation study confirmed that the kidney failure specific postoperative outcome models developed in Alberta, Canada, performed well in a geographically distinct Canadian population. Future research should explore the performance of these models in different settings and evaluate their clinical effect with prospective implementation. cardiovascular events chronic kidney failure ESKD kidney failure mortality mortality risk prediction modeling Canadian Institutes of Health Research Foundation grant Navdeep Tangri Canadian Institutes of Health Research Foundation grant pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes OPEN-ACCESS TRUE SDC T Read-along YES Introduction Adverse events from surgical procedures lead to more than 4 million deaths annually and are the third leading cause of mortality. 1 2 3 3 6 Enhanced care during the perioperative period, which encompasses the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative phases of surgery, is crucial for ensuring patient safety and optimizing outcomes. By making informed decisions during this period, health care providers can significantly mitigate the risk of postsurgery complications. Effective perioperative risk prediction tools can provide information to inform strategies to mitigate adverse outcomes postsurgery, leading to improved patient safety and recovery. Several risk prediction tools are available to predict morbidity and mortality in adult patients undergoing major noncardiac surgery for the general population. North American preoperative risk stratification guidelines 7 8 9 10 To address the limitations of these risk prediction tools, three models to predict major clinical events for people with kidney failure having surgery were developed and internally validated using the Alberta Kidney Disease Network (AKDN) database. 10 10 Methods Data Sources and Study Design Manitoba Health (MH) is a publicly funded health insurance agency providing comprehensive health insurance, including coverage for hospital and outpatient physician services, to the province's 1.3 million residents. Coverage is universal, with no eligibility distinction based on age or income, and participation rates are very high (>99%). 11 12 13 We used the MH Population Registry, which captures addresses, dates of birth, death, and health insurance coverage for all insured persons, to identify the source population. We used the Hospital Discharge Abstract Database and Medical Services Database (MSD) to obtain information on surgeries and comorbidities. Since 1971, the Discharge Abstract Database records virtually all services provided by hospitals in the province, including admissions and day surgeries. 12 14 We followed the transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis-artificial intelligence (TRIPOD+AI) 15 Supplemental Table 1 Cohort Definition The Manitoba Centre for Health Policy (MCHP) databases were used to create a cohort of adult patients (18 years or older) with kidney failure (both nondialysis and dialysis), who underwent an inpatient or outpatient noncardiac surgical procedure between April 1, 2007, and December 31, 2019. The CCI 14 Supplemental Table 2 10 Study Population We defined kidney failure as either in receipt of maintenance dialysis or by eGFR. Dialysis recipients were defined by receipt of chronic KRT (hemodialysis, PD; Supplemental Table 3 2 16 17 e.g Outcome The outcome was defined as a composite of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest or ventricular arrhythmia, and all-cause mortality, within 30 days of the index procedure, as per validated algorithms. This aligned with the outcomes defined by Alberta models ( Supplemental Table 4 10 Predictors We identified demographic characteristics such as sex and age from the MH Population Registry. Surgeries were categorized into 11 surgery types based on CCI codes. The surgery setting was classified using the HAD as an outpatient, inpatient elective, or inpatient emergency. Chronic conditions and other comorbidities including history of AMI, cancer, chronic pulmonary disease, dementia, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, liver disease, peripheral vascular disease, and stroke were identified using the HAD and MSD. These were based on validated algorithms of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification and Canadian adaptation of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes 18 Supplemental Table 3 Sample Size For external validation sample size, we estimated that a minimum of 9831 surgeries with 305 outcome events would be necessary based on a conservative estimated outcome rate of 3.1% (from the original Alberta study 10 19 10 Statistical Analysis Descriptive analyses were conducted to understand the characteristics of the cohort. This included the calculation of mean, median, interquartile ranges (IQRs), and SD for continuous variables and counts and percentages for categorical variables. We assessed the performance of all the three risk prediction logistic models developed using the AKDN database on Manitoba data by ( 1 2 We evaluated the performance of the models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR), 20 21 22 23 24 Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (9.4) and Python (v. 3.9.13). The analysis was performed using Scikit-learn, a Python-based library. 25 Results Cohort Characteristics We identified 12,082 surgeries performed in 4175 participants (Figure 1 1 Figure 1 Cohort flow diagram.

Threshold Analysis Supplemental Table 5 Model Performance with Re-Estimation of Predictor Coefficients We developed a logistic regression prediction model incorporating the same predictors as those used in the Alberta models and allowed coefficients and intercepts to vary. Supplemental Table 6 Supplemental Figure 1 Furthermore, the Brier scores were consistently low across all three models. DCA DCA shows that all models demonstrated a similar positive net benefit when compared with strategies where all or none of the participants received a perioperative cardiac monitoring intervention ( Supplemental Figure 2 Threshold Analysis Supplemental Table 7 Discussion In this external evaluation of a series of prediction models, we demonstrated that models developed in Alberta that use routinely available data from administrative health data or claims can predict postoperative events for people with kidney failure with high accuracy. The models in their original form were excellent at discriminating between those who would and would not experience the outcome. Model calibration was strong throughout, except for overestimation at the highest predicted risks. Taken together, these findings from a separate Canadian province suggest that the Alberta models generalize to external settings and may be useful to help patients and providers determine the risk of perioperative events for people with kidney failure. Furthermore, re-estimation of model predictor coefficients leads to some improvements in performance, suggesting that this may be an approach other jurisdictions may take to ensure optimal performance in their setting. Most patients facing major surgery are appropriately concerned about the risk of adverse perioperative outcomes. In the setting of elective surgery, an estimate of the risk of AMI, cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmia, and all-cause mortality within 30 days may provide balance and inform the decision of patients and providers to move forward with the surgery or forego the procedure and consider a conservative approach. Alternatively, risk mitigation measures or other perioperative interventions may be tied to this risk estimate to ensure people at highest risk receive care in alignment with their risk. Existing risk prediction tools may not adequately consider the specific variables associated with kidney failure, which can lead to underestimation or overestimation of risk. The RCRI is a commonly used tool that provides perioperative cardiac risk assessment and management guidelines for patients undergoing noncardiac surgery and is recommended by our national perioperative cardiovascular risk management guidelines. 7 8 26 27 28 To the best of our knowledge, this research describes the first external evaluation of prediction models that predict the risk of major cardiac events and death for people with kidney failure having noncardiac surgery. Our results provide impetus to pursue further testing of the clinical effect of these tools once implemented in clinical practice. As implementation was considered from initial development and all three models contain variables that are readily available in electronic medical record (EMR) or claims systems, it would be feasible for many health systems to implement these tools depending on the degree and intensity of variable availability. Alternatively, these tools could be organized into a risk calculator and used at the point-of-care. The major difference in this setting would be that the variables would be identified using patient self-report or clinician entry based on their knowledge of the patient's history. The performance of these tools if used in this way should be evaluated, although we suspect that they would still perform well given the nature of the comorbidities and other variables included. It is also notable that while these models are accurate and actionable, models 2 and 3 require a large number of variables, making them potentially more complex to implement if not embedded in an EMR with automatic variable capture. Future efforts could focus on developing more parsimonious models and comparing the performance against the models presented here, using either regression or machine learning techniques. Ideally, these risk tools should be tied to perioperative interventions to modify or reduce the risk of poor postoperative events. It is unlikely that merely providing a risk estimate to the patient and clinicians would affect clinical decision making or outcomes, as was the case in a recent randomized controlled trial of providing 1-year mortality risk estimates within an EMR to clinicians caring for patients with hospitalized heart failure. 29 A noteworthy strength of our study was that we used data from the MCHP databases, which provided a large and population-based cohort for our study. We used a comprehensive and population-based cohort to evaluate models developed in a distinct Canadian province, which does provide evidence that the performance of these models with or without coefficient re-estimation would be acceptable in places with similar surgical and kidney failure populations, and with similar perioperative care. A limitation of this study was that we were unable to include all variables during external validation, as we did not have the ability to identify obesity in the Manitoba data sources. However, the performance of tools both with and without re-estimation was robust to this exclusion, providing further support for model transportability to other settings. In addition, the generalizability of our findings is limited by the lack of international validation, and in future research, we plan to include diverse, global cohorts to confirm the applicability of the results across different health care settings. Although the models did not include variables such as preoperative natriuretic peptides or other intraoperative variables, they still performed well with excellent calibration and discrimination. We acknowledge that postoperative risk may differ substantially between nondialysis and dialysis patients and for kidney transplant recipients as a highly selected group with preoperative cardiac risk stratification. Although these groups are important and potentially may benefit from the development of specific models, the purpose of this study was to validate models that had been developed for a diverse kidney failure population. As these important characteristics are still captured as predictors within these models, the diverse risk associated with them is nonetheless considered. Finally, this study was completed with the assumption that all patients in the testing cohort were unique from the development cohort; there is a very small possibility of patient overlap because of interprovincial migration, but this is unlikely to affect our findings significantly. In conclusion, we successfully externally validated models to predict major cardiac events or mortality in patients with kidney failure undergoing noncardiac surgery using population-based routinely collected data. Given known limitations to existing guideline-recommended tools when used in people with kidney failure such as the RCRI, these models offer an accurate and transportable alternative, allowing for better preoperative planning and personalized care strategies. Future research should evaluate the performance of these tools prospectively and also with randomized study designs when incorporated as part of a perioperative intervention for people with kidney failure.
