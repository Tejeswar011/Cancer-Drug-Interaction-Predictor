The initial presentations are similar to symptoms of benign nasal polyps, such as nasal obstruction, hyposmia and nasal discharge. As the disease progresses, the involvement of the palate, paranasal sinuses, orbit and skin become alarming symptoms. We report a case of a young male with Nasal ENKTL who presented with symptoms similar to acute on chronic rhinosinusitis with orbital complications. The challenges of diagnosing and getting to the correct management pathway are discussed.
