To fully investigate the effects of heat treatment on proteins and lipids in sheep milk, lipidomics and Astral-DIA proteomics combined with parallel reaction monitoring methods were used to analyze the changes of lipids and proteins after heat treatment at 65 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 15 s. A total of 79 and 381 differential lipids and proteins were identified respectively. Lipidomics results show that Triacylglycerol (16:1_17:1_16:2) was unique in raw milk, whereas diacylglycerol (20:1_22:1) was unique in 95 °C group. Choline metabolism in cancer was the core metabolic pathway linked with heat treatment. Additionally, the collagen alpha-3(VI) chain protein (COL6A3), folate receptor-like domain-containing protein (FOLR1), and serpin domain-containing protein (JEQ12_008015) gradually disappeared with increasing heating temperature. The differentially expressed proteins were mainly associated with metabolic pathways. These analysis provide scientific connotation for the production of high quality dairy products and the healthy development of the dairy industry. Highlights • Sheep milk was treated by heating at 65 °C for 30 min and at 95 °C for 15 s. • Heated sheep milk samples were analyzed by lipidomics and DIA proteomics. • Diacylglycerol (20:1:22:1) was unique in the 95 °C group. • The serpin domain-containing protein are greatly affected by heat. • These findings may optimize sheep milk processing for better nutritional quality.

Acetonitrile (ACN), methanol (MeOH), isopropanol (IPA), methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), and formic acid (FA) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). LC-MS grade water and acetonitrile were supplied by Thermo Scientific. Lipid standards were sourced from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, China National Pharmaceutical), mass spectrometry-grade trypsin (Promega, V5280) and acetone (Beijing Chemical Factory) were used. Ultrapure water was generated using a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). 2.2 Sample collection Sheep milk was collected at the Yuansheng Ranch in Jinchang City (Gansu Province, China). The selected sheep are all healthy and disease-free, and in good growth condition. Approximately 15–30, 45–60, 100–120 and 160–180 days after the birth of the lambs, 60 samples were collected at each stage. Ten samples were randomly selected from each of the four lactation groups and mixed to form one biological replicate. These samples were then heated at 65 °C for 30 min and at 95 °C for 15 s. Samples were presrved at −80 °C. 2.3 Lipid and protein extraction For lipid extraction, each sample was defrosted on ice, vortexed for 10 s, and 20 μL was mixed with extraction solvent (MTBE: MeOH =3:1, v To efficiently extract the protein and keep it dissolved and stable, SDT cracking solution (4 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) was added to each sample. Samples were then transferred to eppendorf (EP) tubes, boiled in a water bath, subjected to ultrasonic crushing for 2 min. The supernatant was taken for quantitative analysis by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) Protein Assay Kit (BeyoTime, China). After quality detection and enzymatic hydrolysis, the proteins were subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. After quality detection and enzymatic hydrolysis, the proteins were subjected to LC – MS/MS analysis. 2.4 Lipid LC–MS/MS analysis The extracted sample were examined using an a LC–electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS/MS system. The ESI-triple quadrupole linear ion trap-MS (QTRAP)-MS was coupled to the effluent on an alternate basis (SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA). ESI source running parameters are as follows: source temperature 500 °C, ion source, turbo spray; ion spray voltage (IS), −4500 V (negative) and 5500 V (positive); ion source curtain gas (CUR); the medium was CAD or collision gas. For Triple quadrupole (QQQ) scans results Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) tests were used and the collision gas (nitrogen) were adjusted at 5 psi. Based on the metabolites that flushed throughout each phase, a particular set of MRM transitions was tracked. Each extract was analyzed once. All the samples were mixed in equal volumes to prepare quality control (QC) samples, and a QC sample was inserted after each analysis of 6 experimental samples. The lipid qualitative analysis is based on retention time (RT) and the information of parent and daughter ion pairs. The quantitative analysis adopts the MRM of triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. By selectively screening parent ions and characteristic fragment ions, the specificity and repeatability of detection are significantly improved. All lipid chromatographic peaks are integrated, and peak area correction across samples is performed. The lipid identification is all verified by commercial standards, and used for retention time correction and fragment ion confirmation. 2.5 UHPLC-astral LC/MS DIA The mobile phases A (formic acid (0.1 %) and water (100 %)), and B (formic acid (0.1 %) and acetonitrile (80 %)) were prepared. A orbitrap astral mass spectrometer mass spectrometer was used (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), the ion spray voltage was set to 1.9 kV, the temperature of ion transfer tube was adjusted to 290 °C, and the mass spectrum was acquired in a data dependent acquisition mode, with a full first-stage mass spectrometry scanning range of 380–980 m z Ovis aries 2.6 LC-PRM/MS Two micrograms of each sample was taken for LC-PRM/MS analysis. Chromatographic separation was performed using the nanoliter flow rate Easy nLC 1200 chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The buffer was prepared as follows: Liquid A was 0.1 % formic acid aqueous solution, liquid B was 0.1 % formic acid, acetonitrile and water mixed solution (with 95 % acetonitrile). The peptides were isolated and then subjected to targeted PRM mass spectrometry using a QExactive HF-X mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Secondary mass spectrometry of peptides was performed according to the following methods: Following each complete MS scan, the precursor m z 2.7 Bioinformatics analysis Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted using the prcomp function in R ( www.r-project.org http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/compound/ http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html 2.8 Statistical analysis For the two-group analysis, differential metabolites were identified based on a P t P 3 Results 3.1 Lipid composition of different heat treatment groups A total of 978 lipids were identified by LC-MS/MS. The positive and negative ion mode lipid metabolites of quality control (QC) samples were detected, which showed that there were more ion peaks, the main samples had high peak response intensity, and the separation effect was good. Moreover, the curve overlap in the total ion flow diagram of positive and negative modes of QC samples is high, indicating that the retention time and peak intensity are consistent, indicating that the signal is relatively stable when the same sample is tested at different times (Supplementary material Fig. S1-S4).

Fig. 4 Based on strict statistical criteria ( P Fig. 4 Fig. 4 3.5 GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis of differentially expressed proteins To better understand the potential biological significance of the 381 DEPs, we conducted a systematic pathway enrichment analysis usng Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG).

Fig. 6 Astral-DIA results of differential proteins. Fig. 6 4 Discussion In this study, sheep milk was heated at low temperature (65 °C for 30 min) and high temperature (95 °C for 15 s). In the SM, 65 °C and 95 °C groups, 971, 972 and 969 lipids and 1870, 1800 and 1909 proteins were identified respectively. A total of 79 and 381 differential lipids and proteins were identified respectively. The lipid with the greatest differences among different groups was screened for analysis because it might be related to heat treatment. TG (16:1_17:1_16:2) was unique in the raw sheep milk (SM) group. It might be due to the high temperature that Triacylglycerol (TG) was degraded or converted into glycerol and fatty acids ( Cerk et al., 2018 Korte et al., 2023 Cooke & Kazanietz, 2022 Fig. 3 Beyond lipid composition, we also investigated the effects of heating on the proteins in sheep milk using Astral-DIA proteomics, which has the advantages of good reproducibility and high quantitative accuracy. The analysis found that the relative content of the collagen alpha-3(VI) chain protein (COL6A3), folate receptor-like domain-containing protein (FOLR1), and serpin domain-containing protein (JEQ12_008015) were the most abundant proteins in raw milk but these gradually disappeared with increasing heating temperature. Therefore, we speculate that these three proteins will be greatly damaged in spatial structure or undergo degradation due to the influence of high temperature. Subsequently, targeted verification was carried out through PRM. The fold change between the 95 °C group and SM group were 0.42, 0.68, and 0.81 respectively ( Table 1 Qin et al., 2022 Chao et al., 2020 COL6A3 Wang & Pan, 2020 FOLR1 FOLR2 Holm & Hansen, 2020 Nawaz & Kipreos, 2022 Fig. 5 In summary, this study identified lipids and proteins related to the heat treatment of sheep milk and predicted their respective functions. However, this study also has certain limitations. It has not yet conducted research on different breeds of sheep. Besides, the functions of these lipids and proteins have not been fully studied. The next step is to further verify and explore the functions of these unique lipids and proteins and their relationship with heat treatment, and by setting different gradients of temperature and time to process sheep milk, to find the most suitable processing conditions, thereby improving the processing technology of dairy products. Our findings enhance the understanding of sheep milk while providing a direction for the development of high-quality milk products to support the efficient and rapid development of the dairy industry. 5 Conclusions In summary, 971, 972 and 969 lipids were detected in sheep milk treated at 65 °C for 30 min and 95 °C for 15 s, respectively. TG (16:1:17:1_16:2) was unique in the SM group, while DG (20:1:22:1) was unique in the 95 °C group. In addition, we used DIA proteomic methods to detect 1870, 1800, and 1909 proteins in the SM, 65 °C, and 95 °C groups, respectively, and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses further explored the significant differences in metabolic pathway activity among the different heat-treated samples. These results contribute to the understanding of the effects of different heat treatments on the lipids and proteins in sheep milk, providing insights into the potential development of targeted functional sheep milk products and contributing to the healthy development of the dairy sheep sector.
