Machine learning models are valuable tools for predicting\nor screening STAT3 inhibitors. However, the predictive performance\nand interpretability of existing models still require improvement.\nIn this study, we introduce a fingerprint-enhanced graph (FPG) attention\nnetwork model, which integrates sequence-based fingerprints and structure-based\ngraph representations to predict STAT3 inhibitors. During the feature\nlearning process, the FPG model converts sequence information into\na fingerprint vector, while structural information is encoded into\na separate vector using a graph attention network module.

Among 49 models with various\nrepresentations and algorithm combinations, the FPG-based model achieved\nthe best predictive performance, with an average area under the curve\nof 0.897 on the test set. Furthermore, the model outperformed existing\nprediction models for identifying STAT3 inhibitors.

A wide range of direct small-molecule STAT3 inhibitors have\nbeen\nidentified, targeting STAT3 dimerization or its DNA binding, including\npeptides, peptidomimetics, and oligonucleotides. Recent advances in STAT3 inhibitor discovery include\n(1) virtual\nscreening combined with molecular simulations/docking to identify\ncovalent inhibitors;  It is important to note that machine learning (ML) presents valuable\nstrategies for ligand-based drug design, as it can leverage known\nactivity data to predict new drug candidates. Nonetheless, because\nmany ML algorithms are black-box models, achieving both high predictive\naccuracy and interpretability remains a major challenge in AI-driven\ndrug development. Effective molecular representations are crucial\nfor developing drug discovery models that offer both precision and\ninterpretability. Here we develop a computational model for\npredicting STAT3 inhibitors.\nWe introduce a novel molecular characterization network model, FPG,\nwhich integrates molecular fingerprinting with graph neural networks.\nOur method fundamentally differs from the method related to fingerprints\nand graph neural networks (FP-GNN): https://gzliang.cqu.edu.cn/software/Stat3Pro.html 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Data Source In the PubChem database\n( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/ 2.2 Molecular Representation In this\nstudy, various molecular structural representations ( Figure 1 Schematic representation\nof four commonly used molecular characterization\nmodalities.  (i) Molecular fingerprinting: Three types\nof molecular fingerprints are calculated, including dictionary-based\nfingerprints, path/topology-based fingerprints, and extended connectivity\nfingerprints. These fingerprints are used to represent the molecular\nphysicochemical properties, spatial information, and topological structure.\nAll fingerprints are generated using the RDKit package. (ii) Sequence-based embedding: The SMILES\nstrings, which are used to specify chemical molecules, are first converted\ninto corresponding one-hot encoded vectors. These one-hot codes are\nthen passed through an embedding layer to reduce their dimensionality.\nThe downscaled one-hot codes are sequentially fed into a natural language\nmodel. In this case, we use a multilayer bidirectional GRU layer and\nan long short-term memory (LSTM) to capture the forward and backward\ndependencies within the SMILES strings. A fully connected layer is\nthen used to nonlinearly combine the learned forward–backward\nfeatures of the SMILES strings, completing the training of the chemical\nmolecule attribute prediction model. (iii) Molecular image: To create an image-based\nrepresentation of the molecules, the SMILES strings of all small molecules\nwere first processed using the RDKit software package to convert them\ninto a standardized canonical SMILES format. These canonical SMILES\nstrings were then transformed into 32 × 32 pixel color images\nin RGB format. Each image corresponded to a 32 × 32 × 3\nthree-dimensional RGB data matrix, with pixel values normalized to\nthe range of 0 to 1. These normalized matrices were subsequently used\nas input data for the modeling process. (iv) Molecular graph: A molecular graph\nrepresents small molecules as undirected graphs, where nodes correspond\nto atoms and edges represent chemical bonds. SMILES sequences of small\nmolecules are first converted into graphs using the RDKit package.\nEach node encodes seven types of information (35-dimensional one-hot\nvectors) about an atom, including atom type, number of neighboring\natoms, number of neighboring hydrogen atoms, formal valency, explicit\nvalency, hybridization type, and whether the atom is part of an aromatic\nring. The molecular graph is composed of an adjacency matrix A N N X N N Table (v) Fingerprint-enhanced\ngraph (FPG):\nThe novel molecular characterization proposed combines sequence-based\nfingerprint features with molecular graph-based structural features.\nIn the fingerprint layer, the combination of MACCS and Morgan fingerprints\nis generated from the SMILES sequences of the molecules. The MACCS\nfingerprint is a standard dictionary-based molecular fingerprint consisting\nof 166 SMILES Arbitrary Target Specification (SMART) keys. Each structure\nkey encodes the molecular structure as a binary bit string, where\neach bit corresponds to a predefined substructure or fragment. If\nthe molecule contains the predefined feature, the corresponding bit\nis set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. On the other hand, Morgan\nfingerprints generate a bit vector representation by considering the\nlocal environment of the molecule, with the radius of the environment\ndirectly related to the number of iterations. The combined fingerprint\nfeature vector is then processed through a feed-forward neural network\nto obtain the fingerprint feature vector for each individual molecule.\nFor the molecular graph component, the graphical information is as\ndescribed in Table 1 Atomic Features Used in FPG node feature dimension content atom\ntype 10 C, N, O, P, S, F, Cl, Br, I, Si degree of\natom 6 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 hybridization type 3 Sp, Sp2, Sp3 total Hs 5 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 aromaticity 1 Yes/No formal charge 3 1, 0, −1 explicit valence 7 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 2.3 Model Construction 2.3.1 Graph Convolution Layer As illustrated\nin Figure h  i ′ eq 1 h i ′ = Aggregate ( h i , ∑ j ∈ N ( i ) h j ) h  i h  j N H h  i ′ eq 2 H = Readout ( ∑ i ∈ G h i ′ ) 2 Model architecture of the FPG model. The FPG\nmodel combines molecular\ngraph features (processed by graph attention network) and fingerprint\nvectors (MACCS + Morgan) through a three-layer neural network. These\nfused features are classified via multilayer perceptron to predict\nSTAT3 inhibitors, with multihead attention providing interpretable\natomic contributions. The aggregation operator, Aggregate, represents\nthe fundamental\ncomponent of the message-passing mechanism in eq N F eq 3 h = { h⃗ 1 , h⃗ 2 , ... , h⃗ N } , ⁣ h⃗ i ∈ R F h⃗  i W ( l R  F F eq 4 z⃗ i ( l ) = W ( l ) h⃗ i ( l ) z⃗  i ( l z⃗  j ( l z a⃗ ( l e  ij ( l eq 5 e i j ( l ) = LeakyReLU ( a⃗ ( l ) T [ z⃗ i ( l ) ∥ z⃗ j ( l ) ] ) e  ij ( l j i  ij ( l eq 6 α i j ( l ) = exp ( e i j ( l ) ) ∑ k ∈ N i exp ( e i k ( l ) ) eq 7 h⃗ i ( l + 1 ) = σ ( ∑ j ∈ N i j α i j ( l ) z⃗ j ( l ) ) W eq 8 h ( l + 1 ) = avg ( h ( l + 1 ) , 1 , h ( l + 1 ) , 2 , h ( l + 1 ) , 3 , h ( l + 1 ) , 4 , h ( l + 1 ) , 5 ) 2.3.2 Molecular Fingerprint Layer As\nin Figure eq 9 FP mixed = ( FP Morgan | | FP MACCS ) eq 10 V FP = w · FP + b 2.4 Hyperparameter Optimization In this\nstudy, a Bayesian optimization strategy was used to find the hyperparameter\ncombinations. The FPG model optimized six hyperparameters: Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) Dropout, Head Count, Attention Size, Fingerprint-Enhanced\nNetwork (FPN) Dropout, FPN Size, and GNN Ratio. The hyperparameter\noptimization process was performed by default for 20 iterations, with\nthe best-performing set of hyperparameters and evaluation results\nbeing outputted. To avoid overfitting, a dropout strategy was\nemployed that ignores some of the hidden layer nodes in each training\nbatch with a retention probability between 0.1 and 0.9; an early stopping\nstrategy 2.5 Performance Evaluation Parameters The model’s predictive performance was evaluated using the\nfollowing statistical variables: 11 Acc = TP + TN TP + FP + TN + FN 12 Pre = TP TP + FP 13 Recall = TP TP + FN 14 Spe = TN TN + FP 15 MCC = TP × TN − TP × FN ( TP + FP ) ( TP + FN ) ( TN + FP ) ( TN + FN ) Five-fold cross-validation is applied to trade\noff the bias and variance of the observed performance metrics so that\nthe obtained metrics would be more reliable. 2.6 Application Domain Analysis To define\nthe application domain of the FPG model, we employed a combination\nof structural and physicochemical descriptor-based methods. First,\nwe calculated the Tanimoto similarity between the training set compounds\nand external validation/test set molecules using Morgan fingerprints\nto assess structural coverage. Compounds with similarity scores below\na threshold (<0.5) were flagged as outside the application domain.\nWe also performed principal component analysis on molecular descriptors\nto visualize the chemical space distribution. The application domain\nboundary was delineated using the convex hull method, where molecules\nfalling outside the hull were considered outside the model’s\nreliable prediction scope. The applicability domain was further validated\nby analyzing prediction confidence scores, with low-confidence predictions\n(probability scores near 0.5) indicating potential application domain\noutliers. 2.7 Web Server Implementation Based on\nthe FPG model, we developed an online STAT3 inhibitor activity predictor\ncalled STAT3 Pro. STAT3 Pro uses Nginx as a reverse proxy server to\nhandle and respond to user requests. To implement the basic interaction\nlogic of the user interface, we employed the lightweight web application\nframework Flask. On the frontend, graphical elements and charts are\nrendered using the D3.js library for data visualization of document\noperations. Additionally, the Vue.js framework is used to create a\nresponsive user interface layout. When users submit compound molecular\ndata through the web page, the data is instantly transmitted to the\nserver backend, where it is validated and analyzed for inhibitor activity\nusing the FPG model built on the Pytorch framework. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Training Results Based on the FPG-Based Model We optimized the model’s hyperparameters using a Bayesian\nmethod. As shown in Figure 3 (A) Acc corresponding\nto individual hyperparameters in the hyperparameter\noptimization process and (B, C) the FPG model training process based\non the best hyperparameter combination: (B) loss value change; (C)\nAcc value change. The best performing hyperparameter combination\n(FPN Dropout = 0.5,\nGNN Dropout = 0.5, FPN Size = 550, GNN Ratio = 0.4, Head Count = 0.5,\nand Attention Size = 0.5) was selected for the subsequent five-fold\ncross-validation. As can be seen from the performance changes of the\nFPG model during the training process ( Figure To further validate the model’s robustness, we split the\ndataset into 80% for training and 20% for external validation.

We then performed chemical space analysis using the\nt-SNE  Figure 4 Visualization of t-SNE dimensionality reduction for four feature\nextraction methods (mol2vec, molecule graph, Morgan fingerprint, and\nfingerprint + graph). These results suggest that, in this dataset’s\nchemical space\nanalysis, the coupled representation of molecular fingerprints and\nmolecular graphs outperforms other representation methods. This may\nbe since molecular graphs focus on the distribution of atom and bond\nweights, while the combined molecular fingerprints emphasize extracting\nsubstructure features that significantly contribute to classifying\nactive molecules. The coupling of these two representations allows\nthe model to better uncover the potential relationships between the\nstructural features of inhibitor molecules and their activity. Although\nMorgan fingerprints are typically represented as high-dimensional\nvectors, the distance between fingerprints does not always correlate\nwith the similarity of compounds due to hash collisions. The image-based\nmolecular graphs performed the worst in classification, likely because\nthese images introduce large blank areas without useful information. Therefore, the coupling of molecular fingerprints with graph attention\nmechanisms offers better potential for explaining the structure–activity\nrelationships of drugs, while also providing robust predictive performance. 3.4 Model Interpretability The advantage\nof FPG lies in its dual interpretability, which combines coupled fingerprints\nand graph attention mechanisms. The coupled fingerprints integrate\nstructures extracted based on prior knowledge, allowing the model\nto capture chemically meaningful structural features, such as functional\ngroups and special ring structures. On the other hand, the graph attention\nmechanism, combined with molecular structural topology, provides a\nvisual representation of molecular structure information. In this\napproach, each node represents an atom, and when calculating attention\nscores, the model integrates surrounding structural information. Each\nedge represents a chemical bond, with the score determined by the\nweighted attention scores of the connected atoms. By analyzing the\nattention scores of atoms and bonds, the model reveals the influence\nof molecular substructures on the target property. Based on the number\nof atoms in the molecule, the model automatically identifies and highlights\nthe atoms and bonds that contribute the most to the target property. Using a positive sample molecule from the validation set as an\nexample, Figure 5 Interpretability comparison of four deep learning\nmodels.

Figure 6NJS Figure The bond weight heatmap learned\nby the GNN model ( Figure  Figure  Figure We applied the interpretability methods of the\nFPG model to analyze\nthe structure-toxicity relationship of three representative STAT3-SH2\ninhibitors (the phase III clinical drug napabucasin (PubChem ID 10331844),\nthe phase II clinical drug stattic (PubChem ID 2779853), and the phase\nI clinical drug WP1066 (PubChem ID 11210478)). The reason for selecting\nthese three compounds is as follows: First, these clinical-stage compounds\nhave well-defined STAT3 inhibition mechanisms and abundant experimental\ndata, providing a reliable benchmark for the interpretability analysis\nof the model. Second, the chemical diversity and druggability characteristics\nof these three clinical-stage compounds (such as the bromine atom\nmodification in WP1066 and the covalent binding mechanism of stattic)\nalready cover the key design strategies of STAT3 inhibitors, which\nis sufficient to validate the model’s ability to capture the\ncritical substructures responsible for activity.

Figure  Figure 3.5 Application Domain of the FPG Model In this study, we employed standardized ecotoxicological datasets\nfor fish, crustaceans, and algae, featuring diverse chemical classes\nwith molecular weights of 150–800 Da and logP values of −2\nto 8. The data encompassed both acute (LC 50 50 Daphnia magna Danio rerio Our results\nrevealed that 89.7% of the external validation set compounds resided\nwithin the application domain, exhibiting high structural similarity\n(Tanimoto > 0.6) and descriptor coverage within the principal component\nanalysis convex hull. These molecules showed consistent prediction\naccuracy (Acc = 0.82) and high confidence scores (mean probability\n> 0.8). The remaining 10.3% of compounds, primarily containing\nrare\nsubstructures or extreme descriptor values (logP > 8), were flagged\nas application domain outliers, with lower prediction reliability\n(Acc = 0.65). The model’s application domain thus effectively\ncovers typical STAT3 inhibitor scaffolds (e.g., quinazolinones, naphthoquinones)\nwhile highlighting limitations for highly divergent chemotypes. This\nensures transparent guidance for users regarding the model’s\nsuitable application scope. Current models exhibit reduced reliability\nfor ionizable compounds\n(ionic liquids), chronic/low-concentration effects (NOEC < 0.1\nmg/L), and under-represented taxa (marine algae). These limitations\nstem primarily from data gaps in these specific domains, highlighting\nthe need for expanded training sets incorporating mechanistic descriptors\nand broader taxonomic coverage in future iterations. 3.6 STAT3 Inhibitory Activator Structure We used the functional group-based substructure fragment derivation\nmethod from Pysmash, developed by Yang et al., p Table section 5 Representative Substructure for STAT3\nInhibitors 3.7 STAT3 Pro Web Server Implementation We deployed the optimal FPG model to a web platform to facilitate\nresearchers in predicting and designing potential STAT3 inhibitors.\nAs shown on the homepage of the STAT3 Pro Prediction Server ( Figure https://gzliang.cqu.edu.cn/software/Stat3Pro.html 7 Home page for STAT3 Pro inhibition prediction server. In summary, we construct a novel molecular characterization\nnetwork\nmodel, FPG, which combines molecular fingerprints and graph neural\nnetworks to predict STAT3 inhibitors. We compare it with 48 models\nbuilt using different molecular representations (fingerprint-based,\nmolecular graph-based, image-based, and sequence-based), combined\nwith ML and DL techniques. The results show that FPG achieves optimal\nperformance on the independent test set, with an Acc of 0.8208, an\nAUC of 0.9187, a sensitivity of 0.8284, and an MCC value of 0.6354.\nFeature visualization reveals that the multifingerprint coupled graph\nattention mechanism effectively distinguishes active from inactive\ncompounds. This is likely due to the molecular graph’s focus\non atomic and bond weight distributions, while the mixed molecular\nfingerprints emphasize the extraction of substructure features that\nsignificantly contribute to the classification of active molecules.\nThe combined representation enables the model to uncover the potential\nrelationships among inhibitor molecules more effectively. The dual\ninterpretability of the graph attention mechanism and molecular fingerprints\nprovides a clearer understanding of the key features the model captures\nfor STAT3 active molecules. Based on the best-performing FPG model,\nwe develop a STAT3 prediction server ( https://gzliang.cqu.edu.cn/software/Stat3Pro.html To further improve the FPG model’s predictive performance,\nwe could (i) incorporate 3D conformational features and quantum chemical\ndescriptors to better capture steric and electronic interactions,\n(ii) integrate transfer learning from protein–ligand interaction\nfingerprints, and (iii) develop an active learning framework to iteratively\nrefine the model with newly tested compounds. These advances would\nenhance the model’s ability to identify novel scaffolds and\noptimize lead compounds while maintaining interpretability.
