Emerging evidence shows that simple nutritional indices—the prognostic nutritional index (PNI), the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI), and the C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR)—predict AC completion and survival across commonly used regimens (modified FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine–capecitabine, and regionally adopted S-1). In PC, early postoperative declines in nutritional status, driven by systemic inflammation, sarcopenia, and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, often interrupt treatment. This review focuses on two clinical questions in PC: which nutritional markers predict completing ≥80% of planned AC cycles and when to start nutritional intervention. We highlight recent data showing that interventions within 2–4 weeks after surgery, guided by nutritional and inflammatory markers, may improve chemotherapy adherence and outcomes. Embedding these assessments into standard perioperative care could move nutrition from a supportive role to a proactive, central component of personalized oncology. Pancreatic cancer (PC) remains associated with poor survival despite curative-intent resection. Many patients fail to complete the planned course of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC), most often due to early postoperative nutritional decline. We conducted a narrative review (PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus; Jan 2010–Dec 2024; last update 15 February 2025) focusing on two endpoints: (1) nutritional predictors of completing ≥80% of planned AC cycles and (2) optimal timing of perioperative nutritional interventions. Preoperative GNRI and PNI, early postoperative albumin and CAR, and sarcopenia are robust predictors of AC adherence and survival. Nutritional decline is frequently accelerated by systemic inflammation and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency. Observational data indicate that interventions initiated within 2–4 weeks after surgery—before starting AC—improve chemotherapy completion rates, especially when guided by dynamic monitoring of nutritional and inflammatory markers. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) offers a potential window for metabolic optimization, but validated nutrition-based predictors of NAC adherence remain limited. Readily measurable nutritional indices such as PNI, GNRI, and CAR should be integrated into early perioperative assessments to identify high-risk patients. Timely, phase-specific interventions, including enzyme replacement and anti-inflammatory nutritional strategies, can enhance AC adherence and improve prognoses. These findings support the transition from a supportive to a proactive, personalized nutritional oncology model in resectable PC. pancreatic cancer perioperative chemotherapy nutritional status chemotherapy completion dysbiosis This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction In this review, we define “malnutrition” according to the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria (phenotypic and etiologic components) and “cachexia” as a multifactorial syndrome characterized by progressive skeletal muscle loss—unresponsive to conventional nutrition—and systemic inflammation (e.g., >5% weight loss over 6 months or body mass index (BMI) < 20 kg/m 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Recognizing this, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (Version 2.2025) recommend routine perioperative nutritional screening using validated assessment tools, alongside institution-wide implementation of tailored interventions such as high-protein diets, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), and structured physical activity programs [ 12 13 The survival benefits of adjuvant therapy are well established internationally. Randomized trials, including CONKO-001 [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 17 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 Mechanistic insights provide further rationale for targeted nutritional strategies. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6 and TNF-α, mediate muscle proteolysis and adipose tissue browning via the JAK/STAT3 and NF-κB pathways, thereby exacerbating cachexia and reducing chemotherapy tolerance [ 33 34 35 Figure 1 Figure 1 Collectively, these data highlight a dual challenge: identifying patients at highest nutritional risk before and after surgery, and delivering timely, evidence-based interventions to maintain or restore their capacity to complete planned chemotherapy. This review focuses on two clinically actionable endpoints: (1) nutritional determinants of completing ≥80% of planned AC cycles, and (2) optimal timing of nutritional intervention. In doing so, we aim to provide a practical framework that synthesizes current evidence, acknowledges existing limitations, and outlines priorities for future clinical trials in personalized nutritional oncology. Accordingly, when regimen-specific studies are cited—many of which come from East Asia using S-1—the biological rationale and observed associations (e.g., with GNRI, PNI, CAR, sarcopenia) are interpreted as regimen-agnostic unless otherwise specified. 2. Materials and Methods We performed a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library (January 2010–December 2024; last update 15 February 2025) using both controlled vocabulary (e.g., MeSH) and free-text terms for “pancreatic adenocarcinoma” or “resectable pancreatic cancer” and nutritional parameters (GNRI, PNI, CAR, sarcopenia, serum albumin). Boolean operators and filters for English language and human studies were applied. The PubMed search string was: (“pancreatic adenocarcinoma” [MeSH] OR “resectable pancreatic cancer”) AND (“Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index” OR “GNRI” OR “Prognostic Nutritional Index” OR “PNI” OR “C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio” OR “CAR” OR “sarcopenia” OR “serum albumin”). Database-specific adaptations were used for EMBASE, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. We included adult patients (≥18 years) with resectable PC receiving NAC and/or AC and reporting at least one nutritional index or intervention, with outcomes related to chemotherapy completion, tolerance, or survival. We a priori defined “chemotherapy completion” as maintaining a relative dose intensity (RDI) ≥ 80% over the planned 6-month AC course; when only cycle counts were reported, completion of ≥80% of planned cycles was considered an approximate equivalent endpoint. Exclusion criteria comprised case reports, editorials, letters, conference abstracts, non-original works, non-English publications, and studies without full text. Screening followed a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-style flow: of 5793 records retrieved, 5525 remained after deduplication; 1014 full texts were reviewed, and 212 original studies plus 53 review articles were included. Discrepancies between two independent reviewers were resolved by consensus ( Figure 2 Limitations include the narrative nature of this review, potential selection and publication bias, and reliance primarily on PubMed, although supplemental searches in other databases were conducted to minimize omissions. Greater weight was given to prospective, multicenter studies with external validation. Evidence appraisal. 36 37 38 3. Results 3.1. Nutritional Predictors of AC Completion Although several cohorts evaluated S-1 in East Asia, these indices have also been associated with adherence and outcomes in studies of modified FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine-based AC; thus we consider them broadly applicable across regimens. Multiple clinical parameters reflecting nutritional and inflammatory status have been evaluated as predictors of AC completion in resectable PC. The most consistently validated are the GNRI, PNI, CAR, and sarcopenia. GNRI: Low preoperative GNRI is associated with early discontinuation of S-1 AC and reduced survival in multiple retrospective and prospective cohorts, including studies with external validation [ 20 21 39 40 PNI: Lower PNI values—calculated from serum albumin and lymphocyte count—predict incomplete AC and poorer survival [ 41 42 43 44 CAR: Elevated CAR, reflecting combined systemic inflammation and malnutrition, independently forecasts poor S-1 tolerability and inferior recurrence-free and overall survival [ 22 23 45 46 Sarcopenia: Skeletal muscle depletion predicts reduced chemotherapy tolerance and completion, as well as worse overall survival [ 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 These indices outperform single variables such as BMI or albumin alone, as they integrate both nutritional and inflammatory dimensions. Table 1 3.2. Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (NAC) vs. AC: Nutritional Vulnerability In contrast to AC, NAC is administered before postoperative nutritional decline and therefore generally achieves higher treatment completion rates. The Japanese randomized Prep-02/JSAP-05 trial, along with complementary cohort studies, demonstrated that gemcitabine plus S-1 NAC preserved nutritional status and improved resection outcomes [ 54 55 14 15 16 17 10 11 3.3. Timing of Nutritional Intervention Evidence, though mostly observational, suggests that early postoperative nutritional intervention (within 2–4 weeks after surgery) improves AC completion and functional recovery compared with interventions starting at AC initiation. AC is ideally initiated once the patient is medically fit—commonly within ~12 weeks after surgery, per prevailing guidance—though trial-specific windows vary (e.g., ≤10 weeks in JASPAC-01 [ 17 PERT: Timely initiation after pancreaticoduodenectomy prevents malabsorption, limits weight loss, and has been associated with improved survival [ 26 27 28 High-protein, high-calorie diets and immunonutrition: Use of omega-3 fatty acids and other immunonutrition components during the early postoperative period may help preserve lean mass and reduce inflammation [ 56 57 58 59 60 61 Prehabilitation programs: During NAC, combined nutritional counseling and exercise interventions have demonstrated improvements in PNI and inflammatory ratios before surgery [ 31 62 63 Table 2 Figure 3 3.4. Limitations of Current Evidence Most studies are retrospective single-center analyses; randomized controlled trials specifically designed to test nutritional optimization for AC completion in PC are lacking. Predictors of NAC adherence are less well-validated than those for AC. Multicenter prospective trials are needed to confirm optimal intervention timing and content. Interventions include nutritional counseling, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT; for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency [PEI]), immunonutrition, exercise therapy, and emerging options such as vitamin D analogs. Their timing and impact vary depending on the treatment context—neoadjuvant, postoperative, or adjuvant; where pancreatic-specific trials are limited, evidence from gastrointestinal (GI) cancers is cited. 4. Discussion 4.1. Clinical Evidence Linking Nutritional Status and Chemotherapy Outcomes with Nutritional Indices and Sarcopenia Historically, composite nutritional–inflammatory indices, such as GNRI, CAR, and PNI, together with sarcopenia, were primarily validated as predictors of postoperative outcomes and survival after pancreatic resection [ 65 66 67 68 20 22 67 4.1.1. GNRI (Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index) A lower preoperative GNRI predicts POCs after resection and early discontinuation of S-1 AC after curative surgery in a multi-institutional study with external validation, supporting GNRI as a practical pre-AC triage tool [ 19 20 69 4.1.2. CAR (C-Reactive Protein-to-Albumin Ratio) A higher preoperative CAR is associated with POCs after resection, and poor tolerability and early cessation of S-1 AC after curative resection, shown in a development cohort and confirmed by external validation [ 21 22 70 4.1.3. PNI (Prognostic Nutritional Index) In patients who received NAC followed by curative surgery, PNI < 45 independently predicted failure to continue S-1 AC, and meta-analytic data link low preoperative PNI with worse post-resection survival—supporting its use alongside GNRI/CAR for pre-AC risk appraisal [ 8 42 43 4.1.4. Sarcopenia Sarcopenia. CT-defined sarcopenia (low skeletal muscle index at L3) has been associated with treatment modifications and failure to complete S-1 AC in PC cohorts; moreover, in patients receiving adjuvant modified FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine, baseline sarcopenia was linked to markedly shorter overall survival irrespective of regimen, underscoring its prognostic and tolerance implications during AC [ 71 72 73 74 4.2. Nutritional Interventions and Their Protective Effects Targeted nutritional interventions have the potential to modify treatment trajectories in resectable PC. In clinical settings, early, structured nutritional support during chemotherapy has been associated with better treatment adherence and survival in PC cohorts [ 75 76 77 57 59 60 61 Despite these data, malnutrition and cachexia are often underdiagnosed, and nutritional therapy remains underutilized in oncology practice. Early and sustained implementation of evidence-based nutritional support—tailored to individual inflammatory and metabolic profiles—should be viewed as a proactive, modifiable component of perioperative care. In metastatic PDAC, early nutritional support has been associated with improved treatment tolerance and patient-centered outcomes, although prospective evidence remains limited [ 25 78 4.3. Mechanistic Insights: Inflammation, Muscle Proteolysis, and Immune Modulation Preclinical studies have elucidated the molecular basis by which nutritional decline compromises treatment tolerance. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) family cytokines activate the JAK/STAT3 pathway via the IL-6Rα/gp130 receptor complex, thereby inducing acute-phase protein synthesis, skeletal muscle proteolysis, and browning of adipose tissue—core phenotypic features of cancer cachexia [ 33 79 80 81 82 83 From a translational perspective, mechanism-guided interventions that temper IL-6/JAK/STAT3 activity are being explored. Although direct evidence in pancreatic cancer is limited, observational data in other malignancies suggest that IL-6 receptor blockade with tocilizumab can reduce CRP, increase serum albumin, maintain body weight, improve symptoms, and prolong median overall survival in cachectic patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer [ 84 85 86 4.4. Gaps Between Evidence and Clinical Implementation International guidance already specifies what “good practice” should look like: the 2017 ESPEN expert recommendations and the 2021 ESPEN practical guideline call for routine screening with validated tools, early dietitian involvement, and protocolized nutrition pathways embedded across oncology services [ 13 87 88 89 12 90 Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PEI) after pancreaticoduodenectomy further exacerbates postoperative malnutrition through fat malabsorption. Although PERT improves nutrient absorption, mitigates weight loss, and has been associated with survival benefits [ 27 28 91 92 93 4.5. Cancer Cachexia as a Therapeutic Target Cachexia in PC represents a systemic metabolic derangement driven by both tumor-derived and host inflammatory signals. Cytokines such as IL-6 and TGF-β1 activate muscle proteolysis and lipolysis, while modulating immune responses in ways that impair therapeutic efficacy [ 34 94 95 96 In PC-specific models, tumor organoid–derived factors from cachectic patients have been shown to disrupt contractile smooth muscle cells, providing a mechanistic link between tumor-secreted mediators and gastrointestinal motility impairment [ 97 98 These mechanisms underscore why cachexia is not merely a symptom but a direct mediator of poor prognosis. Given its high prevalence and predictive value for AC intolerance, cachexia should be targeted as aggressively as other modifiable risk factors, combining anti-inflammatory nutritional strategies (e.g., omega-3 PUFAs, immunonutrition) with structured exercise and metabolic support. Narrative and mechanistic overviews emphasize cachexia as a systemic, treatable driver of poor outcomes, not merely a comorbidity [ 99 100 101 4.6. Toward Personalized Nutritional Oncology While indices such as the GNRI, PNI, CAR, and sarcopenia are valuable for risk stratification, they do not fully capture the multidimensional determinants of treatment response. Integrating molecular and microenvironmental factors—such as microRNA profiles, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) status, and stromal activation markers—could refine predictive accuracy. For example, microRNAs such as miR-301b and miR-200b have been implicated in gemcitabine resistance through EMT promotion and tumor microenvironment modulation [ 102 103 104 105 106 107 64 4.7. Future Research Directions Host–microbiome–tumor interactions are increasingly recognized as modifiers of both efficacy and toxicity of systemic cancer therapies beyond immune checkpoint inhibitors [ 108 109 110 35 Emerging synthesis work specific to PC indicates that microbially derived metabolites may mitigate chemotherapy resistance by rewiring tumor–stromal crosstalk and inflammatory pathways [ 111 112 For fluoropyrimidines, the S-1 combination (tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil) controls systemic 5-FU exposure chiefly via gimeracil-mediated inhibition of host dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). The gut microbiome may modulate fluoropyrimidine pharmacodynamics and mucosal toxicity through pyrimidine metabolism, bile-acid/SCFA signaling, and inflammation [ 108 27 Key design elements for future perioperative trials include: Stratification: Baseline GNRI/PNI/CAR combined with microbial diversity and metabolite panels (SCFAs, TMAO). Endpoints: Primary—maintenance of RDI ≥ 80% (6 months); secondary—completion of ≥80% of planned cycles, CTCAE-graded toxicities, QoL. Testable interventions: Optimization of PERT, ω-3–enriched immunonutrition, and pre/pro/synbiotics—alone and in combination. Intratumoral microbiota readouts: 16S/shotgun metagenomics with quantification of drug-modifying genes (e.g., cytidine deaminase) in resection tissue; exploratory circulating microbial DNA/metabolites as non-invasive biomarkers. Methodologic rigor: Contamination control, pre-registered protocols, multiplicity-adjusted analyses. By overlaying microbiome and metabolite features onto established inflammatory–nutritional indices (GNRI, PNI, CAR), the field can move toward a feasible, biomarker-guided model that personalizes both anticancer pharmacology and supportive nutrition to maximize adjuvant chemotherapy completion and clinical benefit in resectable PC. 5. Conclusions This narrative review consolidates current evidence demonstrating that readily obtainable nutritional indices—including the GNRI, CAR, PNI, and sarcopenia—consistently predict completion of perioperative chemotherapy and long-term outcomes in resectable PC. These metrics, which integrate dimensions of nutritional reserve and systemic inflammation, capture key biological determinants of treatment tolerance and survival and are further modulated by gut microbiota–host interactions. The weight of both mechanistic and clinical data supports embedding early, standardized nutritional risk assessments into routine perioperative oncology workflows, followed by phase-specific, targeted interventions to preserve metabolic and functional capacity. Despite robust retrospective evidence, prospective multicenter validation of these indices, ideally coupled with biomarker-guided stratification (e.g., inflammatory cytokine profiles and microbiota composition), is urgently needed. Such integration could transform nutritional management from a supportive adjunct to a proactive, central pillar of personalized oncologic care—enhancing chemotherapy adherence, reducing postoperative morbidity, and ultimately improving survival. By reframing perioperative nutrition as a modifiable, prognostically relevant domain, clinicians can leverage it as a therapeutic target rather than a secondary consideration.

Dysbiosis reduces short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production and impairs the barrier function, leading to malabsorption and malnutrition. This triggers excess IL-6 and TNF-α, activating JAK/STAT3 and NF-κB pathways, which worsen systemic inflammation and muscle loss. The cycle increases postoperative complications and lowers chemotherapy completion rates, leading to poorer prognosis. Note: For resectable PDAC, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is not universally standard and remains under investigation; the sequence shown is a schematic for discussing nutrition and does not imply guideline uniformity.

After deduplication ( n Figure 3 Perioperative timeline and recommended windows for nutritional evaluation and intervention in resectable pancreatic cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is followed by surgery at approximately 4 weeks, and adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) should begin early after surgery once patients are clinically ready, in accordance with prevailing guidelines and institutional practice. Nutrition checkpoints at the end of NAC, postoperative day 7–14, and pre-AC assess GNRI/PNI, albumin/CAR, and sarcopenia to prompt a dietitian-led high-protein diet with or without oral nutritional supplements (ONS), pancreatic enzyme replacement (PERT), and resistance training—aiming to maintain AC relative dose intensity (RDI) at ≥80% for 6 months. curroncol-32-00519-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Summary of nutritional assessment indices in pancreatic cancer care.
