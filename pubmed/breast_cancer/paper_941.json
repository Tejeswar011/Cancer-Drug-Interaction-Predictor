It was established that the bulk modification of the PETG filament with montmorillonite, graphite nano-plates, and other ingredients can reduce the 3D-printed prototypes’ wear by up to eight times. The gas-phase fluorination of the product’s surface provides a decrease in the rest friction coefficient and temperature in the “indentor-3D-printed disk” contact pair.

Introduction The improving of polymer materials made the items’ functional and operational properties an urgent and practically significant task of modern materials science [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 It is known [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 The quantitative analysis of multiscale biological objects’ images [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 The meso-level directional texture regulation can be implemented using bulk modification techniques with the rationally selected fillers [ 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 The common polymer matrices’ bulk modification ingredients are the powders of aluminum oxide, copper, and molybdenum disulfide [ 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 The filled filament rheological characteristics change statistically significantly due to the bulk modification outlined in the materials’ elemental composition and chemical structure transformations. It leads to the need of the extrusion technological parameters’ correction [ 57 58 59 60 61 62 60 62 The structural heterogeneity of the FFF-manufactured prototypes’ surface does not always allow 3D-printing products to fully achieve the required strength, tribotechnicality, and other characteristics [ 63 64 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 Within the framework of this study, the following were carried out: (a) the biomimetic design [ 77 74 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. The Experimental Samples’ Surface Design The design of the experimental samples’ surfaces were carried out using an original technique of the biomimetic approach implementing [ 77 Figure 1 78 The shark skin structure’s separate element (the “flake”, Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 The need to form the quasi-periodic structure (similar to the shark skin texture’s mesoscopic mode) on the samples’ surfaces ( Figure 1 (1) The formation of the shark skin’s surface digital twin (using the original jpg2xls converter); (2) The simulation of a set of pixels’ brightness (related to the features of the surface microrelief) with the two-dimensional Fourier series biharmonics decomposing [ 79 80 (3) The digital construction of the 3D-printing products structure (based on the obtained model and using Paint3D and Cura slicer software).

The Experimental Samples’ Creation The following were carried out for the 3D-printing test items’ (3D disks) prototyping: (1) The initial polymer matrix and the bulk modifies the materials’ rational choice; (2) The polymer matrix dispersed filling with the reinforcing ingredients; (3) The FFF-technology using prototypes production; (4) The direct regulation of the sample’s surface functional properties (by the original technique of the fluorine-containing gas mixture modification) [ 62 The dominant FFF-3D-printing materials are as follows: acrylic, butadiene nitrile and styrene copolymer (ABS), polylactide (PLA), polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) [ 83 84 85 86 87 78 73 The dispersed filling [ 62 75 All variants of the composite filaments were formed in the single-screw extruder (Filastruder, Twinsburg, OH, USA), the EPS 20 × 25 extrusion line (Polymermashservice, Kuznetsk, Russia), and the modernized twin-screw extruder (Moscow Polytech, Mashplast, Russia) at a temperature of 240 °C in accordance with [ 62 88 Figure 3 Section 2.3 A series of the experimental samples (designed for the optimized 3D rasterization conditions in the 3D disks with a diameter of 40 mm and a thickness of 2.5 mm form-factor ( Figure 4 The prototypes’ surface properties’ direct control was carried out (in accordance with the materials in the science-structural-functional paradigm) by changing the elemental composition and chemical and physical structures with the helium–fluorine gas mixtures’ (He/F 2 Figure 5 2 The samples’ surfaces were cleaned of potential contamination by a mechanical–chemical method (wiping with ethyl alcohol and drying under normal conditions).

Identifying the Properties and Structure of the Experimental Samples The following operations were performed to identify the properties and the structure of the composite materials and the 3D-printing products: (1) The determination of 3D-printing and technological properties of the composite filaments (using the original melt flow index measurement (MFI) technique [ 62 (2) The empirical characterization of the elemental composition and the physical structure of the experimental sample’s surface with scanning electron microscopy (SEM); (3) The study of tribotechnical properties (the coefficient of friction, the temperature in the tribological contact zone, the wear resistance) of the manufactured products. The original technique [ 62 Figure 6 Figure 6 The value of the “Flow” parameter in the Cura slicer was adjusted as the result of the following MFI-measurements (6): (6) F l o w C u r a = 1 − M F I c o m / M F I i n i × 100 % M F I c o m M F I i n i The microrelief of the chipped composite filaments and the surface of the 3D-printed products were studied using a JSM-7500 FA autoemission scanning electron microscope (JEOL, Akishima-sh, Japan) at an electron current of ~1 nA. The average depth of analysis (calculated in the Win Casino v2.48 program using the Monte Carlo method) was 0.4 microns. The digital counterparts of the obtained SEM images of the experimental samples’ surfaces are shown in Figure 7 The tribotechnical properties (friction coefficient and wear resistance) of the experimental samples (3D disks) were determined with a universal friction machine MTU-01 (JSC Concern Nanoindustria, Saint Petersburg, Russia), with the technique developed at Moscow Polytechnic University [ 62 Figure 8 The temperature in the “3D-disk-indenter” contact zone was measured using the Seek Thermal Compact Pro thermal imaging module for smartphones. The wear of the experimental samples was determined with the composite 3D-disk mass, reducing gravimetric measurements (ViBRA HT-224RCE analytical scales (SHINKO DENSHI Co., Ltd., Tokyo Japan)) under the standard abrasion (TU 4271-001-29034600-2004) for an hour. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. The Results of 3D-Printing Products’ Surface Biomimetic Design The design of biosimilar material systems [ 84 91 92 93 80 84 94 95 The experimental samples were manufactured from PETG filament and based on its composite materials. The DTS, SMS, and values of the Pearson correlation coefficients between DTS/SMS of the original layout (shark skin) and the experimental samples (3D disks) were calculated ( Table 1 It can be seen that the PETG- and PETG-based compositions made experimental samples’ digital twins differ significantly from the shark skin ones ( R D T S < 0.1 R S M S > 0.9 2 The results of the initial and fluorinated PET samples’ IR-Fourier spectroscopy and planar and depth point EDS analysis were presented in [ 96 Figure 9 The obtained dependence of the fluorine content on the depth of the layer is shown in Figure 10 Similar results were obtained for the typical cured PETG-surface [ 88 Figure 11 3.2. The Results of the Determined and Developed Composite Filaments’ 3D-Printing Properties It was found ( Figure 12 The PETG-based composite MFI values are practically independent of the composition and the content of the filler in the polymer matrix when measuring with the IIRT5 industrial plastometer ( Figure 12 Table 2 The decrease in the MFI values of the composite filaments occurs mainly due to the formation of the agglomerates (100–400 microns) as a result of the material meso- and microstructure-associated transformations. It worsens the melt passing through the small-diameter 3D-printer extruder nozzle (<500 microns), influencing the quality of the fused filament-fabricated 3D disks negatively [ 62 2 3.3. The Results of the Formed Integrated Fluorine-Containing Layers’ Tribological Properties’ Determination It is shown (using direct measurements of the friction coefficient, wear, and temperature in the tribological contact zone (“indenter-3D-printed disk”) of manufactured samples (based on PETG filled with the shungite, montmorillonite, graphite nanoplates and molybdenum disulfide)) that the chemo-morphological texturing with the fluorine-containing gas mixtures provides the ability to control the tribotechnical characteristics of the additive prototyping products’ properties ( Figure 13 Additionally, we have calculated the specific wear rate k m · s k g 97 (7) k = V F · L = M ρ P E T G · F · L Here, V M ρ P E T G ≅ 1270 k g m 3 F ≅ 147 N L L = 2 π · r · N ≅ 71 m N = ν · τ = 200 r o u n d m i n u t e · 15 m i n = 3000 r o u n d s r ≅ 3.75 m m ν = 200 r o u n d m i n u t e τ = 15 m i n Table 3 We tried to determine the empirical dependence of the samples’ actual wear on the rest friction coefficient. The latter was measured using the universal friction machine MTU-01 in accordance with TU 4271-001-29034600-2004 (in the “dry friction” mode in a pair of “3D-printed disk-indenter”) ( Figure 8 Table 4 The classical Reye–Archard–Khrushchev law of wear (which formalizes the description of the energy dissipation hypothesis) has the following form: (8) V = K · N · L H Here, V K N L H We directly measured the rate of the weight loss per time. So, the above dependence was transformed to the following form: (9) w = ∆ m ∆ t = K · ρ · N · v H Here, ρ v = ω · r r 98 99 100 H = α · T − β H = α · e − β · T T ~ F T P · L ~ μ · N (10) w = ∆ m ∆ t ~ K · ρ · N · v α · e − β · T ~ a · e b · μ (11) w = ∆ m ∆ t ~ K · ρ · N · v α · T − β ~ a · μ b It also mentioned [ 101 H = α · T 2 + β · T + γ α < 0 H = β − α · T − T 0 2 (12) w ~ K · ρ · N · v α · μ 2 + β · μ + γ ~ 1 b − a · μ − μ 0 2 We used the simplified biparametric superhyperbolic model for the unification and to ease the comparison with other models: (13) w ~ K · ρ · N · v α · T + β 2 ~ 1 α · μ + β 2 This allowed us to compare the quality of the same data set approximation by different models, calculating the classical determination coefficient: (14) R 2 = 1 − ∑ i = 1 N ε i 2 ∑ i = 1 N w i − w ¯ 2 Here, N ε i 2 w ¯ ∆ m / ∆ t i N We constructed the confidence intervals at w ± 2 · δ w w ± 3 · δ w δ w (15) w = F μ , a , b ⇒ δ w = ∂ F ∂ μ a ¯ , b ¯ · δ μ ¯ + ∂ F ∂ a μ ¯ , b ¯ · δ a ¯ + ∂ F ∂ b a ¯ , μ ¯ · δ b ¯ The corresponding linearized models’ parameters and their standard deviations were determined using the least squares technique. It was found (based on a comparison of the approximation quality of the experimental data set with some analytical functions) that a generalized description of the product surface wear on the rest friction coefficient dependence (for the “indenter-3D-printed disk” tribological contact pair) should be carried out using a second-order superhyperbolic model ( Figure 14 Table 5 The necessity of using this model type is also supported by the presence of a vertical asymptote that corresponds with the limit friction coefficient value μ c r i t i c a l μ > μ c r i t i c a l A significant (non-linear) reduction in wear ( Figure 14 Table 6 The proposed complex technology for increasing wear resistance has demonstrated the greatest effectiveness for taunite and montmorillonite-filling PETG-based items. The highest relative fluorination efficiency was observed as a result of gas-phase modification of the PETG/montmorillonite samples. The surface treatment with the fluorine-containing gas mixtures significantly increases the wear resistance of the prototypes made from both raw and filled PETG. The bulk modification of the filament with molybdenum disulfide (0.5 vol.%), MMT, NPG and taunite reduces the composites’ wear by four to six times compared with an unfilled case. And the fluorination additionally reduces the composites’ wear up to three times due to the formation of an integrated fluoroplast-like layer with a depth of ~2 microns in the composite samples’ surfaces ( Figure 9 A decrease in the average temperature (from 78 ± 2 to 42 ± 2 °C) of 3D-printed disks in the tribological contact zone ( Figure 13 We present the results of standardized (ISO 25178-2:2012) three-dimensional surface parameters’ measurements ( Table 7 S a S q S s k S k u S a l S t r S a l S t r Table 7 The statistically significant differences in the above parameters’ values are observed exclusively for the S a l The morphological heterogeneity of the experimental samples’ surface was characterized quantitatively as a result of the computer analysis of the corresponding optical images ( Table 8 Figure 2 79 94 95 It can be seen ( Table 8 M S V = ∑ k l A k l 2 = 0.055 ∑ k l A k l 2 = 0.023 M o S 2 An increase in the content of molybdenum disulfide (from 0.5 to 1.5 vol.%) in the polymer matrix helps to preserve the initial quasi-periodic surface texture of the 3D-printed disk (since ∑ k l A k l 2 M o S 2 ∑ k l A k l 2 M o S 2 Thus, the consistent use of bulk and surface modification makes it possible to effectively regulate the tribotechnical properties of 3D-prototyping products developed on the basis of the composite filaments. 4. Conclusions Taking into account the biomimetically determined need to ensure the similarity of the 3D-printed items’ surface structures to the shark skin texture (to improve their tribological characteristics) and apply the original approach to the rational choice of the main extrusion parameter value, we developed a technology for the formation of an antifriction-integrated fluorine-containing coating in the surface layers of the products manufactured with FFF-3D printing from the PETG-based filaments filled with shungite, molybdenum disulfide, montmorillonite, etc. The possibility of friction coefficient, wear resistance, and temperature in the tribological contact zone’s direct regulation is due to the presence of the reinforcing fillers in the polymer matrix. The changes in their concentration (in the studied range) do not lead to a critical deterioration of the composite filaments’ printing-technical properties (compared to the original unfilled polymers) but allow the frictional properties of the 3D products’ surfaces to improve. The primary increase in the wear resistance of the 3D-printed disks (due to the filling of the polymer (PETG) matrix) is explained by the mechanical activation of the reinforcing filler (MoS 2 The chemo-induced decrease in the friction coefficient value is a consequence of a reduction in the products’ surface roughness due to the formation of an integrated coating (up to 2 microns thick), chemically similar to the fluoroplastics. The following are the future tasks of the research team: the optimization of the gas-phase modification procedure’s technological parameters; the base polymer and the fillers’ granulometric composition, the temperature regime, and the geometry of extrusion influence on the 3D-printing products’ volume structure and studied structural characteristics; and the analysis of the fluorinated surfaces’ stability and the possibility of transition films’ formation under the increased abrasion duration, various loads, and indenter rotational speeds, using start/stop cycles for the analysis of shock tribological resistance, etc. Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization, G.R. and F.D.; methodology, G.R.; software, Y.R.; validation, A.E.; formal analysis, M.S.; investigation, G.R.; resources, V.N. and M.S.; data curation, A.E.; writing—original draft preparation, F.D. and G.R.; writing—review and editing, G.R., Y.R. and V.N.; visualization, A.E.; supervision, V.N.; project administration, F.D.; funding acquisition, F.D.
