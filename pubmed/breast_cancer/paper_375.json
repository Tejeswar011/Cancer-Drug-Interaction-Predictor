Two types of culture media—one for early development (medium A) and one for recovery after vitrifying/warming (medium B)—were analyzed. Our results showed that protein concentrations were higher in medium A in which embryos reached the blastocyst stage compared to those in which embryos arrested before this stage. Moreover, the pH of medium A associated with higher-grade blastocysts tended to be more acidic than that associated with lower-grade blastocysts. Conversely, in medium B, pregnancy did not occur even with high-grade blastocysts when the medium was contaminated by residual vitrifying/warming agents or had slightly elevated component concentrations due to water evaporation. Furthermore, medium B tended to be slightly alkaline with higher-grade blastocysts, in contrast to medium A. The noncontact, noninvasive, and label-free Raman spectroscopic method for assessing human embryo viability based on culture media analysis may serve as a liquid biopsy in the near future. As ART has become an important treatment for infertility, this method, which may enhance its safety and efficacy, is expected to contribute to human welfare.

For example, Conaghan et al. investigated whether pyruvate uptake by single embryos from the culture medium on the first, second, and third days after insemination correlated with pregnancy outcomes using ultramicro-fluorescence assays 3 4 5 Raman spectroscopy is a type of vibrational spectroscopy that is similar to infrared spectroscopy. In this spectroscopic analysis, a spectrum is obtained by irradiating a laser onto a sample, dispersing the scattered light, and detecting. This provides information about vibrational modes associated with functional groups in molecules such as proteins, lipids, and DNA/RNA in situ without labeling in a noninvasive and noncontact manner 6 7 6 9 10 14 10 −1 11 12 14 13 14 15 16 Herein, culture media used for human embryos were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy to verify whether the differences in the components of culture media owing to embryo metabolism could be detected based on the developmental grade and stage of embryos. Two types of media—one for culturing early embryos up to the blastocyst stage and another for recovering vitrified/warmed blastocysts—were examined. Raman spectra revealed variations in protein concentration and pH of culture media, depending on the developmental stage of the embryos and pregnancy outcomes. Notably, high-grade blastocysts that successfully implanted exhibited less contamination of the culture medium by components from the vitrifying/warming media, suggesting that this approach provides information about the culture conditions. While it is difficult to provide an index for selecting embryos with high pregnancy outcomes using only Raman spectral data, this study shows the possibility of selecting embryos in better conditions among the embryos, even when they are of the same morphological grade. It is expected that noninvasive, nonstaining, real-time liquid biopsies based on embryo culture will improve the success rate of ART. Materials and methods Supernatant of embryo culture Two types of supernatants from in vitro fertilized embryo cultures were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy. Herein, two media are named medium A (HiGROW OVIT, FUSO Pharmaceutical Industried, Ldt., Osaka, Japan) and medium B (EmbryoGlue, Vitrolife K. K., Tokyo, Japan). Medium A was used for developing culture for early embryos, while medium B was for culturing embryos after vitrifying and waring. Four types of culture media for vitrification (VT507-1, VT507-2, KITAZATO, Shizuoka, Japan) and warming (VT508-2, VT508-3, KITAZATO, Shizuoka, Japan) of embryos were used. The culture media generally consists of amino acids (including essential amino acids), salts such as NaCl and KCl, sugars such as glucose and lactate, sodium pyruvate, human serum albumin (HSA), ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid, and phosphate ions (KH 2 4 2 4 2 2 Each medium sample was used to culture a single embryo, and the developmental stage and grade of each embryo were recorded alongside pregnancy outcomes. The developmental stage and grade for early embryos was identified using the Veeck classification, while that for blastocysts followed the Gardner classification 17 18 18 1 2  Table 1 ( a b a Stage and Grade Ctrl unF deg frag 2-cell 4-cell 8-cell 3AA-3CC 4AA-4CC Sam.

All experiments were approved by the Ethics Committees of Akita University and Shimane University (2704). All methods adhered to institutional guidelines. Informed consent was obtained from donors to donate the culture media used for embryo culture according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All methods were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines. Raman measurements Raman measurements of culture media were conducted using a Raman microscope (XploRA INV, HORIBA Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a 532 nm diode laser, a spectrometer with an 1800 gr/mm grating, a charge-coupled device camera, and a microscope (Eclipse Ti2 Inverted Microscope, Nikon Co., Tokyo, Japan) with a 40× objective lens (Plan Fluor, NA = 0.6; Nikon). The power of the incident laser light at the sample point was ~ 300 mW, and Raman spectra were calibrated using the peak of silicon. Each thawed medium sample was drawn into a glass capillary (outer diameter: 1.52 mm, inner diameter: 1.13 mm, Drummond Scientific Company, Broomall, PA) and measured under temperature control at 37 °C with a stage heater (monotone-100, ThreeHigh Co., Ltd., Japan).

The loadings of PC 3 in Fig. 6 3 6 6 Conclusion Two types of culture media were analyzed using Raman spectroscopy: medium A, used for developing embryos into blastocysts, and medium B, used for recovering vitrified/warmed blastocysts. In medium A, the protein concentration increased in media supporting higher-graded blastocysts, and the pH tended to be more acidic compared to media for lower-graded blastocysts. In contrast, the medium used for warming vitrified blastocysts was not mixed with medium B in cases that led to pregnancy. Furthermore, pregnancy outcomes were found to be lower in culture media where the concentration of components increased due to water evaporation. This may be due to the toxicity of medium used for warming vitrified embryos to the cells and/or changes in osmotic pressure on the cells caused by concentration variations in the culture medium. Moreover, the pH of medium B appeared to be more alkaline with higher-graded blastocysts. The differences in composition and pH of the culture medium were attributed to embryo metabolism, and the magnitude of these differences increased depending on the developmental stage and grade of the blastocysts. This suggests that Raman spectroscopy has the potential to evaluate the viability and pregnancy outcomes by monitoring the culture medium in real-time. Specifically, spectral variations caused by artificially induced pH changes in the culture medium were detected in the media used for culturing blastocysts. Measuring the pH of culture media with a pH meter is impractical because of the small volume (~ 20 µL) of the medium. Additionally, indicators such as phenolsulfonphthalein cannot be used in oocyte/embryo culture to avoid the risk of cytotoxicity. Therefore, it is virtually impossible to directly measure and/or assess the pH of the embryo culture media. Thus, Raman spectroscopy can be considered the only method to evaluate the pH of the culture medium in a noncontact, noninvasive, and nonstaining manner. This method for assessing the pH of embryo culture medium can also be applied to other media containing phosphate ions that act as a buffer for culturing somatic cells, embryonic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells. Furthermore, a confocal laser can be irradiated onto the culture medium, allowing for noninvasive, noncontact acquisition of Raman spectra while culturing embryos. For example, embedding Raman spectroscopic mechanism into a time-lapse monitoring system can enable to assess the embryonic potential based on the molecular variations in culture medium in addition to the consecutive observations of embryonic development. The study is a pilot test to determine whether the embryo stage and grade can be evaluated based on differences in the composition of culture medium using Raman spectroscopy. It is not intended to identify critical values, such as protein concentration and pH, that could predict embryo implantation. However, it is necessary to establish these thresholds for predicting embryo implantation by analyzing more culture media in order to advance ART in the future. Once this is achieved and the safety of laser irradiation on the culture medium is confirmed, real-time monitoring of culture medium using Raman spectroscopy during embryo culture could open a new era for supporting ART, serving as a novel “liquid biopsy” method.
