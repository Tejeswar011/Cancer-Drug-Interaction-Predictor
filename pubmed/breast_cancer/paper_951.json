Introduction Adult diffuse glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor type with the worst prognosis; high-grade glioblastoma has a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 5% of patients [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 The approach to GBM treatment to date is to personalize each clinical case, considering the diagnosis time, onset or relapse, age, tumor cancer markers, and the patient’s general condition. The current standard treatment approach for newly diagnosed GBM involves tumor-maximal surgical resection with radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) therapy [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 The primary effects of drugs on GBM are related to the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and the activation of apoptosis [ 17 18 19 20 21 As an anticancer preparation, sodium dichloroacetate (NaDCA) selectively acts on cancer cells by inhibiting PDK [ 22 23 22 24 25 Sodium valproate (NaVPA) is a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, specifically targeting classes I and IIa, and an epigenetic modulator that affects gene expression by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis [ 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 The inflammatory microenvironment of the GBM tumor, characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as the activation of inflammatory pathways, promotes tumor malignancy, which is associated with increased resistance of GBM to therapy [ 36 37 38 39 40 41 Slc5a8 42 43 44 Understanding the mechanisms of action of drugs and the evolution of resistance to treatment is crucial for the efficacy of GBM treatment, as it enables the assessment of the impact of drugs on changes in cancer prognostic markers [ 45 46 47 48 49 SLC12A2 − 50 51 52 SLC12A5 + − + − + − 53 54 55 CDH1 CDH2 genes 56 CDH1 57 SLC12A5 SLC12A5 58 GFAP 59 60 GFAP 60 The study aimed to determine the differences in the primary cell response of IDH-wildtype GBMs to treatment with the sodium valproate and sodium dichloroacetate combination (NaVPA–NaDCA) by assessing the expression of cancer marker genes SLC12A2 SLC12A5 CDH1 CDH2 EZH2 GFAP NaVPA–NaDCA and TMZ had individual effects on the expression of SLC12A2 SLC12A5 CDH1 CDH2 EZH2 GFAP 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. GBM Patient Clinical Data The inclusion criteria for study patients were as follows: adult patients with a first diagnosis of GBM, who had not received anticancer drugs and were not using valproic acid. GBM tissue samples were obtained from three patients who underwent surgery, and their details are provided below. GBM5-1F, 45-year-old female; glioblastoma diffuse (WHO Grade IV), IDH-wild-type; tumor of the left-sided frontoparietal region with spread to the basal ganglia and upper part of the brain stem; strong positive cytoplasmic reaction in GFAP tumor cells (surgery 28 November 2024); GBM5-2F, 77-year-old female; GBM diffuse (WHO Grade IV), IDH-wild-type; left frontal region tumor; strong positive cytoplasmic reaction in GFAP tumor cells (surgery 6 January 2025); GBM5-3F, 83-year-old female; GBM diffuse (WHO Grade IV), IDH-wild-type; tumor of the left parietoccipital area; strong positive cytoplasmic reaction in GFAP tumor cells (surgery 24 March 2025). The Vilnius Regional Biomedical Research Ethics Committee granted authorization to conduct biomedical research on 11 November 2024, under authorization No. 2024/11-1625-1077. Patients were operated on at Vilnius University Santaros Hospital Neurosurgery Clinic (Santariškių St. 2, Vilnius); patients were not treated with anticancer drugs prior to surgery. 2.2. Preparation of Cells for Analysis from Tumor Tissue The explanted tumor tissue was placed in Ca 2+ 2+ g 2 g 2.3. Total RNA Extraction and Real-Time qPCR Total RNA was extracted from the cells using the TRIzol™ Plus RNA Purification Kit (Invitrogen™, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roterdam, The Netherlands). The concentration of the extracted RNA was measured with a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems™, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roterdam, The Netherlands), with the addition of RNaseOUT™ Recombinant Ribonuclease Inhibitor (Invitrogen™, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roterdam, The Netherlands). Real-time PCR for SLC12A2 SLC12A5 CDH1 CDH2 EZH2 GFAP GAPDH 2.4. Investigational Medicinal Preparations Investigational medicinal preparations used for the study were sodium valproate (NaVPA; Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), sodium dichloroacetate (NaDCA; Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), and temozolomide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The combination of NaVPA and NaDCA is patented: a patent filed that covers VPA–NaDCA as a new medicinal product for the treatment of cancer (Official bulletin of the State Patent Bureau of the Republic of Lithuania, No. 6874, filling date 17 April 2020); a European patent application has been submitted (European patent application No. 21168796.7, filing date 16 April 2021). Primary GBM cells were treated with 2 mM NaVPA and 3 mM NaDCA combination (NaVPA–NaDCA) for 24 h. The doses of the investigational drugs were selected based on studies conducted in vivo and in vitro with GBM cell lines [ 43 61 2.5. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis and graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism 9 software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). For statistical purposes, the threshold cycle (CT) values of single PCR replicates were normalized to the control GAPDH U Tables S1–S6 −ΔΔCT p 3.

Discussion Glioblastoma (GBM) is a very aggressive type of glioma that practically recurs after first-line standard treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, and TMZ chemotherapy [ 62 63 64 7 65 Experimental studies with GBM cell lines have shown that NaVPA–NaDCA exhibits anticancer effects on GBM by inhibiting tumor growth, invasion, proliferation, and angiogenesis, and its efficacy may be superior to that of TMZ. However, the efficacy of the investigational medicines depends on the GBM cell lines [ 43 66 42 44 In the study, we discuss below the differences in the expression of SLC12A2 SLC12A5 CDH1 CDH2 EZH2 GFAP The cation and chloride cotransporters, the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC1) and the K-Cl cotransporter (KCC2), are essential for the determination of intracellular Cl − 67 − 68 SLC12A2 SLC12A5 − 51 SLC12A2 SLC12A2 SLC12A2 69 − 70 71 72 The expression of SLC12A5 SLC12A5 SLC12A5 SLC12A5 69 SLC12A2 SLC12A5 SLC12A2 − − SLC12A5 SLC12A2 − SLC12A5 − + − 73 − 74 75 − + − 76 The majority of GBM did not express CDH1 77 78 79 80 CDH1 CDH1 CDH1 CDH1 CDH2 CDH2 CDH2 CDH2 81 The following research areas are the GBM markers EZH2 GFAP EZH2 82 83 58 EZH2 EZH2 SLC12A5 EZH2 The following significant differences in GFAP GFAP GFAP Ezh2 cKO 84 A limitation of the study could be that the number of primary GBM cells studied was small and limited to women. Therefore, studies are needed on the impact of gender differences on treatment effects. Another limitation of the study was that it did not account for other mechanisms that influence protein levels or activity, thereby limiting the assessment of the mechanism to mRNA. However, the activity of the proteins studied is influenced by many mechanisms other than gene expression (mRNA). Regarding the lack of studies on protein levels, it is worth noting that the correlation between differentially expressed mRNA and mRNA/protein levels of the same gene is a topic of debate. Genome-wide correlation between mRNA and protein expression levels is notoriously poor; typically, 0–50% of mRNA levels correspond to protein expression, with a correlation between mRNA and protein expression levels of around 40% explanatory power across many studies. Correlations between differentially expressed mRNA profiles were low and even negative [ 85 86 87 88 The studies clearly show that GBM tissue cells exhibit a polymorphic response to tested treatment, indicating the importance of assessing the effects of chemotherapeutic agents before treatment is administered to personalize treatment. NaVPA and NaDCA have been used for treatment for decades, have the potential to cross the BBB, and their safety profile and blood levels are well known, encouraging further testing for new GBM therapeutic indications. Our in vitro studies demonstrate that NaVPA–NaDCA treatment is superior to TMZ treatment in certain respects. 5. Conclusions The combination of sodium valproate and sodium dichloroacetate, as well as temozolomide, had individual impacts in vitro on the SLC12A2 SLC12A5 CDH1 CDH2 EZH GFAP When assessing the changes in SLC12A2 SLC12A5 CDH1 CDH2 EZH2 GFAP To determine the differences in the efficacy of NaVPA–NaDCA and TMZ, further preclinical studies are needed to investigate their effects on the expression and function of GBM pathogenesis-relevant proteins, as well as their effects on GBM carcinogenesis pathways in the research of individualized treatment. 6.
