However, accurately predicting AMPK activators\nremains challenging due to the complexity of its biological data.\nGiven the high global prevalence of chronic metabolic diseases, accelerating\nthe discovery of novel AMPK modulators while reducing time and development\ncosts is cruciala goal that can be effectively addressed through\nan in silico drug discovery pipeline.

Accurately predicting\nAMPK activators using traditional methods\nis challenging, due to the complexity  As such\nneural network architecture, particularly convolutional\nneural network (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM)\narchitectures have shown significant promise in predicting drug activities\nin quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modeling\nthrough enhancing the accuracy   Generally, a traditional predictive model\noften relies on one algorithm\nor one set of features, which could potentially generate bias toward\na single selection.  In this study, we aim to\ndevelop a highly accurate meta-learner\nmethod for screening AMPK activators, called MetaAMPK, by leveraging\na diverse set of molecular fingerprints and probability features (PFs)\nderived from the BiLSTM and CNN models. To capture various aspects\nof chemical representation, we employed 12 different molecular fingerprint\nschemes to encode chemical structures, ensuring diverse and robust\ninput for the meta-model. For the meta model, we first trained the\n24 baseline models constructed from 12 CNN and 12 BilLSTM fingerprint-based\nmodels. After that, we extracted the probability score from these\n24 baseline models and used it as a model-based representation for\nbuilding an accurate meta-learner. This feature could enhance the\naccuracy of the meta-model and may facilitate the identification of\npotential drug candidates targeting the AMPK protein. The primary\ncontributions of this study are as follow: 1. We developed a state-of-the-art meta-learner\nthat learn from the previous experience with error feedback especially\nfor classifying AMPK activators. 2. We integrated multibaseline models\nutilizing 12 knowledge-based molecular fingerprints to learn a diverse\npatterns of structure–activity relationship. 3. We utilized both CNN and BiLSTM models\nas a meta-learner framework to refine predictions and improve generalization. 4. We validated the prediction\nperformance\nusing external test set and evaluated its through multiple gold standard\nmetrics specifically for ML application. 2 Methods 2.1 Data Preparation The curated AMPK\ndata set is obtained from a previously published study. 2.2 Molecular Feature Encoding The 12\nmolecular fingerprints used in this study are included: (1) atom-pair\ndescriptor 2D (AP2D) with 780 features, (2) atom-pair 2D count descriptor\n(AP2DC) 780 features, (3) chemistry development kit (CDK) 1024 features,\n(4) extended CDK (CDKExt) 1024 features, (5) CDK graph-based (CDKGraph)\n1024 features, (6) electrotopological state (Estate) 79 features,\n(7) Klekota-Roth fingerprint (KRFP) 4860 features, (8) Klekota-Roth\nfingerprint count (KRFC) 4860 features, (9) MACCS fingerprint 166\nfeatures, (10) PubChem fingerprint 881 features, (11) Substructure\nfingerprint (SubFP) 307 features, and (12) Substructure fingerprint\ncount (SubFPC) 307 features.  2.3 Meta-Learner Model In this meta-learner\nframework, we construct two sequential model layers, including baseline\nand meta layers, as described in Figure X eq f baseline ( X ) = ŷ baseline 1 f baseline ŷ baseline eq f meta ( PFs ) = ŷ meta 2 f meta eq ŷ final = f meta ( PFs test ) 3 1 Architecture of meta-learner\ndevelopment. The baseline models in this architecture were separately\ntrained\nbefore implementing in the meta-learner strategy. The BiLSTM model\nconsists of two BiLSTM layers, with the first containing 64 units\nand returning sequences to the second layer, which has 32 units. This\nis followed by a fully connected layer with 16 neurons using the ReLU\nactivation function and an output layer with a single neuron using\na sigmoid activation function for binary classification. The CNN model\ncomprises a one-dimensional convolutional layer with 32 filters and\na kernel size of 3, followed by a max-pooling layer with a pool size\nof 2. The output is then flattened and passed through a fully connected\nlayer with 16 neurons using ReLU activation before reaching the final\nsigmoid-activated output layer. Both models use the ADAM optimizer\nwith a learning rate of 0.001 and binary cross-entropy as the loss\nfunction to optimize the model performance. To determine the\nmost effective meta-model, we tested the final\nmeta-learner using both BiLSTM and CNN architectures. All parameters\nof meta-learners were set to be the same as those of the baseline\nmodels. The models were trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of\n32 and a validation split ratio of 0.2. 2.4 Model Evaluation All of the models\nwere evaluated using classification metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity,\nspecificity, F1, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and area\nunder the curve (AUC). These metrics were calculated based on true\npositive (TP), true negative (TN), false negative (FN), and false\npositive (FP), eqs accuracy = TP + TN TP + TN + FP + FN 4 sensitivity = TP TP + FN 5 specificity = TN TN + FP 6 F1 = TP TP + 0.5 · ( FP + FN ) 7 MCC = ( TN × TP − FN × FP ) ( TP + FP ) ( TP + FN ) ( TN + FP ) ( TN + FN ) 8 precision = TP TP + FP 9 2.5  Y To validate the robustness of the developed models, Y Y Y Y Y 2.6 Applicability Domain Analysis The\napplicability domain (AD) was established using a distance-based method,\nspecifically the k k eqs D i < D k + σ S k 10 D i ≥ D k + σ S k 11 D  i k D  k S  k k 2.7 Permutation Importance To evaluate\nthe feature importance from the meta-learner and its baseline, we\ncomputed the permutation importance by evaluating the effect of randomly\nshuffling each feature on model accuracy. First, the original accuracy\nis determined from two meta-learners. Then, for each feature, its\nvalues were randomly permuted 10 times, and the accuracy of the new\nfeature value was recalculated. eq importance score = accuracy permuted − accuracy original 12 2.8 Statistical Assessment The statistical\nevaluation of model performance was carried out to determine whether\nthere were significant differences among the baseline and the meta-learners.\nWe tested three key performance metrics, including accuracy, MCC,\nand AUC scores from all the models. To examine the distribution of\neach metric, the Shapiro-Wilk test was initially performed. The results\nrevealed that the distributions for all performance metrics deviated\nfrom normality ( p U 2.9 Molecular Docking Molecular docking\nsimulations were performed to study the interactions between the AMPK\nprotein (PDB ID: 4ZHX x y z x y z  3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Chemical Space Analysis We explored\nthe chemical space of the AMPK molecules using 12 molecular fingerprints\nwith a combination of t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding\n(t-SNE) and kernel density estimation (KDE), as illustrated in Figure 2 Chemical distribution of the AMPK data set using t-SNE distribution. We also found that the EState fingerprint demonstrated\nsix distinct\nKDE peaks, suggesting that this feature represents unique and separate\nclusters. This pattern was also observed in the KRFP and KRFPC fingerprints.\nHowever, these two features showed broader KDE distributions, which\nmight reflect a more diverse set of data points within these clusters.\nThis diversity could be due to the presence of a large 4860 substructure\nfingerprints. For MACCS and PubChem, these two features were characterized\nby their moderately broad density peaks and large cluster separations.\nThese data suggest that while they are distinct, there may be some\nshared features or transitional data points that bridge these two\nclusters. Finally, the SubFP and SubFPC fingerprints stood out with\nunique KDE distributions. The SubFP displayed a more compact distribution\ncharacterized by two large and two small clusters, whereas the SubFPC\nexhibited a more diverse, yet less distinctly separated set of clusters.\nThis suggests a different distribution pattern that may contribute\nto the variation in model performance between these two substructure-based\nfeatures. Overall, the combined t-SNE visualization and KDE\nfigure offer\na comprehensive view of the structure of the AMPK data set, highlighting\nboth the distinctiveness and the interrelations among the 12 fingerprints.\nHowever, none of these features show a unique separation between AMPK\nactivators and controls, suggesting that relying solely on molecular\nfingerprints may not be sufficient to effectively identify AMPK activators. 3.2 BiLSTM Models Performance The baseline\nBiLSTM models exhibit significant variability, highlighting the challenges\nand strengths of this architecture in external testing, as displayed\nin Table 1 Mean Scores of Performance Metrics\nfor BiLSTM Models ( n fingerprints accuracy sensitivity specificity MCC F1 score AUC precision AP2D 0.651 0.546 0.758 0.372 0.595 0.672 0.820 Estate 0.716 0.576 0.858 0.454 0.671 0.788 0.809 KRFP 0.683 0.561 0.808 0.413 0.633 0.730 0.814 PubChem 0.751 0.678 0.826 0.513 0.733 0.824 0.805 SubFP 0.743 0.654 0.833 0.495 0.720 0.805 0.800 CDKGraph 0.745 0.714 0.775 0.493 0.737 0.820 0.767 CDK 0.746 0.682 0.812 0.501 0.730 0.816 0.791 KRFPC 0.675 0.514 0.839 0.373 0.614 0.710 0.766 CDKExt 0.684 0.654 0.715 0.373 0.676 0.754 0.704 SubFPC 0.768 0.768 0.769 0.543 0.768 0.849 0.777 AP2DC 0.760 0.626 0.897 0.543 0.724 0.854 0.862 MACCS 0.704 0.753 0.653 0.410 0.719 0.777 0.689 3.3 CNN Models Performance The performance\nmetrics of the CNN baseline models with the external test demonstrate\na clear advantage over BiLSTM models, with noticeable variations across\ndifferent fingerprints, as shown in Table 2 Mean Scores of Performance Metrics\nfor CNN Models ( n fingerprints accuracy sensitivity specificity MCC F1 score AUC precision AP2D 0.846 0.844 0.847 0.692 0.847 0.901 0.850 Estate 0.856 0.825 0.887 0.714 0.852 0.907 0.882 KRFP 0.898 0.889 0.906 0.795 0.897 0.950 0.906 PubChem 0.874 0.879 0.868 0.747 0.875 0.933 0.871 SubFP 0.859 0.835 0.884 0.721 0.857 0.922 0.882 CDKGraph 0.890 0.848 0.933 0.783 0.886 0.933 0.928 CDK 0.887 0.850 0.926 0.779 0.883 0.961 0.922 KRFPC 0.887 0.877 0.898 0.776 0.887 0.948 0.898 CDKExt 0.889 0.870 0.908 0.778 0.887 0.951 0.906 SubFPC 0.861 0.875 0.847 0.724 0.864 0.935 0.854 AP2DC 0.851 0.833 0.869 0.704 0.849 0.920 0.867 MACCS 0.862 0.874 0.850 0.727 0.865 0.930 0.859 3.4 Meta-Learner Performance  Table 3 Mean Scores of Performance Metrics\nfor Meta-Learner Models ( n meta-learners (seed) accuracy sensitivity specificity MCC F1 score AUC precision BiLSTM (0) 0.915 0.897 0.934 0.831 0.914 0.965 0.932 BiLSTM (42) 0.891 0.963 0.800 0.783 0.907 0.950 0.882 BiLSTM (123) 0.893 0.932 0.845 0.785 0.907 0.942 0.889 CNN (0) 0.911 0.890 0.933 0.823 0.910 0.967 0.931 CNN (42) 0.861 0.873 0.845 0.719 0.874 0.935 0.859 CNN (123) 0.873 0.881 0.863 0.743 0.885 0.936 0.872 In order to examine the consistency and robustness\nof our meta-models,\nadditional evaluations were conducted with different train-test splits\nusing two additional random seeds, 42 and 123.

These compounds–calebin\nA (1), narciclasin (2), daphnetin (3), esculetin (4), osthole (5),\nscopoletin (6), GSK554170A (7), and CHEMBL3933251 (8)–are visualized\nin Figure 7 Structural analysis of representation test set compounds within\nAD of meta-models.

Moreover, each compound falls within the\nAD of the meta-models, with a probability score of 0.99, indicating\nhigh confidence in the predictions. The strong correlation between\ndocking and ML results suggests that these compounds may possess significant\npotential as bioactive candidates. The superior binding affinity observed\nin pseudoberberine and beta-lapachone highlights their potential as\nlead compounds for further optimization and in vitro validation. Metformin\nis well-known for its role as an AMPK activator and be used as ref The docking results showed that pseudoberberine, beta-lapachone,\nand donepezil exhibit stronger binding affinities to AMPK than metformin,\nwith values of −8.205, −7.585, and −7.484 kcal/mol,\nrespectively, as presented in Table Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure 8 Docking pose of the best scoring predicted compounds.\nThese compounds\nare (A) Metformin (control), (B) Pseudoberberine, (C) Beta lapachone,\nand (D) Donepezil. Interestingly, all compounds except beta-lapachone\nreveal both\noxygen (red) and nitrogen (blue) atoms in their interactions, which\nmay indicate the presence of polar interactions and potential specificity\nin ligand binding. Beta-lapachone, however, only reveals oxygen atoms,\npointing to a more hydrophobic binding profile.In conclusion, while\npseudoberberine, beta-lapachone, and donepezil show stronger binding\naffinities than metformin, the lack of hydrogen bonds in these interactions\nsuggests that their ability to activate AMPK is less certain. Pseudoberberine is a berberine analogue, which is known to inhibit\nmitochondrial respiratory complex I; thereby, it may increase the\nAMP/ATP ratio and trigger AMPK phosphorylation of AMPK alpha at Thr127. Beta-Lapachone is a bioactive\ncompound recognized as a substrate\nfor NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) and has been shown to activate\nAMPK across various cell types, contributing to its anti-inflammatory,\ncytoprotective, and anticancer effects.   Donepezil,\nprimarily known as a cholinesterase inhibitor for Alzheimer’s\ndisease, also acts as an activator of AMPK phosphorylation, leading\nto increased mitochondrial biogenesis and ATP production via upregulation\nof PGC–1α and NRF-1. In this study, we developed a novel meta-deep learning\nsystem that\nintegrates the CNN and BiLSTM architectures with 12 molecular fingerprints\nthat can learn to capture complex patterns and enhance the predictive\nperformance of AMPK activator molecules. We found that the BiLSTM\nand CNN performed with very similar performance against AMPK protein.\nWe also validated our model with the unseen data and a molecular docking\nexperiment, resulting in a validated and reliable predictive method\nfor AMPK activator predictions. To further expand this method we have\nevaluate the generalization ability of our model, We conducted a new\ntest set using an unseen data set obtained from another study, Table 8 Generalization Test Performance Metrics\nUsing 53 Unseen Molecules from PubChem AID1806723 meta models accuracy meta-BiLSTM 0.9623 meta-CNN 0.9623 To evaluate the effectiveness of our meta-learner\nwith the previous\nstudy, Table 9 Brenchmark of Machine Learning Models\nWith the Meta-Models models accuracy (%) precision (%) sensitivity (%) specificity (%) AUC MCC RFC 92.6 90.3 91.2 94.0 0.968 – SVM-C 93.0 90.1 93.5 92.4 0.962 – SGB 93.0 90.7 92.0 94.0 0.968 – LRC 91.0 89.2 97.4 94.8 0.948 – DNN 90.6 87.6 90.2 91.1 0.970 – meta-BiLSTM 91.5 93.2 89.7 93.4 0.965 0.817 meta-CNN 91.1 93.1 89.0 93.3 0.967 0.829 Notably, both meta-BiLSTM and meta-CNN achieved precision\nscores\nabove 93%, outperforming all previous models, including SGB (90.7%)\nand DNN (87.6%). This high precision indicates that our models are\nmore effective in minimizing false positives, which is particularly\nvaluable in critical applications such as drug classification, in\nthis case, to classify AMPK activators. In addition, the specificity\nscores for meta-BiLSTM (93.4%) and meta-CNN (93.3%) were among the\nhighest recorded, highlighting their strength in correctly identifying\nnegative cases. Although our meta-learners reported slightly\nlower sensitivity\ncompared to LRC, which achieved the highest sensitivity at 97.4%,\nthey offered a better balance between sensitivity and specificity.\nThis is reflected in the strong MCC scores (both at >80%), which\nprovide\na more holistic evaluation of model performance, particularly under\nclass imbalance. Furthermore, the AUC values of 0.965 for meta-BiLSTM\nand 0.967 for meta-CNN were relatively high, although not the highest\namong the compared models, highlighting the stronger ability to correctly\nidentify true AMPK activators and reduce false positives. This is\nan essential feature for virtual screening workflows. In addition\nto standard validation methods, we implemented Y While MetaAMPK exhibits strong predictive performance, specifically\nwith accuracy, AUC, and MCC of 0.8 on the test set, the results of\nthe Y Our study presents a comprehensive and robust approach\nto predict\nAMPK activators by leveraging DL architectures, interpretability tools,\nand molecular docking validation techniques. While previous research,  Moreover, we enhanced the model interpretability through\npermutation\nimportance analysis from both global and local importance scores.\nThese scores were computed to identify the most influential fingerprint\nfeatures, offering insights into the chemical characteristics that\ncontribute to AMPK activators. Improving upon the previous study,\nwhich relied solely on a statistical comparison of descriptors, our\nfeature importance results were subsequently used to guide a structure–activity\nrelationship (SAR) analysis, revealing critical substructural patterns.\nAdditionally, we assessed the model’s AD using a k k Finally, the generalization capacity of our model was tested on\nan external AMPK data set, achieving a high predictive accuracy of\n96%. This confirms that our model is not overfitted with the original\ntraining data and can maintain performance on independent compound\nsets. Together, these contributions distinguish our approach from\nprior research and demonstrate the value of combining advanced DL\nframeworks, model interpretation, AD analysis, and molecular docking\nvalidation in the context of drug discovery. Our findings not only\nimprove the accuracy and interpretability of AMPK activator prediction\nbut also offer a more rigorous and biologically meaningful framework\nfor virtual screening in kinase-targeted drug development. 4 Conclusion In this study, we developed\na robust predictive framework by constructing\n24 predictive models using two baseline architectures, CNN and BiLSTM,\nin combination with 12 molecular fingerprints. We further explored\nthe impact of using different meta-models, CNN and BiLSTM, in the\nstacked ensemble approach to assess their effectiveness in capturing\ncomplex molecular representations. To validate the robustness and\ngeneralization of our meta-models, we applied them to an unseen AMPK\ndata set. The promising results obtained from this external data set\nfurther confirm the reliability of our predictive framework in identifying\npotential AMPK activators. Moreover, molecular docking revealed the\nstronger binding affinity of the external set compounds compared to\nthe known AMPK activator drug. This demonstrates the model’s\napplicability in real-world drug discovery scenarios, particularly\nin screening novel compounds for targeted proteins. Our findings indicate\nthat both meta-models exhibit strong predictive capabilities with\nclosely matched performance scores. However, statistical analysis\nreveals that the meta-CNN model consistently outperforms its counterpart,\ndemonstrating a superior and more stable performance across various\nfingerprint types and evaluation metrics. This suggests that meta-CNN\nnot only maintains high predictive accuracy but also offers greater\nreliability and generalizability in different molecular representations.
