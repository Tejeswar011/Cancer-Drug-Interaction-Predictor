Total RNA from the housefly samples was isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, United States), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality and quantity of the RNA were assessed using a NanoPhotometer ® M. domestica Musca _domestica 31 32 2.6 Plate confrontation assay The specific methods used for this assay are based on previous studies conducted in this laboratory. In order to elucidate the interactions between B. velezensis Serratia marcescens Proteus stuartii Pseudomonas vermicola Klebsiella pneumoniae Enterobacter hormaechei Enterobacter cloacae Asaia bereziniae Lactobacillus fusiformis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Lactococcus lactis Bacillus safensis B. velezensis Serratia marcescens 2.7 Effects of feeding isolated B. velezensis The housefly larval feeding experiment spanned three consecutive days, with larval samples collected daily from each experimental group. Each larval sample was transferred into a centrifuge tube filled with phosphate buffer (pH = 7.0) and subsequently homogenized. Following this, the samples were centrifuged at 4°C and 12,000 revolutions per minute for 20 minutes, after which the supernatant was carefully extracted. The enzymatic reaction system was assembled using the methodology previously detailed in references ( 33 34 405 2.8 Histological analysis Samples were collected three days after B. velezensis 2.9 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics version 20 and GraphPad Prism 8.0.2 software. All data were presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). To evaluate the effects of different treatments on the body weight and length of housefly larvae, a two - way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted, followed by Šidák correction for multiple comparisons to control the family - wise error rate. For the antagonism experiment, data were analyzed using Student’s t - test to determine significant differences between groups. Likewise, the t - test was applied to analyze the activity of phenoloxidase in the hemolymph of the larvae. Statistical significance was indicated by asterisks, where *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and ****P < 0.0001. 3 Results 3.1 Sampling, isolation, and insecticidal potential of bacteria  B. velezensis B. velezensis st  Figure 1 B. velezensis st 2 8 5 8 Figure 1 The mortality of housefly larvae following treatment with varying concentrations of B velezensis 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 B velezensis Based on the average mortality of housefly larvae at different B. velezensis Y x  Supplementary Tables S1, S2   Supplementary Table S3 B. velezensis  Supplementary Table S3 50 6 6 7 B. velezensis 3.2 Genome characteristics of B. velezensis Genomic information provided critical insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of B. velezensis B. velezensis  Supplementary Figure S1  Table 1  Table 1  Supplementary Table S4  Table 2 ces mucp hlyIII Table 1 Basic information on the B. velezensis Type Number Total_len Average_len Percentage of Genome(%) Gene 3983 3568866 896 89.79 CDS 3782 3508356 928 88.27 tRNA 86 6665 78 0.17 23S rRNA 9 26334 2926 0.66 16S rRNA 9 13923 1547 0.35 5S rRNA 9 999 111 0.03 tmRNA 1 360 360 0.01 misc_rna 87 12229 141 0.31 Table 2 Predictive classification statistics of virulence factors of strain BV.

Given with a q-value < 0.05 and at least a twofold change (log2(fold change) > 1 or < −1) were considered differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the transcriptome data showed that PC1 accounted for 47.9% of the variance in gene expression and separated the Bv group from the Ct group, indicating a significant impact of B. velezensis  Figure 7A  Figure 7B TPS Figure 7 Differences in gene expression between the Ct and Bv group.

The Bt toxins have gained widespread acclaim due to their exceptional attributes, including high safety for humans and livestock, rapid biodegradability without persistent residues, and minimal environmental impact ( 128 129 130 131 B. velezensis Musca domestica B.velezensis With advances in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, we will focus on developing and adopting novel integrated pest control technologies. These technologies along with other environment friendly pest control methods, will provide safer and more effective pest management. Meanwhile, studying bacteria-insect interactions could offer valuable new insights into the factors and mechanisms involved in human pathogenesis.
