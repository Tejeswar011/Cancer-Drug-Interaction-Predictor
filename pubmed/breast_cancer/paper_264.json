It is often characterized by the presence of a painful mass, skin changes, and persistent inflammation, which can clinically resemble breast cancer. Due to the absence of specific imaging signatures and a poorly understood pathogenic mechanism, diagnosis is primarily achieved through exclusion. We present the case of a 31-year-old woman who, three years after undergoing a radical mastectomy for triple-negative breast cancer in her right breast, was diagnosed with GM in her left breast. The diagnosis was based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), conventional and contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and confirmed through histological analysis. The patient has experienced recurrent episodes of GM over the past three years. Notably, this case represents the first reported instance of granulomatous mastitis occurring in the contralateral breast following a radical mastectomy for breast cancer.

Diagnostic imaging and biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. The patient subsequently underwent a right mastectomy and right axillary lymph node dissection. Postoperative pathology revealed invasive breast cancer (Histological score: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 points, Grade III) (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Histopathological results of the breast. A B Three years later, a mass was detected in the patient’s left breast, accompanied by significant premenstrual distention and pain, but without local redness or swelling. Mammography indicated that the left breast exhibited heterogeneous density with uneven distribution and patchy areas of high density; no definite masses or malignant calcifications were observed (Fig. 2 3 4  Fig. 2 Mammography images. ( A B  Fig. 3 Contrast-enhanced breast MRI image, VIBRANT-Flex phase. Multiple nodules and patchy areas of enhancement are visible in the lower quadrant of the left breast (indicated by the yellow arrows)  Fig. 4 Ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound images of the breast. A B C D Six years after undergoing radical breast surgery, the patient experienced recurrent episodes of chronic inflammation in the left breast, eventually leading to another resection of the left breast mass. Postoperative pathology revealed inflammatory exudate, granulation tissue, and both acute and chronic inflammation of the breast tissue, accompanied by abscess formation and a multinucleated giant cell reaction (Fig. 5 6  Fig. 5 Pathological image. HE staining at 200× magnification reveals inflammatory cell infiltration and multinucleated giant cells within granulation tissue. The yellow arrow highlights the multinucleated giant cells  Fig. 6 Breast ultrasound images. A B C Discussion Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), characterized by the lack of expression of ER, PR, HER2, represents the most aggressive and lethal subtype of breast cancer [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 We report a case of breast cancer treated with regular chemotherapy following radical mastectomy, in which refractory GM developed in the contralateral breast. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of GM occurring in the opposite breast after radical mastectomy. Previous literature has described cases where both diseases co-occurred in the same patient or where GM occurred at the site of the surgical scar of after breast conserving surgery. Ichinose et al. [ 10 11 12 In patients presenting with breast inflammation, malignancy must be ruled out, as it may represent inflammatory breast cancer or, rarely, DCIS [ 13 14 Supplementary Information  Supplementary Material 1.
