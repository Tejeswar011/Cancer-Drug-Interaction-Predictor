However, its poor water solubility limits its application in food and pharmaceutical fields. Here, the curcumin and mogroside (MOG) self‐assembled nanoparticles (CUR–MOG NPs) with well water solubility were successfully prepared. The CUR–MOG NPs were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), x‐ray diffraction (XRD), UV‐visible spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The antioxidant activity and HepG2 cell cytotoxicity were further evaluated. CUR–MOG NPs exhibited a particle size of 59.96 ± 0.852 nm with a polydispersity coefficient of 0.077 ± 0.013.

Introduction Curcumin (CUR) is a hydrophobic polyphenol from the rhizome of the widely used turmeric spice ( Curcuma longa 1 2 α β 3 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 Embedding hydrophobic compounds within amphiphilic molecules or complexes through noncovalent interactions is an effective way to improve their water solubility [ 10 11 π π 12 13 17 18 19 Recently, small molecule self‐assembled nanoparticle technology is regarded as an excellent candidate for use as a carrier in nanoscale delivery systems due to its numerous advantages, such as a loading capacity and a convenient preparation process, not requiring any carrier or excipient [ 20 21 22 23 24 25 20 21 26 Mogrosides (MOGs) are cucurbitane‐type triterpene glycosides produced by monk fruit ( Siraitia grosvenorii 27 28 Here, curcumin–mogroside nanoparticles (CUR–MOG NPs) were prepared by using a dialysis method. The structural properties of assembled CUR–MOG NPs were examined by using dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), x‐ray diffraction (XRD), UV‐visible spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Furthermore, the antioxidant and HepG2 cell cytotoxicity activities of CUR–MOG NPs were also evaluated. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials The MOGs were purchased from SXBC Kangze Biotech Co.

(Shanghai, China). 1,1‐Diphenyl‐2‐picryl‐hydrazyl (DPPH) was purchased from Shanghai Yuanye Bio‐Technology Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The apoptosis and necrosis detection kit with YO‐PRO‐1 and propidium iodide (PI) fluorescent dyes, methylthiazolyldiphenyl‐tetrazolium bromide (MTT), and penicillin–streptomycin (P/S) solution was purchased from Beyotime Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, New York, United States).

[ 25 μ 25 μ AR = N t N 0 × 100 % , N 0 N  t The CUR–MOG NP solutions were lyophilized and stored at 4°C for future use. 2.3. Characterization of Self‐Assembly CUR–MOG NPs 2.3.1. TEM Observation The microstructural morphology of CUR–MOG NPs was assessed using TEM. Solutions of CUR–MOG NPs were appropriately diluted and negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid. The morphologies were analyzed with a HITACHI HT7800 transmission scanning electron microscope (HITACHI Instrument Co., Japan) operating at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. 2.3.2. Measurement of Particle Size Distribution and Surface Charge (DLS and Zeta) The average diameter and polydispersity index (PDI) of the nanoparticle dispersions (100 μ 29 2.3.3. Thermal Analysis CUR and MOG powers were mixed in a ratio of 0.9:100 (designated as CUR–MOG PMs), which was used as control. Thermal analysis was performed by TGA. The CUR, MOG, CUR–MOG PM, and CUR–MOG NP melting points were determined by analyzing endotherms obtained in HITACHI STA200 (HITACHI Instrument Co., Japan). 2.3.4. XRD Assay XRD analysis of all samples (CUR, MOG, CUR–MOG PMs, and CUR–MOG NPs) was performed at ambient temperature using the D8 x‐ray diffractometer system (Rigaku SmartLab 9 KW, Japan) and Cu K α 30 2.3.5. FTIR Spectroscopy The samples were ground into a fine powder and sifted through a 200‐mesh sieve. The resulting powders were then compressed into tablets. Attenuated total reflectance FTIR spectroscopic analysis was performed using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS20 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, United States) covering a range from 4000 to 400/cm, with 32 scans taken [ 15 2.3.6. UV‐Visible Spectroscopy A UV spectrophotometer (N4S, Shanghai Yidian Analytical Instruments & Analysis Co.) was used to measure the UV‐visible absorption spectra of CUR and CUR–MOG NPs dispersed in ethanol and MOG dispersed in water. UV‐visible absorption scanning was performed from 200 to 600 nm at a scanning speed of 0.1°/min. The absorbance range was set between 0.0 and 2.0 for each sample [ 31 2.3.7. Solubility Measurement The solubility of CUR and CUR–MOG NPs was determined following the method proposed by Zhang et al. [ 28 Y = 0.19110.0059 X − R 2 = 0.998 , Y X 2.3.8. DPPH Scavenging Activity Based on the described process, CUR–MOG NPs were assessed for their DPPH scavenging activity [ 32 μ DPPH  scavenging  activity % = A 0 − A 2 − A 1 A 0 × 100 % , A 0 A 2 A 1 50 2.4. Anticancer Activities 2.4.1. Cell Culture HepG2 liver carcinoma cells were cultured using DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% P/S and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO 2 2.4.2. Cytotoxicity The cytotoxicity of CUR, MOG, and CUR–MOG NPs against HepG2 cells was assessed using an MTT assay following the methodology outlined by Chen et al. [ 33 2 μ μ Cell  viability = A 2 − A 0 A 1 − A 0 × 100 % , A 2 A 1 A 0 2.4.3. Cell Apoptosis by Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy HepG2 cells were seeded into confocal dishes at a density of 1 × 10 5 μ μ 2.5. Statistical Analysis The experimental data were analyzed using SPSS 22.0 for variance (ANOVA). The results of the experiment were expressed as mean ± SD, and to analyze the significant differences between samples, Duncan’s test was used. All experiments were conducted in triplicates. 3.

Duncan’s test was used to analyze the significant differences among the different groups: ns, p p p Many studies have proven that CUR induces cellular apoptosis to reduce viability [ 57 58 9 μ −1 Figure 9 The effect of CUR, MOG, and CUR–MOG NPs on HepG2 cell apoptosis. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that CUR–MOG NPs can effectively induce cell viability in HepG2 liver cancer cells in a concentration‐dependent manner. Moreover, the CUR–MOG NPs promoted the apoptosis of liver cancer cell lines. 4. Conclusion The self‐assembly advantage lies in its predominantly water‐based composition with only a small component of organic solvent needed. Additionally, the assembly of the nanoparticle using this system can be performed without needing heat and in an open beaker. Here, the CUR–MOG NPs that were prepared displayed a particle size measuring 59.96 ± 0.852 nm, a low PDI of 0.077 ± 0.013, and a theta potential amounting to −15.27 ± 1.155 mV. SEM, DLS, XRD, FTIR, and TGA were used to determine successful self‐assembly of CUR–MOG NPs. The solubility of the CUR–MOG NPs was approximately 10,606 times greater than that of free CUR. The cell viability assays demonstrated the inhibitory effect of CUR–MOG NPs in liver cancer cell HepG2 lines. This study developed a new nanocarrier for insoluble polyphenols and expanded the nonnutritive sweetener applications as bioactive materials.
