The occult type of POI (OPOI) is associated with a significant decrease in fertility and normal FSH levels. Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) is known for its antioxidant properties and potential benefits on ovarian function. This study aimed to determine the effect of fennel extract on Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) levels and antral follicular count (AFC) in infertile women with occult premature ovarian insufficiency. Methods This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted at Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. 60 Infertile women with OPOI were randomly assigned to either the intervention group, who received fennel extract, or the control group, who received a placebo, with a ratio of 1:1. AMH measurement and AFC were performed at baseline and after 60 days, on the third day of menstruation. Results AMH level and AFC at the baseline were not statistically significant between fennel and the placebo groups( p p p Conclusion Fennel extract may have a beneficial effect on AFC in infertile women with occult POI, but had no effect on serum AMH levels. Further studies are needed to reach more definitive results in this field. Trial registration This trial has been registered at Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20111219008459N15).

Conventional treatments such as the use of hormonal drugs or assisted reproductive techniques, due to side effects, less-than-expected treatment response, and high costs, are unaffordable for many couples, leading to a preference for herbal medicines [ 37 Measuring the level of Anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH), which is produced by follicles, is the most reliable test for detecting ovarian reserve dysfunction [ 7 38 39 Given the importance of fertility in the stability of family foundations, the high cost and numerous side effects of pharmaceutical treatments, and the limited number of studies on the effect of fennel extract on sex hormone levels in female mice and one quasi-experimental human study in this area, the present study was designed to determine the effect of fennel extract on Anti-Müllerian Hormone levels and sonographic indices in infertile women with occult premature ovarian insufficiency. Methods Study design and participants This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial (participants, intervention performers, outcome assessors, and data analysts were blinded to the type of intervention received) designed to investigate 60 women with occult premature ovarian insufficiency (OPOI) who presented to the Al-Zahra Infertility Clinic of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences in 2023. We adhered to the CONSORT guidelines for the standardized reporting of randomized trials [ 40 2 41 Sampling After approval by the Ethics Committee of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences (ethical code: IR.TBZMED.REC.1401.966) and registration of the title at the Clinical Trials Center (IRCT20111219008459N15), convenience sampling was conducted. At the infertility clinic, patients were identified based on the diagnosis of occult type of premature ovarian insufficiency (OPOI) confirmed by an infertility specialist. Those who did not wish to use donor eggs were fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study. If they consented to participate, a written informed consent form was obtained. After controlling the inclusion and exclusion criteria, demographic and medical questionnaires were completed by the participants in the presence of the researcher. Blood AMH levels and antral follicle count (AFC) were assessed before and after the intervention. For AMH assessment, 3 ml of blood were drawn from the brachial vein and tested using an ELISA kit by a laboratory technician at Al-Zahra Hospital. AFC was performed on the third day of the menstrual cycle using real-time transvaginal sonography with a Medison v 20 machine made in South Korea by a radiologist at Al-Zahra Hospital for all participants. The number of antral follicles with a diameter of approximately 3–9 mm in each ovary was recorded separately by the researcher on a checklist. Sample size The sample size was calculated based on a study by Farhadi et al. [ 42 42 Randomization and intervention Participants were randomly assigned to two groups just before the start of the intervention in a 1:1 allocation ratio using block randomization with blocks of four and six. Randomization was conducted by an individual not involved in the sampling process using the Randomizer software to ensure allocation concealment, and the intervention received (drug or placebo) was placed in sequentially numbered, opaque vials, thus blinding the sampler and outcome assessor. During the intervention period, participants took three 300 mg fennel tablet or a placebo daily. The fennel tablets and their placebos, which were indistinguishable in shape and color, were prepared by Barij Essence Pharmaceutical Company and were administered three times a day for two months (the time required for the growth of pre-antral follicles is approximately two months [ 43 Statistical analysis The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation) and inferential statistics with SPSS version 26. Independent t-tests were used to compare the intervention and control groups in terms of quantitative variables such as age, age at menarche, BMI, and FSH levels. The Chi-square test was used to compare educational levels, and Fisher’s exact test was used to compare occupation, type of infertility, and menstrual cycle regularity. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare AMH levels and AFC before the intervention due to the non-normal distribution of the variables. After the intervention, ANCOVA was used to compare AMH levels and AFC between the groups, adjusting for baseline values. All analyses were based on the intention-to-treat approach. Side effects were reported using descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage). Results A total of 100 women with POI were enrolled in the study from June 2023, to October 2023, and their follow-up ended on January 2024. Twenty-five participants were excluded due to not meeting the inclusion criteria, and 15 declined to participate. Therefore, 60 women were randomly and equally assigned to the fennel and control groups. In the fennel group, two participants dropped out due to headaches and palpitations, and two due to amenorrhea; in the placebo group, two dropped out due to amenorrhea and one due to a headache. Ultimately, 26 participants in the fennel group and 27 in the placebo group were analyzed Fig. 1 1 p 1  Fig. 1 Flow chart of the study  Table 1 Socio-demographic characteristics of the participants in study groups Variable Fennel (30 = n Placebo(30 = n P Age (years)** 38/6 ± 1/9 38/1 ± 2/4 0/415 † BMI** 26/9 ± 2/9 26/9 ± 4/3 † Gravida* ‡ 0 20 (66) 22 (74) 1 7 (24) 6 (20) 2 or more 3 (10) 2 (6) Number of births* 0 24 (80) 24 (80) ‡ 1 (20) 6 6 (20) Number of living child* 0 24 (80) 24 (80) ‡ 1 6 (20) 6 (20) Number of abortions* 0 23 (76) 28 (93) ‡ 1 5 (17) 2 (7) 2 or more 2 (7) 0 (0/0) Regular menstruation 29 (97) 30 (100) § Infertility period (years)** 8/7 ± 5/5 7/2 ± 4/7 † Type of infertility 0/779 § Primary 20 (67) 22 (73) Secondary 10 (33) 8 (27) Occupation >0/99 § Housekeeper 24 (80) 23 (77) Employed 6 (20) 7 (23) Education 0/558 ‡ Illiterate 2 (7) 3 (10) Elementary 13 (43) 6 (20) High school 3 (10) 6 (20) Diploma 5 (17) 10 (33) University 7 (23) 5 (17) Income 0/333 ‡ Enough 29 (96.7) 28 (93.3) Insufficient 0 (00) 1 (3.3) Relatively enough 1 (3.3) 1 (3.3) House Status 0/032 †† Personal 10 (33.3) 12 (40.0) Rental 10 (33.3) 16 (53.3) Relative’s house 10 (33.3) 2 (6.7) *Number (%), **mean(SD), § † †† ‡ The Mann-Whitney U test showed that there was no statistically significant difference in AMH levels between the fennel and placebo groups before the intervention ( P p 2  Table 2 Comparison of Antimullerin hormone and antral follicles before and after the intervention in study groups Fennel group( n Placebo group( n Variable Median (first and third quarter) Mean (standard deviation) Median (first and third quarter) Mean (standard deviation) Mean difference (95% confidence interval) P AMH Before intervention 0.24(0.00 to 0.66) 0.35(0.39) 0.13(0.00 to 0.53) 0.32(0.39) 0.825* After intervention 0.34(0.00 to 0.89) 0.37(0.53) 0.49 (0.00 to 0.76) 0.39(0.46) 0.00(−0.29 to 0.29) 0. †986 AFC Before intervention 2.5 (1.0 to 4.0) 3.0(2.1) 2.5 (2.0 to 5.0) 3.4(2.4) 0.572* After intervention 4.0 (1.0 to 7.0) 3.4(3.1) 2.0(1.0 to 5.0) 2.8(2.4) 1.6(0.07 to 3.1) 0.040† AMH AFC †ANOVA test with control of base score and residence variable, * U-Mann-Whitney test The Mann-Whitney U test indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in AFC between the fennel and placebo groups before the intervention ( P p 2 Side effects of the supplement were assessed as a secondary outcome. There were one case of abdominal pain and one case of palpitations in the fennel group, and one case of headache in the placebo group. Discussion The results of this randomized clinical trial showed that fennel increased ovarian reserve, as evidenced by a significant increase in AFC in the intervention group compared to the control group after the intervention period. However, there was no significant increase in AMH levels in the intervention group compared to the control group. Phytoestrogens are polyphenolic compounds that can be divided into two groups: flavonoids and isoflavonoids. Isoflavonoids have a structural and functional similarity to mammalian estrogens, particularly 17β-estradiol [ 44 45 46 47 A study by Fallah Hosseini and Kianbakht in Iran in 2012 on Wistar rats aimed to determine the effects of aqueous extracts of fenugreek root, fennel seeds, and milk on fertility and the sex of newborn rats. The study showed that the number of pregnant rats and the total number of newborns in the fennel group significantly increased compared to the control and other groups ( P P 48 Another study by Sirotkin et al. in 2020 aimed to investigate the direct effects of fennel on the basic functions of ovarian cells, such as proliferation, apoptosis, and response to physiological hormonal stimuli, such as ghrelin. The study showed that fennel could change the apoptosis ratio in favor of proliferation, thereby potentially stimulating ovarian cells and folliculogenesis [ 49 In a study by Yavangi et al. in 2020 to determine the effect of fennel extract on fertility outcomes in assisted reproductive technology (ART) in women with poor ovarian response, 41 infertile women with POF were assessed. Before and after treatment with fennel extract, levels of LH and FSH, ovarian volume, and the number of antral follicles were measured on the third day of the menstrual cycle and mid-cycle. Patients consumed 50 cc of fennel extract nightly and after two months of treatment with fennel, laboratory tests and sonography were repeated; then, an ovarian stimulation protocol was used. Significant differences in serum LH levels ( P P P P P P P 31 Pre-ovulatory follicles have antioxidant properties; for example, glutathione, a water-soluble antioxidant synthesized intracellularly [ 50 51 26 52 23 25 53 26 Antioxidants from exogenous sources are able to counteract the undesirable effects of OS on the ovary and show good therapeutic effects in preventing and treating POI [ 23 54 In another study by Hongxia Xu et al., the antioxidant effects of melatonin on ovarian reserve capacity, granulosa cells, AMH, and FSH in female mice that had developed POI due to Cyclophosphamide (CTX) were investigated. The study found that melatonin treatment significantly reduced serum levels of FSH and LH ( p p 55 In a similar study by Moradi et al., the antioxidant effects of 0.5 mg/kg/day Capsaicin (CAP) and 100 mg/kg/day Quercetin (QUR) on POF caused by cyclophosphamide (CYC) in a mouse model were examined. In this study, ovarian volume decreased in mice with POF, and apoptosis of ovarian cells increased as a result of CYC injection. After treatment with CAP and QUR, ovarian volume significantly increased with a reduction in the expression of pro-apoptotic genes, and serum AMH levels and the number of follicles significantly increased. This study showed that CAP could improve tissue markers of oxidative stress [ 56 Overall, the results of these studies indicate that antioxidants have a positive effect on increasing ovarian reserve, particularly AMH levels. F. vulgare has antioxidant activity and is used to protect against damage from oxidative stress [ 29 57 A study by Fahimeh Pourjafari and colleagues aimed to investigate the effects of two well-known medicinal plants (fennel and flaxseed) on serum AMH levels and AMH expression in the ovaries of first-generation female mice. In the fennel group, AMH + cells increased in all follicles regardless of size, intensity, and age. AMH expression in the fennel and fennel plus flaxseed groups significantly increased compared to the control and flaxseed groups ( P P P 45 In contrast, in a human study by Shuyu Wang and colleagues in China aimed to determine the antioxidant effect of Coenzyme Q10 on ovarian response and embryo quality in young women with low basal levels and reduced ovarian reserve. The study showed that baseline FSH levels on the third day of the menstrual cycle were significantly lower after 60 days of CoQ10 supplementation compared to pre-treatment levels in the same group of women. In contrast, AMH and AFC levels before and after CoQ10 treatment were almost the same. The amount of gonadotropin used in the CoQ10 treatment group was significantly lower than in the control group ( P P P P P 58 Limitations and strengths The strengths of this study are the complete observance of clinical trial principles, including random allocation and blinding; conducting follow-up phone calls with participants to ensure regular use of drug/placebo. Limitations of this study included not measuring other hormones involved in premature ovarian insufficiency such as FSH and estrogen, as well as a small number of research participants due to financial constraints, which hindered the generalization of the study to all individuals affected by hidden premature ovarian insufficiency. Conducting studies with a larger sample size and longer follow-up time, as well as measuring other hormones involved in premature ovarian failure, dominant follicles and the number of pregnancies, is recommended. Conclusion Fennel extract may have a beneficial effect on AFC in infertile women with occult POI, but had no effect on serum AMH levels. It seems that more studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm or refute the results of this study to speak with greater certainty about the effectiveness of this intervention and to use them as effective, inexpensive, safe, and acceptable interventions for patients to manage premature ovarian insufficiency in the future.
