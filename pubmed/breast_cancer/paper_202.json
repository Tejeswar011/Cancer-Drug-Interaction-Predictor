Introduction Fenugreek ( Trigonella foenum-graecum Methods This study employed metabolomics and transcriptomics to analyze metabolite profiles and gene expression in fenugreek roots, stems, and leaves. Using UPLC-MS/MS, we identified 2,124 metabolites, and full-length transcriptome sequencing alongside RNA-seq analysis revealed tissue-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Results Our analysis revealed distinct tissue-specific accumulation patterns of alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids. The roots were identified as the primary site for the biosynthesis of these secondary metabolites.

Current evidence indicates that this metabolic route originates from the formation of isopentenyl diphosphate (IDP) precursors, which are subsequently converted to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). This intermediate is then catalyzed by squalene synthase (SQS) to generate squalene. Subsequent enzymatic modifications involve squalene epoxidase (SEP) and cycloartenol synthase (CAS), which sequentially mediate the synthesis of cycloartenol through two-step epoxidation and cyclization processes ( Nguyen et al., 2013 Gas-Pascual et al., 2014 Mohammadi et al., 2020 Schaeffer et al., 2001 Nasiri et al., 2022 O Gao et al., 2021 Christ et al., 2019 Elucidating the genetic regulatory networks that govern biochemical pathways is pivotal for establishing genotype-metabolotype correlations in plants that accumulate bioactive compounds ( Salami et al., 2024 Salami et al., 2023 Riasat et al., 2018 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant materials and growth condition The fenugreek seeds used in this study were obtained from local germplasm resources in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, China. Species identification was performed through comprehensive analysis combining morphological characterization of plant specimens with DNA barcoding techniques targeting the ITS2 psbA 2.2 Metabolomics profiling and data analysis Metabolomics sample preparation and bioinformatics analysis were conducted at Shanghai Majorbio Co., LTD. ( http://www.majorbio.com/ Raw data were processed using Progenesis QI (Waters Corporation, USA), and a data matrix was\ngenerated by matching against the self-constructed plant Metabolite Database (MJDBPM). Data\npre-processing was conducted via cloud.majorbio.com 2.3 Full-length library construction and SMRT sequencing Total RNA was extracted from tissue samples using RNAprep Pure Plant Plus Kit (Polysaccharides & Polyphenolics-rich) (Tiangen Biotech, China) and quantified for concentration and purity using the Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). RNA integrity was assessed via agarose gel electrophoresis, and the RNA integrity number (RIN) was determined using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Equal amounts of RNA from roots, stems, and leaves were pooled. Full-length cDNA was synthesized using the SMARTer™ PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa, Japan) and purified with PB magnetic beads (PacBio, USA) to construct the sequencing library. Library quality was rigorously evaluated before sequencing. Full-length transcriptome sequencing was performed on the PacBio platform (PacBio, USA). Post-sequencing, high-quality data were filtered through stringent quality control measures. Raw data were processed using Iso-Seq3 software (PacBio, USA) to generate full-length consensus sequences. Circular consensus sequencing (CCS) reads were extracted based on full passes ≥ 3 and sequence accuracy > 0.90. Data were further evaluated by analyzing circular consensus sequencing (CCS) sequence counts, base numbers, and average insert lengths. 2.4 Transcriptome sequencing analysis The cDNA library was sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq X Plus system (Illumina, USA). Raw sequencing data were processed using Fastp (Version 0.23.2) ( https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp http://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/ http://bioconductor.org/packages/stats/bioc/DESeq2/ 2.5 Integration analysis of metabolome and transcriptome The biosynthesis mechanisms of fenugreek secondary metabolites were elucidated by integrating differentially expressed metabolites (DAMs) with differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We constructed a DEG-DAM association network based on KEGG functional pathways, enabling detailed statistical analysis of flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenes, with a focus on their subclasses and metabolic pathways. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to quantify the relationship between metabolite levels and corresponding mRNA expression within each sample group. Correlation heatmaps and network maps were used to visualize these relationships. 2.6 Quantitative real-time PCR To verify the accuracy of the transcriptome sequencing quantification results, we conducted qRT-PCR experiments. In the experimental methodology, we selected genes involved in metabolic pathways and validated their expression profiles via qRT-PCR. To ensure data precision and robustness, tissue samples were processed with a rigorous experimental design, including both biological and technical triplicates. Total RNA was extracted from the samples and reverse-transcribed into cDNA following standard protocols using the PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser (TaKaRa, Japan). qRT-PCR analysis was performed using the CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad, USA) with SYBR Green master mix (AGBio, China). The TfACT7 -ΔΔ  C t Dong et al., 2024  Supplementary Table S1 2.7 Molecule docking To further verify the correlation between ABC transporters and metabolites, we conducted molecular docking experiments. The three-dimensional structure of the ABC transporter was predicted using AlphaFold2 (DeepMind, UK) and the model with the highest PLDDT score was selected. Ligand structures of plant secondary metabolites were retrieved from PubChem and optimized through energy minimization using Chem3D 19.0 (PerkinElmer, USA). Following binding pocket prediction with Proteins.plus ( https://proteins.plus Peng et al., 2022 Ma et al., 2024 2.8 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses and graphical representations were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted with SPSS v20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Gene expression levels and metabolite concentrations were visualized through heatmaps generated in Microsoft Excel 2019 using a tripartite color gradient in conditional formatting, with Z-score normalized data reflecting relative abundance patterns. 3 Results 3.1 Fenugreek metabolome profiling and DAMs identification To investigate the metabolomic profiles of fenugreek roots, stems, and leaves, we performed ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) to establish a comprehensive metabolomic database. Through PCA, we observed a significant reduction in variability between biological replicates, which validated the consistency and reliability of the experimental results. PCA results also revealed distinct metabolomic differences among the tissues (  Figure 1A  Supplementary Figure S1  Figure 1B  Figure 1C Figure 1 Metabolomic profiles of fenugreek.

To identify tissue-specific metabolic regulation, we performed pairwise comparisons and identified differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs). The comparison between leaves and roots (DL_vs_DR) showed the most pronounced differences, with 1,020 DAMs, followed by root vs. stem (DR_vs_DS, 970 DAMs) and leaf vs. stem (DL_vs_DS, 743 DAMs) (  Figure 1D  Supplementary Figures S2A, B  Supplementary Figures S2C, D  Supplementary Figures S2E, F  Supplementary Figures S2G, H  Supplementary Figures S2I, J  Supplementary Figures S2K, L O  Figures 1E-H 3.2 Characterization of the full-length transcriptome of fenugreek In the absence of a reference genome, we employed single-molecule real-time sequencing (SMRT) technology to sequence the full-length transcriptome of fenugreek, generating approximately 37.8 Gb of sequencing data. After self-correction and data curation, we obtained 228,601 circular consensus sequences (CCSs), of which 203,123 were identified as full-length non-chimeric (FLNC) reads for subsequent analysis (  Supplementary Table S2  Supplementary Figure S2  Supplementary Table S3 3.3 Transcriptome analysis of DEGs in fenugreek To investigate DEGs among fenugreek tissues (roots, stems, and leaves), we extracted transcriptome data, generating a comprehensive dataset of 58.54 Gb high-quality clean data.

This study employed UPLC-MS/MS to construct a comprehensive metabolomics database of fenugreek, uncovering significant metabolic variations across its root, stem, and leaf tissues. Our analysis identified numerous DAMs within these tissues. Notably, the roots of fenugreek were found to be the primary reservoirs for flavonoids, alkaloids, and terpenoids, whereas the leaves accumulated specific flavonoids and diterpenoids (  Figure 1 Pueraria lobata Xi et al., 2023 Pueraria lobata  Figure 2 Naika et al., 2022 4.2  De novo In the absence of a reference genome for fenugreek, full-length transcriptome sequencing provided a comprehensive overview of expressed genes (  Supplementary Figure S2 Naika et al., 2022  Figure 3 Gao et al., 2021 Christ et al., 2019 Islam et al., 2020 Wu et al., 2022 All_1_transcript_6824_TfCHS TfCHI All_1_transcript_78079 All_1_transcript_72877 All_1_transcript_81643 All_1_transcript_86801 TfCYP75B1 All_1_transcript_64340 All_1_transcript_60598  Figure 3 Chen et al., 2022 Rasi et al., 2024 TR All_1_transcript_81371  Figure 3 Gentiana dahurica Li et al., 2022 Cao et al., 2016 MTD All_1_transcript_72649 All_1_transcript_74582  Figure 3 4.3 Evolutionarily conserved roles of ABC transporters in metabolite partitioning Plant secondary metabolites, particularly flavonoids, terpenoids, and alkaloids, are synthesized and accumulate in specific tissues. Transport mechanisms are essential in this process. For instance, AaPDR3 in Artemisia annua Fu et al., 2017 Salvia miltiorrhiza Li et al., 2024 Coptis japonica Shitan et al., 2003 Fei et al., 2024  Figure 2  Supplementary Figure S5  Supplementary Figure S6  Figure 4  Figures 4B, C 4.4 Uncharted transcriptional landscape governing bioactive compound synthesis In recent years, the transcriptional regulation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis in medicinal plants has garnered extensive attention. Notable advancements have been achieved in elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of key compounds, such as artemisinin, taxol, tanshinone, ginsenosides, camptothecin, and salvianolic acid ( Shi et al., 2024 Shi et al., 2018 Shen et al., 2016 Yuan et al., 2023 Zhang et al., 2015 Fang et al., 2023 Wang et al., 2022 Peng et al., 2020 Hao et al., 2023 Rohani et al., 2016 Wang et al., 2019 Glycine max Yan et al., 2015 Liu et al., 2013 Chu et al., 2017 Bian et al., 2018 Medicago sativa MsFLS MsF3’H Su et al., 2025 Pueraria lobata thomsonii PtMYBs Wu et al., 2023  Figure 5A, C  Figure 5D 5 Conclusion Fenugreek’s secondary metabolites hold significant potential for pharmaceutical and nutritional applications. In this study, we used an integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics approach to analyze DAMs and DEGs in fenugreek seedling tissues (roots, stems, and leaves). Our findings revealed that the roots are the primary site for synthesizing and accumulating most secondary metabolites, while specific terpenoids and flavonoids were mainly enriched in stems and leaves. Through multi-omics analysis, we identified key enzyme-coding genes involved in the biosynthesis of alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids, providing essential genetic resources for engineering high-efficiency medicinal compound production. Additionally, we discovered ABC transporter genes and TFs potentially regulating secondary metabolite biosynthesis and transport. Co-expression networks and molecular docking elucidate metabolite-transporter interactions. These findings provide genetic resources for engineering high-yield metabolite production and support molecular breeding strategies for pharmaceutical applications.
