The Hemoglobin, Albumin, Lymphocyte, Platelet (HALP) score, a composite biomarker of nutritional and inflammatory status, has shown prognostic value in various malignant and inflammatory conditions. This study aimed to evaluate the role of HALP score in predicting strangulation and the need for bowel or tissue resection in patients undergoing surgery for incarcerated abdominal wall hernias. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the data of 135 patients who underwent elective or emergency hernia surgery due to incarceration between 2015 and January 2025. Patients were divided into two groups: those requiring tissue or organ resection due to intraoperative signs of strangulation (n = 53) and those who underwent hernia repair without resection (n = 82). HALP scores were calculated using preoperative laboratory values. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric tests due to the non-normal distribution of variables. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of the 135 patients included, 53 (39.3%) underwent bowel or tissue resection due to intraoperative evidence of strangulation, while 82 (60.7%) underwent hernia repair without resection. Patients in the resection group tended to be older (median age: 72 vs. 64 years, p p p Conclusion A decreasing trend was observed, the trend toward lower HALP scores in patients with strangulated hernias suggests a potential role for HALP as a supportive biomarker in preoperative risk assessment. Its low cost and accessibility make it a practical tool, especially in emergency settings. Larger, prospective studies with standardized preoperative protocols are warranted to validate the clinical utility of HALP in predicting ischemic complications in incarcerated hernias. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025 Introduction Hernia surgery is one of the most common surgical procedures performed in General surgery. 20 million hernia surgeries are performed annually in the world [ 1 2 3 4 Hemoglobin, Albumin, Lymphocyte,Platelet (HALP) score is a relatively new prognostic index that has been introduced by Chen et al. in 2015, to predict the prognosis in gastric cancer. It is a scoring system that combines biochemical markers related to patients nutritional and inflammatory status. The score was calculated as [hemoglobin (g/L) × albumin (g/L) × lymphocytes (/L)]/platelets (/L) [ 5 6 7 8 6 In this study, from a general surgeon’s perspective, we aimed to investigate whether the HALP score is associated with ischemic changes in the contents of abdominal wall defects. We hypothesized that lower preoperative HALP scores would be associated with intraoperative findings of tissue ischemia necessitating resection. Material methods In this study, we assessed the data of the patients who underwent elective or emergency hernia surgery in our hospital, due to incarceration, retrospectively. Our study includes patients who underwent operation between 2015 and 2025 January. It was not possible to obtain information of whole incarcerated hernia patients due to changes in hospital data storage programme and unfortunately for some patients who have the info on their diagnosis, there was no surgery note in the system. We had to exclude those patients. Patients who have insufficient data on surgery notes were excluded as well. Eventually, our study was conducted with 135 patients. Due to the transitions in the hospital information system, some patients diagnosed with incarcerated hernia lacked accessible surgical notes or laboratory records. Among the initially screened 149 patients, 14 (9.4%) were excluded due to insufficient data, including missing operative notes or unavailable preoperative blood tests. Only those with inadequate documentation were excluded, in an effort to minimize selection bias. However, this exclusion may have contributed to the absence of statistical significance in our primary outcome, and it has been acknowledged among the study’s limitations. The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of Ankara Training and Research Hospital (E25/547). During our study we retrospectively evaluated the need of the tissue-organ resection during hernia surgeries due to ischemia. One arm of the study included those needed resection while other arm had patients who had hernia repair after reduction of hernia sac content but not resection. It is important to underline that we are talking about resections performed due to ischemic status of the incarcerated hernia contents. Because in some surgeries, grossly normal looking tissues were ligated and removed in order to obtain better exposure and facilitate the surgery. In our study this type of resections were not taken into consideration. As landmark to determine which tissue is ischemic and which is not, our study relied on surgeon’s decision in surgery. In most of the cases, if the tissue is not completely necrotic, surgeon applied necessary measures and waited for enough time to save the organ. At the end, according to appereance, decision to excise was taken. And accordingly, pathology reports of excised tissues affirm that they were showing signs of necrosis or ischemia. While calculating HALP scores, we took the latest blood test results before surgery into consideration, as rule. In emergency surgeries, preoperative blood samples were drawn shortly before incision, whereas in elective cases, blood tests were typically obtained within 2–5 days prior to surgery . Statistical analysis The data was analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The normality of the distribution of continuous variables was evaluated by using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Because all continuous variables were determined to be non-normally distributed, they were presented as median (minimum–maximum). Categorical variables were given as frequency (percentage). Continuous variables were compared using the Mann–Whitney U test, and the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variable comparisons. A two-tailed p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results A total of 135 patients who underwent emergency or elective surgery for incarcerated abdominal wall hernias were included in the study. Of these, 53 patients (39.3%) required bowel or tissue resection due to intraoperative findings of ischemia or necrosis (strangulated hernia group), whereas 82 patients (60.7%) underwent only hernia repair after successful reduction of the hernia contents without the need for resection (incarceration-only group). Demographic and clinical characteristics The mean age of the entire cohort was 63.47 ± 16.94 years, with a median age of 67 (range 24–94). Patients in the strangulation group were older than those in the incarceration-only group, with a median age of 72 (30–92) vs. 64 (24–94), respectively. Although this difference was not statistically significant, a trend was observed (p = 0.083) (Table 1 Table 1 Comparison of age and halp score between patients with and without strangulation Study group Strangulation (+) Strangulation (−) p Age, years 63.47 ± 16.94 67 (24–94) 66.34 ± 16.15 72 (30–92) 61.61 ± 17.28 64 (24–94) 0.114 0.083 HALP score 4.45 ± 2.82 3.83 (0.62–14.84) 4.1 ± 3.02 2.55 (0.62–11.35) 4.67 ± 2.69 4.55 (0.95–14.84) 0.253 0.092 HALP There was no significant difference in gender distribution between groups (p = 0.467). Among the patients who underwent resection, 27 (50.9%) were male and 26 (49.1%) were female, compared to 47 (57.3%) males and 35 (42.7%) females in the non-resection group (Table 2 Table 2 Comparison of gender, hernia characteristics, surgical approach, and additional organ resections between strangulated and non-strangulated hernia cases Study group Strangulation (+) Strangulation (−) p Gender Male 74 (54.8) 27 (50.9) 47 (57.3) 0.467 Female 61 (45.2) 26 (49.1) 35 (42.7) Hernia type Inguinal 60 (44.4) 21 (39.6) 39 (47.6) 0.748 Femoral 21 (15.6) 10 (18.9) 11 (13.4) Umbilical 28 (20.7) 11 (20.8) 17 (20.7) Incisional 22 (16.3) 9 (17) 13 (15.9) Epigastric 3 (2.2) 1 (1.9) 2 (2.4) Femoral + umbilical 1 (0.7) 1 (1.9) – Additional organ resection No 82 (60.7) – 82 (100) < 0.001 Yes 53 (39.3) 53 (100) – Small intestine 22 (16.3) 22 (41.5) – Omentum 19 (14.1) 19 (35.8) – Peritoneum 1 (0.7) 1 (1.9) – Appendix vermiformis 1 (0.7) 1 (1.9) – Appendix epiploica 2 (1.5) 2 (3.8) – Small intestine + colon 1 (0.7) 1 (1.9) – Small intestine + omentum 6 (4.4) 6 (11.3) – Colon + omentum 1 (0.7) 1 (1.9) – Hernia side (for inguinal/femoral hernia) Right 47 (57.3) 19 (59.4) 28 (56) 0.063 Left 32 (39) 10 (31.3) 22 (44) Unknown 3 (3.7) 3 (9.4) – Type of surgery Open 132 (97.8) 53 (100) 79 (96.3) 0.279 Laparoscopic 3 (2.2) – 3 (3.7) Significant p HALP score comparison The mean HALP score for all patients was 4.45 ± 2.82, with a median value of 3.83 (range 0.62–14.84). In the strangulation group, the mean HALP score was lower (4.1 ± 3.02; median 2.55), compared to the incarceration-only group (mean 4.67 ± 2.69; median 4.55). Although the HALP score tended to be lower in the resection group, this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.092) (Table 1 Hernia characteristics The most frequently observed hernia type in both groups was inguinal hernia (n = 60, 44.4%), followed by umbilical (n = 28, 20.7%), incisional (n = 22, 16.3%), femoral (n = 21, 15.6%), and epigastric hernias (n = 3, 2.2%). There was no statistically significant difference in hernia type distribution between the two groups (p = 0.748) (Table 2 Regarding sided hernias (inguinal or femoral), right-sided hernias were more common overall (n = 47, 57.3%), followed by left-sided (n = 32, 39.0%), with 3 patients (3.7%) having unspecified side information. In the strangulation group, 59.4% of sided hernias were right-sided, compared to 56% in the incarceration-only group. This distribution showed no significant difference (p = 0.063) (Table 2 Surgical details and organ resection All patients in the strangulation group (n = 53) underwent organ or tissue resection. Among these, 22 (41.5%) underwent small intestine resection, 19 (35.8%) had omentum resected, and a smaller number underwent resection of peritoneum (1.9%), appendix vermiformis (1.9%), appendix epiploica (3.8%), colon (with or without small intestine/omentum; total 13.2%). In contrast, no resections were performed in the incarceration-only group. This difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001) (Table 2 Open surgery was the predominant approach in both groups (97.8% overall), with only 3 patients (2.2%) undergoing laparoscopic repair. There was no significant difference in surgical technique between groups (p = 0.279) (Table 2 Discussion Abdominal wall hernias are frequently encountered in surgical practice and are primarily managed through operative intervention. In some cases, the herniated contents become incarcerated, leading to a risk of strangulation, particularly when vascular compromise occurs. This may result in bowel ischemia and subsequent necrosis, both of which are potentially life-threatening complications. Therefore, early recognition of ischemia and necrosis is critical for optimal surgical planning and patient outcomes [ 9 3 10 In this context, there is increasing interest in identifying objective biomarkers that could help distinguish between simple incarceration and strangulation, particularly in emergency settings where rapid decision-making is essential. One such tool is the HALP (Hemoglobin, Albumin, Lymphocyte, Platelet) score, which reflects a patient’s immune-nutritional and inflammatory status. Originally introduced in oncology, HALP has shown prognostic value in various malignancies and has recently gained attention in inflammatory surgical conditions such as appendicitis and diverticulitis [ 5 7 8 In our study, although not statistically significant, patients with strangulated hernias had lower median HALP scores compared to those without strangulation (2.55 vs. 4.55; p = 0.092). This suggests that a lower HALP score may reflect tissue hypoxia, systemic inflammation, and compromised nutritional reserves—all of which may predispose to or result from strangulation-related ischemia. Similarly, patients requiring bowel resection were older on average (median age: 72 vs. 64; p = 0.083), supporting previous findings that advanced age is a risk factor for strangulation due to delayed presentation, comorbidities, or reduced physiological reserve [ 11 13 Although this trend did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.748), the relatively higher frequency of femoral hernias in the resected group may still reflect a clinically relevant predisposition to strangulation, which could become significant in larger cohorts. Additionally, hernia side (right vs. left) was not significantly associated with strangulation (p = 0.063), but right-sided hernias were more common overall—likely reflecting the natural anatomical dominance observed in previous studies [ 14 15 The only variable that was statistically significant in relation to strangulation was the need for additional organ resection (p < 0.001), which is a direct surgical consequence of ischemia and necrosis. This finding validates the clinical judgment used intraoperatively and underscores the importance of identifying strangulation early, before irreversible damage occurs. This study has several limitations. First, its retrospective and single-center design limits the Generalizability of the findings. Data were collected from a single institution over a 10-year period, and due to changes in the hospital’s digital record systems, some incarcerated hernia cases were excluded—particularly those with missing operative notes or incomplete laboratory data. This introduces a degree of selection bias that may have influenced the results. Second, although the HALP score demonstrated a trend toward lower values in patients with strangulated hernias, the difference did not reach statistical significance. This may be attributable to the limited sample size, particularly in the resection group (n = 53), which may have underpowered the study to detect subtle but clinically relevant differences. Larger cohorts are needed to validate the observed trends and to establish optimal HALP cut-off values for predicting ischemic complications. Third, the timing of the laboratory measurements used to calculate the HALP score varied. In emergency cases, blood samples were obtained immediately before surgery, whereas in elective cases, preoperative tests may have been performed several days earlier. This lack of standardization could affect the accuracy of the HALP score in reflecting the true preoperative immunonutritional status. Lastly, although the study aimed to exclude resections performed for technical convenience, the intraoperative assessment of ischemia is inherently subjective and may vary between surgeons. Furthermore, other inflammatory markers such as CRP, NLR, and LDH were not consistently available in the dataset, limiting the opportunity to compare the HALP score with other established prognostic biomarkers. Overall, our findings suggest that the HALP score may serve as a helpful adjunct in the preoperative evaluation of incarcerated hernias. In future clinical practice, HALP scores may support surgical decision-making in borderline cases where clinical signs of ischemia are equivocal and early intervention is not clearly indicated. Larger, prospective, multicenter studies with standardized laboratory sampling are warranted to better define the prognostic value and optimal cut-off values for HALP in this patient population. Conclusion While our findings did not reach statistical significance, the consistent downward trend in HALP scores among patients requiring resection suggests potential prognostic utility. Given its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and availability from routine laboratory tests, HALP may serve as a supportive tool in the preoperative assessment of incarcerated hernias, especially in emergency settings. To validate its predictive role and establish clinically meaningful cut-off values, future large-scale, multicenter prospective studies with standardized laboratory protocols and comparisons to established inflammatory markers are warranted.
