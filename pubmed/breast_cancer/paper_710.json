Methods We studied the prevalence/incidence of CIDP in Asian (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) and white subjects in Birmingham, UK, and associations of ethnicity with demographics/deprivation/phenotype/treatment and outcomes. Results On 10th July 2025, CIDP prevalence was 6.18 per 100 000 (95% CI: 4.66–8.05). Prevalence was lower in Asian (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) compared to white subjects (2.64 per 100 000 vs. 10.15 per 100 000; RR: 0.260, 95% CI: 0.111–0.609; p p p p p p p Conclusions Subjects of Asian (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) ethnicity in the UK may have a lower risk of CIDP after 50 years of age, but an equivalent risk between 18 and 49 years, compared to white subjects. They may present younger, be more socially deprived, and be more likely noncompliant to treatment, compared to white subjects.

Considering other autoimmune neurological diseases, lower incidence rates have been described in the UK in nonwhite subjects compared to white subjects for multiple sclerosis (MS), whereas no difference was observed for myasthenia gravis [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 To our knowledge, inter‐ethnic differences have not been studied in CIDP. The low prevalence of CIDP represents a challenge for ascertaining eventual differences in the characteristics of affected subjects from ethnic minority subgroups. Our center in Birmingham, UK, offers the possibility of attempting to study this question, representing the only subspecialist unit for inflammatory neuropathy in the wider region and serving a city with a large nonwhite population, having reached 51.4% of the total population in 2021, of which the majority (27.1%) are of Asian (Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi) origin. In the current study, we mainly aimed to (i) ascertain the prevalence and incidence rates of CIDP in subjects of Asian (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) ethnicity, in comparison to white subjects, (ii) determine associations of Asian (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) ethnicity with demographic features, social deprivation, clinical characteristics, treatment access, and outcomes. 2 Materials and Methods We retrospectively reviewed electronic records of consecutive adult subjects (age ≥ 18 years) with a diagnosis of CIDP or possible CIDP, meeting European Academy of Neurology/Peripheral Nerve Society (EAN/PNS) 2021 criteria, attending the Inflammatory Neuropathy Service, University Hospitals Birmingham, UK. The Inflammatory Neuropathy Service is the only referral center for adults with chronic inflammatory neuropathy for the city of Birmingham and receives referrals for all newly diagnosed cases locally. It also receives additional out‐of‐area tertiary referrals from the West Midlands region and beyond. We collected demographics, ethnicity data, place of residence, social deprivation category, disease sub‐type, mode of onset, pretreatment disease duration from symptom onset, treatment(s) administered, treatment compliance, and outcomes. Ethnicity data were separated into two main sub‐categories: (i) any nonwhite ethnicity, (ii) any white ethnicity. We specifically compared, in the current study, from the former sub‐category, Asian (specifically, Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) ethnicity and any white ethnicity in the prevalence and incidence analyses. Population data and estimated ethnicity proportions per age group were obtained from the 2021 UK Census, Office of National Statistics [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 28.0 (Armonk, USA). CIDP point prevalence rate was determined at the point of analysis for the Birmingham residents and separately for Asian (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) and for white subjects, and stratified per age group (18–49 years and ≥ 50 years). Mean yearly incidence over the study period was determined for the Birmingham cohort and in subjects of Asian (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) and of white ethnicity. Relative risk (RR) for CIDP was established by nonparametric one‐sample binomial tests and 95% confidence intervals (CI) through Clopper‐Pearson (exact) tests for Asian (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) ethnicity versus white ethnicity. The prevalence, incidence, and RR analyses included only Birmingham residents and used available local population ethnicity data and age group proportions [ 16 p This analysis was conducted as part of a registered and approved retrospective clinical audit of the impact of social and economic factors on the diagnosis and management of CIDP in subjects attending the Inflammatory Neuropathy Service, University Hospitals Birmingham, UK (CARMS‐22724, 16th January 2025). Audit does not require Ethics Committee approval in the UK. 3 Results Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Identification and breakdown of cases of CIDP having attended the Inflammatory Neuropathy Service, University Hospitals Birmingham between July 2014 and July 2025.

There is, however, a paucity of data in CIDP, likely in view of its rarity. There have been a limited number of epidemiological studies performed in CIDP outside Europe and North America [ 22 23 24 Through a large cohort of subjects with CIDP attending our tertiary center and serving the second largest city in the UK, which now has a majority nonwhite population of high Asian (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) proportion, we have attempted to study the impact of ethnicity in CIDP. Although it is possible that few patients with CIDP may not have been referred to our service, we believe the prevalence rate found is likely accurate in the absence of other subspecialist services for inflammatory neuropathy locally and in the wider region and the well‐established links and referral pathways with local neurologists, which result in the systematic referral of all newly diagnosed local cases. The point prevalence and incidence rates are, furthermore, in keeping with those previously found in the UK [ 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Previous studies have reported a possible protective effect of Asian ethnicity against diabetic polyneuropathy compared to white subjects [ 6 34 35 36 37 We found correlations of Asian (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) ethnicity with younger age and with greater social deprivation in the wider cohort which included out‐of‐area tertiary referred subjects. Independent associations were found with both factors. These findings are in keeping with existing population data which show lower mean age as well as greater deprivation in nonwhite, and Asian populations, compared to white populations in the UK [ 38 3 39 40 41 42 Noncompliance to treatment was associated with Asian (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) ethnicity and having a local Birmingham postcode, with independent associations for both. Poor treatment compliance has been reported in ethnic minority and inner‐city populations in various medical settings in the UK [ 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 Our study is limited by its single‐center and retrospective design. We were not able to investigate epidemiological characteristics of other individual ethnic minorities, in view of the rarity of CIDP and small numbers of affected subjects from several other minority ethnic sub‐groups. Furthermore, the prevalence and incidence analyses were performed versus subjects of “any white ethnicity,” which represents itself a heterogeneous group. We cannot exclude, in view of the small sample size, that the Asian (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) subjects with CIDP in our cohort may not be representative of their wider ethnic group, with regard to detailed deprivation level, educational background, and disease awareness. This may have impacted upon our findings particularly with regard to predisease disability or tertiary referral rate, as we have recently described in another recent study [ 53 54 55 56 Despite limitations, we believe our study brings novel insights into the epidemiology of CIDP in different ethnic sub‐groups in the UK, which merit further investigation in larger diverse cohorts. Future studies are needed to confirm if, similar to diabetic polyneuropathy, CIDP risk is lower in Asian (Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) subjects compared to white subjects after 50 years of age and to understand why the risk may be equivalent in‐between ethnic groups earlier in life. Finally, and more generally, our findings on noncompliance to treatment and its deleterious effects on outcomes highlight the need for careful consideration of cultural factors in the holistic management of chronic neuromuscular diseases like CIDP in diverse ethnic environments.
