Introduction Peripheral nerve injuries represent a considerable clinical and socioeconomic burden. Epidemiological data indicate an incidence of 13–23 per 100,000 persons annually worldwide [ 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 SCs contribute to peripheral nerve regeneration by secreting neurotrophic factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, supporting both neuronal survival and axonal guidance [ 5 6 7 2+ 2+ 2+ 8 9 10 Multiple Ca 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 11 12 13 14 15 16 2+ 17 18 2+ 2+ 19 2+ 20 In parallel, optogenetic tools have emerged as precise actuators of intracellular Ca 2+ 2+ 21 22 23 2+ Figure 1 2+ Schematic representation illustrating the convergence of endogenous and optogenetic Ca 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ This review synthesizes current knowledge on the molecular architecture and functional implications of Ca 2+ 2+ 2+ 2. Endogenous Ca 2+ Among the multiple signaling inputs governing SC plasticity, Ca 2+ 2+ 2+ The major Ca 2+ Figure 2 2+ TRPV4, TRPA1, and TRPM7 mediate Ca 2+ 2+ 2+ 2.1. Voltage-Gated Ca 2+ VGCCs are integral membrane proteins that mediate Ca 2+ 1 2 24 25 24 25 In SCs, both T-type–like and L-type–like VGCC currents have been identified across several experimental models, including murine dorsal root ganglion (DRG) co-cultures [ 20 26 27 28 20 Notably, VGCC expression and activity in SCs are dynamically modulated by neuron-derived factors and intracellular cAMP signaling. Co-culture with DRG neurons enhances VGCC expression in SCs, while their removal markedly reduces detectable Ca 2+ 26 VGCCs, though less studied than other Ca 2+ Functionally, VGCCs in SCs contribute to neurotrophic factor release; in cultured SCs, electrical stimulation enhances NGF secretion via T-type channel–mediated Ca 2+ 3 27 2+ 28 Collectively, these findings indicate that SCs, although non-excitable, possess functionally relevant VGCCs that allow them to sense and respond to electrical and biochemical cues in the peripheral nerve environment. This Ca 2+ 2.2. TRP Channels TRP channels are a superfamily of non-selective cation channels that mediate Ca 2+ 29 30 Among them, members of the TRP channel family—particularly TRPA1, TRPV4, and TRPM7—play essential roles in transducing oxidative, mechanical, and inflammatory signals into Ca 2+ TRPA1 is activated by ROS and inflammatory mediators and is upregulated in SCs after nerve injury. Its activation promotes NOX1-dependent H 2 2 2+ 11 2+ 12 31 2+ 2+ 32 These TRP channels share the capacity to mediate stimulus-specific Ca 2+ Complementing TRP-mediated Ca 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 33 2+ 19 2+ 34 Together, TRP channels and SOCE channels allow SCs to maintain plastic Ca 2+ 2.3. Piezo Channels Piezo channels are a class of mechanically activated ion channels that open in response to membrane tension or deformation. Among them, Piezo1 and Piezo2 are the two principal isoforms identified in mammals [ 35 2+ 36 37 38 39 40 In SCs, Piezo2 has recently been identified as a critical regulator of mechanosensitive Ca 2+ 17 2+ 18 Consistent with this view, our recent findings [ 17 2+ 41 42 TRPM7, discussed in Section 2.2 2+ 13 14 43 2+ 32 2.4. P2X Channels Lastly, P2X receptors are a family of ligand-gated ion channels that are directly activated by extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), mediating rapid influx of cations such as Na + + 2+ 44 45 46 Upon ATP release during injury, P2X7 receptors mediate Ca 2+ 47 48 2+ 49 P2X4 receptors, on the other hand, are upregulated in SCs following peripheral nerve injury and are largely localized in intracellular compartments such as lysosomes, with translocation to the plasma membrane upon inflammatory stimulation [ 50 51 Collectively, purinergic signaling through P2X receptors equips SCs with the ability to detect ATP as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) and convert it into a spectrum of regenerative responses. These responses include phenotype modulation, cytokine secretion, axon guidance, and remyelination. The dual roles of P2X7 and P2X4—balancing inflammation, differentiation, and neurotrophic support—underscore their importance as molecular switches in the dynamic SC response to peripheral nerve injury. Taken together, endogenous Ca 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 3. Functional Implications of Ca 2+ After peripheral nerve injury, SCs undergo a dynamic transformation into a repair phenotype, characterized by increased motility, upregulation of trophic factor expression, and the formation of Bands of Büngner that guide axonal regrowth [ 52 53 54 2+ Ca 2+ 2+ 53 54 55 56 57 2+ 2+ 17 These pathways coordinate cytoskeletal remodeling, adhesion molecule regulation, and transcriptional reprogramming necessary for SC migration and the establishment of axon-guiding Bands of Büngner. Notably, SC plasticity underlies their ability to adapt to injury environments and support long-term regeneration, even in aged or chronically denervated tissues [ 58 59 60 2+ 61 62 2+ Recent bioinformatics analyses, including those assessing perineural invasion in cancer [ 63 2+ 2+ 61 62 2+ Section 4 Although SCs operate in a distinct physiological context, the overlap in Ca 2+ 2+ 2+ This secretory activity, driven by Ca 2+ Section 5 64 2+ Collectively, these findings underscore the multifaceted role of Ca 2+ 2+ 65 66 2+ 4. Optogenetic Control of Ca 2+ Optogenetics provides a powerful means to interrogate cellular signaling with high precision by using light-activated ion channels, most notably channelrhodopsins (ChRs). Originally developed for neuronal research, these microbial opsins act as light-gated cation channels that, upon photoactivation, permit the influx of monovalent and divalent cations. While traditionally applied to control membrane excitability in neurons, recent advances have expanded their application to glial biology, including SCs, where Ca 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ Figure 3 2+ Classical channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), originally derived from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, exhibits robust Na + 2+ 2+ + 67 2+ 2+ 67 68 2+ 69 CapChR2 is distinguished by its sustained Ca 2+ 2+ + 70 At the structural level, crystallographic and computational studies implicate a cluster of acidic residues—E83, E90, D253 (collectively referred to as the “E-E-D triad”)—that are responsible for divalent cation selectivity [ 71 72 73 2+ 2+ 73 2+ 2+ A notable functional property of CapChR2 is its irradiance-dependent gating. At low light intensities (0.5–1 mW/mm 2 2+ 2 2+ 72 2 Our recent electrophysiological analysis further demonstrated that the half-maximal effective irradiance (EC 50 2 70 2+ 2+ These electrophysiological and structural characteristics translate into distinct functional outcomes. The transient high Ca 2+ 2+ 56 74 70 2+ To further elucidate the molecular basis of this neuritogenic effect, we conducted mass spectrometry-based proteomic profiling of the SC secretome under conditions of elevated intracellular Ca 2+ 2+ 2+ 17 2+ Figure 4 Table 1 Schematic summary of Ca 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ Taken together, these data suggest that CapChR2 functions as a powerful optogenetic tool for modulating SC behavior in a light-dependent, Ca 2+ 2+ 5. Calcium-Triggered Secretory Programs in Schwann Cells: Implications for Nerve Regeneration Optogenetic activation of SCs via CapChR2 provides a cell-type–targetable approach to modulate glial function in peripheral nerve regeneration.

Axon Guidance Netrin/Slit/ROBO module: Mediates chemoattractive and chemorepulsive gradients essential for initial axonal pathfinding. Among the guidance molecules, netrin-1, Slit1, and their receptors (e.g., DCC, Unc5, ROBO1) constitute a functionally coherent group central to axon pathfinding. Netrin-1, originally identified as a chemoattractant secreted by floor plate cells, directs commissural axons in the developing spinal cord through interactions with DCC and integrins [ 75 76 76 77 Slit proteins, functioning primarily as chemorepellents via ROBO receptors, cooperate with netrin-1 in establishing complex axonal trajectories. In the thalamocortical system, overlapping gradients of Slit1 and netrin-1 generate emergent axonal responses not elicited by either cue alone [ 78 79 85 86 87 Collectively, these findings highlight the capacity of Ca 2+ 2+ Semaphorin/Plexin/Neuropilin axis: Functions predominantly as repulsive guidance signaling to ensure spatial fidelity of regrowth. In parallel, the Semaphorin–Plexin/Neuropilin axis represents another major regulatory module of axonal navigation and synaptic patterning. Semaphorins, including secreted class III members (e.g., Sema3A, Sema3F) and membrane-bound forms (e.g., Sema6A), act predominantly as repulsive cues that modulate growth cone dynamics during regeneration [ 81 83 84 82 88 89 93 94 2+ Semaphorin signaling is not only crucial during development but also restricts regenerative axon growth, as shown in C. elegans models where deletion of plexin genes leads to increased regrowth and reconnection of motor neuron neurites [ 84 83 93 94 88 89 Neuropilin-2 serves as a critical receptor component for Sema3F-mediated signaling and plays an indispensable role in directing axonal projections during neural development. Experimental analyses using Npn-2 knockout mice have revealed that the absence of Neuropilin-2 leads to disorganized formation of several cranial and spinal sensory nerves, along with aberrant axonal trajectories in the anterior commissure and hippocampal mossy fibers [ 93 94 2+ Ephrin/Eph system: Provides fine-tuned, contact-mediated signaling for topographical axonal targeting and synapse formation. Ephrin–Eph signaling represents yet another critical layer of contact-mediated guidance that functions through bidirectional signaling between membrane-bound Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands. EphA2, one of the Eph receptors, transduces both repulsive and attractive cues via cell–cell interactions and plays a central role in modulating growth cone behavior through reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton [ 90 91 92 92 2+ SCs activated by Ca 2+ 5.2. Neurotrophic Factors In parallel with axon guidance cues, Ca 2+ 143 18 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 BDNF, acting through TrkB and p75 (NTR) receptors, orchestrates a broad range of functions in neurons, from activity-dependent synaptic refinement to structural plasticity. It is involved in both central and peripheral nervous system development and repair, with downstream activation of CREB-, MAPK-, and PI3K-dependent pathways [ 99 101 102 VEGF-A, though classically known for its angiogenic function, exerts direct neurotrophic and neuroprotective actions by binding to VEGFR2/Flk-1 receptors expressed on neurons and glia. It enhances neurogenesis, axonal guidance, and neuronal survival both in vitro and in vivo [ 95 96 97 98 CXCL12 (SDF-1), a chemokine enriched in the perivascular niche after injury, binds to its receptor CXCR4 to guide neuronal precursor migration and axon pathfinding. In mature neurons, it supports neurite outgrowth and confers resistance to inhibitory molecules in the glial scar, via activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway [ 105 106 107 GDF7, a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, is selectively expressed in the dorsal roof plate and is essential for specifying subsets of commissural interneurons in the spinal cord [ 104 2+ Table 1 Collectively, the Ca 2+ Beyond their neural targets, SC-derived neurotrophic factors and neuromodulators may also influence adjacent non-neuronal cells, including keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts, suggesting broader roles in peripheral tissue homeostasis. This emerging perspective aligns with recent concepts from the field of neurocosmetics, which propose that peripheral nerves—through the activity of SCs—modulate skin physiology, barrier integrity, and even emotional responses via the skin–brain axis [ 144 145 146 147 148 2+ 148 5.3. Extracellular Matrix (ECM) Molecules In addition to soluble neurotrophic factors and axon guidance cues, SCs activated by Ca 2+ 2+ Among structural and adhesive glycoproteins, laminin β2 constitutes a foundational component of the SC basal lamina; fibronectin forms an injury-associated provisional matrix; type IX collagen (COL9A1) contributes to specialized matrices such as perineuronal nets. Laminin β2 acts via integrin and dystroglycan receptors to promote myelination and directed growth cone extension [ 149 150 2+ 151 152 Collagen IX (COL9A1), though less abundant, plays a critical role in synaptic organization and perineuronal net (PNN) maintenance. Its loss leads to disassembly of PNNs and aberrant inhibitory synapse formation in the telencephalon, suggesting roles in both peripheral and central neuroplasticity [ 118 119 Matrix components involved in synaptic and nodal specialization further illustrate the multifaceted influence of SCs beyond structural support. Agrin, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, is indispensable for the formation and stabilization of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), where it orchestrates postsynaptic differentiation and acetylcholine receptor clustering [ 108 153 110 2+ 109 108 Osteopontin (OPN), a multifunctional glycoprotein, is increasingly recognized as a critical modulator of inflammatory and regenerative signaling within the nervous system. OPN is secreted by both neurons and glia under pathological conditions and is upregulated in response to injury and neuroinflammation [ 114 154 113 114 Through the activity-dependent secretion of agrin and osteopontin, SCs participate in the re-establishment of synaptic architecture and functional connectivity. These molecules not only maintain nodal integrity and synaptic fidelity in the peripheral nervous system but also influence neuroimmune dynamics and synaptic plasticity in the central and autonomic nervous systems, reinforcing their relevance to global neural homeostasis and regeneration. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan glypican-1 and cytoskeletal linker MACF1 further support SC-mediated regeneration. Glypican-1 modulates the responsiveness of SCs and neurons to neurotrophic factors including BDNF, VEGF, and neuregulin through its interactions with heparan sulfate-binding domains and signaling receptors. It also participates in the differentiation of neuron-like cells via complex formation with neuregulin and contributes to SC myelination through its interaction with collagen α4(V) [ 120 121 122 124 Finally, MMP9, a matrix metalloproteinase, plays a multifaceted role in sculpting the regenerative niche. In addition to degrading structural ECM proteins, MMP9 liberates matrix-sequestered growth factors, modulates laminin-integrin signaling, and facilitates neuronal survival through PI3K/AKT pathway activation [ 115 117 116 155 Together, these ECM molecules comprise a finely tuned secretome that is activated in response to Ca 2+ 2+ 156 5.4. SC-Autonomous Regulation via MYRF and Associated Intracellular Signaling Cascades Beyond providing structural and paracrine support to neurons, SCs possess robust intrinsic mechanisms that regulate their own regenerative and myelinating phenotypes. A key emerging factor in this context is the myelin regulatory factor (MYRF), a membrane-associated transcription factor originally characterized in oligodendrocyte differentiation. MYRF has recently been implicated in peripheral nerve regeneration, where it supports transcriptional reprogramming in repair SCs. Upon proteolytic cleavage, MYRF translocates to the nucleus and promotes the expression of myelin-related genes such as Mbp and Prx, thereby maintaining glial identity under regenerative conditions. In peripheral nerves, MYRF expression is upregulated after injury and functions in concert with canonical SC transcription factors including SOX10, EGR2 (Krox20), and c-Jun, establishing a dynamic regulatory network that integrates injury cues, intracellular Ca 2+ 129 130 Importantly, intracellular Ca 2+ 2+ 2+ 126 MYRF-dependent transcriptional activity extends beyond myelin gene expression. It also regulates genes involved in lipid biosynthesis (e.g., Fasn, Srebp1), mitochondrial function (e.g., Pgc1α, Mfn2), and autocrine factors such as neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), all of which support SC polarity, metabolic fitness, and remyelination. In particular, NRG1 engages ErbB receptors in an autocrine feedback loop, reinforcing a pro-regenerative phenotype [ 134 Additional regulatory input is provided by non-canonical Wnt signaling, notably through Wnt5a–DVL1. These pathways are activated in SCs following nerve injury and contribute to cytoskeletal remodeling, polarity, and directed migration [ 125 126 133 GSK3β represents another intracellular node coordinating SC behavior. It is a key target of the PI3K pathway, and its inhibition leads to β-catenin accumulation and transcription of genes promoting SC proliferation and differentiation [ 135 136 132 136 TGF-β1 is another major modulator of SC fate. It regulates gene expression at the transcriptional level, suppressing myelination-associated factors while enhancing non-myelinating and migratory phenotypes through activation of SMAD2/3 and MAPK/NF-κB pathways [ 127 129 131 128 130 On the other hand, PTEN serves as a critical gatekeeper of SC plasticity. By antagonizing PI3K/AKT signaling, PTEN restricts uncontrolled SC proliferation and maintains differentiation balance. Loss of PTEN enhances regenerative responses but may predispose SCs to malignant transformation, as observed in models of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) [ 137 138 In summary, MYRF operates at the convergence of intracellular Ca 2+ Taken together, these findings underscore the notion that SCs, when appropriately stimulated via Ca 2+ 2+ 157 158 2+ 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 2+ 6. Conclusions Recent advances in optogenetics have provided powerful tools to dissect and manipulate glial cell function with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Among these, CapChR2 stands out as a rationally engineered optogenetic actuator that enables sustained, Ca 2+ 2+ 2+ Our findings, supported by electrophysiological analyses and proteomic profiling, demonstrate that light-induced SC activation via CapChR2 can recapitulate key features of physiological Ca 2+ Nonetheless, realizing its full therapeutic potential will require addressing outstanding challenges in gene delivery, light penetration/dosing (phototoxicity and thermal load), and biocompatibility/immune responses in vivo. Integration with novel photonic systems, tissue-specific promoters, and clinically viable gene transfer vectors will be crucial steps toward translational application. In summary, CapChR2-mediated optogenetic control of SCs offers the following: (1) precise modulation of intracellular Ca 2+ 2+ Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization, T.N., M.T. and K.S.-N.; Writing—original draft, T.N.; Writing—review and editing, T.N., M.T. and K.S.-N.; Supervision, T.N. and M.T.; Project administration, T.N.
