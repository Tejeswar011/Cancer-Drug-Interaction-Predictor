Single-cell transcriptomic analyses have revealed a high level of inter- and intra-organ heterogeneity of fibroblasts. However, the functional implications and lineage relations of different fibroblast subtypes remained unexplored, especially in the mammary gland. Here, we provide a comprehensive characterization of pubertal mouse mammary fibroblasts, through single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial mapping, functional assays, and in vivo lineage tracing. We unravel a transient niche-forming population of specialized contractile fibroblasts that exclusively localize around the tips of the growing mammary epithelium and are recruited from preadipocytes in the surrounding fat pad stroma. Using organoid-fibroblast co-cultures we reveal that different fibroblast populations can acquire contractile features when in direct contact with the epithelium, promoting organoid branching. The detailed in vivo characterization of these specialized cells and their lineage history provides insights into fibroblast heterogeneity and implicates their importance for creating a signalling niche during mouse mammary gland development. Fibroblasts represent a heterogenous cell population but how their differences reflect their plasticity and origin is not fully understood. Here, the authors map the origin and fate of a transient contractile fibroblast population that forms a niche supporting pubertal mammary gland branching and growth.

They are endowed with extremely pleiotropic functions: they secrete, remodel, and degrade components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), produce signalling molecules to communicate with other cells, generate other types of mesenchymal/stromal cells and can become contractile and exert mechanical forces in vivo 1 3 1 4 5 Epithelial ductal elongation and branching in the mammary gland occurs mostly postnatally, when a peak of oestrogen during puberty awakens the rudimentary mammary epithelium formed during embryogenesis, and the mammary epithelium actively proliferates and invades the surrounding fat pad stroma to generate a highly branched ductal network 6 7 8 9 The importance of the stroma, in particular of fibroblasts, to support mammary branching morphogenesis is well recognized 2 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Acta2 17 18 19 20 21 22 The transcriptional and functional heterogeneity of mammary fibroblasts during the prominent epithelial remodelling underlying pubertal branching morphogenesis in vivo has not been fully investigated. Although single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets of mammary fibroblasts were generated 23 28 Results Single cell analysis of the growing tips and the ductal regions of the pubertal mammary gland reveals the existence of contractile peri-TEB fibroblasts The pubertal mammary gland contains fibroblasts surrounding the epithelial ducts, the TEBs and dispersed in the fat pad (Fig. 1a–c 29 1b 1d 1 17 neg neg neg neg neg neg 23 30 31 1e Fig. 1 Single cell RNA sequencing of pubertal mammary fibroblasts. a b c Col1a2-CreERT;R26-mTmG d 1 a–d e f 32 g h i j i j Unsupervised clustering of merged fibroblasts identified seven separate clusters (Fig. 1e 32 1f 1f, g 1f 33 1a 1g 1e, f 1b 1g 1h 1c Acta2 1d 17 We then used the transcriptional signatures of each cluster to inform on their relation to other fibroblasts, to identify potential functional differences between them and to position our finding with previously published studies on mammary fibroblasts.

However, lineage tracing of proliferating fibroblasts using Notch1-CreERT2;R26-mTmG Notch1 Peri-TEB fibroblasts trail behind the growing epithelium To specifically assess the fate of peri-TEB fibroblasts we used a genetic labelling approach to lineage trace them and to follow their behaviour in vivo.

Peri-TEB fibroblasts are recruited from preadipocytes The lineage tracing experiments described above indicated that peri-TEB fibroblasts are left behind during ductal growth, raising the question of the origin of new contractile αSMA+ fibroblasts that are delivered to TEBs to maintain an equilibrium within the peri-TEB niche and to support epithelial growth and fat pad invasion. We reasoned that growing TEBs inevitably encounter preadipocytes dispersed within the fat pad on their morphogenetic journey. Moreover, we performed a trajectory analysis of our scRNAseq data and calculated a pseudo-time of differentiation, from interstitial progenitors, the putative fibroblast precursors in the fat pad 32 44 12a, b Fgf10 6a 6b Fgf10-CreERT2;R26-mTmG 45 6c 6d Fgf10-CreERT2 6e Fgf10 6f–h 12c, d Fgf10 Fgf10 Fgf10+ Fgf10-CreERT2;R26-mTmG 6i, j 12e–h Fig. 6 Peri-TEB fibroblasts are recruited from preadipocytes. a Fgf10 1e b Fgf10 Fgf10 Fgf10 neg c Fgf10-CreERT2;R26-mTmG d e d e n t d e f–j Fgf10-CreERT2;R26-mTmG f g h g h f–h n N i j Fgf10-CreERT2;R26-mTmG i neg j n N The recruitment of peri-TEB fibroblasts was further explored using a transplantation experiment, where we engrafted tdTomato+ fragments of mammary glands (consisting of epithelium and surrounding stroma, both labelled by red fluorescence) into cleared fat pads of immunocompromised host mice (Supplementary Fig. 13a 13b 13c, d Furthermore, we revisited the co-culture experiment presented in Fig. 3g 17 1i 13e, f 13e, f Fgf10 Discussion Heterogeneity of mammary fibroblasts Dissection of fibroblast heterogeneity is a blooming topic of research, thanks to single cell analyses that now offer an unprecedented view into the differences between individual fibroblast subtypes presenting conserved or tissue-specific features 4 5 34 26 25 23 28 17 7 32 38 26 Fig. 7 Schematic representation summarizing our findings: peri-TEB fibroblasts are recruited by the growing epithelium from preadipocytes in the fat pad. A schematic representation of our findings. Upper panel: The mammary stroma comprises 5 clusters of fibroblasts with distinct spatial locations: peri-TEB fibroblasts surround the neck of TEBs, periductal fibroblasts envelope the ducts, interstitial progenitors reside in collagenous fat pad septae, AREGs dwell in blood vessel stroma, and preadipocytes are scattered between adipocytes. Lower panel: Our lineage tracing experiments starting from peri-TEB fibroblasts (with Acta2-CreERT2; Fgf10-CreERT2 Our data suggest a strong correlation between spatial organization of stromal cells and different fibroblast subtypes that seems to be conserved in other organs. For example, in the skin, papillary fibroblasts are close to the epidermis, while SCA1+ reticular fibroblasts are embedded deeper in the dermis, close to the subcutaneous fat pad 46 47 48 5 Fibroblast hierarchy Fibroblasts are stromal cells of remarkable plasticity, as revealed by genetic lineage tracing experiments and transplantation assays. In the skin, papillary and reticular fibroblast lineages segregate during embryonic development and never overlap in adult homeostasis 46 Dpp4 32 44 Pi16 Dpp4 4 Pi Dpp4 Based on our lineage tracing experiments with three different mouse lines, we propose that proliferative fibroblasts represent cells transiting between a preadipocyte ( Fgf10 Acta2 Notch1-CreERT2 Acta2 Notch1 We show by ex vivo recombination that both preadipocytes and interstitial progenitors can be activated by contact with the epithelium and acquire a contractile αSMA+ phenotype, although it is not clear whether interstitial progenitors can change directly into peri-TEB fibroblasts in vivo, or if they must transition through a preadipocyte state. Similarly, without further lineage tracing studies, we cannot formally rule out the possibility of other stromal cell types, like pericytes or adipocytes, acting as a source for the peri-TEB fibroblasts, either directly or through other fibroblast subtypes. Thus, our results support the notion that peri-TEB fibroblasts represent a transient cell state forming a specialized niche during branching morphogenesis and provide the missing link between fat pad fibroblasts and periepithelial fibroblasts, demonstrating that they are not separate lineages (Fig. 7 Fibroblasts can also differentiate into pericytes and adipocytes in the skin 49 50 51 44 52 53 Fibroblasts orchestrate epithelial morphogenesis Fibroblasts are believed to be critical regulators of mammary branching morphogenesis 2 10 11 11 8 Fgf10 − 26 27 27 Fgf10 Fgf10 27 Fgf10 FGF2 induces epithelial proliferation and organoid budding in vitro 12 54 ECM expression and organization is another critical regulator of mammary epithelial branching 55 57 35 A new line of evidence suggests that stromal cells may also regulate epithelial morphogenesis through mechanical forces derived from actomyosin cell contraction, as it was shown for the regulation of lung branching 18 58 59 60 61 17 62 7 Fibroblasts activation—signals from the epithelium and beyond The process of fibroblast activation is best studied in wound healing, when fibroblast contractility and ECM production are turned on to aid proper wound closure and healing. Excessive fibroblast activation, however, can result in scarring, fibrosis and provide a cancer-prone microenvironment. Contractile fibroblasts are also found in developing tissues and it is not clear if they are controlled by conserved mechanisms. Interestingly, we found that, while peri-TEB fibroblasts are characterized by a signature of contractility, they express lower levels of collagen 1, suggesting that the activation process is either completely different or only partial, when compared to wound healing. Many of the signalling pathways commonly associated with fibroblast activation were shown to be involved in mammary fibroblasts regulation, like PDGF 63 64 65 67 68 69 70 Methods Ethics statement All procedures involving animals were performed under the approval of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic (license # MSMT-9232/2020-2), supervised by the Expert Committee for Laboratory Animal Welfare of the Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, at the Laboratory Animal Breeding and Experimental Facility of the Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University (facility license #58013/2017-MZE-17214), or under approval of the Animal Facility Committee of the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Czech Academy of Sciences and the Czech Academy of Sciences (licence #AVCR 1066/2024 SOV II) at the Animal Facility Module of the Czech Centre for Phenogenomics (facility license #MZE-59270/2024-13143), or under the approval of the ethics committee of the Institut Curie and the French Ministry of Research (reference #34364-202112151422480) in the Animal Facility of Institut Curie (facility license #C75–05–18).

We then plot the trajectory according to the two first diffusion components. We then used slingshot (v2.6.0) to define pseudotime, specifying the cluster “Interstitial progenitor”s as source and the cluster “peri-TEB” as end point. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) For IHC, only mammary glands #4 were dissected, spread on a glass slide and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (EM grade; Electron Microscopy Sciences) overnight at 4 °C, then they were dehydrated in ethanol solutions with increasing concentration and in xylene and embedded in paraffin. 5 µm sections were cut on rotational microtome (Thermo Scientific, Microm HM340E or Leica RM2255). After rehydration, sections were boiled in pH 6 citrate buffer or pH 9 Tris-EDTA buffer to retrieve antigens, blocked in 1% BSA and 5% FBS and incubated with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 2 Fgf10 In situ hybridization (ISH) For ISH, mammary glands were processed the same way as for IHC and the staining was performed using the RNAScope kit following manufacturer’s instructions, using commercially available probes (Supplementary Table 2 Enpep Ly6a F3 Pi16, Mfap4 Fgf10 Fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS) For FACS or flow cytometry, harvested mammary glands #1, #2, #3, #4 and #5 were chopped into 0.5 × 0.5 × 0.5 mm 3 2 In vitro adipogenesis assay For in vitro assessment of adipogenic potential in 2D, 20,000 FACS-sorted fibroblasts were seeded in one well of an IBIDI 8-well plate.

The cells were overlayed with minimal adipogenic medium (MAM; 10% FBS, 1× ITS (10 μg/ml insulin, 5.5 μg/ml transferrin, 6.7 ng/ml sodium selenite), 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin in DMEM/F12) and incubated overnight. The next day, the medium was replaced by either fresh MAM or by a complete adipogenic medium [CAM; 1 µM dexamethasone, 0.5 µM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthin (IBMX) in MAM]. After 2 days of CAM (or MAM) treatment, the medium was switched back to MAM for all conditions and cells were kept in culture for 8 more days with medium replaced every other day. Then the cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton -100 in PBS for 10 min and stained with DAPI (1 µg/ml), AlexaFluor 568 phalloidin and BioTracker 488 Green Lipid Droplet Dye (Sigma) overnight.
