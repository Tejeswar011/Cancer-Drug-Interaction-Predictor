Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine primarily involved in immune regulation, has recently been identified as a key player in cardiovascular health. However, its role in modulating inflammation and fibrosis after AMI is not fully understood. This study investigates how TSLP mediates anti-inflammatory effects and reduces fibrosis, ultimately improving heart function in a mouse model of AMI. We established a TSLP knockout mouse strain and performed left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery ligation to create an AMI model. This was used to investigate the role of TSLP in eosinophil (EOS) recruitment and fibrosis alleviation. Additionally, EOS depletion, JAK-STAT pathway inhibition, and ferroptosis were employed to analyze potential mediating factors. The extent of cardiac tissue fibrosis was evaluated using histological staining. Inflammatory cytokine levels and EOS were assessed through ELISA and flow cytometry. Western blotting was conducted to detect proteins related to ferroptosis and the JAK-STAT pathway. TSLP deficiency significantly exacerbated myocardial remodeling in AMI mice, while TSLP treatment markedly reduced cardiac fibrosis following AMI, with a notable decrease in collagen deposition within the heart tissue. In Transwell assays, TSLP effectively recruited EOSs, and in vivo experiments demonstrated that TSLP promoted the resolution of acute-phase inflammation (within one week), a process that could be blocked by EOS depletion. TSLP promotes the resolution of post-infarction inflammation and inhibits fibrosis by recruiting EOSs to the heart. This highlights the potential of targeting the TSLP-EOS axis as a therapeutic strategy to improve cardiac function and reduce post-AMI complications.

Under inflammatory conditions, other cells such as macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts can also produce TSLP. As the name suggests, TSLP was initially discovered as a growth factor derived from the supernatant of a mouse thymic stromal cell line, found to promote the survival and proliferation of B lymphocytes. Subsequent studies revealed that TSLP can mediate allergic reactions and is an effective target for treating asthma and atopic dermatitis. TSLP not only acts on B lymphocytes but also regulates the functions of dendritic cells and T cells [ 18 22 25 26 27 This study aims to investigate the function and potential mechanisms of TSLP in regulating EOS migration during myocardial remodeling after AMI, providing new insights for immunoregulatory therapy post-AMI. Materials and methods Clinical sample collection Clinical imaging data and blood samples were collected from patients at The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. The storage, analysis, and disposal of these samples were conducted in compliance with the guidelines approved by the Ethics committee of The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. Animal and AMI modeling Eight-week-old wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice and TSLP knockout (KO) mice (Strain ID T027399, GemPharmatech) were used. AMI was induced via permanent ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery under 1.5% isoflurane anesthesia. Coronary angiography was performed to confirm occlusion. For histological and immunofluorescence analysis, hearts were excised, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 5-μm thickness. For Western blot analysis, heart tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Echocardiographic assessments were performed before and 1 week after AMI induction using a Vevo 2100 system (VisualSonics, Canada) with a 30-MHz probe. M-mode images were analyzed using VevoLab software. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Zhengzhou University. Tissue collection and histological staining Seven days post-AMI, mice were euthanized, and hearts were excised. 1-mm transverse sections of the left ventricle were incubated in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) solution at 37 °C for 20 min, followed by fixation in 10% formalin. Infarcted areas (white) and non-infarcted myocardium (red) were quantified using ImageJ software. Paraffin-embedded sections were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining for morphological assessment, Sirius Red staining for collagen quantification, and Masson’s trichrome staining for fibrosis analysis. Fibrotic areas were quantified using ImageJ as the percentage of collagen-stained regions relative to total myocardial area. Images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse E200 microscope (Nikon, Japan). Western blot analysis and antibodies Myocardial tissue lysates were prepared, and equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies specific to the target proteins, followed by washing and incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Protein bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and quantified using ImageJ software (NIH, USA). The primary antibodies used included TSLP (500-P258-1MG), TSLPR (14-5499-82), p-JAK1 (44-422G), JAK1 (MA5-42649) from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, USA), and STAT5 (13179-1-AP), ECP (55338–1-AP), E-selectin (20894–1-AP), GAPDH (10494-1-AP), ACSL4 (22401–1-AP), and GPX4 (30388-1-AP) from Proteintech (Wuhan, China). EOS recruitment and migration assays EOS were isolated from murine umbilical cord blood using Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 ng/mL IL-5, 10 mM HEPES, and 1% Penicillin–Streptomycin. For migration assays, EOS (1 × 10⁶ cells) were placed in the upper chamber of a Transwell insert (8-μm pore, Corning), and primary cardiomyocytes cultured in the lower chamber were treated with purified TSLP at 0, 10, 50, or 100 ng/mL. After 8 h, migrated EOS were quantified using flow cytometry (BD FACSCanto II). Mitochondrial activity AC16 cardiomyocytes were treated with TNFα (10 ng/mL) for 24 h and stained with 100 nM MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Invitrogen) for 30 min. Fluorescence intensity was detected using a Leica DMi8 fluorescence microscope (excitation/emission: 579/599 nm). Ferroptosis assessment Ferroptosis-related markers were quantified using commercial assay kits (Beyotime). GSH was measured by a microplate reader at 412 nm, MDA by the thiobarbituric acid reaction method at 532 nm, and Fe 2 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Serum levels of cardiac injury markers, including cTnI, cTnT, CK-MB, and LDH, were measured using ELISA kits (Abcam) following the manufacturer's instructions. Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, TNFα, as well as ICAM-1, MMP-9, and C5a, were also quantified using ELISA kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All samples were measured in triplicate, and absorbance was read at 450 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). EOS depletion, TSLP rescue, and pharmacological inhibition experiments To deplete EOS, WT mice were intraperitoneally injected with 100 μl of anti-Siglec-F antibody daily, starting one day prior to AMI and continuing for three days post-surgery. The TSLP rescue group received a single administration of TSLP (25 μg) on the day of AMI induction. In parallel, TSLP-KO mice underwent AMI induction and were treated with the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1, 10 mg/kg, diluted in 0.01% DMSO saline, administered 1 h before surgery) or the JAK inhibitor baricitinib (1.0 mg/kg daily post-surgery). All mice were euthanized on day 7 post-AMI for histological and molecular analyses. Statistical analysis Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) from at least three independent experiments (n ≥ 3). Normality was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. One-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test was performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 (GraphPad Software). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results TSLP elevation in response to myocardial infarction Coronary angiography of patients with AMI revealed marked stenosis or complete occlusion of both the left and right coronary arteries (Fig. 1 GSE61144 1 1 Fig. 1 Increased TSLP Levels in the Blood of Patients and Rodents Following AMI. A B GSE61144 C D E F G H I J P P P We established a mouse AMI model by ligating the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and collected cardiac tissues at 24-h intervals to measure TSLP levels. The results demonstrated that TSLP underwent a sharp increase following AMI, followed by a gradual decrease over a two-week period (Fig. 1 1 To further investigate the function of TSLP in AMI, we designed four distinct TSLP-knockout strategies (Fig. 1 1 1 Echocardiographic assessments conducted before and after AMI induction in the same subjects exhibited classical features of AMI and subsequent heart failure. These features included reduced ventricular wall thickness, dilated interventricular septum, and decreased heart rate, as demonstrated by M-mode ultrasound imaging (Fig. 1 1 In summary, the data indicate a potential interaction between increased TSLP protein expression and the occurrence of AMI, as well as subsequent ventricular remodeling. Furthermore, the successful establishment of the TSLP-KO mouse model provides a robust system for studying the mechanistic roles of TSLP in AMI and its aftermath. TSLP deficiency exacerbates myocardial remodeling post-AMI Histological evaluation of myocardial tissue from WT and TSLP-KO mice following AMI revealed distinct pathological changes. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining showed that sham-operated mice exhibited intact cardiac architecture with orderly arranged cardiomyocytes. In contrast, AMI-induced WT mice displayed disrupted myocardial structure, characterized by disorganized cardiomyocyte alignment and prominent inflammatory cell infiltration with multinucleated cells. Notably, TSLP-KO mice exhibited more pronounced myocardial injury, including expanses of necrotic tissue stained brick-red and devoid of intact cellular structures (Fig. 2 2 2 Fig. 2 TSLP deficiency exacerbates AMI-induced fibrosis and damage. One week after AMI modeling, mice were euthanized, and heart sections and tissue samples were collected for staining, ELISA, and Western blot analysis. A B C D E F GSE109048 G H P P P Extracellular proteins intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and complement component C5a play critical roles in post-AMI physiological processes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) quantification revealed that levels of ICAM-1, MMP-9, and C5a were significantly elevated in both WT and TSLP-KO mice following AMI. Moreover, the increases in these inflammatory markers were more pronounced in TSLP-KO mice compared to WT controls (Fig. 2 2 KEGG pathway enrichment analysis based on the GSE109048 2 2 Western blot analysis was conducted to evaluate the expression of TSLP-TSLPR, components of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, ECP as an EOS marker, and E-selectin, which mediates leukocyte adhesion and recruitment to inflammatory sites (Fig. 2 These findings imply that TSLP deficiency disrupts normal leukocyte recruitment dynamics following AMI, contributing to impaired tissue repair and increased fibrosis. The association between reduced ECP levels and the mild fibrotic phenotype observed in TSLP-KO mice prior to AMI, as well as enhanced fibrosis and decreased tissue elasticity post-AMI, warrants further investigation. TSLP-mediated EOS recruitment and cardiomyocyte protection To further elucidate the immune cell landscape in myocardial tissues following AMI, we extracted RNA from the hearts of WT and TSLP-KO mice after surgery and constructed cDNA libraries for quantitative PCR (qPCR). We examined an array of immune cell markers, including those for dendritic cells (CD11c, HLA-DR), T cells (CD3, CD4, CD8), B cells (CD19), neutrophils (Ly6G), mast cells (CD117, FcεRI), EOS (Siglec-F, MBP), and innate lymphoid cells (CD127, Eomes, RORγt). Notably, Siglec-F and MBP mRNA levels were markedly reduced in TSLP-KO mice compared with WT controls, indicating a significant decrease in EOS recruitment to the heart in the absence of TSLP (Fig. 3 Fig. 3 TSLP recruits EOS and mitigates cardiomyocyte injury via ferroptosis suppression. A C A B C D I D E F G I 2 P P P To investigate the role of TSLP in EOS recruitment and cardioprotection, murine umbilical cord blood-derived hematopoietic stem cells were differentiated into eosinophils. A Transwell assay was employed, with EOS seeded in the upper chamber and cardiomyocytes co-cultured with gradient concentrations of purified TSLP protein in the lower chamber. After 8 h of incubation, flow cytometry analysis revealed that in the absence of TSLP, EOS migration toward the lower chamber was minimal. TSLP induced EOS migration in a dose-dependent manner, although its chemotactic effect plateaued at higher concentrations, suggesting a non-linear recruitment response (Fig. 3 3 Subsequently, we employed human EOL1 eosinophilic cells and AC16 myocardial cells to further elucidate the protective mechanisms of TSLP. We treated myocardial cells with TNFα to simulate the pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic microenvironment characteristic of AMI. Concurrently, EOL1 cells were treated with TSLP, and the resulting conditioned medium was applied to AC16 cells. Hoechst staining, CFDA staining, and propidium iodide (PI) staining demonstrated that TNFα significantly increased myocardial cell death. In contrast, conditioned medium from TSLP-treated EOL1 cells markedly reduced TNFα-induced apoptosis in AC16 cells (Fig. 3 To assess oxidative stress, we utilized the BODIPY 581/591 C11 probe, which emits red fluorescence in its non-oxidized state and green fluorescence upon oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Fluorescence microscopy revealed a substantial increase in green fluorescence intensity in TNFα-treated myocardial cells, indicating elevated ROS levels. Treatment with conditioned medium from TSLP-activated EOL1 cells significantly attenuated ROS accumulation in AC16 cells (Fig. 3 3 Autophagy was evaluated using Acridine Orange staining, which fluoresces green under neutral pH and red within acidic autolysosomes. TNFα treatment led to an upregulation of autophagy in myocardial cells, as evidenced by an increase in red-fluorescent cells. Conversely, conditioned medium from TSLP-treated EOL1 cells reduced the number of autophagy-positive AC16 cells (Fig. 3 Analysis of key ferroptosis-related proteins and biochemical indicators revealed that treatment with TNFα markedly increased ACSL4 expression and malondialdehyde (MDA) production, while significantly decreasing the expression of GPX4 and the intracellular level of its cofactor glutathione (GSH). Intracellular iron levels were also elevated in response to TNFα stimulation, indicating enhanced lipid peroxidation and iron overload. In contrast, supernatants derived from TSLP-stimulated EOS suppressed ACSL4 expression and MDA accumulation, restored GPX4 expression, and replenished GSH levels, thereby mitigating iron dyshomeostasis and ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3 Collectively, these findings indicate that TSLP facilitates the recruitment and activation of eosinophils, which in turn confer protective effects on myocardial cells. Specifically, eosinophil-mediated mechanisms mitigate TNFα-induced increases in intracellular ROS levels and prevent excessive autophagy, thereby safeguarding myocardial cells from the AMI-like inflammatory environment. TSLP attenuates ferroptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyocytes via inhibition of the JAK1–STAT5 pathway To investigate the regulatory role of TSLP in cardiomyocyte ferroptosis and mitochondrial injury, we first analyzed a single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset from AMI patients ( GSE214611 4 4 Fig. 4 TSLP–JAK1–STAT5 signaling regulates mitochondrial function and ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes. A GSE214611 B C D E F G H I P P To further validate the role of this pathway, a rescue experiment was conducted wherein cardiomyocytes were treated with TNFα and then incubated with TSLP-activated EOS supernatants in the presence or absence of a JAK1 inhibitor (JAKi) (Fig. 4 4 To assess mitochondrial function, MitoTracker Red staining was used to visualize active mitochondria. Quantification of fluorescence intensity, normalized to control levels, revealed that TNFα significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and activity, consistent with ferroptosis progression. TSLP treatment and JAK1–STAT5 inhibition restored mitochondrial activity to near-baseline levels (Fig. 4 4 4 i 4 In summary, these results demonstrate that TSLP protects cardiomyocytes from TNFα-induced ferroptosis by inhibiting the JAK1–STAT5 signaling pathway. This inhibition preserves mitochondrial structure and function, alleviates oxidative stress, and restores redox homeostasis. Activation of the JAK1-STAT5 pathway inhibits SLC7A11 and promotes ferroptosis in cardiomyocytes To investigate the potential causal relationship between JAK1-STAT5 pathway activation and ferroptosis in TNFα-treated AC16 cardiomyocytes, we pharmacologically modulated both ferroptosis and the JAK1-STAT5 pathway. Initially, AC16 cells were treated with the ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) and the ferroptosis inducer Erastin. Western blot analysis revealed that, under Fer-1 treatment, ACSL4 expression was downregulated, while GPX4 was upregulated, indicating enhanced antioxidant defense and reduced lipid peroxidation. Conversely, Erastin treatment resulted in an upregulation of ACSL4 and a downregulation of GPX4, suggesting increased ferroptosis activation. However, no significant changes in the phosphorylation levels of either JAK1 or STAT5 were observed when compared to the control group (Fig. 5 Fig. 5 JAK1-STAT5 Pathway Modulates SLC7A11 Expression. A B C 2 D E SLC7A11 P P P Subsequently, we inhibited the JAK1-STAT5 pathway using Filgotinib, a JAK1 inhibitor (JAKi). Western blot results demonstrated a significant reduction in the phosphorylation levels of JAK1 and STAT5, without affecting their total protein levels. In contrast to the previous findings, JAK1-STAT5 pathway inhibition led to a marked decrease in ACSL4 expression, accompanied by significant increases in GPX4 and SLC7A11 levels, suggesting suppression of ferroptosis (Fig. 5 2 5 Considering that SLC7A11 showed the most significant alteration in response to JAK1-STAT5 pathway inhibition, and prior study have indicated that STAT5 suppresses SLC7A11 28 SLC7A11 5 SLC7A11 To further validate this interaction, we inserted the SLC7A11 SLC7A11 5 SLC7A11 Upregulation of STAT5 expression or phosphorylation enhances its binding to the SLC7A11 TSLP reduces AMI-induced myocardial remodeling via inhibition of JAK-STAT-mediated ferroptosis Following our cell-based investigations into the protective effects of TSLP against AMI-induced injury, we validated these findings at the animal level. Specifically, we induced AMI in WT mice and manipulated EOS levels via a Siglec-F antibody (to deplete eosinophils) and/or applied TSLP treatment. Sirius Red staining revealed that, consistent with our prior observations, cardiac tissue in the control group (AMI without intervention) was prone to fragmentation during section preparation (Fig. 6 6 6 Fig. 6 TSLP reduces AMI-induced fibrosis and elastic changes by inhibiting JAK-STAT-mediated ferroptosis. A D A B C D E G E F G P P P Immunostaining of ferroptosis-related proteins and JAK-STAT pathway components revealed that TSLP administration reduced both ferroptosis and JAK1 phosphorylation–driven pathway activation, in contrast to the effects of EOS depletion (Fig. 6 To directly assess the relationship between TSLP and JAK-STAT-related ferroptosis in AMI, we employed TSLP-KO mice, which were treated with the JAKi and/or the Fer-1 following AMI induction. Sirius Red, H&E, and Masson’s trichrome staining demonstrated that inhibiting either ferroptosis or JAK-STAT signaling mitigated post-AMI cardiac remodeling, and the combined therapeutic approach produced an additive protective effect (Fig. 6 Collectively, our findings indicate that TSLP plays a pivotal role in modulating eosinophil-driven cardioprotection following AMI and highlight ferroptosis and the JAK-STAT pathway as key processes in post-infarction myocardial damage and remodeling. Moreover, the synergistic effects of inhibiting both ferroptosis and JAK-STAT in TSLP-KO mice underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting these pathways to improve cardiac outcomes after AMI. Clinical improvement of AMI-related indicators with TSLP and inhibition of JAK-STAT and Ferroptosis pathways To assess the translational relevance of our histological and cellular findings, we analyzed blood samples from mice subjected to AMI under various treatment conditions. Specifically, we evaluated clinical biomarkers of myocardial injury, inflammatory mediators, and pro-inflammatory cytokines to determine the impact of TSLP treatment, JAK-STAT pathway inhibition, and ferroptosis inhibition on AMI recovery. Serum levels of cTnI, cTnT, CK-MB, and LDH were significantly elevated in mice with EOS depletion following AMI, indicating increased myocardial injury (Fig. 7 Fig. 7 TSLP Treatment and Inhibition of JAK1 and Ferroptosis Pathways Improve Myocardial Injury and Inflammation Resolution Post-AMI. A C A B C D E F P P P Levels of ICAM-1, MMP-9, and C5a were significantly increased in the context of EOS depletion post-AMI (Fig. 7 E Pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1β, and TNFα were significantly elevated in eosinophil-depleted mice following AMI (Fig. 7 F Collectively, the data indicate that TSLP treatment, along with the inhibition of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and ferroptosis, synergistically enhances the clinical recovery of myocardial function post-AMI. These interventions not only reduce myocardial cell loss but also prevent excessive fibrosis and ventricular hypertrophy resulting from prolonged inflammatory infiltration and impaired myocardial compensation mechanisms. Our findings suggest that a combinatorial therapeutic approach targeting TSLP-mediated EOS recruitment and associated inflammatory and cell death pathways may offer significant clinical benefits in accelerating the resolution of inflammation and improving cardiac outcomes following AMI. Discussion In this study, we investigated the role of TSLP, a key immunoregulatory cytokine in AMI [ 25 29 22 AMI triggers a robust immune response characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages into the damaged myocardium. Recent studies have highlighted the involvement of EOS in post-AMI repair and remodeling [ 21 30 31 Furthermore, our study reveals that TSLP acts as an upstream regulator of EOS activity, playing a crucial role in AMI. The differential effects of EOS in different stages of AMI, as well as the complexity of the myocardial microenvironment, may account for these findings. EOS are known to release the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 [ 32 33 34 36 37 39 40 Previous literature indicates that TSLPR is a cytokine receptor associated with the JAK-STAT signaling pathway [ 29 41 23 42 43 44 45 The significance of our study lies in two key aspects. First, we demonstrate that TSLP has therapeutic potential following AMI, as it reduces inflammation and fibrosis by modulating the protective function of EOS, thereby preserving cardiac function. Second, we uncover the critical role of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway in ferroptosis during AMI, suggesting that targeting this pathway could prevent ferroptosis and improve AMI prognosis. Future studies should further explore the molecular signaling pathways between TSLP, EOS, and cardiomyocytes. Moreover, investigating TSLP's role in human AMI cases is essential to determine whether similar protective effects exist. Finally, exploring the potential of combining TSLP with ferroptosis inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy may offer more effective treatment options for AMI. In conclusion, our research demonstrates that TSLP mediates cardioprotection by regulating EOS, inhibiting ferroptosis, and improving post-AMI cardiac remodeling. These findings provide new insights into the immune regulatory mechanisms following AMI and offer a novel therapeutic target for improving patient outcomes.
