Primary outcomes included taxonomic abundance changes, diversity measures, and effect sizes with rigorous FDR correction for multiple comparisons. Patient population This prospective longitudinal and observational study was conducted at MacKay Memorial Hospital (MMH), Taipei, Taiwan, with institutional review board approval (IRB No. 19MMHIS061e). Participants were recruited through convenience sampling, comprising adults (≥20 years) with histologically confirmed stage I–IV breast cancer via core biopsy. All participants provided written informed consent, while patients with recurrent breast cancer were excluded. Treatment protocols for HR+ breast cancer patients were stratified by menopausal status, with premenopausal women receiving selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, primarily Tamoxifen) and postmenopausal women prescribed AIs and Tamoxifen. In high-risk premenopausal cases or patients desiring future fertility, treatment was augmented with ovarian suppression using luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists. Hormone treatment (HT) duration generally ranges from 5 to 10 years. Fecal samples were collected at baseline (first admission) for all participants, with HR+ patients providing additional samples at three- and six-months post-initiation of HT to assess temporal changes in gut microbiota composition. Fecal samples collection and DNA extraction of microbiota Fecal samples were collected upon breast cancer confirmation by core biopsy and stored at −20 °C until analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions with modifications. Briefly, 0.2 g of fecal sample was homogenized with 1 mL InhibitEX buffer and glass beads using a Precellys homogenizer (Bertin Instruments, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France) at 4500 beats/min for 2 min. The suspension was heated at 70 °C for 10 min and centrifuged for 1 min to pellet stool particles. The supernatant (600 µL) was transferred to a new 2 mL tube containing 25 µL proteinase K, followed by the addition of 600 µL AL buffer. After incubation at 70 °C for 10 min, 600 µL of 100% ethanol was added and mixed thoroughly. The mixture was filtered through a QIAamp spin column at 13,000 rpm for 1 min, followed by sequential washing with AW1 and AW2 buffers. DNA was eluted in 100 µL ATE buffer, and its concentration and quality were assessed using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA). 16S rRNA library construction and sequencing The V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified for microbial phylogenetic classification. The first PCR amplification was performed in 25 µL reactions containing 50 ng (2.5 µL) of template DNA, 0.2 µM each of V3-V4 forward primer (5’-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3’) and reverse primer (5’-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3’), and 12.5 µL 2X Kapa HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KapaBiosystems). PCR conditions were initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min; 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s; followed by final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Amplified products were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP Reagent beads (Beckman Coulter Inc., CA, USA). Index PCR was performed in 50 µL reactions containing 5 µL of purified amplicon, 25 µL 2X Kapa HiFi HotStart ReadyMix, and 5 µL each of Nextera XT Index 1 and 2 primers (Illumina, CA, USA). Cycling conditions were: 95 °C for 3 min; 8 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; with final extension at 72 °C for 5 min using an Applied Biosystems 2720 thermocycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, CA, USA). The indexed amplicons were purified using AMPure XP beads. Libraries were quantified using KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix on a Roche LightCycler 480 system, normalized to 4 nM, and pooled for sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform with 2 × 300 bp paired-end chemistry, generating >80,000 reads per sample. Sequence data were processed using QIIME2 software package (version 2017.10). Chimeric sequences were removed using DADA2, and reads were trimmed by 30 and 90 bases at the 3’ end of forward and reverse reads, respectively. Taxonomic classification was performed using a Naïve Bayes classifier trained on the Greengenes13.8 database with a 99% OTU threshold. The resulting taxonomic assignments were classified at seven levels (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species) using the NCBI database. Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 26.0 software. Data is presented as means ± standard deviation (SD). Comparisons between two groups were conducted using Student’s t-test, while multiple group comparisons employed one-way or two-way ANOVA as appropriate. Statistical significance was set at p Microbial community analyses were performed using MicrobiomeAnalyst. Bacterial compositions were analyzed at Family, Genus, and Species levels. Alpha diversity was assessed using the Shannon index calculated through QIIME software package (version 2017.10). Beta diversity between samples was evaluated using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index and visualized through Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA). The statistical significance of beta diversity differences was determined using Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA), with reported F-values, r-squared values, and p-values. For taxonomic analysis, bacterial taxa absent in ≥5% of participants were excluded. For genera with median relative abundance >1%, multiple regression analysis was performed to examine associations with bacterial composition, adjusting for potential confounders. Non-normally distributed data, identified through skewness and kurtosis calculations, were normalized using Box-Cox transformation. Statistical significance for each genus and species was assessed using t-tests. Taxonomic compositions were visualized using stacked plots showing percentage abundance (PA) of different genera and species, with separate graphs highlighting the top 20 most abundant taxa. Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) was employed to identify differentially abundant features between sample groups. Features were considered significant when meeting both criteria: p All analyses in this study employed rigorous False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to control for multiple comparisons. Given the exploratory nature of microbiome research and the inherent challenge of multiple testing in taxonomic analyses, we applied conservative statistical thresholds (FDR p Supplementary information  Supplementary information Publisher’s note Supplementary information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41523-025-00810-2.
