Metallodrugs have had a significant impact on the treatment of NENs, as platinum-based chemotherapy is the first-line therapy approved for managing these types of tumors. Currently, medicinal inorganic chemistry is investigating new metal-based drugs to mitigate the side effects of existing agents, including cisplatin and its derivative compounds. Among the emerging alternatives to platinum-based drugs, ruthenium-based complexes garnered attention as potential chemotherapeutics due to their notable antineoplastic and antimetastatic activity. This review focuses on the promising antitumor effects of certain Ru compounds in NEN therapy, emphasizing their potential in NEN treatment through interaction with new potential targets. Among these, IT-139 (also known as KP-1339 or NKP-1339), which has already entered clinical trials, and other new Ru compounds are highlighted. metallodrugs neuroendocrine neoplasms ruthenium-based complexes platinum-based chemotherapy medicinal inorganic chemistry IT-139 (KP-1339 or NKP1339) This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Metal-based drugs and imaging agents are widely used in clinical settings for the treatment and diagnosis of cancers and a variety of other diseases [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 4 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 In addition to platinum-containing complexes, researchers have also explored other metals in the transition series (e.g., Ru(III), Ir(III), Pd(II), Au(I), Ti(IV), Cu(II), and Fe(II)), resulting in different mechanisms of action and antiproliferative properties [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 This review aims to discuss the role of metallodrugs in NENs therapy, providing an update of currently approved metal-based drugs and promising drug candidates in pre-clinical and clinical studies. Specifically, we focus on Ru(II)- and Ru(III)-based complexes, which were intensively studied in recent decades and represent a viable alternative to cisplatin for the treatment of these types of tumors due to their therapeutic potential [ 21 22 23 2. Neuroendocrine Neoplasms: Classification and Treatment Options Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies that are considered rare due to their low incidence, constituting approximately ~2% of all malignancies [ 20 24 25 26 NENs can originate from any organ, but most commonly arise from the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) and bronchopulmonary tracts [ 27 28 27 20 29 30 30 Among the therapeutic options, surgery is the primary choice for resectable NENs. In cases of inoperable, unresectable, or metastatic disease, systemic treatments include radiotherapy, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) ( 177 Figure 1 20 29 31 Metallodrugs have had a decisive role in the treatment of NENs, as platinum-based chemotherapy and PRRT are approved for the management of these types of tumors [ 20 32 3. Metal-Based Drugs for NENs Treatment Metal-based drugs, particularly platinum complexes such as cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin, play a pivotal role in cancer treatment protocols ( Figure 2 33 34 35 36 31 33 37 31 38 39 40 41 In the design of new metal-based anticancer agents, the gold-based complex, Auranofin, has garnered increasing attention as a potential alternative to traditional cisplatin [ 42 43 NCT01737502 44 Among the most studied metal-based drugs, ruthenium complexes represent a class of potential chemotherapeutics due to their remarkable antineoplastic and antimetastatic activity [ 45 trans trans trans Figure 3 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 Figure 3 53 54 55 56 54 Figure 3 NCT01415297 NCT04421820 23 57 In addition to the most extensively studied platinum, ruthenium, and gold complexes, other new metal-based compounds are currently being investigated in vitro and in vivo for their anticancer activity. Pellei and colleagues evaluated the antitumor properties of newly synthesized metal complexes (Mn(II), Fe(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II)) against a series of human cancer cell lines derived from various solid tumors, including SCLC [ 58 58 59 4. Ruthenium(II/III) Complexes Interest in ruthenium(II/III) complexes has grown significantly due to the successes of platinum therapies and the chemical similarities among platinum group metals (Pt, Pd, Rh, Ir, Ru, and Os) [ 60 21 22 61 62 63 64 54 The anticancer activity of ruthenium compounds was first demonstrated in 1976 when fac 3 3 3 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 Ruthenium, with its variable oxidation state ranging from +2 to +8, serves as a unique catalyst in oxidative reactions. Ruthenium compounds primarily exist in three oxidation states. The high oxidation state of Ru(IV) compounds is unstable, limiting their further development [ 22 74 75 76 75 76 77 78 79 68 80 22 Among the Ru(III)-based drugs that have progressed to clinical studies, NAMI-A ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 In addition to Ru(III), several Ru(II)-arene complexes, such as RM-175 and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane (PTA)-containing complexes (RAPTA-C and RAPTA-T) ( Figure 4 34 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 1 2 89 22 Presently, the progression of ruthenium antitumor agents is transitioning from singular treatment modalities to combination therapies [ 22 54 90 91 54 4.1. Mechanisms of Action Ruthenium complexes are administered through intravenous injections. In the blood, these drugs, like other metallotherapeutics, can be transported by albumin and transferrin [ 54 92 54 54 93 94 54 95 96 94 52 97 98 99 100 101 52 97 98 102 Generally, during endocytosis, external molecules are internalized by the cellular membrane to form endosomes, which can reach lysosomes [ 54 54 102 Figure 5 60 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 107 105 111 112 54 112 113 114 Figure 5 4.2. The Case of IT-139 The Ru(III) complex IT-139 (KP-1339 or NKP-1339) ( Figure 3 NCT01415297 23 57 60 23 Figure 5 2 49 51 52 60 115 116 117 60 117 118 94 117 The primary antitumor effects of IT-139 are attributed to suppression of the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), also known as the immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein (BiP). GRP78 is a key regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR), promoting protein folding and assembly, controlling protein quality, and regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-signaling pathways that lead to UPR survival and apoptosis responses. Upon ER stress, when misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, GRP78 binds to these proteins, releasing and activating three ER transmembrane signal transducers: protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). This leads to the induction of UPR [ 119 120 121 121 GRP78 can be overexpressed in cancer, functioning as a central stress sensor that detects and adapts to changes in the tumor microenvironment. Stress conditions such as hypoxia, glucose deficiency, and lactic acidosis can induce cell surface GRP78 expression in cancer cells. This activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) signal, enabling tumor cells to adapt to the microenvironment of the metastatic site and acquire the ability to survive and establish at the metastatic site [ 121 122 123 124 125 126 IT-139 is able to suppress GRP78 expression in a wide range of cancer cells via multiple mechanisms, with minimal effect on GRP78 stress induction in normal human cell lines and primary cells [ 23 118 123 Moreover, IT-139 alters intracellular calcium ion (Ca 2+ 127 128 129 Interestingly, IT-139 represents the first recognized ruthenium-based complex that is likely able to trigger immunogenic cancer cell death (ICD) in vitro ( Figure 5 124 129 130 131 132 124 124 133 117 124 129 134 135 Figure 5 4.3. New Ruthenium-Based Drug in Pre-Clinical Studies The field of Ru-based agents has yielded some very promising anticancer agents with exceptional in vivo and in vitro activity [ 114 136 49 137 23 46 138 139 140 141 Table 1 Leskovac et al. (2018) investigated the anticancer properties of three Ru(II)-N-alkyl complexes, each with a different phenothiazine (chlorpromazine hydrochloride, thioridazine hydrochloride, or trifluoperazine dihydrochloride) as counterion [ 139 143 144 139 145 139 145 139 146 146 Table 1 Figure 6 139 To the best of our knowledge, the study by Leskovac et al. is the only one that has considered the in vitro role of dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) in NE cancer cells following treatment with a Ru compound. Given that phenothiazines can affect D2R, Leskovac and colleagues evaluated the influence of the Ru complexes on D2R distribution in the plasma membrane of rat neuroendocrine PC-12 cells ( Table 1 2 3 3 2 5 139 Table 1 Figure 6 Recently, Khan and colleagues investigated the antiproliferative effect of a family of Ru(II) complexes with a half-sandwich structure and a new bis-quinoline-based ligand. These complexes were highly active against PC-3 [ 46 142 147 142 Table 1 6 p 6 46 Table 1 Figure 6 Differently from Leskovac [ 139 46 142 3 3 148 Table 1 Figure 6 Figure 6 149 150 151 152 153 Finally, D’Amora (2019) studied the chemical and biological behavior of two NAMI-A-class sugar-incorporated Ru(III) complexes, (Na[ trans 4 trans 4 Table 1 141 5. Ru Complexes Targets and NENs: New Possible Therapeutic Strategies Over the past few decades, the role of specific biomarkers that can predict the response of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) to platinum-based drugs has been extensively studied [ 20 Table 2 60 154 IT-139, as well as other Ru complexes, act by inhibiting GRP78 [ 117 148 123 121 125 155 156 157 Figure 5 121 125 155 156 157 molecules-30-03828-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Molecular and structural formulas of the mentioned ruthenium(II) and ruthenium(III) complexes in the clinical and pre-clinical phase and their general mechanism of action.

Conclusions and Perspectives Over the past few decades, various anticancer metallodrugs have emerged as agents for controlling compound reactivity and stability in physiological environments. Among the most studied metal-based complexes, ruthenium complexes represent the most promising alternatives to platinum-based anticancer agents due to their multifunctional biochemical properties. Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) represent a small group of malignancies with diverse prognosis, biology, and behavior. Probably, the relative rarity of this type of malignancies results in a lack of studies in the literature aimed at studying metallodrugs and, in general, chemotherapy agents in NENs. Currently, some ruthenium complexes are undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of solid tumors, including neuroendocrine neoplasms ( Table 2 Table 2 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization, E.S., F.D.C., M.B. and F.P.F.; validation, M.B. and F.P.F.; investigation, E.S., F.D.C. and A.A.; writing—original draft preparation, E.S. and A.A.; writing—review and editing, E.S., F.D.C., A.A., M.B. and F.P.F.; supervision, M.B.

Figure 5 Proposed mechanism of action of Ru(III) complex IT-139 (NKP-1339 or KP-1339). Ru complexes can enter cells by simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, active transport, or transferrin (Tf)-mediated uptake. Their antitumoral action appears to be related not only to DNA damage and ROS induction but primarily to the disruption of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis by depletion of key cellular chaperons, including GRP78, in combination with enhanced IT-139-mediated protein damage. Induction of cell death could occur through the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP signaling pathway, calpain, and caspase activation. Moreover, IT-139 treatment could lead to upregulation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) stress response pathway and accumulation of HMGB-1 in the cytoplasm and extracellular space. All these effects ultimately lead to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, autophagy activation, and ICD. Figure 6 Structures of novel experimental Ru compounds.
