This proposal has been widely applied to conceptualize behavioral addictions, including problematic social media use (PSMU). However, certain criteria can be defined as “core” (e.g., mood modification, relapse, withdrawal, conflict), reflecting problematic involvement, while others as “peripheral” (e.g., salience, tolerance), reflecting non-problematic involvement. We evaluated whether a two-factor model distinguishing between core and peripheral criteria provides a better fit than the unifactorial model in PSMU. Additionally, we examined whether core and peripheral criteria exhibit different patterns of association with psychological measures. Methods A total of 2,761 adolescents ( M SD Results A two-factor model that distinguished core (i.e., mood modification, relapse, withdrawal, conflict) and peripheral (i.e., salience, tolerance) criteria provided a better fit than the unifactorial model for both scales. Core criteria were positively associated with depression, anxiety, and loneliness, and negatively associated with life satisfaction and self-esteem. Opposite patterns were observed for peripheral criteria: they were negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and loneliness, and positively associated with life satisfaction and self-esteem. Discussion and Conclusions Our findings suggest that the components model of addiction may not be valid for assessing PSMU, promoting overdiagnosis and pathologization.

Components definition and items examples of main problematic social media use scales Component Definition of each component ( Griffiths, 2005 Example items from the SMD ( Boer, van den Eijnden, et al., 2022 Van Den Eijnden et al., 2016 Example items from the BSMAS ( Andreassen, Torsheim, Brunborg, & Pallesen, 2012 Andreassen et al., 2016 Type of component ( Billieux et al., 2019 Charlton & Danforth, 2007 DSM-5 Analogue “internet gaming disorder” ICD-11 Analogue “gaming disorder” Salience The behavior is the most important activity, dominating cognition, emotions, and behavior. During the past year, have you regularly found that you cannot think of anything else but the moment that you will be able to use social media again? How often during the last year have you spent a lot of time thinking about social media or planning how to use it? Peripheral component Criterion 1: Preoccupation No direct analogue Tolerance The need to increase the amount of the behavior to achieve the effects previously obtained. During the past year, have you regularly felt dissatisfied because you wanted to spend more time on social media? How often during the last year have you felt an urge to use social media more and more? Peripheral component Criterion 3: Tolerance No direct analogue Mood modification The modification of subjective experience as a consequence of performing the behavior (e.g., arousing, tranquilizing, or allowing escape). Includes the euphoria experienced when performing or anticipating the behavior. During the past year, have you often used social media to escape from negative feelings? How often during the last year have you used social media in order to forget about personal problems? Core/Peripheral component Criterion 8: Use to relieve negative mood No direct analogue Relapse The tendency to revert to earlier patterns of the behavior, with even the most extreme patterns quickly re-emerging after periods of abstinence or control. During the past year, have you tried to spend less time on social media, but failed? How often during the last year have you tried to cut down on the use of social media without success? Core component Criterion 4: Unsuccessful attempts to control or decrease use Impaired control over gaming Withdrawal Unpleasant physical or emotional states occurring when the behavior is stopped or reduced. During the past year, have you often felt bad when you could not use social media? How often during the last year have you become restless or troubled if you have been prohibited from using social media? Core component Criterion 2: Withdrawal symptoms No direct analogue Conflict Negative consequences arising in relationships with others or within oneself due to the behavior. During the past year, have you had serious conflict with your parents, brother(s), or sister(s) because of your social media use? How often during the last year have you used social media so much that it has had a negative impact on your job/studies? Core component Criterion 9: Jeopardization of significant relationship Significant functional impairment Note Brown, 1988 Griffiths, 2005 Van Den Eijnden et al. (2016) Boer, van den Eijnden, et al. (2022) Andreassen et al. (2012) Andreassen et al. (2016) This model has been extensively cited and has stimulated the conceptualization of various behaviors and daily activities in which people may be highly engaged (e.g., technology-mediated behaviors, hobbies, sports) as potentially addictive behaviors. This conceptualization has been accompanied by the development of a plethora of brief assessment tools, typically composed of six items, covering the addiction “components” ( Chen et al., 2020 Cataldo, Billieux, Esposito, & Corazza, 2022 Starcevic, Billieux, & Schimmenti, 2018 Among these instruments, two are particularly prominent in assessing problematic social media use (PSMU). The first is the six-item Bergen Social Media Addiction Scale (BSMAS) ( Andreassen et al., 2016 Van Den Eijnden, Lemmens, & Valkenburg, 2016 DSM-5 Table 1 However, reliance on the components model of addiction – and more largely on substance use disorder criteria – to define behavioral addictions has been heavily criticized in recent years, mainly for failing to distinguish elevated but healthy involvement in a specific activity from pathological involvement ( Billieux, Schimmenti, et al., 2015 2019 Bottel et al., 2023 Flayelle, Schimmenti, Starcevic, & Billieux, 2022 Mihordin, 2012 Razum & Huić, 2024 Castro-Calvo et al., 2021 Razum, Baumgartner, & Glavak-Tkalić, 2023 ICD-11 Billieux, Stein, Castro-Calvo, Higuchi, & King, 2021 Reed et al., 2022 Castro-Calvo et al., 2021 Charlton (2002) Charlton and Danforth (2007) Brown, 1993 Griffiths, 2005 Billieux, Flayelle, Rumpf, & Stein, 2019 Infanti, Valls-Serrano, Perales, Vögele, & Billieux, 2023 Deleuze, Long, Liu, Maurage, & Billieux, 2018 Infanti et al., 2023 Manchiraju & Sadachar, 2018 Mylonopoulos & Theoharakis, 2020 2021 Orosz, Vallerand, Bőthe, Tóth-Király, & Paskuj, 2016 Tóth-Király et al., 2019 Vera Cruz et al., 2024 Verseillié, Laconi, Castro-Calvo, & Chabrol, 2023 This crucial distinction between core and peripheral components remains largely ignored in most behavioral addiction research, as all six components are often considered to reflect a unitary construct of “addiction.” Although this approach is highly pragmatic in research because a single composite score that reflects “addiction” facilitates interpretation, it restricts detailed analysis of individual components ( Cataldo et al., 2022 Kardefelt-Winther et al., 2017 Nogueira-López, Rial-Boubeta, Guadix-García, Villanueva-Blasco, & Billieux, 2023 Current study Among the various behavioral addictions, we have selected PSMU as a compelling example to illustrate the potential pitfalls of applying substance use disorder criteria to appetitive behaviors. PSMU is not officially recognized as a disorder in either DSM-5 or ICD-11. Nevertheless, it is considered a growing public health concern from a public health perspective ( WHO, 2024 Brand et al., 2022 Cataldo et al., 2022 Psychometric studies conducted on these two questionnaires have systematically replicated a one-factor latent structure, implying that all assessed criteria are supposed to reflect a unitary latent construct of PSMU ( Boer, Stevens, Finkenauer, Koning, & van den Eijnden, 2022 Brailovskaia & Margraf, 2022 Fournier et al. (2023 2024) Peng and Liao (2023) Verseillié et al. (2023) Burén, Nutley, Crisci, and Thorell (2023) Verseillié et al. (2023) Fournier et al. (2023) Peng and Liao (2023) Burén et al. (2023) Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to explore further whether measurement instruments based on the components model of addiction that assess PSMU indeed mix core and peripheral criteria, using data collected from the two most popular PSMU scales: the six-item BSMAS ( Andreassen et al., 2016 Van Den Eijnden et al., 2016 RQ1: Does a one-factor or a two-factor model provide a more accurate representation of the latent structure underlying PSMU, as measured by the BSMAS and the SMD? RQ2: How do core and peripheral criteria predict various measures of psychological well-being and distress? Methods Participants and procedure Data were collected from 3,463 Spanish-speaking participants recruited from September 2023 to April 2024 in 16 educational centers located in Valencia and Madrid (Spain). Participation consisted of completing 14 psychometric instruments that assessed different psychological constructs (see “Secondary data study” folder for further details at the following link: https://osf.io/wc4ev/ Data collection was conducted in person by researchers and/or teachers, either via an online survey implemented on the Qualtrics www.qualtrics.com Qualtrics n n n n M SD Table 2 Table 2.

The BSMAS comprises six items, one for each criterion of the components model of addiction (e.g., tolerance: “You feel the need to use social media more and more”). It has traditionally been measured using a 5-point Likert scale. In the context of the present study, we also adapted it to a 6-point Likert scale for consistency and comparability with the SMD. Therefore, the item response options range from “strongly disagree” (1) to “strongly agree” (6). The composite score ranges from 6 to 36. The scale obtained a Cronbach's α Bottaro, Griffiths, & Faraci, 2025 α Social Media Disorder Scale (SMD) (Spanish version by Boer, van den Eijnden, et al., 2022 Van Den Eijnden et al., 2016 This scale is designed to measure PSMU. The SMD consists of nine items that were developed explicitly from the internet gaming disorder criteria in DSM-5 Savci, Ercengiz, and Aysan (2018) α Boer, van den Eijnden, et al., 2022 α Pa tient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (Spanish version by Diez-Quevedo et al., 2001 Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001 The adolescent version of this questionnaire was obtained from the AIDS Education & Training Center Program ( www.aidsetc.org www.phqscreeners.com α Ferreira, Sousa, & Salgado, 2019 Rahman, Dhira, Sarker, & Mehareen, 2022 α G eneralized Anxiety Disorder Scale GAD-7) (Spanish version b y Crockett, Marcelo, Martínez, & Ordóñez-Carrasco, 2022 ; original English version by Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, & Löwe, 2006 The GAD-7 comprises seven items (e.g., “You have worried too much about different things”) that measure symptoms of anxiety. Items are on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 (“not at all”) to 3 (“nearly every day”). The composite score ranges from 0 to 24. The scale showed a Cronbach's α Mossman et al., 2017 Seo & Park, 2015 α Thr ee-Item Loneliness Scale TILS) (Spanish version by Trucharte , 2023 ; original English version by Hughes, Waite, Hawkley, & Cacioppo, 2004 This scale measures loneliness and comprises three items (e.g., “How often do you feel you lack companionship?”). The response scale ranges from 1 (“hardly ever”) to 3 (“often”). The composite score ranges from 3 to 9. The Spanish validation study reported a Cronbach's α Trucharte et al., 2023 α Sati sfaction With Life Scale (SWLS-3) (Spanish version by Ortuño-Sierra, Aritio-Solana, Chocarro de Luis, Nalda, & Fonseca-Pedrero, 2019 ; original English version by Diener, Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985 This questionnaire was used to assess life satisfaction. Originally composed of five items, Kjell and Diener (2021) Ortuño-Sierra et al., 2019 α Sing le Item Self-esteem SISE) (Spanish version by Domínguez-Lara, 2020 ; original English version by Robins, Hendin, & Trzesniewski, 2001 This scale measures self-esteem with only one item (i.e., “I have a high self-esteem”). The score ranges from 1 (“completely disagree”) to 5 (“completely agree”). The Spanish validation obtained a high correlation with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (ranging from 0.523 to 0.622). German validation obtained a correlation with the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale of 0.75 ( Brailovskaia & Margraf, 2020 r Robins et al., 2001 Data analytic strategy Missing data handling First, missing values were handled. Of the participants, 15.86% did not respond to all items included in the survey. The percentage of missing data across items included in the complete survey ranged from 6.95% to 11.99%. Little's test indicated that the data were not missing completely at random ( p Little, 1988 Mayer & Mayer, 2019 Wright & Ziegler, 2017 Stekhoven & Bühlmann, 2012 El Badisy, Graffeo, Khalis, & Giorgi, 2024 supplementary materials Confirmatory factor analyses To address RQ1, we tested three factor structures for both the BSMAS and the SMD. Hence, six confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) models were fitted. In Model 1, we fitted the classical one-factor model reported in the original validation articles ( Andreassen et al., 2016 Van Den Eijnden et al., 2016 Billieux et al., 2019 Charlton & Danforth, 2007 Fournier et al., 2023 2024 Peng & Liao, 2023 To fit the three models, we employed the robust maximum likelihood estimator due to its suitability for Likert scales with more than five response options ( Finney & DiStefano, 2006 Hu & Bentler, 1999 Rosseel, 2023 α Jorgensen, Pornprasertmanit, Schoemann, & Rosseel, 2022 Structural equation analyses To evaluate RQ2, we specified two Structural Equation Models (SEM), one for the BSMAS and one for the SMD. SEM was chosen for its ability to model multiple latent constructs simultaneously and to reduce measurement error. In each model, we treated all constructs as latent: core and peripheral PSMU criteria were modeled as exogenous factors, and life satisfaction, self-esteem, loneliness, depression, and anxiety were modeled as endogenous factors, following the best-fitting CFA structures for the BSMAS and SMD. Parameters were estimated using the WLSMV estimator, and model fit was evaluated according to the aforementioned cutoff criteria for the fit indices. This estimator was chosen due to its superiority to other estimators when treating categorical items (e.g., Robust Maximum Likelihood; Li, 2016 Rosseel, 2023 Ethics Ethical approval for this study was granted by the Ethics Committee of the University of Valencia (Spain) (procedure number: 2675827). All participants provided informed consent prior to their participation in the present study. A passive informed consent procedure was followed, whereby parents or legal guardians were informed of the study by each participating school. These data have already been used in a previous original research article (see https://osf.io/wc4ev/ Results Confirmatory factor analyses Chi-square difference tests between all confirmatory analysis models suggested that the two-factor models (i.e., Model 2, Model 3) presented a significantly better fit than did the classic unifactorial model (i.e., Model 1) ( p Table 3 Table 3.

Such results align with those reported in Fournier et al. (2023 2024) Griffiths (2005) Charlton (2002) Charlton and Danforth (2007) Burén et al., 2023 Peng & Liao, 2023 Li, Mu, Xie, & Kwok, 2023 Peng and Liao (2023) SEM analysis indicated that core criteria positively predict depression, anxiety, and loneliness and negatively predict life satisfaction and self-esteem, whereas peripheral criteria showed the opposite pattern. When we took into account the relationship between core criteria and psychological indicators, an inverse and significant relationship emerged with all dependent variables considered. Meta-analytic literature indicates a positive association between PSMU and depression, anxiety, and loneliness and a negative one with self-esteem and life satisfaction ( Akkaş & Turan, 2023 Huang, 2022 Shannon, Bush, Villeneuve, Hellemans, & Guimond, 2022 Fournier et al., 2023 Guo et al., 2022 Peng & Liao, 2023 Zarate, Ball, Montag, Prokofieva, & Stavropoulos, 2022 The pattern of results found in this study can be understood in light of the dualistic model of passion formulated in Vallerand et al. (2003) Vallerand (2008) Curran, Hill, Appleton, Vallerand, & Standage, 2015 Billieux et al., 2019 Overall, our results suggest that both the BSMAS and the SMD assess two distinct latent constructs and that their items should not be used to compute a global score of “addictive social media use.” Although this study focused on PSMU, the theoretical distinction between high involvement and pathological involvement is not exclusive to social media use: it has been observed in the context of various appetitive behaviors, such as exercising, binge-watching TV series, using online pornography, gaming, and gambling ( Charlton & Danforth, 2007 2010 Flayelle et al., 2022 Granziol et al., 2023 Katz et al., 2024 Vera Cruz et al., 2024 Whelan, Laato, Islam, & Billieux, 2021 Terry, Szabo, & Griffiths, 2004 Granziol et al., 2023 Limitations and future research This study has several limitations that must be addressed to contextualize its findings. First, the sample comprises solely adolescents from schools in Spain, which may limit the generalizability of the results to other age groups, settings, countries, or languages. Second, using only two items to evaluate the peripheral factor is a relevant limitation ( Eisinga, Grotenhuis, & Pelzer, 2013 Emons, Sijtsma, & Meijer, 2007 Heck & Thomas, 2020 Kline, 2005 N Marsh, Hau, Balla, & Grayson, 1998 Smith, McCarthy, & Anderson, 2000 Van Den Eijnden et al., 2016 Müller et al., 2022 Paschke, Austermann, & Thomasius, 2021 Conclusions Our findings highlight significant limitations in the two most popular scales for assessing PSMU, which hold important implications for the field. The BSMAS and the SMD conflate core criteria and peripheral criteria, thus mixing items reflecting engagement with items reflecting addiction. The current approach to PSMU assessment contributes to (over)pathologizing the use of social media. Indeed, including peripheral criteria to assess excessive behaviors contributes to inflated prevalence rates ( Cheng, Lau, Chan, & Luk, 2021 Nogueira-López et al., 2023 Satchell et al. (2021) We advocate for the critical evaluation of core criteria in behavioral addiction research and recommend removing peripheral criteria from assessments, as their inclusion pathologizes intensive – but healthy – involvement in appetitive behaviors. We also propose to rename peripheral criteria as engagement indicators and invite clinicians and researchers to be aware of these issues and be more cautious about using “quick and short” screening tools that conflate problematic and non-problematic items to assess a construct of “behavioral addiction,” which is often rooted in criteria developed to assess substance use disorders. To provide a constructive way forward, we also suggest adopting instruments grounded in ICD-11 criteria, such as the ACSID-11, which assesses impaired control over the behavior and functional impairment in important areas of daily life as key indicators of PSMU.
