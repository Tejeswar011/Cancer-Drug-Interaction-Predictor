Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide [ 1 2 The drug resistance of cancer cells can be either intrinsic, pre-existing at the start of treatment, as a result of genetic changes accumulated during carcinogenesis, or acquired as a result of treatment. Acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs, in particular, oxaliplatin resistance, is a multifactorial process involving alterations in DNA repair, drug detoxification, apoptosis, cellular signaling, and many others [ 3 Chromosomal rearrangements and changes in gene expression affecting proliferation, survival, and cell response to damaging effects may play an important role in the formation of resistance to chemotherapy [ 4 5 The HCT116 cell line, derived from a human colorectal carcinoma, is frequently employed in CRC research due to its well-characterized genetic background. By comparing oxaliplatin-sensitive and oxaliplatin-resistant HCT116 cells, researchers can uncover key genomic and transcriptomic alterations associated with drug resistance. Karyotype analysis provides insights into chromosomal instability and large-scale genomic rearrangements, while transcriptomic profiling reveals differentially expressed genes and signaling pathways that may drive resistance. This article explores the establishment of oxaliplatin-resistant HCT116 cells and presents a comparative analysis of their karyotypes and transcriptomes against their drug-sensitive parental HCT116 cells. By identifying genomic and gene expression changes, this study aims to shed light on potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets to overcome oxaliplatin resistance in colorectal cancer. 2. Results 2.1. Generation of Oxaliplatin-Resistant Cells Based on the Human Colorectal Cancer Cell Line HCT116 In the presented work, a line of oxaliplatin-resistant human colorectal cancer cells was obtained by repeated pulse exposure of parental HCT116 cells to a high concentration of oxaliplatin (Oxpl). For this purpose, cells at a confluent density (70–80%) were treated with 150 μM oxaliplatin for 6 h, after which the culture medium was changed to fresh medium without oxaliplatin. The concentration of 150 μM was selected based on MTT assay data as the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of parental HCT116 cells at which 50% of the cells died 48 h after changing the medium to fresh without the active drug (IC50 48 h) ( Figure 1 To develop resistance, the parental HCT116 cells were subjected to sequential rounds of oxaliplatin treatment. For this purpose, cells at a confluent density (70–80%) were treated with 150 μM oxaliplatin for 6 h, after which the culture medium was changed to fresh medium without oxaliplatin. The oxaliplatin concentration of 150 μM was chosen based on the results of the MTT test, as the concentration at which 50% of the cells died 48 h after changing the medium to fresh without the active drug (IC50 48 h) ( Figure 1 After a recovery period and monolayer formation, the cells were subcultured twice. After repeated passages, the cells were subjected to the next round according to the method described above. The period of recovery of cell viability and their return to active proliferation was reduced with each subsequent round of oxaliplatin treatment. Thus, the duration of restoration of the active proliferation of cells that survived after the first round was 6–7 weeks, after the second round, it was 4–5 weeks, and after the third, it was 3–4 weeks. After resumption of active proliferation, the cells were characterized by an increased size compared to the parental sensitive cells, with the presence of a large number of multinucleated cells. After two rounds of Oxpl treatment, the cell resistance index (RI) was determined using the MTT test data, which is an important parameter for assessing the degree of their resistance to a chemotherapy drug or physical impact [ 6 7 8 Figure 1 2.2. General Characteristics of the Obtained Cells Resistant to Platinum Drugs The drug resistance of tumor cells can be either passive, due to a decrease in the intracellular concentration of the active substance, or active, which involves the restoration of damage and survival under conditions of cellular stress caused by the action of chemotherapeutic drugs [ 9 Figure 1 Figure 1 According to the results of the FACS analysis, oxaliplatin causes cell cycle arrest at the G2 checkpoint and the accumulation of sensitive HCT116 cells at the G2/M phase boundary, with subsequent initiation of the cell death program, as evidenced by an increase in the proportion of cells with sub-diploid DNA content ( Figure 1 Thus, it was demonstrated that Oxpl causes cell cycle arrest, a characteristic of cells with damaged DNA, both in sensitive and resistant HCT116 cells, which is apparently associated with the accumulation of platinum DNA adducts under the action of Oxpl. This indicates that the formed resistance of HCT116 oxpl-R cells is not associated with tolerance mechanisms, which consist of avoiding damage and reducing the intracellular concentration of the active substance, but is realized through mechanisms of active resistance. Drug-resistant tumor cells are often characterized by cross-resistance to other drugs. The width of the spectrum of this intersection can be used to judge the specificity of the resistance formed. To assess the degree of cross-resistance to other DNA-damaging drugs used at the IC50 concentration for the parental sensitive HCT116 cells, a comparative analysis of their effect on the viability of sensitive and oxaliplatin-resistant cells was carried out ( Figure 1 2.3. Cytogenetic Analysis of Oxaliplatin-Resistant Human Colorectal Cancer Cells, HCT116 Oxpl-R, Revealed Multiple Karyotype Abnormalities One of the most common features of cancer cells is an aneuploid karyotype. Approximately 90% of solid tumors and more than 50% of hematopoietic cancer cells exhibit varying degrees of aneuploidy [ 5 10 11 12 According to the flow cytometry data, the resistant HCT116 oxpl-R cells are characterized by an increased DNA content compared to the parental HCT116 cells ( Figure 2 To analyze the changes in cell ploidy, as well as their karyotype during the development of resistance to oxaliplatin, a karyological analysis of the HCT116 oxpl-R cells was performed. According to the cytogenetic analysis, the population of the HCT116 oxpl-R cells is hypotetraploid and heterogeneous in chromosome number, which varies from 80 to 88, mainly due to changes in the copy number of normal chromosomes ranging from 1 to 5. Cells with chromosome numbers 84 and 85 constitute two modal classes in the population by chromosome number ( Table 1 Figure 2 Figure S1 Six permanent clonal structural chromosome aberrations (SCAs) were identified, involving chromosomes X, 5, 6, 8, 10 (twice), 16, 17, and 18. The clonal SCAs include translocations t(17q;18q) (present in two copies), t(5q;6q), and t(8q;16p); additional material on the long arm of chromosome 10 (aad(10)); and the deletion of nearly the entire long arm of chromosome 10 (del(10)(q22)). Using spectral karyotyping [ 13 The parental HCT116 cells are pseudo-diploid with the chromosomal formula 46,XY,der(10)dup(10)(q22q23),der(8),t(8;16)(q13;p13.3),der(18)t(17;18)(q11.2;p11.2) ( Figure S2 14 Comparison of the karyotypes of the HCT116 oxpl-R cells and the parental HCT116 cells revealed the following: (1) an increase in ploidy in the HCT116 oxpl-R cells to a hypotetraploid state and (2) the emergence of two new stable chromosomal aberrations in the HCT116 oxpl-R cells: a translocation t(?5q;6q) and a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 10 (del(10)(q22)). It can be hypothesized that the translocation t(?5;6)(q22;q25) may contribute to the acquisition of drug resistance in these cells. Additionally, a modification in one homologue of the X chromosome was observed in some cells. Notably, all HCT116 oxpl-R cells retained three chromosomal rearrangements characteristic of the original HCT116 line. These aberrations were present in two copies in the resistant cells, which may play a role in sustaining their proliferative capacity and contributing to genomic instability. 2.4. Transcriptomic Landscape of Oxaliplatin-Resistant HCT116 Cells Reveals Metabolic and Genome Stability Alterations There is a chromosomal concept explaining drug resistance, which is based on the evidence that drug resistance is proportional to the number of chromosomal alterations in cells [ 4 Figure 3 All six samples exhibited consistently high Pearson correlation coefficients with each other (ranging from 0.97 to 1.00), reflecting strong reproducibility across replicates ( Figure S3 Figure 3 Comparative analysis of gene expression between the oxaliplatin-sensitive HCT116 and oxaliplatin-resistant HCT116 oxpl-R cells identified 1807 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of <0.05 and an absolute log2 fold change (|log2FC|) > 2. Among these, 1216 genes were significantly upregulated, while 591 genes were downregulated in the experimental group relative to the control ( Figure 3 A heatmap was generated to visualize the expression patterns of the top 30 DEGs across the samples. The top DEGs were grouped into six distinct clusters based on their expression patterns across the samples, where each cluster represents a set of genes with similar expression dynamics. Functional analysis was performed to determine whether there is enrichment of known biological functions, interactions, or pathways among the gene sets obtained. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. According to the GO database, significant enrichment of upregulated genes was observed across a broad spectrum of biological processes, including respiration and energy metabolism (GO:0019646 aerobic electron transport chain, GO:0006754 ATP biosynthesis), GO:1902600 proton transmembrane transport, and GO:0044355 clearance of foreign intracellular DNA, among others ( Figure 4 The KEGG pathway analysis revealed activation of pathways controlling energy metabolism (hsa00190 oxidative phosphorylation) and protein synthesis (hsa03010 ribosome), ECM–receptor interaction (hsa04512), glycosphingolipid biosynthesis (hsa00601), and a set of disease and pathogen-driven pathways (hsa05208, hsa05171, hsa05016, hsa05218) ( Figure 4 These findings suggest that oxaliplatin-resistant cells exhibit reduced proliferative potential and increased genome instability compared to oxaliplatin-sensitive HCT116 cells. We suggest that the high level of oxidative stress in resistant cells may contribute to their reduced proliferative capacity and increased genomic instability. Excessive accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, disrupting normal cell cycle mechanisms and leading to delays in cell division. Moreover, oxidative damage to the genome increases mutation frequency and chromosomal alterations, thereby promoting genomic instability and disturbing cellular homeostasis. 2.5. Oxaliplatin-Resistant Cells Exhibit Higher Redox Gene Activity and Enhanced Reactive Oxygen Species Production The levels of reactive oxygen species and antioxidant system activity are often reported as indicators of malignancy and aggressiveness in tumor cells [ 15 16 17 Figure 5 Our results revealed an upregulated expression of multiple redox-related genes in the oxaliplatin-resistant cells HCT116 oxpl-R ( Figure 5 Figure 5 In particular, increased expression levels were observed for genes involved in the antioxidant defense system, such as GPX3 GSR NDUFB7 NDUFB5 NDUFA2 NCF2 AHR To confirm the difference in redox status, ROS levels were examined in the HCT116 and HCT116 oxpl-R cells, measuring fluorescence intensity of DCF ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 2.6. The Relationship Between Transcriptomic Changes and Chromosomal Rearrangements in Oxaliplatin-Resistant HCT116 Oxpl-R Cells To associate these transcriptomic signatures with karyotype changes, the distribution of DEGs throughout chromosomes was visualized in the HCT116 oxpl-R cells on a karyoplot ( Figure 6 18 19 20 Figure 6 Given the extensive and heterogeneous karyotypic alterations, where different cells within the population carry varying chromosome numbers, it is highly challenging to unequivocally interpret transcriptomic changes. What is detected as a significantly differentially expressed gene (DEG) may represent either a true change in transcript abundance within individual cells due to gene expression regulation or expression confined to only a subset of the cellular population. It remains unclear to what extent these clonal variations in gene expression contribute to the development of platinum resistance. 3. Discussion Given that oxaliplatin stands as a cornerstone in the therapeutic management of colorectal cancer (CRC), frequently integrated into regimens such as FOLFOX [ 21 Transcriptomic profiling of oxaliplatin-resistant colorectal cancer (CRC) cells derived from DLD1 and HCT116 identified ALCAM activation with concurrent CD22, CASP1, and CISH suppression as key molecular features of oxaliplatin non-response [ 22 23 24 25 Despite the existing data, the task of elucidating mechanisms of resistance remains highly relevant, given that researchers studying the transcriptomes of drug-resistant cancer cells highlight the complexity of the problem, which stems from the alteration of entire gene clusters and signaling pathways instead of individual genes. In this regard, the discovery of universal markers or broadly applicable target panels for overcoming drug resistance in cancer cells seems unrealistic at present. Instead, priority should be given to the ongoing accumulation of this type of data, gathering new transcriptomic signatures from cells exhibiting drug resistance to enhance our insight into possible resistance mechanisms, which are often distinct for each resistant cell line. The origin of the platinum resistance observed in HCT116 oxpl-R cells results from multiple cycles of high-concentration platinum drug exposure. Prolonged culturing itself is known to enable cells to develop resistance to treatment [ 26 27 Figure 1 What sets this study apart from others is that we analyzed the transcriptome of oxaliplatin-resistant HCT116 cells (HCT116 oxpl-R) alongside their karyotype, in an effort to link chromosomal alterations to the transcriptomic signatures observed. Such an integrative approach may provide deeper insights into the evolutionary pressures and genomic reorganizations accompanying the acquisition of resistance and contribute to improved prediction of potential resistance mechanisms through cytogenetic profiling of resistant cells. Indeed, aneuploidy and chromosomal instability (CIN) are hallmarks of most solid tumors that contribute to tumor heterogeneity and selective adaptation [ 28 5 29 10 11 29 30 The development of oxaliplatin resistance in CRC cells is a complex process accompanied by significant karyotypic alterations, as observed in our study. The resistant cell lines, derived from parental oxaliplatin-sensitive HCT116 cells, exhibited pronounced polyploidization and chromosomal rearrangements, notably the deletion of the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q) and the translocation between chromosomes 5 and 6 at bands 22q and 25q, denoted as t(5;6)(22q;25q). Deletion of the long arm of chromosome 10 has been identified in various cancers and has been associated with tumor development, progression, and, in some cases, drug resistance. Of a cohort of 260 patients with primary neuroblastoma tumors at disease onset, 26 exhibited 10q loss, while the remaining 234 displayed different segmental chromosomal aberrations (SCAs) [ 31 32 According to our data, oxaliplatin-resistant HCT116 cells undergo polyploidization (predominantly tetraploidization) in the process of acquiring platinum resistance. Tetraploidization, or whole-genome duplication, is increasingly recognized as a pivotal event in cancer drug resistance development. Polyploidy likely contributes to oxaliplatin resistance by providing redundant genetic material that mitigates the impact of DNA damage induced by oxaliplatin, a platinum-based agent that forms DNA crosslinks. This adaptation may stabilize the cancer genome against genotoxic stress while facilitating further chromosomal rearrangements. Studies have shown that tetraploid cancer cells, which contain double the normal chromosome number, are often more tolerant to chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy compared to diploid cells [ 33 34 35 Apart from whole-genome polyploidization in HCT116 oxpl-R cells, aneuploidies affecting specific chromosomes should also be taken into account, as we observe complex polyploidy with chromosome-specific copy number variations that undoubtedly affect gene dosage in the transcriptome of oxaliplatin-resistant cells. For instance, trisomy of chromosomes 7 and 13 in DLD1 colorectal cancer cells has been reported to confer resistance to 5-fluorouracil [ 36 Figure 2 Figure S1 6 37 38 20 The loss of the Y chromosome in resistant cells resulted in the downregulation of genes located on the Y chromosome, which appeared among the differentially expressed genes in our data, with suppressed expression in these resistant cells. The loss of the Y chromosome is widely documented in the literature as a negative prognostic marker and a characteristic feature of drug-resistant cancer cells [ 39 40 These findings align with the recent literature on genomic instability and its role in chemotherapeutic resistance, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms driving resistance and prompting discussion about the interplay between karyotypic changes and selective pressures in cancer evolution. The overall increase in chromosome copy number leads to global gene expression shifts that support resistance phenotypes, such as improved DNA repair, evasion of apoptosis, and enhanced stress response. The transcriptomic profile of resistant cells is intricately linked to karyotypic rearrangements, as these structural changes disrupt gene regulation and signaling cascades. Integrating transcriptomic data, our RNA-seq analysis of resistant cells highlighted extensive differential gene expression primarily affecting pathways related to energy metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis, such as the regulation of proton transmembrane transport ( SLC9A9 SLC36A1 SLC25A27 SLC25A20 UCP3 NCF2 AKR1C1 AKT3 NDUFB5 NDUFA4L2 NDUFB7 DMAC2L NDUFB5 PINK1 Figure 4 Among our key DEGs, there are many genes involved in antioxidant defense and redox homeostasis pathways that modulate intracellular ROS levels ( Figure 5 16 41 15 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 46 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 50 Some of the detected ROS-related genes are reported as prognostic markers for CRC, according to the Human Protein Atlas [ 58 59 Figure S4 NDUFB5 60 NDUFA4L2 61 62 In this study, an integrated analysis of the karyotype and transcriptome of oxaliplatin-resistant cells was conducted, uncovering numerous chromosomal rearrangements and a substantial set of differentially expressed genes that impact diverse biological pathways. While certain chromosomal and gene expression signatures align with previously described hallmarks of platinum resistance, others constitute novel findings that broaden the current understanding of resistance biology. A critical challenge is to discern which molecular and chromosomal changes are common hallmarks of platinum resistance versus those that stem from the unique evolutionary trajectory of our resistant cell lines. Addressing this, we aim to expand our research by screening a diverse collection of cell lines resistant to various platinum drugs and other therapies to extract robust, recurring patterns of genomic instability. Combined with the literature evidence, our study will facilitate the identification of new molecular markers for detecting tumor genomic instability and support the design of innovative therapies targeting drug resistance in tumor cells. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Line Human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116 was obtained (Praymbiomed, Moscow, Russia) and tested according to short tandem repeat (STR) standards by Gordiz (Moscow, Russia). Oxaliplatin-resistant HCT116 oxpl-R cells were obtained by repeated pulse exposure of parental HCT116 cells to a high concentration of oxaliplatin ( Section 2.1 2 4.2. Cell Viability Analysis Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay. For this, the cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 15 × 10 3 4.3. Distribution of Cells by DNA Content The cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.01% saponin/PBS solution for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated in the presence of 100 μg/mL RNase A and 10 μg/mL propidium iodide for 15 min at 37 °C and analyzed on a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Breya, CA, USA). 4.4. Measurement of ROS Levels For the detection of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the cells were incubated with 2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, D6883, Sigma), which is acetylated inside the cells to form a non-fluorescent compound that is subsequently oxidized by ROS to fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin (DCF). The cells were washed with warm PBS and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in 5 µM DCFH-DA/PBS, washed again in warm PBS, and then analyzed using a flow cytometer Coulter Epics XL (Bechman, Brea, CA, USA) with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm. 4.5. Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Ψm) The cells were incubated with 50 nM tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) in PBS for 10 min at 37 °C. TMRM, a cationic fluorescent dye, accumulates in mitochondria in a membrane potential (ΔΨm)-dependent manner. After staining, the cells were immediately analyzed using a CytoFLEX flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) with 488 nm excitation and emission detection at 560–606 nm. 4.6. Karyotype Analysis (GTG-Banding) Karyotyping of the human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT116 and oxaliplatin-resistant HCT116 was performed. To accumulate cells in the metaphase stage, colchicine solution was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 0.375 µg/mL, followed by a 1.5 h incubation. Then, the cells were removed with a trypsin–Versene solution, treated with a hypotonic solution (0.55% KCl and 1% Na citrate solutions) for 20 min at 37 °C, and fixed using a 3:1 methanol–glacial acetic acid solution for 15 min. The fixing solution was changed to a fresh one. The procedure was repeated 3 times. For metaphase chromosome spread preparation, the fixed cell suspension was dropped onto dry slides over a 50 °C water bath and then left to dry completely. The dried chromosome preparations were treated with 0.02% trypsin solution for 3 min at 30 °C, and the enzymatic reaction was halted with blocking solution (134 mM KCl; 3,42 M NaCl; 104 mM NaHCO3; 140 mM a-D-glucose) for 15 s. The chromosomes were stained with 2% Giemsa solution (Paneco, Moscow, Russia) for 4 min. Chromosomal structural rearrangements were automatically analyzed using a hardware–software system comprising an AxioSkop A1 ProgRes MF microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany), a high-resolution monochrome CCD camera (Jenoptik, 1360 × 1024 pixels, Jena, Germany), and a computer running VideoTesT Karyo 3.1 software. 4.7. RNA Sequencing and Transcriptomic Data Analysis RNA Isolation: For transcriptome analysis, total RNA was extracted from the HCT116 and HCT116 oxpl-R cells using the Lira reagent (Biolabmix, Novosibirsk, Russia) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. For RNA quality assessment, the concentration of extracted nucleic acid was detected with Nanodrop2000 (manufacturer: ThermoFisher, South San Francisco, CA, USA, model: Nanodrop2000), and the integrity was detected with Agient2100, LabChip GX (manufacturer and model: Perkin Elmer LabChip GX). A Hieff NGS Ultima Dual-mode mRNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (Yeasen Tec. Inc., Shanghai, China), model:13533ES96, was used for library construction. Product purification magnetic beads, namely, HieffNGS DNA selection Beads (Superior Ampure XP alternative) (Yeasen), model:12601ES56, were used. The primer adapters included the following: adpter3 = “AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTG AACTCCAGTCAC” and adpter5 = “AGATCGGAAGAGCGTCGTGTAGGGAAAGAGTGT”. The libraries were sequenced on the Illumina Novaseq X platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). The PE150 sequencing reagent was NovaSeq X S4 Reagent Kit (San Diego, CA, USA). The average number of pair-end reads was 40.1 ± 3.5 million per sample in this study. After quality filtering and trimming with Trimmomatic [ 63 Transcript quantification was performed via lightweight mapping using Salmon [ 64 The transcript-level quantifications obtained with Salmon were imported and summarized to the gene level using the tximport R package (version 1.34.0) [ 65 66 p To plot DEGs according to their chromosome location, the karyoploteR package for R was used [ 67 Functional enrichment analysis was performed using the R package clusterProfiler (version 4.14.6) [ 68 69 p 68 70 4.8. Real-Time PCR Analysis Reverse transcription was performed with 2 µg of RNA using an RT kit (Biolabmix, Novosibirsk, Russia). The PCR program was as follows: 38 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 30 s. Gene expression levels were normalized to GAPDH −ΔΔCt 71 All oligonucleotides used for qPCR are listed in Table 2 5. Conclusions Through combined analysis of chromosomal structure and gene expression, we uncovered significant genomic rearrangements and diverse transcriptomic shifts in oxaliplatin-resistant cells. While some of these changes align with established platinum resistance mechanisms, others reveal novel pathways and potential targets. Together with the existing literature, our results provide a foundation for identifying new markers of tumor genomic instability and contribute toward the development of targeted therapeutic approaches against chemoresistant tumors.
