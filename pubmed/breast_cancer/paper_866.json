To improve the efficacy of BCG, a better understanding of the immune landscape underlying BCG resistance is critical. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and whole-exome sequencing on tumors from NMIBC patients before and after BCG treatment. Our analysis revealed a marked increase in CD6/ALCAM interactions between T cells and urothelial cells in BCG recurrent tumors. CD6-high T cells were enriched in recurrent tumors and exhibited downregulation of activation-related genes, indicative of functional impairment. These observations were supported by analysis of an independent BCG-treated NMIBC cohort, in which CD6/ALCAM signaling was correlated with shorter recurrence-free survival ( p Subject terms Bladder cancer Cancer therapeutic resistance Paul C.

Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) remains the gold standard for reducing recurrence and progression in intermediate- to high-risk NMIBC patients. Despite its clinical utility, up to 50% of patients experience disease recurrence, highlighting the need for improved treatment strategies and an improved understanding of resistance mechanisms 1 3 Prior bulk genomic and transcriptomic studies have provided insights into mutations 4 5 6 Our results revealed that although genomic alterations and cellular composition were similar between BCG naïve and recurrent tumors, recurrent samples showed enhanced CD6/ALCAM signaling between T cells and urothelial cells. CD6-high T cells exhibited a gene expression signature of impaired activation, suggesting a mechanism of immune evasion. The significance of this pathway was validated in a large independent cohort, which further implicates CD6/ALCAM as a potential therapeutic target in NMIBC. Results Cell type composition of BCG naïve and recurrent tumors To understand the genomic and molecular drivers of BCG resistance, we implemented a protocol for rapid dissociation and scRNA-seq from cystoscopically resected NMIBC specimens along with parallel whole exome sequencing. Our final cohort consisted of 27 samples from 23 patients, with 14 samples collected prior to BCG treatment (“naïve” samples; n n 1 S1 n FGFR3 PIK3CA KMT2D KDM6A KMT2C ARID1A 1A 7 CDKN2A 1A q 1B Fig. 1 Genomic and single-cell transcriptional profiling of NMIBC.

As NMIBC cells likely harbor aberrant transcriptional profiles depending on their degree of differentiation, we performed scRNA-seq on 10 freshly isolated bladder biopsies away from tumor with normal appearing urothelium and used these samples as a reference atlas to assist with cell type annotation (Fig. 1C S1 1C S2 1D 1E 1F-H 1E S3 KRT15 KRT5 UPK2 UPK1A 1H 1H Interferon signaling is broadly activated across cell types after BCG treatment After harmonizing single cell populations across patients, we sought to identify changes in cell-type abundance that might exist between naïve ( n n 2A 2 2B 3 Fig. 2 Differential cell abundance and differential gene expression between BCG naïve and BCG recurrent NMIBC.

To surface more nuanced mechanisms of immune resistance related to specific cellular interactions in the microenvironment, we performed cell-cell communication analyses using CellChat 8 n n n 3A 9 S5A 10 11 5B Fig. 3 Comparative analysis of cell communication networks in BCG naïve and recurrent samples.

In an era of widespread BCG shortage, identifying mechanisms responsible for disease recurrence has become even more critical, so that we can develop therapeutic strategies to augment BCG efficacy or judiciously offer clinical trial enrollment. While there have been multiple attempts to identify mechanisms of recurrence using bulk RNA-seq 6 12 13 14 6 6 Cell-to-cell communication analysis revealed increased interactions between T cells and urothelial cells in recurrent samples mediated by CD6/ALCAM. We further identified that T cells with high CD6 expression had a reduced activation capacity. CD6 is a transmembrane glycoprotein primarily expressed on the surface of T cells, where it plays a crucial role in modulating T cell activation and function during immune responses and tolerance 15 17 18 18 19 22 23 + + + - + + 24 Validation of the CD6/ALCAM signature was performed using an independent bulk RNA-seq dataset. Elevated expression of both CD6 and ALCAM was detectable prior to BCG treatment and was significantly associated with worse recurrence-free survival. These findings suggest that T cell dysfunction may be pre-established in the tumor microenvironment and are consistent with prior studies showing an association between an inflamed state prior to BCG and treatment resistance 6 25 27 28 29 Another study showed that intravesical BCG exerts a potent systemic effect by reprogramming hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in both mice and humans 30 In addition to T cell–urothelial interactions, stromal elements have also been implicated in bladder tumor immunity. Wang et al. reported that high stromal and immune infiltration scores were associated with worse overall survival in muscle-invasive bladder cancers and in metastatic bladder cancers treated with checkpoint inhibition 31 While our study provides novel insights into the role of CD6/ALCAM signaling in BCG resistance, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, our single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis was conducted on a modest cohort ( n hi In conclusion, our findings shed light on the immune cell interactions potentially driving BCG resistance and highlighted a need to further investigate the role of CD6/ALCAM signaling within NMIBC. While we are in silico estimating cellular interactions via CellChat 8 32 33 34 35 Methods Patients, sample collection, treatment, and follow-up Patients with a new bladder tumor diagnosed by axial imaging and/or cystoscopy were consented for specimen collection and molecular analysis under an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol (14-1222/CASE2815) adhering to U.S. Common Rule guidelines and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki at Cleveland Clinic. Tumors were identified with a cystoscope, and a cold cup forceps was used to biopsy the intra-luminal portion. Control specimens were biopsied in a similar fashion from areas with normal appearing urothelium at least 5 cm away from any tumor site or suspicious lesion. Tissue pieces were either snap frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen or dissociated for 10x Genomics 3’ single-cell RNA-seq library preparation as previously described in ref. 36 Whole exome sequencing Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen tumor tissues and quantified using NanoDrop. The sequencing library was made using SureSelectV5 library kit following manufacturer’s protocol and sequenced using paired end 150 bp reads to an average coverage of 187x (range 151x-263x). The sequencing reads were aligned to GRCh38 using STAR. A combination of five different mutation callers (Mutect2, SomaticSniper 1.0.4, VarScan V2.4.3, Strelka v2.9.10 and Platypus 0.8.1) were used to identify SNVs. Small insertions and deletions (indels) were determined using Mutect2, Varscan v2.4.3, Strelka v2.9.10, and Platypus 0.8.1. We used the SnpEff variant annotation and effect prediction tool to determine effect of called variants. Our variant reporting criteria are as follows: Tcov > 10 & Taf ≥ 0.04 & Ncov > 7 & Naf ≤ 0.01 & Tac > 4 were set to pass. Common SNPs were eliminated by comparison to snp142.vcf. Rare variants found in dbSNP were kept if Naf = 0. Variants with Tcov < 20 or Tac < 4 were marked as low confidence. Only Variants called by more than 1 caller were reported. Common variants in gnomAD v 2.1.1 (March 2019 release; gnomAD also incorporates Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)) were excluded. Additional optimization and filtering were applied for insertions/deletions (INDELS). INDELS in blacklisted regions ( https://www.encodeproject.org/annotations/ENCSR636HFF/ ) Mutation load was determined as the total number of non-synonymous mutations passing filters. Previously described signatures of mutational processes were determined in each sample using non-negative least-squares regression as provided by the R package deconstructSigs v1.8.0 using the COSMIC signatures as the mutational signature matrix. Mutational profiles were analyzed from MAF files using R package maftools version 2.12.0. Gistic2.0 was used for analyzing copy number change from facets segment values. Single-cell RNA-seq mapping and cell naming FASTQ files were mapped to the GRCh38 reference human genome using Cellranger (v5.0.0). Cells containing less than 600 genes and/or more than 30% mitochondrial and ribosomal genes were removed. Sample-specific Seurat objects were created using Seurat (v4.3.0), then normalized using Seurat’s SCTransform. Samples were then split into benign bladder (10 samples) and cancer (27 samples) sets. Each set was integrated independently, based on variable features using Seurat’s IntegrateData function. Cells from the benign bladder set were then divided into Immune, Stromal, and Urothelial compartments, re-clustered, and named based on marker genes. We also identified and named clusters containing doublets (cell clusters that contain cells with an abnormal number of genes or markers characteristic for multiple different cell types). To help name cancer cells, we used Seurat’s label transfer method 37 Differential gene expression, differential abundance, GSEA, and CellChat analyses Differential gene expression was assessed with Seurat’s FindMarkers function using a negative binomial generalized linear model (test_use = ‘negbinom’) with patient as a covariate to account for several samples that came from the same individual. Parameter logfc_threshold was set to 0.05. Other parameters were set to default. Differential expression (DE) analysis was performed only for comparisons in which there were more than 100 cells present for analysis in recurrence and naïve groups. The output of DE analysis was the input for gene set enrichment analysis, performed using the GSEA function from clusterProfiler (v4.4.4) and HALLMARK gene sets. All genes, regardless of p-value, were sorted from highest to lowest log2 fold change and used for the analysis. Longitudinal analysis of two individuals with tumors taken at multiple time points was used to investigate the change in IFNG related gene sets using ssGSEA scores. Differential abundance analysis was performed by comparing fractions of different cells between different groups using Wilcoxon rank sum test as implemented in R. Cell types with more than 100 cells per group were considered for this analysis. Heat maps were generated using ComplexHeatmap and circlize packages. To group cells into CD6 (ALCAM) high and CD6 (ALCAM) low groups, we first split cells into those that express the gene (count > 0) and those that do not and filter out all cell types for which less than 100 cells expressed the gene. Next, we found the mean log-normalized gene expression of gene-expressing cells and used that value to separate low from high groups. Cell-to-cell interaction was performed using CellChat 1.6.1 8 Bulk RNA-seq analysis Validation of CD6/ALCAM signature association with BCG response was performed using the bulk RNA-seq data from Jong et al. 6 n 1 2 Supplementary information  Supplementary Information Supplementary Data 1 Supplementary Data 2 Supplementary Data 3 Supplementary Data 4 Publisher’s note These authors contributed equally: Ivan Juric, Emily E.
