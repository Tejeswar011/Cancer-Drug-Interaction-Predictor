Adipose‐derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) may penetrate the brain and alter lipid homeostasis, contributing to neurodegeneration. METHODS We isolated exosome‐enriched EVs from subcutaneous and visceral fat of lean and obese individuals, followed by lipidomic profiling. An in vitro amyloid‐β (Aβ) aggregation assay using purified Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides was performed under lipid environments mimicking physiological and pathological states. RESULTS Obese‐derived EVs exhibited distinct lipid profiles, particularly in lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and sphingomyelin (SM) species. Functional assays demonstrated that lipid identity and concentration critically influenced Aβ aggregation kinetics. DISCUSSION Our study reveals that obesity‐associated EV lipids modulate Aβ aggregation, linking adipose metabolism to AD pathology. These findings support lipid‐targeted strategies as potential therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. Highlights  Human adipose‐derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) from obese individuals exhibit distinct lipidomic profiles. EV lipids modulate amyloid‐β (Aβ) 40 and Aβ42 aggregation in a lipid‐type‐ and concentration‐dependent manner. Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and sphingomyelin (SM) species from obese EVs significantly deregulate Aβ fibrillization in vitro. EV lipid cargo links peripheral metabolic state to amyloid pathology in Alzheimer's disease. adipocyte‐derived extracellular vesicles Alzheimer's disease Aβ fibrillization exosome‐enriched extracellular vesicles lipid homeostasis lipidomics obesity NIH 10.13039/100000002 R01AG057635 R01CA238727 U01CA253553 T.

We then systematically profiled and quantified the full range of lipids detected in the isolated EVs using multidimensional mass spectrometry and advanced lipidomics analysis to annotate, quantify, and identify lipid species with pathophysiological relevance. Subsequently, we investigate how specific EV‐derived lipids influence the aggregation dynamics of human Aβ peptides to reveal new insights into the intersection of metabolic dysfunction and neurodegenerative risk. 2 METHODS 2.1 Human subjects and adipose tissue collection Subcutaneous (SQA) and visceral (VA) adipose tissues were collected from lean and obese individuals (Supporting Information Table 1 Adipose tissue samples were harvested intraoperatively at the surgical site near the umbilicus. Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue was obtained via a 3–4 cm skin incision (approximately 1 cm in depth), followed by aspiration with a small liposuction cannula under sterile conditions and local anesthesia (1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine). All procedures were performed by experienced surgical collaborators at The Ohio State University (OSU) clinical research center. Between 5 and10 grams of tissue were collected from each participant and processed within 60 min of excision. Upon collection, samples were divided for two distinct applications. One portion was immediately flash‐frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C for lipidomic analysis. The remaining tissue was transferred into ice‐cold sterile saline and promptly transported to the laboratory for adipocyte isolation and subsequent EV extraction. To maintain sterility throughout processing, samples were placed in sterile containers filled with prechilled sterile media and handled exclusively under a laminar flow hood. Adipocytes and the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) were isolated by collagenase I digestion of finely minced adipose tissue, following previously established protocols.  38 RESEARCH IN CONTEXT   Systematic review  Interpretation  Future directions 2.2 Isolation of human adipocyte‐derived EVs Exosome‐enriched EVs were isolated from human adipocytes for lipidomic analysis and in vivo studies. Human adipocytes were isolated from subcutaneous adipose tissue samples as described above. After isolation, adipocytes were washed and cultured in serum‐free maintenance medium (DMEM/F‐12 supplemented with 25 µg/mL insulin and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) at 37°C for 16–20 h in 6‐well plates (3 mL/well). This serum‐free condition was used to eliminate lipid contamination from fetal bovine serum (FBS) and ensure the purity of EVs for downstream applications. After incubation, culture supernatants were collected and cleared of cellular debris by sequential low‐speed centrifugation. To improve EV yield and scalability, exosome‐enriched EVs were isolated using tangential flow filtration (TFF), followed by ultrafiltration to concentrate the preparations. The resulting EVs reached concentrations of approximately 10 12 All EV isolation and characterization procedures adhered to the guidelines of the International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV). Characterization of human adipocyte‐derived EVs was performed using microfluidic resistive pulse sensing (MRPS) to assess particle size and concentration, immunomagnetic bead capture for exosomal surface markers, and Western blotting for adipocyte‐specific and exosomal proteins. 2.3 In vivo visualization of EV distribution For in vivo tracing in mice, EVs were isolated from mouse adipose tissue using a modified protocol incorporating collagenase II digestion. The purified EVs were labeled with the ExoGlow™‐Vivo EV Labeling Kit (Cat # EXOGV900A‐1) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and subsequently administered via tail vein injection at a dose of 6.55 × 10⁹ particles per mouse. Fluorescence imaging was performed using an IVIS (In Vivo Imaging System) to visualize EV biodistribution. 2.4 Lipidomics Lipid species were analyzed using multidimensional mass spectrometry‐based shotgun lipidomics approach.  39  40 For shotgun lipidomics, the lipid extract was further diluted to a total lipid concentration of ∼2 pmol/µL. The mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (TSQ Altis, Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) and a hybrid quadrupole‐Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q‐Exactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA), both equipped with an automated nanospray ion source device (TriVersa NanoMate, Advion Bioscience Ltd., Ithaca, NY) as described previously.  41 The data processing and analysis was performed based on the principles of shotgun lipidomics such as ion peak selection, baseline correction, isotope effect correction, etc.  39  42  43 2 1 2 3 FIGURE 1 Lipidomic profiling of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from lean and obese individuals.

Scatter plot showing the percentage reduction of major lipid classes in EVs ( x y 2.5 Outlier detection analysis To identify potential outlier samples from global lipidomic profiles, the Isolation Forest algorithm was applied using default hyperparameters. This unsupervised anomaly detection method is designed for high‐dimensional data and operates by randomly partitioning the feature space; samples that require fewer splits to be isolated are assigned higher anomaly scores. The algorithm is nonparametric, robust to noise, and does not assume a specific data distribution. To evaluate the influence of the identified outlier on downstream analyses, sensitivity analyses were performed by comparing results with and without the inclusion of outlier (Lean 1). This approach enabled validation of the robustness of major lipidomic findings and ensured that conclusions were not driven by a single data point. 2.6 Reagent preparation of ThT assay Amyloid‐ β40 and 42, ultra pure, with NaOH, recombinant human (Sigma, #AG964 & AG970) were dissolved in 1% NH 4 For the lipid details, sodium oleate (Sigma, #07501), sodium palmitate (Sigma, #P9767), Brain SM (Avanti, #860062P), egg SM (Avanti, #860061P), milk SM (Avanti, #860063P), egg  lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) (Lyso PC; Avanti, #830071P), 18:0 LPC (Lyso PC; Avanti, #855775), 16:0‐20:4 phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (Avanti, #850759C), 16:0‐18:1 PE (Avanti, #850757P), C18(Plasm)‐18:1 PE (Avanti, #852758P), and C18(Plasm)‐20:4 PE in ethanol (Cayman, #37137). Stock solutions of sodium palmitate and sodium oleate (100 mM) were prepared by dissolving the fatty acid powders in ethanol, followed by brief sonication cycles (10 s per pulse, 200 W) on ice. Sonication was continued until the mixture became uniformly cloudy, indicating thorough dispersion. The stock solutions were protected from light and stored at 4°C. Prior to use, aliquots were prewarmed to 60°C and briefly sonicated again. For details, please refer to the previously published method.  44 For all lipids, those provided in powder form were directly dissolved in molecular‐grade ethanol (Sigma, #E7023) to 100 mM as stock. For lipids supplied in chloroform, the solvent was first evaporated under a gentle nitrogen stream, and the resulting lipid film was redissolved in an equivalent volume of ethanol. During this process, sonication was applied to facilitate complete dispersion of the lipids in ethanol. Prior to use, aliquots and lipids in ThT‐reaction buffers were briefly sonicated again. Lipid concentrations reflecting human pathophysiological states were obtained from the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) along with relevant literature sources. To facilitate direct comparison, all concentration values were standardized to µM units, consistent with plasma lipid data. For brain‐derived measurements, the following conversion principles were applied: For values reported as nmol/mg protein, concentrations were converted to µM using the formula: nmol/mg protein × brain protein content (28‐54 mg/g)  45  46 For values reported as nmol/g brain wet weight, the conversion formula was: nmol/g × brain density (1.03 kg/L)  46 2.7 Fibrillization kinetics assays To identify an optimal assay buffer for monitoring Aβ fibrillization in the presence of various lipid components using ThT, three buffer systems were evaluated: Buffer A: 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, and pH 7.2 Buffer B: 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and pH 7.2 Buffer C: 10 mM phosphate, 150 mM NaCl, and pH 8.0 Buffer C was ultimately selected as the optimal condition based on signal consistency and reproducibility. Fibrillization assays were conducted in 384‐well nonbinding surface microplates (Greiner, #781903), with a final reaction volume of 40 µL per well. The assay mixture included the following components: Lipid samples: 4 µL of ethanol‐dissolved lipids added per well, with serial dilutions ranging from 1X to 1/1024X. Buffer C: used as the base buffer in all wells ThT: added from a 200 µM stock to a final concentration of 20 µM Aβ42: added last into the reaction mixture from a 200 µM stock to a final concentration of 20 µM Negative control dyes: morin and phenol red, each added at 20 µM final from 200 µM stocks Control groups were configured as follows: Blank: Buffer C only NTC (no template control): Buffer C + ThT Positive control: Buffer C + ThT + Aβ42 Negative control: Buffer C + ThT + Aβ42 + phenol red + morin Fluorescence‐based aggregation assays were performed using a BioTek Synergy H1 plate reader (Agilent, #1623193). Reactions were incubated at 37°C with fluorescence readings taken every 5 minutes. Prior to each read, the plate was subjected to a 20‐second double‐orbital shake. ThT fluorescence was measured with excitation at 440 nm and emission at 484 nm. Background subtraction was performed using the NTC wells containing only buffer and ThT. 2.8 Kinetic data presentation and statistics To quantify the effects of different lipids on Aβ40 and Aβ42 ThT fluorescence signal and aggregation kinetics over time, a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied using the area under the curve (AUC) as the within‐subject factor. For each sample, raw fluorescence intensity–time curves collected at equally spaced time points were summarized by AUC, capturing the overall response magnitude. As all samples were measured at identical intervals (each 5 minutes), AUC values were mathematically equivalent to mean relative fluorescence unit (RFU) up to a constant factor, allowing valid group‐level comparisons. One‐way ANOVA was then performed on AUC values to assess differences between lipid treatment groups. Outliers were identified and excluded using a leave‐one‐out z‐score method, in which each replicate was compared to others within the same group at each time point. Replicates exhibiting consistently elevated deviations across the time course were removed. This QC step was applied to all lipid/Aβ conditions, each of which included at least duplicate or triplicate measurements for statistical analysis. This approach preserved the advantages of repeated measurements in minimizing within‐group variability while allowing a straightforward assessment of group effects on cumulative or average response. Results were reported as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) for each condition. Post hoc comparisons were conducted using Dunnett's test, comparing each treatment group to the positive control. p p p p p p 3 RESULTS 3.1 EV purification and quality control (QC) EVs mediate crosstalk between adipose tissue and the brain  21 S1A S1B,C  47 Isolated EVs then underwent standard QC following established protocols.  48  49 S1D S1E S1F  50  48  49 3.2 Lipidomic profiling We performed the multidimensional mass spectrometry‐based lipidomics for the EVs derived from both lean and obese individuals (Supporting Information Table 2 1A 1B,C To investigate sample‐level deviations observed in EV lipidomic clustering (Figure 1A 1 1D–E S2A–E The correlation heatmap reveals distinct clustering patterns among lipid species in lean and obese EVs, indicating obesity‐associated reorganization of lipid coregulation networks (Figure 1F 4 1F 5 Furthermore, the clear separation of LPC and SM between lean and obese groups across various lipid classes indicates significant differences in EV lipid composition that remain consistent irrespective of Lean 1 inclusion (Figure 1G S2F S2F 1H To determine the extent to which EVs reflect the lipid composition of adipose tissue (Supporting Information Table 3 2A 2B 2C In the network association analysis, phospholipids such as PC, PA, and LPE exhibit strong interconnections in EVs (Figure 2D 2E 2F 2G 2I 2G–H 2I These findings indicate that EVs reflect the lipidomic profile of adipose tissue to a certain extent, with selective lipid enrichment and preserved network associations. This reinforces the hypothesis that EVs serve as lipid carriers facilitating adipose–brain crosstalk. 3.3 Aβ fibrillization evaluation The aforementioned lipid components in EVs derived from human adipocytes primarily consist of phospholipids and SM. Regardless of lipid class, all contain fundamental fatty acid chains. Our systematic profiling of EVs and adipose tissue revealed that both are enriched in unsaturated fatty acid chains (Figure S2G–I 3A FIGURE 3 In vivo and in vitro models of amyloid‐β (Aβ) aggregation and modulation by palmitic acid.

The process involves dynamic interconversion between aggregation species and spatial localization across cellular compartments. (B) Illustration of in vitro Aβ aggregation in a purified, cell‐free system, monitored by thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence.

Different ThT fluorescence curves (dashed lines) represent modulation of fibrillization kinetics under various experimental conditions. (C) Classification of fatty acids based on the number of double bonds (n_DB). Fatty acids (FAs) are categorized into saturated fatty acids (SFAs; n_DB = 0), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs; n_DB = 1), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; n_DB > 1). Representative examples of each class are shown: palmitic acid (16:0) as an SFA, oleic acid (18:1) as a MUFA, and linoleic acid (18:2) as a PUFA.

Statistical approach consistent with Methods Section 2.8 p # p p /# p /## p /### p /#### To ensure a high‐purity background, we employed an in vitro ThT fluorescence assay to assess the lipid‐type‐specific effects on Aβ fibrillization (Figure 3B 3A,B  51  52  53 Given these limitations, the lipid concentrations used in this study were primarily guided by reported physiological and pathophysiological levels in human plasma. Where available, we also compiled absolute concentration data from human brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lipidomics to provide a more comprehensive frame of reference. Together, these datasets offer a valuable basis for interpreting the relevance of lipid exposures to Aβ aggregation dynamics. Based on our analysis (Figure S2G–I 3C 3.4 Fatty acids and Aβ fibrillization Palmitic acid, also known as hexadecanoic acid, is one of the most common saturated long‐chain fatty acids (C16:0) in mammals, comprising approximately 21%–30% (molar) of human depot fat. In healthy adults, the blood concentration of palmitic acid can reach 2360 ± 430 µM in males and 2500 ± 630 µM in females,  54  55  56  57 3D–G 3D,E 3F,G Before examining the effects of additional lipid species, several methodological considerations warrant clarification to aid in the interpretation of the Aβ aggregation data. The apparent lack of sharply defined lag, growth, and plateau phases (Figure 3D y S3A 3D In our optimized assay system (Method section 2.7), Aβ aggregation proceeds more rapidly than conventional chronic protocols which typically span 20–150 hours.  58  59 3D 3D In the Aβ aggregation assay, area under the curve (AUC) quantifies the overall extent of Aβ aggregation over time, as reflected by the integrated kinetic fluorescence signal. To assess overall Aβ aggregation under different lipid concentrations, AUC could be calculated by numerical integration of relative fluorescence unit(RFU) over time using the trapezoidal rule, a method well‐suited for discrete, uniformly spaced time‐series data. Since fluorescence measurements were collected at consistent 5‐minute intervals, the AUC is effectively proportional to the cumulative RFU values, and their average reliably reflects aggregation kinetics across conditions (Figure 3E To address potential concerns regarding nonzero initial baselines—a consequence of preaggregation during sample handling prior to the first readout—we reconstructed simulated curves by extrapolating back to the actual reaction start time (Figure S3B Oleic acid, also known as octadecenoic acid, is a widely distributed and abundant long‐chain monounsaturated fatty acid (C18:1, omega‐9). In healthy adults, oleic acid concentrations range from 11.42 ± 1.67 to 2135.4 ± 665.5 µM ( n  55  60  60  56  57 S3C,D S3C,D S3C,D S3E–F In the experiments described above, the convergent finding is that both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids can promote Aβ fibrillization at relatively high concentrations approaching lipotoxic conditions. Notably, the same fatty acid exerts differential effects on Aβ40 and Aβ42 aggregation. A divergent observation is that palmitic acid, the most abundant saturated fatty acid in vivo, does not influence baseline Aβ aggregation at physiological concentrations. Our study expands the known benefits of unsaturated fatty acids. In addition to their classical antioxidant effects—attributed to the presence double bonds—we observed that their lipid characteristics confer an additional advantage: at physiological concentrations (100–200 µM), unsaturated fatty acids can suppress the spontaneous fibrillization of Aβ40. 3.5 SM and Aβ fibrillization SM exhibited pronounced deregulation in our human EV lipidomics profiling (Figure 1G,H  61 Among these, SM (23:0) is the least studied in terms of physiological and pathological concentrations, with limited reports indicating a plasma level of 7 ± 2.7 µM.  62  63  64  65  62 In human CSF, SM (16:0) and SM (18:0) have been detected at concentrations of 0.336  ±  0.109 and 0.340  ±  0.154 µM,  66  67 In our ThT‐based fibrillization assays, SM 23:0 significantly enhanced Aβ aggregation at higher concentrations, including at physiologically relevant levels near 7 µM (Figure 4B–E 4D,E FIGURE 4 Experimental kinetics of amyloid‐β (Aβ) aggregation in the presence of milk sphingomyelin.

Statistical approach consistent with Methods Section 2.8 # p p /# p /## p /### p /#### In contrast, SM 16:0 consistently promoted Aβ aggregation across both high and low concentration ranges (Figure S4 S5 These findings suggest that certain sphingomyelin species, particularly SM (23:0), can significantly inhibit Aβ42 fibrillization at relatively low, physiologically relevant concentrations, potentially contributing to the attenuation of AD‐related amyloid pathology. In contrast, SM (18:0) and SM (16:0) did not exhibit such inhibitory effects under similar conditions. This highlights that, despite sharing a common sphingomyelin backbone, variations in acyl chain length and saturation can result in markedly different impacts on Aβ aggregation dynamics. The observed differential effects may be attributed to several factors. Longer, fully saturated acyl chains such as those in SM (23:0) may confer distinct biophysical properties, such as increased membrane rigidity or altered lipid packing, that influence Aβ interaction at the lipid interface. Alternatively, the ability of specific SM species to modulate local microenvironments—such as surface hydrophobicity or curvature stress—may selectively affect Aβ42's conformational transition and nucleation kinetics. 3.6 LPC and Aβ fibrillization Lysophospholipids are bioactive lipids formed as intermediates during the dynamic turnover of membrane phospholipids.  68  69  70  71  72 In our study, EV lipidomic profiling revealed distinct, nonoverlapping clusters and marked deregulation of LPC species between obese and lean individuals (Figure 1G,H 5A  10  73  74  66 FIGURE 5 Experimental kinetics of amyloid‐β (Aβ) aggregation in the presence of egg lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC; Lyso PC).

To explore the contribution of lipids beyond those enriched in EVs, we included another Zwitterionic lipid, PE in our Aβ aggregation assays (Figures 6 S7‐S9  75  76  77 FIGURE 6 Experimental kinetics of amyloid‐β (Aβ) aggregation in the presence of C18(Plasm)‐20:4 phosphatidylethanolamine (PE).

Statistical approach consistent with Methods Section 2.8 # p p /# p /## p /### p /#### Plasmalogen PEs, defined by a vinyl ether linkage at the sn‐1 position, are enriched in the brain and have been shown to protect against oxidative stress.  78  79  80 6A According to concentration estimates from the HMDB, C18(Plasm)‐20:4 PE ranges from approximately 3.717  ±  0.679 to 28.290  ±  21.925 µM in the human circulatory system, while C18(Plasm)‐18:1 PE ranges from 2.160  ±  0.374 to 27.865  ±  22.648 µM. For diacyl PE species, concentrations estimated via MetaboAnalyst indicate that 16:0/20:4 PE ranges from 6.002  ±  2.136 to 52.133  ±  21.658 µM, and 16:0/18:1 PE ranges from 3.660  ±  1.734 to 41.967  ±  12.350 µM. In human brain, all four PE species—C18(Plasm)‐20:4 PE, C18(Plasm)‐18:1 PE, 16:0/20:4 PE, and 16:0/18:1 PE—were detected across multiple brain regions, including the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, as well as the cerebellum.  81  81  81  81 In our ThT‐based fibrillization assays, both C18(Plasm)‐20:4 PE and C18(Plasm)‐18:1 PE markedly promoted Aβ40 and Aβ42 aggregation at supraphysiological concentrations (Figures 6B–E S7A–D 6B–C S7A,B 6D–E S7C,D S8A–B and S9A,B S9A,B S8C,D S9C,D These results indicate that both the chemical structure and concentration of PE species critically influence Aβ aggregation dynamics. Plasmalogen PEs exhibit isoform‐specific and concentration‐dependent effects—enhancing Aβ40 aggregation while suppressing Aβ42 aggregation at physiological levels. In contrast, diacyl PEs (e.g., 16:0/20:4 and 16:0/18:1 PE) consistently promote Aβ40 aggregation, with 16:0/18:1 PE displaying a clear dose‐dependent response. However, their effects on Aβ42 aggregation appear less predictable. Collectively, these findings suggest that lipid structural remodeling may selectively modulate amyloidogenic processes in AD. 4 DISCUSSION Obesity is increasingly recognized as one of the most prominent modifiable risk factors for dementia, including AD.  2  6  82  83  84  21  7  8 In this study, we first employed an EV tracking strategy combined with organ‐specific analysis to evaluate the biodistribution of adipose‐derived EVs in the brain (Figure S1B,C  48  85  86 S1D S1E S1F Next, we conducted a comprehensive lipidomics profiling of these EVs. Although most prior studies have focused on murine adipocyte‐derived EVs,  86 1H 1G These lipids are known to participate in a variety of intracellular processes and extracellular signaling events. Elevated levels of LPC, for example, are associated with cellular damage, potentially through mechanisms such as altering membrane permeability and disrupting osmotic balance.  87  88  89  90  91 Because adipocyte‐derived EVs can penetrate the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and accumulate in the brain parenchyma,  21  21  33  92 By contrast, our pure lipid–Aβ system allows for direct and specific interactions with minimal confounders, likely explaining the accelerated fibrillization kinetics observed. Interestingly, the ThT fluorescence curves exhibited a rapid increase reminiscent of seeded or secondary nucleation‐like aggregation, rather than the slower kinetics typically seen with spontaneous Aβ monomer aggregation.  93 A growing body of literature supports the notion that Aβ exhibits strong affinity for lipid molecules.  18  32  33  94 4.1 Concentration‐dependent lipid effects The influence of lipid concentration on Aβ aggregation varies significantly among lipid types. Certain lipids exhibited a clear dose‐dependent promotion of Aβ aggregation, as reflected by stepwise changes in kinetic parameters such as lag time ( T lag T 1/2 T grow Others showed less predictable patterns, signifying complex lipid–peptide interactions. A consistent observation across multiple lipid species, including oleic acid (Figure S3 5 S4 S5  33  95  96  97  20  36  37  98 4.2 Isoform‐specific responses The same lipid species could have either similar or distinct effects on Aβ40 and Aβ42 aggregation, suggesting that structural differences between the two isoforms may influence their lipid‐binding properties. It is well established that Aβ neurotoxicity follows the hierarchy of nonfibrillar oligomers > fibrils > monomers,  37 From a mechanistic standpoint, our findings highlight the critical role of lipid composition and concentration in modulating Aβ aggregation dynamics and, by extension, AD pathology. Interactions between lipid molecules and Aβ can facilitate pathological aggregation through biophysical processes such as phase separation and condensate formation,  33 Moreover, these findings carry important translational implications. As EVs and lipid‐based carriers gain traction as promising therapeutic delivery systems capable of crossing the BBB, rational design of their lipid constituents becomes critical. Ensuring biocompatibility and target specificity must be balanced against the risk of inadvertently driving Aβ aggregation or exacerbating neurotoxic pathways. By demonstrating that even subtle shifts in lipid composition or concentration can meaningfully alter Aβ aggregation outcomes, our work underscores the necessity for precise lipid profiling and engineering in such delivery platforms. Finally, the lipid–Aβ specificity observed here underscores that maintaining tightly regulated lipid metabolic homeostasis in the brain is pivotal for mitigating or preventing neurodegeneration. As metabolic dysfunction and obesity continue to rise globally, their intersection with neurodegenerative diseases demands closer scrutiny. Our study contributes a foundational understanding of how discrete lipid species, present at various concentrations, can shape Aβ assembly and possibly translate into altered neuronal toxicity. Although our findings provide molecular insights using a well‐controlled pure system, we acknowledge that the current study does not establish whether EV lipid differences directly contribute to Aβ aggregation in the brain. Future studies incorporating appropriate animal models, allowing the disentanglement of potential confounding effects, will be essential to determine the physiological relevance of EV‐mediated lipid–Aβ interactions in the context of AD pathology.
