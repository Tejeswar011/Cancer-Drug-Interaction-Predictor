Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major global health burden, ranking among the most commonly diagnosed malignancies and leading causes of cancer‐related deaths worldwide [ 1 2 In this context, natural compounds have gained increasing attention as promising agents for cancer prevention and treatment [ 3 4 5 γ δ γ δ 6 7 8 9 The present study is aimed at investigating the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of γ δ Mechanistically, γ δ 7 1 10 κ β 11 14 Beyond their direct anticancer activity, γ δ 15 Nevertheless, several challenges remain in translating T3 into clinical applications. These include limitations in bioavailability, the need to define optimal dosing and evaluation of long‐term safety and interactions with standard therapies [ 16 17 19 Moreover, emerging data suggest that the anticancer efficacy of T3 can vary by cancer type, cell line and experimental conditions. In CRC, γ δ 20 23 Taken together, this study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the anticancer role of T3 by specifically evaluating γ δ 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Cell Culture Conditions Four human CRC cell lines (HCC2998, HCT116, SW48 and Caco2) were obtained from the cell repository of International Medical University (IMU), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Cells were maintained under standard culture conditions at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO 2 2.2. Determination of the Half‐Maximal Inhibitory Concentration (IC 50 For viability analysis, cells were seeded in 96‐well plates at a density of 5.0 × 10 3 3 μ γ δ % Cell viability was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit‐8 (CCK‐8) assay (DOJINDO, Kumamoto, Japan), and absorbance was measured at 450 nm (reference 650 nm) using a Tecan microplate reader (Switzerland). The values were calculated using GraphPad Prism (v9.5.1) from normalised cell viability data. Additional reagents used included absolute ethanol (BDH, AnalaR), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma–Aldrich) and UltraPure DNase/RNase‐free distilled water (QIAGEN, United States). 2.3. RNA Extraction and Gene Expression Analysis (Real‐Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT‐qPCR)) Total RNA was extracted using the PureNA Fastspin Total RNA kit (Research Instruments Pte Ltd., Singapore), following the manufacturer’s protocol with slight modifications. Briefly, cells (2.0 × 10 6 μ Gene expression was assessed using the Luna Universal One‐Step RT‐qPCR Kit (New England Biolabs, United States), which integrates reverse transcription and quantitative PCR in a single‐tube format. The reactions were conducted with the following thermal cycling conditions: reverse transcription at 55°C for 10 min, initial denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, followed by 40–45 cycles of denaturation (95°C, 10 s) and extension (60°C, 30 s), with final melt curve analysis from 60 to 95°C. Data were normalised to GAPDH − ΔΔ GAPDH 1 7 Table 1 Common genes selected for RT‐qPCR validation studies.

Annexin V–FITC/PI Apoptosis Assay Apoptosis induction was quantified using the Annexin V–FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences, United States) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells (1 × 10 6 γ δ 50 6 Each sample (100 μ μ μ μ Early apoptotic cells were identified as Annexin V‐positive and PI‐negative, indicating externalisation of phosphatidylserine without loss of membrane integrity. Late apoptotic cells exhibited dual positivity for both Annexin V and PI, reflecting advanced stages of apoptosis accompanied by compromised membrane permeability. Necrotic cells were characterised by Annexin V‐negative and PI‐positive staining, consistent with the loss of membrane integrity without prior apoptotic signalling. In contrast, viable cells remained negative for both Annexin V and PI, indicating intact membranes and the absence of apoptotic features. This dual‐staining method allowed for discrimination between apoptotic and necrotic populations based on phosphatidylserine externalisation and membrane integrity. 2.5. Flow Cytometric Cell Cycle Arrest Analysis HCC2998 CRC cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 10 6 γ δ 50 Cell cycle profiling was performed using the BD Cycletest Plus DNA Reagent Kit (Becton, Dickinson and Company, United States), following the manufacturer’s protocol. A minimum of 5 × 10 5 Subsequently, isolated nuclei were stoichiometrically stained with PI, a DNA‐intercalating fluorochrome that binds quantitatively to double‐stranded DNA. Flow cytometric acquisition was carried out on a BD FACScan cytometer equipped with electronic doublet discrimination and an FL2 detector (585/42 bandpass filter), optimised for PI emission (peak detection range: 564–606 nm). A minimum of 10,000 events per sample was collected. DNA content histograms were analysed using FlowJo v10 and modelled with a Dean–Jett–Fox algorithm to quantify the percentage of cells in G 0 1 2 3. Results 3.1.

This necrotic population was more prominent at later time points, suggesting that prolonged exposure to T3 may trigger secondary necrosis or direct membrane disruption, potentially due to mitochondrial damage or overwhelming oxidative stress. From a therapeutic perspective, the occurrence of necrosis may have dual implications. While it contributes to tumour cell clearance, necrosis is often accompanied by the release of damage‐associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that can provoke a local inflammatory response [ 51 γ δ The cell cycle arrest observed in T3‐treated HCC2998 cells underscores the cytostatic efficacy of γ δ δ 1 1 Cip1 Kip1 1 γ δ 10 2 γ δ 1 Our findings are consistent with numerous studies in the field, which have shown that T3, particularly γ δ 52 53 11 54 δ 55 δ 56 γ δ 57 δ 58 These findings are consistent with the broader body of literature on T3, which has demonstrated its ability to induce apoptosis through a variety of mechanisms, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and the inhibition of key survival pathways such as the NF‐ κ 59 γ c 60 β 61 The apoptotic effects likely involve the modulation of various molecular targets and signalling pathways, including cell cycle regulators, transcription factors, angiogenesis factors and metastasis‐related proteins [ 62 63 δ δ 64 While our study focused on γ δ γ δ 65 γ δ γ δ 24 γ δ One of the significant contributions of this study is its demonstration of the dual role of T3 in both inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis. These two processes are critical in the context of cancer treatment, as effective therapies must not only halt the growth of cancer cells but also actively promote their death. The ability of T3 to achieve both objectives highlights its potential as a standalone therapy or as an adjuvant to existing treatments. For example, previous research has shown that T3 can increase the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents and dietary components by sensitising cancer cells to their effects, potentially allowing for lower doses of chemotherapy and reducing side effects [ 66 Despite these promising findings, several challenges remain in translating the anticancer effects of T3 into clinical practice. One major obstacle is their bioavailability, as the absorption of T3 and TCP in the intestine varies from 20% to 80% of the total ingested amount, which is lower than that of other fat–soluble vitamins [ 36 67 68 5.
