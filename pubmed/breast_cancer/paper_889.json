This study evaluated specimen PET-CT imaging for IMA in 41 patients undergoing BCS. Specimen PET-CT imaging was performed with the ß-CUBE/X-CUBE (MOLECUBES) or the AURA 10 (XEOS).

This approach offers better cosmetic outcomes, improved quality of life, and comparable survival rates (both overall survival and disease-free survival) compared to total mastectomy 1 3 4 1 5 6 7 8 Even in experienced hands, positive excision margins for invasive BC are found in approximately 20% (9% to 36%) of BCS cases at international breast care units 9 10 11 12 13 To avoid re-operations due to positive margins, a rapid and reliable method for intraoperative margin assessment (IMA) is needed. Traditionally, specimen radiography for non-palpable masses is used as the standard of care (SOC) IMA method but other techniques have been reported, including frozen section, intraoperative ultrasound, and micro-CT. The performance of these methods has been reviewed in recent meta-analyses 14 15 Here, we used a novel IMA technique: high-resolution Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography (PET-CT) specimen imaging with the use of 18 18 16 n The primary aim of this study is to (1) assess the diagnostic performance of specimen PET-CT as an IMA technique by comparing it to final histopathology in the largest patient cohort until now, involving multiple evaluating physicians. Additionally, the study aims to (2) determine its clinical value by comparing it to the SOC (i.e., specimen radiography for non-palpable specimens) and other established IMA methods. Further analyses examine the influence of physician experience and confidence levels. In short, the objective is to demonstrate the diagnostic performance and clinical value of specimen PET-CT, providing a foundation for further research that could support its clinical implementation. Results Descriptives Between June 2017 and December 2022, 49 patients were enrolled in this study, for which 41 cases were analyzed.

The interventions that were done in case of positive margins, were described Confidence level Confidence levels were analyzed across various parameters, with detailed findings presented in Supplementary Table 3 Discussion This study evaluated the diagnostic performance and clinical value of specimen PET-CT imaging for IMA in patients undergoing BCS. With a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 86%, specimen PET-CT accurately defined the margins in IDC tumors, the most common form of BC, representing 75.2% of all BC cases in Belgium 17 n The detailed analysis of the positive margins seen in the IDC cases, highlights the clinical value of specimen PET-CT imaging: out of 31 IDC cases, 9 had positive margins on final histopathology. With specimen PET-CT guidance, surgeons recommended cavity shaves in 8 of these 9 cases, resulting in a very low NNT of 4. This means that scanning 4 patients with specimen PET-CT and performing a cavity shave when indicated, could prevent one positive margin on final histopathology and thus avoid one re-operation. When comparing specimen PET-CT to the SOC (specimen radiography with a guide wire for non-palpable lesions), also a low NNT of 8 was found. This indicates that for every 8 patients scanned with specimen PET-CT, one positive margin (and potentially a re-operation) could be avoided compared to SOC. These findings show the clinical value of PET-CT in reducing positive margins and support further research to explore its broader use in BCS. Most importantly, in all 5 cases that needed a re-operation, all seven physicians recommended a cavity shave supported by the specimen PET-CT images. If this device was used intra-operatively, all re-operations could have been avoided. The safety and minimal workflow interruption of this technique are supported by the clear visualization of high [18 F]FDG uptake in every resected specimen, even with a 10-minute acquisition time and a reconstructed dose as low as 0.8 MBq/kg. Since the sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure can be performed during this 10-min scanning time, there is almost no interruption in the surgical flow. Second, the median activity for this 0.8 MBq/kg dose was only 15.1 kBq, indicating limited radiation exposure for the surgical team and histopathologist. Rep et al. 18 19 Recent large-scale systematic reviews highlight the sensitivity and specificity of other IMA techniques: ultrasound (72% and 78%), frozen section (81% and 97%), and specimen radiography (52% and 77%) 15 18 20 21 22 15 23 15 24 24 The primary challenge identified in this study is the accurate margin assessment for DCIS, ILC, and NACT cases, where the limited patient numbers hinder robust conclusions. Additionally, different uptake patterns in DCIS, ILC, and NACT cases imply the need for an adapted window setting, and so suggest adjustments to the interpretation flow. Here, only the invasive tumor mass was analyzed in both IDC and ILC cases, leaving any in-situ components unassessed. Therefore, future research should focus on training physicians to assess these in-situ components within invasive carcinomas as well. Another challenge is the potential interference of [18 F]FDG activity with SLN localization using the gamma probe to detect [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid. Improved results were observed with the 1-day protocol and use of patent blue. Future studies might also benefit from adjusting gamma probe settings to mitigate this issue. Although radiation exposure to staff and patients is limited (only 1/5 of a full body PET-CT dose is used), other IMA techniques, such as frozen section, offer zero or significantly lower radiation exposure. Device cost is another consideration, its justification hinges on cost-effectiveness analysis and prevention of re-operations. Important to note is that the potential of specimen PET-CT imaging extends beyond BC, with promising results observed in head-and-neck cancer 25 26 19 19 27 28 In conclusion, the findings of this study are promising, indicating that this novel IMA technique achieves high diagnostic performance in margin assessment and offers valuable support for BCS. To confirm these findings, a multicentric study (BrIMA) with a larger patient cohort for all subtypes, is ongoing. Methods Ethics and patient information The study was conducted in compliance with local and national regulations and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Council for Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. The study protocol and amendments were approved by an independent ethics committee or review board at the participating institution (Ghent University Hospital Ethics Committee, identifier EC/2017/0200); all patients provided written informed consent. The trial is registered since 20/01/2020 on ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT04343079 Eligible participants were females aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with early-stage invasive BC (T1-2, N0-1, ductal or lobular), and scheduled for BCS. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or lactation, diabetes, inflammatory BC, prior surgical treatment or radiotherapy of the affected breast, logistical infeasibility, i.e., appointment at the nuclear medicine department for radiotracer injection that would result in an unacceptable delay of surgery, and participation in other clinical trials. For an overview of these inclusion and exclusion criteria see Supplementary Table 4 Surgical procedure with specimen PET-CT imaging On the day of surgery, 40 patients received an intravenous administration of 4 MBq/kg of [ 18 18 99m Subsequently, BCS was performed. After excision, the radioactivity level of each specimen (in kBq) was measured with a VDC-404 dose calibrator (Veenstra Instruments, Joure, the Netherlands). Next, a high-resolution specimen PET-CT scan was performed. At the start of the study, only the preclinical MOLECUBES scanners (MOLECUBES, Ghent, Belgium) situated at the radiology department, were available ( n n n n n 16 5 During the specimen PET-CT imaging, the SLN procedure was conducted using a Neoprobe 2000 Gamma Detection System with an NPB14A 14 mm Bluetooth probe (Neoprobe Corporation, Dublin, OH). Throughout the study, interference with [ 18 99m In this study, the PET-CT images were not assessed intraoperatively. After imaging of the tumor specimen by the PET-CT, it was brought either first to the radiology department to perform a specimen radiography (in case of a guide wire localization), or directly to the histopathology department. At the histopathology department, the tumor margins were assessed following ASCO/CAP protocols 29 30 Image assessment The PET-CT images were interpreted postoperatively by seven physicians, who were blinded to the patient and the histopathological results. All physicians underwent interpretation training, which included: (1) learning the fundamentals of PET and CT, (2) training on interpreting specimen PET-CT images and assessing margins using an interpretation flow chart, and (3) practicing with test cases ( n 3 Fig. 3 Interpretation workflow. Visualization of the interpretation workflow. In this study, margins were evaluated as negative, (>1 mm margin free of tumor), close (≤1 mm margin free of tumor), or positive (tumor seen on the specimen margins). The physicians also assessed their confidence in margin evaluation (1 = not confident, 2 = limited confidence, or 3 = confident), identified the orientation of the closest margin and indicated if they would take a cavity shave. The window setting (red means a high uptake, purple/blue a low uptake) is set to 80% to optimize contrast and signal intensity for most tumor types. For invasive lobular carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in-situ, it is reduced to 50% based on our pilot study, which showed that a narrower window enhances visualization of their subtle, diffuse growth pattern and improves margin delineation. All specimen PET-CT images were visualized using AMIDE (Amide’s a Medical Image Data Examiner), an open-source software platform Statistics and image analysis Descriptive statistics were used to detail patient and tumor characteristics. In the analysis, the physicians were divided into predetermined subgroups depending on experience level: (1) no experience, i.e., one resident in gynecology who only received the image interpretation training (A.D.C), (2) limited experience, i.e., three breast surgeons who already had experience with interpreting specimen PET-CT images for study purposes (G.V., M.G., G.C.), and (3) experienced, i.e., two nuclear medicine physicians (K.M., B.B.) and one radiologist (P.V.) who have experience with PET and/or CT during their daily practice. All physicians work at Ghent University Hospital except for one breast surgeon from IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute in Milan (Italy). The sensitivity and specificity of the proposed method were calculated for each physician, using histopathology as the gold standard. Since the image interpretation focused on the main tumor lump, only invasive margins indicated by histopathology were included for invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) cases. Additionally, these metrics were determined based on varying levels of experience and different tumor types: IDC, ILC and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or a different treatment type: after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The analysis included an evaluation of close margins in two ways: first, when margins analyzed as ‘close’ were considered ‘positive’ (close = pos), and second, when margins analyzed as ‘close’ were considered ‘negative’ (close = neg). Ultimately, this approach allowed us to simplify the close margin outcomes into a final dichotomous variable, distinguishing clearly between positive and negative results. The level of confidence with respect to various types of tumors, the number of ‘close’ interpretations, and the number of cavity shaves that the physician ‘would take’ when a ‘close’ interpretation is made, were calculated as well. The activity of each specimen was recalculated to reflect the activity at 185 minutes post-injection, which is the average time between injection and PET acquisition. This was done for both 4 MBq/kg and 0.8 MBq/kg injection scenarios. Finally, the mean and median values of these recalculated activities were determined Supplementary information  Supplementary Material checklist Publisher’s note Supplementary information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41523-025-00818-8.
