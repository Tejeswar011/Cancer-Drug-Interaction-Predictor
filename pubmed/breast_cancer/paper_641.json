When older adults with CKD and their families face treatment decisions, clinicians should utilize walking speed to frame discussions of prognosis. Background Accurate mortality prediction can guide clinical care for older adults with CKD. Yet existing tools do not incorporate physical function, an independent predictor of death in older adults. We determined whether incorporating physical function measurements improve mortality prediction among older adults with CKD. Methods We included Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort participants who were 65 years and older, had eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 Results Among 2338 persons, mean age was 70±4 years, 43% were female, and 43% were Black. Mean eGFR was 42±13 ml/min per 1.73 m 2 Conclusions Among older adults with CKD, adding measures of physical function modestly improves mortality prediction.
