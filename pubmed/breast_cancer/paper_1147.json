We analyzed tDR expression in seven adult mouse tissues to explore tissue-specific tDR enrichment using a tDR-optimized library preparation methodology. We catalogued 26,901 unique nuclear tDRs (ntDRs) and 5114 mitochondrial tDRs (mtDRs). Clustering analysis segregated the tissues, with the spleen and lungs forming a distinct immune cluster. Tissue-versus-all and pairwise differential analysis showed the spleen harboring unique ntDRs and mtDRs. Tissue-enriched tDRs arose from specific isoacceptor and isodecoder tRNAs, independent of mature tRNA abundance, suggesting selective biogenesis rather than bulk turnover. G-quadruplex prediction revealed a pronounced enrichment of potentially quadruplex-forming ntDRs in the kidneys, heart, and spleen, predominantly derived from i-tRFs and tRF3 fragments, suggesting structure-dependent functions in immune regulation. We also benchmarked our library strategy against the PANDORA-seq method. Despite comparable or lower sequencing depth, our method detected ~3–10-fold more unique ntDRs and we observed a clearer representation of tRF-3 fragments and greater isotype diversity. Our tissue atlas and improved tDR sequencing method reveal extensive tissue-specific heterogeneity in tDR biogenesis, sequencing, and structure, providing a framework for understanding the context-dependent regulatory roles of tDRs. tRNA fragments G4 quadruplexes tDRs translation angiogenin epitranscriptome tRNA sequencing Japan society for the promotion of science (JSPS) 23H02741 This work was supported by The Japan society for the promotion of science (JSPS) kakenhi grant number 23H02741. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Background tRNA-derived small non-coding RNAs (tDRs) are central to a rapidly expanding research field [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 1 5 Most research performed on tDRs focused on their roles in cellular stress or diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and metabolic disorders [ 2 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 3 30 1 17 31 32 33 1 26 31 34 35 36 37 38 The Cancer Genome Atlas 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 43 41 48 49 2. Results 2.1. Global Patterns of tDRs Expression in Seven Mouse Tissues To explore the tissue-specific expression of tDRs, we used our previously published small RNA-seq dataset of seven different mouse tissues, with three biological replicates per tissue [ 49 49 41 48 49 50 41 48 50 51 To detect tDRs, we used tDRnamer [ 8 52 Figure 1 49 Figure 1 49 Supplementary Tables S1–S4 Examining the subclasses of all detected tDRs, the most abundant in ntDRs were tRF3b, i-tRFs, and 5′tiRNAs (5′ halves or tiRNA_5 in the plot) ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 The size distribution analysis revealed greater heterogeneity in ntDR lengths compared to mtDR lengths ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 In summary, tDRs expression reveals inter-tissue heterogeneity in variable aspects of tDRs such as source tRNAs and biogenesis. tDRs expression could also discriminate between different tissues as shown in the clustering data presented. 2.2. tDRs Show Tissue-Specific Enrichment Patterns To understand the different patterns of tDRs enrichment in tissues, we conducted differential tDR expression analysis, comparing each tissue to all other tissues (for example, brain vs. all, heart vs. all, etc.). To avoid the dilution of mtDRs patterns, we analyzed ntDRs and mtDRs separately. Analysis of differentially expressed ntDRs revealed that the tissue most divergent from others was the spleen ( Figure 3 Supplementary Figure S1A–D Figure 3 Figure 3 Supplementary Figure S1E–I Figure 3 Because the tissue vs. all approach may introduce bias from high inter-tissue variances, we used EdgeR to conduct a pairwise tissue vs. tissue differential tDRs expression analysis followed by quasi-likelihood post hoc analysis. In both the ntDRs analysis and the mtDRs analysis, the spleen was found to be the most diverse tissue; this finding is in agreement with the data shown for the tissue vs. all approach ( Supplementary Figure S2 Next, we determined which tDR subtypes were enriched in the tissue comparisons. Starting with ntDRs, the most abundant differentially expressed class in the brain vs. all comparison was i-tRFs followed by tRF3b, 5′tiRNAs, and tRF5c; meanwhile, in the spleen, the most abundant differentially expressed class was i-tRFs followed by tRF3b ( Figure 4 Supplementary Figure S3A–C Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Supplementary Figure S3D–F Supplementary Figure S4A–C 2.3. tDRs Enriched in Different Tissues Have Unique tRNA Origins To identify whether ntDRs enriched in different tissues originate from different tRNAs, we identified the isotype (amino acid decoding or isoacceptor tRNA) and the anticodon sequences of the parent tRNAs and conducted a Fisher’s exact test with Benjamin–Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) multiple test correction to identify the statistically significant odds that enriched the tDRs that originated from a specific tRNA isoacceptor ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Supplementary Figure S5A–F 49 53 53 49 Supplementary Figure S6 2.4. Highly Expressed Tissue-Resident tDRs Are Heterogeneous Our analysis to this point focused on the tissue-specific tDRs, given that we analyzed the upregulated tDRs in the tissue vs. all comparisons; thus, we then asked whether the highly expressed tDRs are uniform across tissues. We extracted the top 500 ntDRs by normalized read counts and analyzed them across tissues. We observed variations in the tDRs’ subclasses ( Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 49 Supplementary Figure S7 2.5. G4 Quadruplexes Forming tDRs Are Enriched in the Spleen tDRs functions have come under significant scrutiny in recent years [ 54 26 28 29 17 1 35 55 Figure 7 55 Figure 7 Figure 7 Analysis of the differentially expressed ntDRs (i.e., those with specific tissue enrichment in the tissue versus all comparisons) revealed that the kidneys, heart, and spleen are specifically enriched in potential rG4-forming ntDRs ( Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 In summary, the tDRs that are highly expressed and enriched in different tissues show the potential to form G4 quadruplexes. Previously, only stress-induced 5′tiRNAs were the subject of research focusing on the G4-quadruplex-forming potential of tDRs [ 17 31 2.6. Sequencing Methods Omitting RNA Deacetylation Skew Towards 5′tiRNA Fragments To evaluate the effect of the different steps of small RNA preparation on the final library output, we analyzed mouse tissue samples sequenced by PANDORA-seq [ 41 R Figure 1 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 41 49 Figure 8 Figure 1 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 In summary, our analysis shows a 3–10-fold increase in tDR detection using our optimized tRNA/tDR sequencing approach in comparison with the previously used method. Such an improvement, achieved using a straightforward method that can be easily adopted, shall improve our understanding of tDRs biology and enable explorations of their origins and molecular functions beyond what was previously achieved. 3. Discussion In this analysis, we demonstrate the significant heterogeneity in nuclear and mitochondrial tDRs across different tissues. Importantly, tDRs are heterogeneous at many levels, including source tRNAs, size, site of cleavage/biogenesis, subclass, structure, and potential tRNA modifications in their sequences from the source tRNAs. We also noted that, while the spleen had the lowest number of detected tDRs, it displayed the greatest diversity. tDRs have been implicated in regulating post-stroke immune responses and can replace microRNAs to regulate immune cell functions [ 56 49 53 57 17 31 58 An important step we achieved herein that will aid in understanding tDRs biology is the great improvement in tDR detection compared to previous methods, i.e., an increase of up to tenfold was achieved compared with previous methods [ 41 48 It is important to note that, to fully understand tDRs biogenesis and function, given their extreme heterogeneity, more robust datasets are needed. In addition to robust tDR profiling, combining tDR sequencing with approaches to map tRNA or tDR modifications, G4 quadruplexes formation, or potential RBPs bindings at a large scale will be necessary if we are to decipher the functions of tDRs as well as the regulation of their biogenesis. To date, the biogenesis of tDRs is not fully understood. Several enzymes apart from angiogenin contribute to tRNA cleavage and regulate mRNA translation through modulating codon-biased translation [ 9 11 59 4. Methods Datasets: 49 GSE144666  Data analysis:  Read processing and tDR calling: tDRnamer, standalone version [ 8 https://github.com/UCSC-LoweLab/tDRnamer https://github.com/jstjohn/SeqPrep To analyze tDRnamer output, we used a custom R script that first gathered the read counts for detected tDRs to create a count matrix as well as an annotation file containing all the tDRs’ information, such as their start and end positions, their sequences, and their source tRNAs. tDRs were filtered by length to ensure that tDRs with lengths between 15 and 50 nucleotides were retained for the downstream analysis.  Normalization and differential analysis: EdgeR [ 60 2  tDR subclass assignment: Each tDR was assigned to a subclass from its Sprinzl start/end: 5′ tRFs (tRF5a/b/c), 3′ tRFs (tRF3a/b, plus tRF3c when starting in the anticodon loop and not reaching the CCA), and 5′/3′ halves (tiRNA-5/tiRNA-3). tDRs covering the anticodon region and extending towards the D- and T-arms were assigned as internal tRFs (i-tRFs). Fragments were categorized as intronic when the positions were negative or when they were marked as intronic by tDRnamer. These rules are reflective of current conventions and were implemented in our R classifier.  Sparse least square regression analysis (sPLS-DA): sPLS-DA analysis was conducted using the mixOmics [ 61  Analysis of tDRs length distribution: Analysis of length distribution was performed using the Sprinzl start/end information provided by tDRnamer. A weighted Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to compare between different conditions for statistical significance in enriched tDRs lengths.  Sprinzl position coverage maps: For upregulated tDRs, each significant tDR was expanded to its covered Sprinzl positions (from the mature tRNA start to the end). We then summed the CPM over the tDRs at each position (1–76) per tissue, then row-normalized these to obtain a relative coverage (0–1) and plotted positions 1–76 on the x-axis using the ComplexHeatmap package in R  Isotype and anticodon enrichment among differentially expressed tDRs: For each tissue, we compared the number of significant/selected tDRs vs. the non-significant tDRs per isotype (or anticodon) against the tissue-specific background using Fisher’s exact test with BH FDR correction. We expand each tDR annotation to all its annotated source tRNAs and tested the set membership. We reported the odds ratios and FDR values and visualized the significant categories with dot-plots and heatmaps. Parent tRNA copy (isodecoder) enrichment To resolve isodecoder specificity, each tDR was mapped to all annotated parental tRNA copies (from tDRnamer). Within each tissue, we aggregated TMM-CPM for UP vs. non-UP tDRs per copy and tested the enrichment using a CPM-weighted Fisher’s exact test and BH FDR correction. The results are shown as log 2 10  Pairwise differential expression with edgeR quasi-likelihood (QL) omnibus F-test with post hoc contrasts: Raw tDR read counts were analyzed with edgeR using its quasi-likelihood (QL) generalized linear model (GLM) framework. The library sizes were normalized by the TMM method, and all models were fit to the negative binomial mean–variance family with gene-specific dispersion estimates, which were stabilized by empirical Bayes shrinkage and robust fitting. For the multi-group comparison across tissues/conditions, we fit an intercept-based design ~ group, where the group is a factor with levels: ⟨Brain, Heart, …⟩. (Here, baseline = the first level; “Control” was set as baseline when present.) For feature i in sample j, the model was as follows: l o g μ i j =  l o g N j + α i + x j T β i , μ i j Nj x j αi βi ϕi QL To determine whether any group effect was present for a given tDR, we used the omnibus QL F-test (glmQLFTest) across all non-intercept group coefficients. This provides an ANOVA-like global test per tDR that accounts for count over-dispersion and uncertainty in dispersion estimates. The resulting p To localize the differences, we performed post hoc pairwise QL contrasts between all the unordered group pairs (e.g., Brain vs. Heart, …) with makeContrasts/glmQLFTest. For each contrast, we report log2 fold-change (logFC), p Unless stated otherwise, the figures use only normalized counts for plotting; all statistical testing was performed on the original count scale within the edgeR GLM.  G-quadruplex prediction: G4 quadruplexes analysis was conducted using pqsfinder [ 55 All heatmaps, volcano plots, and other visualizations were created in R. Upset plots were generated using ComplexUpset package in R. Heatmaps were created using the ComplexHeatmap package in R.  Mature tRNA analysis: Mature isodecoder tRNA reads were prepared using tRAX software [ 8 5. Conclusions In conclusion, tDRs are highly heterogeneous under physiological conditions but appear to follow consistent biogenesis rules, which are tied to their specific source tRNAs. Mature tRNA expression, at either the isoacceptor level or the isodecoder level, does not appear to be a contributing factor to tDRs biogenesis. Accordingly, we ask the following questions: What are the processes regulating tDR production? How do rG4-forming tDRs regulate cellular functions? Such questions, and many more, need to be addressed in future research. Such research will help us to fully comprehend tDR biology, support us in understanding their roles in the many diseases that they have been reported to play a role in, and potentially aid us in developing novel tDR-based therapeutics. We believe our tDR-sequencing method will support the better discovery of tDRs and assist us in developing an understanding of their biology.
