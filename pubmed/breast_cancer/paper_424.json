Background Vulvar ectopic breast fibroadenoma (EBF) is an exceptionally rare benign neoplasm that lacks distinctive clinical or radiological features rendering pre-operative differentiation from other vulvar masses challenging. Definitive diagnosis requires histopathological confirmation. Two non-exclusive histogenetic hypotheses have been proposed: (1) derivation from ectopic breast tissue along the embryonic “milk line,” (2) origin from hormonally responsive anogenital mammary-like glands with latent potential for benign or malignant transformation. Case presentation A 41-year-old woman presented with an incidentally discovered, slowly enlarging, painless right vulvar mass. Ultrasonography revealed a well-circumscribed hypoechoic nodule. Complete surgical excision was performed, and histopathological evaluation—including immunohistochemistry for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, GATA3, and p63—confirmed ectopic breast fibroadenoma. No recurrence was detected at 3-month follow-up. Conclusion Despite its rarity, vulvar EBF must be considered in the differential diagnosis of vulvar masses in reproductive-age women. En-bloc excision is curative; however, long-term surveillance is warranted to monitor for hormone-driven recurrence or malignant evolution. ectopic breast fibroadenoma vulva diagnosis treatment The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-in-acceptance Surgical Oncology Introduction Ectopic breast tissue (EBT) is defined as breast parenchyma situated outside the orthotopic mammary ridge. It is reported in 2–6% of the general population, affects both sexes, and appears to be most prevalent in Japanese women ( 1 2 3 4 Clinical data A 41-year-old woman first noted an asymptomatic vulvar mass 10 months before presentation. Because the lesion was neither pruritic nor painful, she did not seek medical attention. Seven days prior to admission she perceived rapid enlargement and consulted our institution. On gynecological examination, a solitary, firm, well-circumscribed, mobile nodule measuring approximately 2cm was palpable in the subcutaneous tissue of the right labium majus, the overlying skin was intact and non-tender. Pelvic examination revealed an anteverted, normal-sized, mobile uterus with a smooth surface and no adnexal masses or tenderness. Her gynecologic history was unremarkable, apart from one cesarean section in 2009. She currently uses barrier contraception with condoms. Bilateral breasts were symmetric, without palpable masses or accessory tissue. The patient denied cyclical variation in nodule size or associated mastalgia and reported no family history of breast or vulvar neoplasms. Based on these findings, the pre-operative differential diagnosis favored benign entities such as epidermal inclusion cyst, hemangioma, lipoma, or cutaneous adnexal tumor. Auxiliary examination Ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic nodule measuring approximately 2.0 * 1.3 * 1.2 cm with clear boundaries in the subcutaneous tissue of the right vulva, suggesting a subcutaneous hypoechoic nodule in the right vulva (  Figure 1 Figure 1 Ultrasound revealed a hypoechoic nodule with clear boundaries in the subcutaneous tissue of the right vulva. Two ultrasound images labeled A and B of the subcutaneous nodule in the right vulva.Image A shows a transverse view of the nodule without color Doppler. Image B displays a similar view but with color Doppler, highlighting vascular activity with red and blue markers indicating blood flow. Intraoperative findings Under sterile conditions, the lesion was excised en bloc via high-frequency electrosurgery. A well-encapsulated, firm nodule measuring 2.0 cm × 1.5 cm was identified immediately inferior to the perineal commissure at the lower margin of the right labium majus. The overlying capsule was thin and intact. Sectioning disclosed an ovoid, grayish-white, solid cut surface with a homogeneous, slightly soft consistency and no gross evidence of hemorrhage or necrosis (  Figure 2 Figure 2 The mass was an oval shape with a complete thin fibrous capsule and a grayish-white solid tissue surface that was slightly soft.

Pathological examination The excised specimen consisted of a well-circumscribed, ovoid mass measuring 2.6×2.2×1.0 cm. The external surface was smooth and enveloped by a delicate, intact fibrous capsule. Cut section revealed homogeneous, grayish-white tissue lacking hemorrhage or necrosis. Microscopically, the lesion was circumscribed by a thin fibrous pseudocapsule and composed of mildly cellular fibrous stroma harboring proliferative, variably configured glandular structures. The glands exhibited a bilayered architecture comprising an inner luminal epithelial layer and an outer myoepithelial layer, recapitulating native breast tissue. Some ducts were mildly dilated; others were compressed or slit-like (  Figure 3  Figure 4 Figure 3 Histological morphology.

Follow-up Three months post-operatively, clinical and high-resolution ultrasound re-evaluation demonstrated complete excision with no evidence of residual or recurrent disease within the vulva. Discussion Vulvar ectopic breast fibroadenoma is an exceptionally rare entity whose pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Two principal hypotheses have been proposed. The classic “milk-line” theory postulates that the lesion derives from residual embryonic mammary ridges that normally regress except for the bilateral pectoral primordia; incomplete involution along the caudal extension of this line could, albeit rarely, give rise to ectopic breast tissue in the vulva ( 5 6 7 Aberrant breast tissue (ABT) is identified in approximately 1–3% of the general population, yet fibroadenoma developing within ABT is distinctly rare. More than 90% of reported cases occur in the axilla; the vulva constitutes the second most common site. Isolated lesions have also been described in the abdominal cavity, pelvis, chest wall, suprapubic region, periumbilical subcutis, and upper extremity ( 8 12 13 Patients usually present with a solitary, painless vulvar nodule that is well-circumscribed, mobile, and firm to rubbery on palpation. Growth is characteristically indolent, with progressive enlargement documented over months to years. The lesion is almost invariably unilateral, and reported diameters range from 1–2 cm to ≥ 5 cm. The labium majus is the most common site; involvement of the labium minus, periclitoral region, or perineal body is exceptional ( 14 Although the lesion comprises ectopic mammary parenchyma, only a minority of women report mild premenstrual tenderness or subtle fluctuation in size; this cyclical change is inconsistent and markedly less pronounced than that typical of orthotopic fibroadenomas, and most patients remain asymptomatic. When progressive enlargement occurs in this anatomically intimate region, pain and mechanical irritation frequently ensue, prompting avoidance of sexual intercourse. Persistent discomfort may subsequently evolve into hypoactive sexual desire and impaired arousal. Alteration of vulvar contour often provokes embarrassment or body-image dissatisfaction, while friction from sitting, cycling, or tight clothing further compromises occupational, athletic, and social functioning. The cumulative impact of these factors ultimately compels presentation for medical evaluation. At presentation, the rarity of the condition and its nonspecific clinical picture—together with imaging findings that merely suggest a benign neoplasm of indeterminate histogenesis—lead clinicians to favour more common entities such as epidermal inclusion cyst, lipoma, leiomyoma, or skin-appendage tumours. Consequently, ectopic mammary fibroadenoma is often overlooked. Even core-needle biopsy may only disclose a benign fibroepithelial lesion without identifying its aberrant mammary origin. The Kajawa–Ancillary Breast Tissue Classification System integrates macroscopic and microscopic characteristics to standardize the categorization of ABT and associated pathologies (  Table 1 Table 1 Kajawa–ancillary breast tissue classification system. Type Designation Characteristic description Type I A fully developed supernumerary breast. characterized by the presence of a nipple, areola, and fully differentiated glandular tissue, thereby mirroring the macroscopic configuration of a native breast Type II glandular tissue and areola without an associated nipple Presence of an areola and fully differentiated glandular parenchyma, with complete absence of a nipple structure. Type III Glandular tissue and nipple, in the absence of an areola. Presence of a nipple and fully differentiated glandular tissue with concomitant absence of the areola. Type IV Isolated fully differentiated glandular tissue Consisting solely of mammary glandular parenchyma without nipple or areola— the most prevalent variant that is frequently misinterpreted as lipoma or lymphadenopathy. Type V An areola with superimposed terminal hair follicles, lacking underlying glandular parenchyma. Presence of an isolated areola, occasionally adorned by terminal hair follicles, yet devoid of functional glandular parenchyma—clinically masquerading as a pigmented nevus. Type VI Nipple only Isolated nipple structure, devoid of both areola and underlying glandular parenchyma—frequently mistaken for an acrochordon or dermatofibroma. Type VII Hypertrichotic accessory breast presenting with hirsute areola lacking both nipple and glandular tissue. Periareolar hypertrichosis, occasionally accompanied by involuted glandular remnants; clinical distinction from sebaceous cysts is mandatory. Type VIII Accessory breast tissue exhibiting pathological alterations. Any of the aforementioned subtypes complicated by cyst formation, fibroadenoma, inflammatory change, or malignant transformation—mandating histopathologic verification. Consequently, complete surgical excision remains the therapeutic gold standard for vulvar ectopic mammary fibroadenoma. Although recurrence is rare, documented cases implicate two principal mechanisms: (i) hormonal activation of residual mammary-like tissue during pregnancy, lactation, puberty, or ovarian hyper-stimulation, and (ii) persistence of microscopic disease at the resection margin. In addition, vulvar ectopic mammary lesions have been reported in association with congenital anomalies of the urinary tract, including hydronephrosis, polycystic kidneys, ureteric strictures, and adrenal hyperplasia (3). Therefore, dedicated renal imaging should be considered once the diagnosis is confirmed. Conclusion Vulvar ectopic mammary fibroadenoma is an exceptionally rare benign neoplasm whose nonspecific clinical and imaging characteristics render accurate pre-operative diagnosis challenging. This case highlights the imperative of including mammary-type lesions in the differential diagnosis of any vulvar mass, particularly in women of reproductive age. En-bloc surgical excision provides excellent prognosis with minimal recurrence; however, long-term surveillance is warranted to monitor for hormonal stimulation and rare malignant transformation. Future studies should clarify the molecular pathogenesis and establish evidence-based management algorithms for this uncommon entity.
