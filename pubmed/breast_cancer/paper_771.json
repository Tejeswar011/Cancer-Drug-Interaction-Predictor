Objective To assess the impact of exercise on bone metabolism in postmenopausal women through meta-analysis, and to offer evidence-based guidance for preventing and managing osteoporosis in this population. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, and other databases using keywords such as “exercise,” “postmenopausal women,” and “bone metabolism” to identify randomized controlled trials published up to 2024 on the effect of exercise on bone metabolism in postmenopausal women. Studies were selected according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.4 and Stata17. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Effect sizes were pooled as standardized mean differences( SMDs CIs I² Results A meta-analysis of 24 studies(1067 subjects total)showed that exercise significantly elevated the levels of alkaline phosphatase(ALP)( SMD CI P SMD CI P SMD CI P SMD CI P SMD CI P SMD CI P SMD CI P SMD CI P SMD CI P SMD CI P SMD CI P SMD CI P Conclusion Exercise significantly improves bone metabolism in postmenopausal women by reducing bone resorption and promoting bone formation. Aerobic exercise lowers CTX levels, while both aerobic and resistance exercise increase OC levels. Short-term (≤6 months) and moderate-length (≤60 minutes/session) interventions are particularly effective. However, more high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these benefits.

The databases Retrieved November 2024 by the first author. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of aerobic and resistance exercise on bone metabolism in middle-aged and elderly people were searched in each database. The search terms included “Exercise, physical exercise, postmenopausal women, osteoporosis, low bone mass, bone metabolism, randomized controlled trial”. To identify more potential studies, we manually searched gray literature, reference lists of identified studies, and relevant registration website (ClinicalTrials.gov) and consulted experts in this field. however, due to the lack of standardized peer-review processes and limited accessibility of detailed data, we decided to exclude gray literature from our analysis. The full search strategies for all databases are shown in  Supplementary Table S2 2.3 Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the studies Inclusion criteria: Inclusion criteria: (i) Study type: RCTs on the effects of exercise on bone metabolism in middle-aged and older adults that have been published in various databases from the time of their construction to November 6, 2024. Only peer-reviewed articles published in English were included to ensure methodological quality and accessibility of data; (ii) Study subjects: postmenopausal women aged ≥45 years. In this study, “postmenopausal” was defined as a serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level >25–30 IU/L, natural amenorrhea for >12 months, or explicit mention in the literature that the participants were in the postmenopausal stage. (iii) Intervention: any form of physical exercise (which refers to the cultural activities in which participants are physically active through the importance of physical exercise with the purpose of strengthening their physical fitness and improving their health), and the intervention group was based on Physical exercise is the focus of the intervention group, and there is no requirement for the exercise mode and load volume. Control measures: the control group only carries out daily life or original physical exercise and does not receive additional exercise intervention. If the control group receives conventional treatment, the experimental group should adopt conventional treatment + exercise intervention at the same time. (iv) Out-come indicators: serum phosphorus, serum calcium, osteocalcin (OC), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), parathyroid hormone (PTH), type I collagen carboxy-terminal peptide (CTX), N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (P1NP). Exclusion criteria: (i) Duplicated published literature; (ii) Non-RCT; (iii) Study subjects were not postmenopausal women; (iv) Interventions did not meet the inclusion criteria and controls did not meet the inclusion criteria; and (v) Outcome metrics did not meet the outcome metrics associated with the inclusion criteria; (vi) Unpublished studies, conference abstracts, and grey literature were excluded due to the lack of complete methodological details and peer review, which may affect data reliability. 2.4 Literature screening and data extraction The retrieved literature was imported into Endnote 20 software and duplicates were removed from it. Two researchers then screened the literature and extracted information based on established inclusion and exclusion criteria. If disagreements were encountered, they were discussed and resolved with a third researcher. Characteristics of included studies included authors, year of publication, country, sample size, and age (  Table 1  Table 2 SD Table 1 Research characteristics.

The outcome indicators of the studies included in this analysis were all continuous variables. Since all the incorporated studies were RCTs, the between-group differences at baseline should theoretically approach zero. Therefore, post-intervention values were used for the meta-analysis, and standardized mean differences ( SMDs CIs I 2 P P ≤ I 2 I 2 I 2 I 2 2.7 Subgroup analysis Subgroup analyses of OC and CTX were conducted according to exercise type, intervention period (≤6 months vs vs 2.8 Sensitivity analysis We performed sensitivity analysis by eliminating studies one by one to verify the robustness of the results. 2.9 Publication bias We used a funnel plot and Egger’s test to detect publication bias when ≥10 studies with the same outcome were included in the analysis. 2.10 Certainty of evidence We applied the Grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the certainty of evidence. Each outcome was evaluated from the following six aspects: study design, risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and other considerations. Then the certainty of evidence was accordingly graded as “high”, “moderate”, “low”, or “very low” ( 15 3 Results 3.1 Results of literature screening The initial screening identified 1653 articles, including 331 articles in PubMed database, 365 articles in Embase database, 278 articles in Cochrane Library database, 225 articles in Web of Science database, 178 articles in Scopus database, and 276 articles in Google Scholar database. We obtained 835 articles by de-weighting with EndNote 20 software, excluded 751 articles after reading the titles and abstracts, excluded 7 articles with low relevance, and read through the full text of the remaining 84 articles to assess whether to include them. Among them, 13 interventions did not match the target group, 9 controls did not meet the criteria, 15 interventions did not meet the inclusion criteria, 12 outcome indicators did not match, 7 had no control, and 4 were unable to extract data, and finally, the remaining 24 papers ( 6 16 38  Figure 1 Figure 1 PRISMA study flow diagram. Flowchart illustrating the study selection process. Initially, 1,658 records were identified through databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Two additional records were found through hand searching. After removing duplicates, 835 records were screened. Of these, 751 were excluded based on title and abstract. Eighty-four full-text articles were assessed, with 60 excluded for various reasons. Ultimately, 24 studies were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis. 3.2 Characteristics of the included studies A total of 24 papers published between 1993–2024 were included in this study, and the total number of subjects was 1067 (575 in the experimental group and 492 in the control group), aged 45 years or older.

The evidence of the remaining outcomes was rated as very low certainty. The reasons for downgrading were mainly attributed to the risk of bias of included studies and imprecision. The results of certainty of evidence are shown in  Supplementary Table S3 4 Discussion Exercise, as an effective non-pharmacological intervention, may be the main reason for the improvement of bone health since bone responds to mechanical loads and acts on the skeleton through muscular forces and ground reaction forces, which increase the density and strength of bone minerals ( 39 39 The results of the subgroup analysis in this study indicate that an exercise duration of ≤6 months and a session length of ≤60 minutes are more effective in reducing the bone resorption marker CTX, while significantly increasing the bone formation marker OC. Exercise exerts mechanical loading on bone tissue, which suppresses the secretion of sclerostin by osteocytes, thereby relieving the inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. This promotes the intracellular accumulation of β-catenin and its translocation into the nucleus, where it activates the expression of bone formation–related genes and enhances osteogenic activity ( 40 42 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 In their meta-analysis on the effects of Tai Chi on bone health in postmenopausal women, Liu et al. selected “6 months” as the cutoff point for intervention duration based on the physiological rationale of the bone remodeling cycle ( 49 50 Most meta-analyses related to the improvement of bone health by exercise have focused on bone mineral density ( 9 51 54 55 56 57 58 59 12 60 61 62 The results of the meta-analysis showed that, compared with the control group, exercise was effective in increasing the levels of bone formation markers, such as ALP, P1NP, and OC, in postmenopausal women. ALP on the other hand widely present in various tissues of the human body, serum ALP is mainly derived from liver, bone and kidney tissues, it is a marker of bone formation, and studies suggest that ALP has an important role in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis ( 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 The results of this study showed that exercise significantly reduced the levels of bone resorption markers such as PTH and CTX in postmenopausal women. PTH is a hormone that regulates calcium and phosphorus metabolism, and 15.6% of postmenopausal osteoporosis patients had elevated PTH. The results of the study on the correlation between osteoporosis-related hormones and bone mineral density showed that the level of serum PTH was negatively correlated with bone mineral density, which allowed early detection of osteoporosis ( 74 75 58 11 The results also showed that exercise did not significantly affect serum phosphorus, serum calcium and 25(OH)D in postmenopausal women. Serum phosphorus and serum calcium play several important roles in bone metabolism with exercise intervention, which is involved in bone formation and repair, influences changes in bone metabolism markers, regulates acid-base balance and cellular osmotic pressure, and interacts with calcium and phosphorus ( 76 78 79 80 80 81 Our subgroup analysis demonstrated that both aerobic and resistance exercise significantly increased OC levels in postmenopausal women, while aerobic exercise also reduced CTX levels. Previous studies suggest that aerobic exercise may increase osteoprotegerin levels, which helps suppress osteoclastogenesis and reduce bone loss, thereby leading to decreased serum CTX and elevated OC levels ( 23 82 82 83 25 30 37 29 Limitations: (i) As the study was an analysis of different bone metabolism by different exercise types, the refinement of the sample size classification may have resulted in a smaller amount of combined effects, which may have had a certain impact on the results, so the analysis was not carried out on the exercise types; (ii) The included studies exhibited heterogeneity in the methods used to measure bone metabolism markers (e.g., IRMA, ELISA), which may affect the comparability and synthesis of the results; (iii) Most of the included studies involved short-term interventions and lacked long-term follow-up data (>2 years); therefore, the sustainability of the intervention effects and their long-term impact on bone health could not be clearly evaluated; (iv) Since all included studies were RCTs, the between-group differences at baseline should theoretically approach zero, which justified our use of post-intervention values for the meta-analysis. However, although randomization balances baseline differences, potential confounding factors may not be fully controlled, which could introduce some bias into the results. Future studies should prioritize reporting baseline data and change-from-baseline values to allow for more comprehensive analyses; (v) This study only searched English-language databases, potentially omitting relevant studies published in other languages (e.g., Chinese, Spanish), which may limit the comprehensiveness and representativeness of the results. Future research should include multilingual databases to reduce potential language bias; (vi) The applicability of our study results to populations from different regions or ethnic backgrounds may be limited, particularly in groups with substantial differences in baseline bone health, lifestyle, or genetic background, and thus should be generalized with caution; (vii) In the study, although the 6-month intervention duration was justified based on the physiological rationale of the bone remodeling cycle, the cut-off point of 60 minutes for single-session exercise duration lacks a clear physiological basis. The choice of this cut-off may be more related to the distribution of the data or operational convenience rather than physiological significance. Therefore, we acknowledge the potential bias that may be introduced by this arbitrary cut-off. 5 Conclusion The systematic review and meta-analysis of this study demonstrated that regular exercise has significant effects on bone metabolism in postmenopausal women by reducing bone resorption and enhancing bone formation. Aerobic exercise effectively decreases CTX levels, while both aerobic and resistance exercise effectively increase OC levels. Short-term interventions (≤6 months) and moderate-duration sessions (≤60 minutes per session) show notable benefits in lowering CTX and elevating OC. However, more rigorously designed randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the benefits of exercise on bone metabolism and to determine the optimal intervention strategies. Due to the small number of studies, it was not possible to determine the effects on other bone metabolism metrics. However, more rigorously designed randomized controlled trials are needed to validate the benefits of exercise on bone metabolism and to explore its optimal protocol.
