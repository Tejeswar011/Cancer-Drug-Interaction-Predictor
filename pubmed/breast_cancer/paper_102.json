Treatment modality is immediate replantation or prompt storage of tooth. Storage is the most common modality. Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) and normal saline are some investigated and efficient storage media to maintain periodontal ligament cell viability. Kangen water is alkalinized water enriched with minerals; thus, it can be used as a storage media. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the efficacy of Kangen water as a storage media. Material and methods Teeth extracted for orthodontic purposes were included and disinfected. Extracted tissues were transferred to a Petri dish consisting of the respective storage media. Normal saline (pH 5.5): group A and HBSS (pH 7.2): group B, Kangen water (pH 8.5): group C, (pH 9.0): group D, and (pH 9.5): group E were study groups. Samples were stained using trypan blue exclusion staining, and cell viability was assessed at 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours using a hemocytometer. Data was analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc Results Hence, it can be suggested that group B was most efficient in maintaining cell viability at all study time intervals and highly significant on statistical analysis with a p Conclusion Kangen water can be used as a storage media/interim transport media. It will be commonly used for domestic purposes. Thus, it will become feasible and easily available. Clinical significance Kangen water has properties such as alkaline pH, capable of maintaining cell viability, easily available, and cost-effective. Hence, it can be recommended as a storage media and can be made easily available in areas with a higher incidence of trauma, such as schools, ground, sports complexes, and home.

The worldwide prevalence of TDI in primary dentition is 22.7% and in permanent dentition is 15.2%. 1 2 Among all TDIs, avulsion is the most complex type of injury, which has an impact on a child's general health, well-being, and psychology. 3 4 5 9 10 An increase in extraoral dry time results in dehydration and necrosis of viable cells of the periodontal ligament, making the tooth incompetent for replantation. Extraoral dry time can be reduced by immersing the avulsed teeth in storage media/interim transport media. 10 The objective of storage media is to maintain the viability of periodontal ligament cells, which is achieved by virtue of its characteristics. Ideal properties of storage media should be neutral pH closer to the oral cavity; should not cause any antigen-antibody reaction; should be easily available; should reduce inflammatory reaction and chances of ankylosis after replantation; should have antioxidant properties. 11 Among various available storage media such as HBSS, milk, saliva, and normal saline, Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) is considered to be an ideal storage media. In 1975, Hank discovered this solution and used it for the preservation of tissue culture. The International Association of Dental Traumatology (IADT) has recommended the use of HBSS as storage media for avulsed teeth. 12 10 Kangen water is alkalinized water enriched with various minerals, especially hydrogen. It is available in pH values of 7.5, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, and 11.5. The pH values of 8.5, 9.0, and 9.5 can be assessed as storage media as their pH is closest to the oral environment. It acts as an antioxidant, facilitates healing, and has an antibacterial effect. 13 14 15 M aterial and ethods Study Design and Ethical Aspects The ex vivo D21081 Sample Size Twenty-five freshly extracted premolars were used to procure the periodontal ligament tissue. The procured tissue was placed in five Petri dishes per group. Groups Twenty-five teeth were randomly divided into five groups using the lottery method, that is, five teeth per group. Tissue was procured and transferred to Petri dishes consisting of respective storage media, that is, normal saline (0.9%) (acuLIFE ® ® Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria Atraumatically, freshly extracted premolar teeth for orthodontic purposes were included in the study. Teeth showing signs of caries, periodontitis, periapical lesions, root resorption, cyst or granuloma, and fractured roots were excluded from the study. Sample Collection and Disinfection Twenty-five freshly extracted premolar teeth fulfilling inclusion criteria were included. Samples were disinfected by immersing them in povidone Iodine (10%) and saline solution (1:3) immediately after extraction, followed by storage in a sterile Falcon tube (50 mL) consisting of 10 mL phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) during transportation to the laboratory. Teeth were removed from the tube using sterile tweezers, by holding them at the cementoenamel junction (CEJ), and were divided into study groups. BP blade #15 was used to extract attached tissue (i.e., periodontal ligament) from the mesial and distal surfaces of the roots. Procedure Tissue procured from the root surface of included teeth were transferred to labeled five Petri dishes per group, comprising 3 mL of storage media groups of the present study for the entire duration of the study. 1 mL of solution from each Petri dish was pipetted and dispensed in the respective labeled Eppendorf tubes. Further, these were placed in a centrifugation machine (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA) and spun at 3,000 rpm for 3 minutes. The supernatant fluid present in the cell suspension was removed. A 0.4% trypan blue stain was prepared by dissolving 0.4 gm of trypan blue in 80 mL of PBS and was boiled on a slow flame. This solution was cooled down until it reached room temperature. Additional PBS was incorporated to produce a final volume of 100 mL. A 0.1 mL of solution from the respective Eppendorf tube was pipetted, and stained in another Eppendorf tube utilizing 0.4% trypan blue. A sample from each group was placed in the Improved double ruling Neubauer's chamber one by one. Microscopically, the cells with stained outer membrane were intact and viable, and cells with complete staining were nonviable. Cell counting was carried out by counting viable and nonviable cells in four outer large boxes of the chamber, excluding cells observed adjoining the outer periphery of boxes. Computing was performed with the aid of a light microscope (Labomed Microscope, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India) at 40× magnification. The same process was followed for the assessment of cell viability in the remaining Petri dishes. Cell viability was assessed at 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours. Petri dishes were stored in refrigeration at 4°C between study time intervals. The total cell count was estimated using a hemocytometer and the cell count was calculated using the formula given below: Total cell count = No. of cells counted × dilution factor × 10 4 The percentage of viable cells was formulated using the following formula: Viable cells (%) = Total number of viable cells per mL of aliquot × 100/total number of cells per mL of aliquot. Statistical Analysis Data obtained was recorded and tabulated in Microsoft Excel 2021, and subjected to statistical analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was executed to find the significance of study parameters between the groups, followed by post hoc p R esults The total cell count in study groups at time intervals of 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours is mentioned in Table 1 Table 1 : Total cell count of periodontal ligament cells in all study groups  Total cell count at different time intervals  Group  A  B  C  D  E  F value  p-value  Duration  Mean  Std. deviation  Mean  Std. deviation  Mean  Std. deviation  Mean  Std. deviation  Mean  Std. deviation 1/2 hour 123.68 1.84 123.24 2.54 106.04 3.41 142.12 2.66 151.46 2.58 223.847 <0.001 * 1 hour 115.98 1.87 135.66 2.89 97 1.12 104 3.51 127.78 2.13 213.801 <0.001 * 2 hours 119.68 2.67 126.3 3.59 109.6 2.66 135.66 2.96 105 4.35 70.074 <0.001 * 6 hours 83.68 2.05 98.7 7.16 118.28 2.6 117.92 2.72 87.24 3.34 83.336 <0.001* 24 hours 89.96 3.09 94.9 2.52 68.26 2.58 77.24 1.85 75.24 2.94 86.907 <0.001 * 48 hours 113.1 1.8 119.46 3.07 84.92 2.47 92.86 2.06 65.36 2.67 394.136 <0.001 * * p At half an hour, the highest percentage of viable cells was observed in, group B (74.18 ± 3.31), followed by group A (66.33 ± 1.72), group D (63.25 ± 1.88), group E (62.94 ± 2.14), and group C (53.22 ± 2.18), which was highly significant on statistical analysis ( p Table 2 Table 2: Percent of cell viability of periodontal ligament cells in all study groups  Percentage of viable cells  Group  A  B  C  D  E  F value  p-value  Duration  Mean  Std. deviation  Mean  Std. deviation  Mean  Std. deviation  Mean  Std. deviation  Mean  Std. deviation 1/2 hour 66.33 1.72 74.18 3.31 53.22 2.18 63.25 1.88 62.94 2.14 52.802 <0.001 * 1 hour 54.98 2.63 63.25 1.9 56.29 2.09 61.31 1.92 55.85 2.32 14.206 <0.001 * 2 hours 43.55 2.21 54.98 2.9 52.64 1.45 54.41 2.85 54.51 2.62 18.974 <0.001 * 6 hours 40.82 2.2 51.64 2.45 47.36 1.5 44.64 1.78 45.69 2.39 17.693 <0.001 * 24 hours 33.4 1.59 49.58 2.42 30.74 1.55 35.28 2.78 35.13 3.03 48.731 <0.001 * 48 hours 33.41 2.31 45.64 3.79 35.38 3.48 25.9 2.4 34.1 2.11 29.608 <0.001 * * p At a time duration of 1 hour, more percentage of viable cells was observed in group B (63.25 ± 1.90), followed by group D (61.31 ± 1.92), group C (56.29 ± 2.09), group E (55.85 ± 2.32), and group A (54.98 ± 2.63), which was highly statistically significant ( p Table 2 At 2 hours, a higher percentage of viable cells was observed in group B (54.98 ± 2.90), followed by group E (54.51 ± 2.62), group D (54.41 ± 2.85), group C (52.64 ± 1.45), and group A (43.55 ± 2.21), which was found to be highly significant on statistical analysis ( p Table 2 At the time duration of 6 hours, a higher percentage of viable cells were observed in group B (51.64 ± 2.45), followed by group C (47.36 ± 1.50), group E (45.69 ± 2.39), group D (44.64 ± 1.78), and group A (40.82 ± 2.20), which was highly statistically significant ( p Table 2 At 24 hours, higher viable cells were observed in group B (49.58 ± 2.42), followed by group D (35.28 ± 2.78), group E (35.13 ± 3.03), group A (33.40 ± 1.59), and group C (30.74 ± 1.55), which was statistically significant ( p Table 2 At 48 hours, more viable cells were observed in group B (45.64 ± 3.79), followed by group C (35.38 ± 3.48), group E (34.1 ± 2.11), group A (33.41 ± 2.31), and group D (25.90 ± 2.40), which was significant on statistical analysis ( p Table 2 On comparing the mean value and standard deviation of the percentage of viable cells at all time intervals to total cell count, it suggests that HBSS is the most efficient, followed by Kangen water (pH 9.0, 8.5, and 9.5) and normal saline ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1: Comparison of percent of cell viability of periodontal ligament cells in all study groups According to the results of all groups, group B (HBSS) was most efficient, followed by group D (Kangen water 9.0 pH), group C (Kangen water 8.5 pH), group E (Kangen water 9.5 pH), and group A (normal saline). D iscussion The present study assessed the efficacy of Kangen water as a storage media for maintaining periodontal ligament cell viability. Cell viability can be evaluated by various techniques such as MTT assay, ATP reduction, and hemocytometer. Among these, a hemocytometer is commonly employed. Morten et al. 16 Trypan blue exclusion staining is a technique of labeling cells in which both nonviable and viable cells are differentiated. Kerschbaum et al. 17 Normal saline (group A) could maintain cell viability at 0.5 and 24 hours. Singh et al., 18 19 20 Hanks' balanced salt solution (group B) was observed to have the most viable cells at 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours. Navit et al., 21 22 23 24 21 Kangen water at pH 8.5 (group C) could maintain cell viability at 1, 2, 6, and 48 hours; pH 9.0 (group D) maintained cell viability at 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours; and pH 9.5 (group E) maintained cell viability at 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 24, and 48 hours. Results of the present study convey that among groups C, D, and E, group D had a better efficacy in maintaining cell viability. Kangen water has several beneficial properties, such as acts as an antioxidant, has an antibacterial effect, a few variants have pH values closer to the oral environment, and is composed of ions. 20 21 25 26 Streptococcus mutans There are a few limitations in the present study; more advanced cell analysis techniques should be considered to improve the credibility of study outcomes. More number of cells should be evaluated for accurate results. Single-cell suspension and an automated analyzer can be utilized for accuracy in cell counting. C onclusion Hanks' balanced salt solution is considered as a gold standard storage media for preserving the viability of periodontal ligament cells, and the same was seen in the result of present study, but it is not easily available and as well as not cost-effective. Kangen water with pH 8.5, 9.0, and 9.5 showed a significant result in maintaining cell viability. It can be concluded that alkalinized Kangen water can be used as a potent storage media as it is capable of maintaining periodontal ligament cell viability, easy availability, and cost-effectiveness. Further research should be executed employing advanced cell analysis techniques. Clinical Significance Kangen water has properties such as alkaline pH, capable of maintaining cell viability, easily available, and cost-effective. Hence, it can be recommended as a storage media and can be made easily available in areas with a higher incidence of trauma, such as schools, ground, sports complexes, and home.
