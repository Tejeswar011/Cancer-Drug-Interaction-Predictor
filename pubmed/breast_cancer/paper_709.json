Small intestinal neuroendocrine tumors (SI-NETs) represent the most frequent neoplasms of the small intestine, with loss of chromosome 18 as the most common genetic aberration. To date, no highly frequently mutated genes have been identified on chromosome 18 or elsewhere. This study aimed to explore the potential role of methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 (MBD2), located at 18q21.2, as a tumor suppressor gene in SI-NETs. By immunohistochemistry, we found undetectable or very low levels of MBD2 expression in 64% of the analyzed SI-NETs, and overall, very low levels of mRNA and protein expression were observed. Overexpression of MBD2 in the SI-NET cell line, GOT1, reduced cell growth and induced apoptosis, though cell migration remained unaffected. In addition, MBD2 expression decreased cell proliferation and migration capacity of the neuroendocrine cells NCI-H727 but showed no effect on apoptosis. Furthermore, MBD2 expression in both cell lines was found to upregulate E-cadherin but downregulate the levels of N-cadherin and vimentin in GOT1 and NCI-H72, respectively, as determined by western blot analysis. These results suggest that MBD2 plays a role in inhibiting the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process and may function as a potential tumor suppressor gene in SI-NETs. Future studies to elucidate the underlying mechanisms are warranted.

In around 30% of patients, the tumor cells secrete excess hormones such as serotonin and tachykinins, leading to carcinoid syndrome (manifesting as flushing and diarrhea). The disease has an annual incidence of 1–3 per 100,000 individuals, and typically exhibits slow progression (often characterized by a Ki-67 proliferation index of <2%), yet diagnosis frequently occurs at advanced stages with distant metastases, most commonly to the liver ( 1 2 3 Despite major efforts, the genetic and epigenetic drivers of SI-NETs remain largely elusive. These tumors are genetically quite stable with a low rate of mutations but are epigenetically dysregulated ( 4 5 6 CDKN1B 7 8 9 10 4 7 Methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 ( MBD2 11 12 13 14 15 16 Sequencing analysis of SI-NETs in our previous study ( https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.10.25323484 Materials and methods Tissue specimens In total, 59 tumors from 32 patients were selected for this study (Supplementary Table S1 (see section on Supplementary materials 17 18 19 Immunostaining Forty-two paraffin-embedded tumor sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated through descending alcohol concentrations. Background staining was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide and then heat-retrieved in citrate buffer pH 6.0. After using the proper normal serum to block nonspecific staining, the sections were incubated with the primary antibody mouse monoclonal anti-MBD2 (sc-514062, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) or mouse monoclonal anti-E-cadherin (sc-8426, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Incubation with the proper secondary antibody was followed by diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining for visualization. Normal kidney tissue was used as staining control with or without the primary anti-MBD2 antibody (Supplementary Fig. S1). Nineteen frozen tissue sections (Supplementary Table S2) were fixed in acetone, incubated in blocking solutions, and stained for MBD2 as described above. GOT1 and NCI-H727 cells were fixed in formalin and incubated for 20 min with ice-cold 70% ethanol. Then the slides were stained for synaptophysin (ab32127, Abcam, UK) as described above. Immunohistochemical results were evaluated using a qualitative intensity scoring system, defined as follows: no detectable staining (negative), faint or barely perceptible staining (weak), and clearly visible to intensely dark staining (positive). In some of the MBD2-stained slides, staining was heterogeneous, with positive and negative regions observed within the same tissue section. Immunofluorescence: the paraffin-embedded sections were treated and incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-chromogranin A antibody (LK2H10, Thermo Fisher Scientific) as mentioned above, followed by incubation with the proper fluorescence secondary antibody (Alexa 488, Life Technologies). Sections were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween20 and incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-MBD2 antibody (55200-1-AP, Proteintech, USA). Then, the sections were incubated with the fluorescence secondary antibody (Alexa 594, Life Technologies), washed again, and mounted with Vectashield with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, USA). Quantitative real-time PCR Frozen tumor sections were prepared by cryostat and stained with hematoxylin–eosin to select specimens with at least 80% tumor cells. Total RNA was isolated from frozen tumor sections or the cells of GOT1 and NCI-H727 cell lines using the RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The extracted total RNA underwent DNase I treatment using the TURBO DNA-free kit (Life Technologies, USA), followed by PCR analysis. Subsequently, one microgram of total RNA was reverse transcribed by the First strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) with random hexamer primers, in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) reactions were performed on StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR systems (Life Technologies) using TaqMan gene expression Master Mix and assays for MBD2 (Hs00969366_m1), CDH1 (Hs01023895_m1), and 18S rRNA (Hs03928990_g1) transcripts. Data analysis was conducted using the 2 −ΔΔCT Western blotting Whole-cell protein lysates of GOT1 and NCI-H727 cells and frozen tumor sections were extracted using RIPA buffer (Sigma Aldrich, USA) complemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein concentrations were determined using Coomassie Plus Bradford Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The membranes were blocked with blocking reagent (Roche, Switzerland), and then blotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-MBD2 antibody (55200-1-AP, Proteintech, USA), mouse monoclonal anti-E-cadherin (sc-8426, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti-N-cadherin (22018-1-AP, Proteintech), rabbit polyclonal anti-ZEB1 (21544-1-AP, Proteintech), rabbit polyclonal anti-vimentin (10366-1-AP, Proteintech), or goat polyclonal anti-actin (sc-1616, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing, the membranes were incubated with the proper horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Finally, proteins were visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (GE Healthcare, USA). The immunoblots were analyzed and quantified using the ImageLab software (Bio-Rad, USA). Two biological replicates of each western blot analysis were performed. The band intensity for each sample was normalized to a loading control, and the wild-type (WT) sample was used as an internal control for normalizing across gels. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) Total DNA from 15 samples (Supplementary Table S2) was included in the analysis. Bisulfite treatment was performed on 500 ng of DNA using the EpiTect bisulfite kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR primer sequences and conditions were described previously ( 20 Cell culture and transfection Both GOT1 and NCI-H727 cells were cultured at 37°C in 5% CO2, in RPMI-1640 medium complemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (1% PEST). GOT1 medium was also supplemented with 5 μg/mL insulin and 5 μg/mL transferrin. GOT1 cells were distributed onto six-well plates (3 × 10 6 PS100001 NCI-H727 cells (2 × 10 6 Proliferation assay and apoptosis The BrdU cell proliferation assay kit (Calbiochem, USA) was used to assess cell proliferation following the manufacturer’s instructions. BrdU was incubated with the cells for 24 h, and absorbance was measured at 450–540 nm using a plate reader. The Annexin V apoptosis detection kit (Invitrogen, USA) was used to analyze apoptosis by flow cytometry. All the experiments were performed three times in triplicate. Scratch wound-healing assay GOT1 and NCI-H727 cells were transfected with the MBD2 expression plasmid or control empty vector in triplicate as described above. Twenty-four hours after transfection, a scratch was introduced on the cell monolayer using a 100 μL pipette tip. Floating cells were washed away using PBS, and fresh medium supplemented with 0.5 mg/mL G418 (Sigma Aldrich) and 6 μg/mL mitomycin C (Sigma Aldrich) was added. Mitomycin C was added to all wells to inhibit proliferation. The scratch area was imaged at 0 and 24 h later using a light microscope (Bio-Rad). The scratch wound areas were measured using the NIH ImageJ software (1.53a) according to the program’s instructions. Three biological replicates of the experiments were performed.

Among these, 64% (28/42) of the tumors showed undetectable or very low expression of MBD2, whereas positive staining or positive areas together with negative areas were observed in 35% (14/42) of the tumors ( Fig. 2A Fig. 2B Figure 2 MBD2 expression in SI-NETs.

We found very low expression of MBD2, located at 18q21.2, at both mRNA and protein levels in GOT1 cells, which is in line with a previous study ( 18 21 Fig. 4A and B Figure 4 MBD2 overexpression in GOT1 and NCI-H727 cells.

MBD2-expressing cells were cultured to confluence and then partially denuded to form a scratch. The migration capacity of the cells was calculated by measuring the percentage of scratch area at defined time points. The assay did not show any difference in cell migration of GOT1 cells expressing MBD2 ( Fig. 5A Fig. 5B Figure 5 The effect of MBD2 overexpression on migration.

Data presented are means ± SD of triplicates (* P MBD2 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in SI-NET cells To further understand how increased levels of MBD2 expression may affect the metastatic capacity of SI-NET cells, we set out to detect alterations in the EMT process by western blot analysis. Although not statistically significant, we observed a prominent increased expression of E-cadherin and reduced expression of N-cadherin in GOT1 cells overexpressing MBD2 compared to the control cells. However, no effect on the expression of vimentin and ZEB1 was observed ( Fig. 6A Fig. 6B Figure 6 Expression of EMT markers in the MBD2-expressing cell lines.

(C) Representative results from immunohistochemical analysis of E-cadherin in 20 PTs and 22 paired MTs. a b c n n To further investigate the expression of E-cadherin in our tumor cohort, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of the 42 SI-NETs. The observed staining patterns of E-cadherin resembled those of MBD2 in 28 tumors out of 42 (Supplementary Table S3). E-cadherin expression was very low or undetectable in 26 out of the 42 tumors, and overall positive staining was seen in 16 of the tumors. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed very low but variable E-cadherin mRNA expression in the tumors, with no significant difference observed between PT and MT ( Fig. 6C Discussion Even though it has long been established that the most common chromosomal aberration in SI-NETs is loss of chr18, mutated tumor suppressor genes associated with tumorigenesis have not yet been identified on this chromosome. We have previously shown that PTPRM 22 DCC SMAD4 23 24 The MBD protein family is important players in coordinating the crosstalk between DNA methylation and other epigenetic modifications to determine the transcriptional status of downstream genes. In cancer, aberrant expression of MBD2 was associated with genome-wide changes in gene expression, including both upregulation and downregulation of many genes. In glioblastoma, overexpression of MBD2 has been shown to be related to tumorigenesis due to aberrant silencing of tumor suppressor genes ( 25 26 In line with our sequencing findings, immunohistochemistry analysis demonstrated undetectable or very low expression of MBD2 in tumors with loss of chr18, while tumors with the WT showed positive staining regardless of strength. In our validation cohort, the majority of analyzed tumors (64%) also showed undetectable/very low levels of MBD2 expression. Overall, we found very low levels of both mRNA and protein expression in SI-NETs. Although enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine are challenging to enrich and purify for mRNA or protein analysis, immunofluorescence confirmed MBD2 expression in these cells within the intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, consistent with findings in other cancers ( 20 26 To assess the importance of MBD2 in SI-NETs tumor growth, we analyzed the effect of MBD2 expression in vitro 27 Downregulation of MBD2 has also been reported to promote tumor metastasis by activating EMT in lung adenocarcinoma ( 15 28 29 30 in vitro in vivo Taken together, this study demonstrated that expression of MBD2 was downregulated in SI-NETs, and our in vitro Supplementary materials Declaration of interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the work reported.
