Introduction Clostridioides difficile Clostridium difficile C. difficile 1 2 3 4 5 Over the past decade, there has been a notable increase in severe and fulminant forms of CDI. It is estimated that approximately 10% of hospitalized CDI patients experience therapeutic failure, colonic perforation (leading to peritonitis), or toxic megacolon [ 6 First-line antibiotic treatments for CDI, such as vancomycin and fidaxomicin, are effective in controlling symptoms but paradoxically exacerbate dysbiosis. Vancomycin is non-selective and, besides targeting the vegetative forms of C. difficile 7 Recurrent CDI (rCDI) and surgical intervention for fulminant forms represent not only a serious clinical problem but also substantial economic burdens. These costs are primarily due to prolonged hospital stays and the need for patient isolation, which limits the use of shared hospital rooms [ 8 Rigorous data are required to confirm the benefits of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in clinical scenarios characterized by dysbiosis [ 9 9 10 11 12 13 14 6 These beneficial effects are due to the ability of FMT to restore gut microbiota diversity, which leads to several advantageous outcomes: (i) a healthy microbiota competes for intestinal niches and nutritional resources; (ii) it produces bacteriocins with bacteriostatic or bactericidal activity; (iii) it restores bile acid metabolism, thereby inhibiting the germination of C. difficile 6 15 16 17 18 The efficacy and safety of MBK-01, compared to fidaxomicin, have been previously evaluated in a randomized, open-label clinical trial (EudraCT 2020-004591-17; NCT 05201079 Following completion of this clinical trial, the AEMPS authorized compassionate use of MBK-01. Given the lack of published evidence, our objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FMT using MBK-01 for the treatment of rCDI in a series of patients treated compassionately at our center. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Design This study was approved by a del CEIm Provincial de Córdoba, with an approval letter dated 27 November 2024, and reference number SICEIA-2024-003053. This is an observational study involving medicinal products as defined in Article 2 of Royal Decree 957/2020 of November 3 regulating observational studies with medicinal products for human use in Spain. It is a descriptive study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of MBK-01. The compassionate use program of MBK-01 for the treatment of rCDI via FMT was authorized by the AEMPS in 2023 following the completion of the phase III clinical trial MBK ICD-01 (EudraCT 2020-004591-17; NCT05201079 2.2. Inclusion Criteria Before offering patients MBK-01 under compassionate use, a benefit-risk assessment of the procedure was conducted. The treatment was offered only to male and female patients over 18 years of age with no controlled rCDI who had experienced at least two previous episodes of CDI, or a first severe episode with risk factors for recurrence. Eligible patients had either failed or were intolerant to approved pharmacological treatments for CDI. An episode of CDI was defined as diarrhea with more than three liquid stools per day at onset with presence of Clostridium difficile Clostridium difficile Clostridium difficile C. difficile TM 2.3. Exclusion Criteria To ensure patient safety, pregnant women and patients with a history of anaphylaxis to any food were excluded. Patients who had previously undergone FMT received antibiotics within the prior week, solid organ transplant recipients (except those transplanted over two years prior with good graft function), those with an absolute neutrophil count below 500 cells/μL, patients with swallowing difficulties, critically ill patients or those with an expected survival of less than 72 h, and patients unable to undergo proper follow-up were also excluded. 2.4. Procedure, Follow-Up, and Analysis MBK-01 is an investigational biologic drug consisting of lyophilized heterologous intestinal microbiota capsules (Full Spectrum & Purified Intestinal Microbiota, FSPIM) manufactured by Mikrobiomik (Vizcaya, Spain). It is derived from multiple healthy donors formulated in gastro-resistant capsules with an enteric coating made of materials that allow delayed release of viable microbial content beyond the stomach, avoiding degradation in gastric acid and ensuring a targeted delivery [ 19 19 20 11 19 19 20 Selected patients received four capsules of MBK-01 administered as a single dose with water. A fasting period of 2 h was required. Patients did not receive proton pump inhibitors or gastric motility stimulants. Treatment with oral fidaxomicin or vancomycin was permitted but discontinued before FMT (at least 24 h). The capsules were stored at 5 ± 3 °C following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Patients were clinically evaluated at 8 weeks (clinical cure) and 12 weeks (clinical cure after repeated doses and recurrence) following FMT. Clinical cure was defined as the absence of baseline symptoms (diarrhea and others) for at least 72 h. Recurrence was defined as the presence of diarrhea lasting more than 48 h with detection of C. difficile toxin(s) after achieving clinical cure ( Table 1 Qualitative variables are expressed as number of cases (proportion) and quantitative variables as the mean (interquartile range). Since this is a descriptive analysis, no statistical tests have been used. The chat-GPT tool has been used in order to improve the readability and understanding of the data included in Table 2 3. Results 3.1. Representative Cases Table 1 3.1.1. Case 1 A 79-year-old male with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis and recurrent urinary tract infections requiring antibiotic therapy presented with a CDI episode characterized by more than 20 bowel movements per day and general deterioration. Diarrhea initially responded to a 10-day course of oral vancomycin but recurred one week after completing treatment. The recurrence was treated with a course of fidaxomicin, resulting in clinical improvement. However, three weeks after completing fidaxomicin, diarrhea recurred, and an extended fidaxomicin regimen was initiated. On day 21 of treatment, FMT with MBK-01 was performed. The patient maintained clinical response at 8 weeks post-procedure. 3.1.2. Case 2 A 45-year-old female undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer developed CDI despite no prior antibiotic use. The patient presented with 10 daily episodes of liquid stools, hypovolemic shock, and impaired renal function. She received a 10-day course of fidaxomicin. Two weeks post-treatment, she experienced a recurrence of profuse diarrhea. An extended course of fidaxomicin was initiated, along with intravenous metronidazole for the first 10 days. FMT was performed on day 20 of treatment, resulting in complete clinical response at 8 weeks. 3.1.3. Case 4 An 81-year-old male with chronic kidney disease secondary to diabetes and recurrent urinary tract infections developed CDI (eight bowel movements per day) without general deterioration after completing a course of quinolone therapy. He was treated with a 10-day course of oral vancomycin. One week after completing treatment, diarrhea recurred, and a 10-day course of fidaxomicin was initiated. The day after completing fidaxomicin, the patient received FMT with MBK-01. However, intermittent symptoms persisted, and a second FMT with MBK-01 was performed. Clinical cure was achieved and sustained at 8 weeks post-treatment. 3.1.4. Case 6 A 49-year-old male on hemodialysis developed lymphoma and underwent chemotherapy. During the second chemotherapy cycle, he experienced a complicated urinary tract infection requiring treatment with ceftriaxone. One week later, he developed severe CDI with signs of sepsis. He was treated with a 10-day course of oral vancomycin. Although the septic parameters were resolved, diarrhea persisted, prompting a 10-day course of fidaxomicin, after which he became asymptomatic. However, one week after completing fidaxomicin, symptoms recurred, and a new 10-day course of oral vancomycin was initiated. At that point, the Infectious Diseases Department was consulted. The patient was stable and asymptomatic at the time. FMT with MBK-01 was performed following completion of the vancomycin course. After initial symptom control, diarrhea recurred at 8 weeks, and a second FMT with MBK-01 was administered, resulting in the sustained resolution of symptoms. 3.1.5. Case 7 A 71-year-old male was admitted with healthcare-associated pneumonia. While receiving treatment with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin, he developed CDI with 10 liquid bowel movements per day. Symptoms resolved after a 10-day course of fidaxomicin, but diarrhea recurred shortly after completing treatment. Oral vancomycin was initiated but failed to control symptoms. After 3 days, treatment was switched to an extended fidaxomicin regimen, which was maintained for 21 days. Following initial symptom control, diarrhea reappeared one week after completing treatment. A new course of fidaxomicin was started, and FMT with MBK-01 was performed on day 10 of treatment. The patient maintained clinical response at 8 weeks post-FMT. 3.1.6. Case 9 A 72-year-old female developed nosocomial pyelonephritis treated with piperacillin–tazobactam. She subsequently developed severe CDI with sepsis and was treated with a 10-day course of oral vancomycin. Diarrhea recurred shortly after, and a 10-day course of fidaxomicin was initiated. Following initial symptom control, a third recurrence occurred. Oral vancomycin was prescribed for 10 days, which was combined with intravenous metronidazole for the first 8 days. At the end of treatment, a single dose of bezlotoxumab was administered to prevent further recurrences. However, this preventive approach failed, and CDI recurred one week later. After two days of fidaxomicin treatment, FMT with MBK-01 was performed, resulting in stable clinical cure. 3.1.7. Case 12 A 73-year-old female developed CDI in the postoperative period following a renal transplant. The patient received immunosuppression with tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid, and corticosteroids. CDI was treated with a 10-day course of oral vancomycin. One week after completing treatment, symptoms recurred. At this point, the Infectious Diseases Department was consulted, and a 10-day course of fidaxomicin was prescribed, followed by FMT with MBK-01 at the end of treatment. However, this therapeutic approach failed. 3.2. Description of the Grouped Cases The grouped case data are provided in Table 2 Three patients (23.1%) were on hemodialysis. One patient (7.7%) was a renal transplant recipient receiving immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid, and corticosteroids. The mean number of previous recurrences before the current episode was 1.5 (range, 1–3 episodes). Of the nine patients (69.3%) with only one prior episode, four had been treated with fidaxomicin and five with oral vancomycin. One patient (7.7%) had two previous episodes, which were treated with oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin. Another patient with three prior episodes received a 10-day fidaxomicin course for the first episode, an extended fidaxomicin regimen for the second, and a combination of oral vancomycin, metronidazole, and bezlotoxumab for the third. The mean interval between the last recurrence and the episode during which FMT was administered was 1.4 weeks (range, 1–3 weeks). In the current episode, FMT was administered once the episode was controlled and completed with fidaxomicin (7 patients, including 2 on extended regimens) or with vancomycin (5 patients, with 2 cases also receiving tigecycline). FMT was administered in only one case on the third day of fidaxomicin treatment, without prior control of diarrhea. This patient had three previous recurrences and had failed treatment with bezlotoxumab. Clinical cure at week 8 was observed in 11 patients (84.6%). One additional patient was cured after a second FMT. Therefore, the overall clinical response rate after multiple FMTs was 12 cases (92.3%). The procedure was well tolerated. Only one patient experienced self-limited diarrhea. 4. Discussion Currently, fidaxomicin is the recommended pharmacological treatment for the first episode of CDI, particularly in patients with risk factors for recurrence. Although its initial clinical efficacy is comparable to that of oral vancomycin (79–86%), the sustained clinical response of fidaxomicin is greater because it reduces recurrences. According to ESCMID, the 28-day recurrence rate is 26% with oral vancomycin compared to 15.9% with fidaxomicin [ 6 6 21 22 In 2021, three medical societies, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) [ 12 13 14 6 9 A recent meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral FMT [ 9 23 23 24 The data appear to incontrovertibly demonstrate that the efficacy of FMT is independent of the route used to perform it. However, FMT via oral capsules does not require endoscopic procedures, can be administered at home, and can easily be repeated as needed. In our opinion, this should be the preferred route, particularly for elderly patients [ 25 Encapsulated preparations also differ in terms of their dosage, preparation, and storage conditions. There is also no agreement as to whether intestinal cleansing prior to FMT is necessary. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis found no evidence that these differences affect the efficacy of FMT in treating rCDI, although there is a trend suggesting that the greater the amount of microbiome administered, the greater the efficacy [ 9 26 The results of our study using FMT with encapsulated MBK-01 show similar results to those of this meta-analysis with other oral products. Clinical cure at week 8 was 84.6% and increased to 92.3% when patients responding to two FMTs were included. It should be noted that all our patients were high risk. FMT was effective in one patient with 3 previous episodes who had recurrence after using bezlotoxumab. All but one of our patients received FMT after completing pharmacological treatment. The NCT05201079 27 27 Encapsulated MBK-01 is not the only biological product under study. Other laboratories such as Vedanta are developing similar products (VE303). VE303 is administered in a daily dose of one capsule for 14 days. The capsule contains 8 well-characterized commensal bacterial strains, which are grown in pure clonal cell banks. In the phase 2 clinical trial to prevent rCDI, FMT with VE303 reduced recurrences from 37% to 13.8% compared to placebo [ 28 NCT06237452 28 The available evidence supports that FMT is a safe procedure, provide that strict protocols are followed to ensure that donors are healthy and free from potentially transmissible intestinal colonization [ 29 30 31 32 Our study has important limitations, such as the small sample size, the lack of control group, and compassionate-use bias. Nevertheless our limited experience supports the efficacy and safety of oral FMT using MBK-01 and provides hypotheses for research based on MBK-01′s performance (e.g., potential use in post-antibiotic treatment as prophylaxis). The results obtained in the treatment of rCDI may open the possibility of exploring the efficacy of FMT in other diseases in which intestinal dysbiosis is present. These include liver cirrhosis with encephalopathy, inflammatory bowel diseases (especially ulcerative colitis), and intestinal colonization by multidrug-resistant bacteria, especially carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli. It is essential to conduct clinical trials to determine whether FMT can restore normal flora, resolve dysbiosis, and prevent infection and related mortality. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, current scientific evidence supports the efficacy and safety of oral FMT using encapsulated microbiota for the treatment of rCDI, regardless of the procedures used in capsule preparation. Our limited clinical experience with MBK-01 indicates that it is a promising and easy-to-use product. However, there is an urgent need for the results of clinical trials to facilitate the integration of these products into routine clinical practice through formal commercialization. This will improve patient access to this therapeutic option in any center.
