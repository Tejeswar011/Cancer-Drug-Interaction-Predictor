Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide, with HER2-positive subtypes requiring precise diagnostic approaches to guide targeted therapy. Digital pathology and AI-based tools offer promising solutions, but their development relies heavily on high-quality digital datasets, labelled or annotated. In this study, we present a dataset of digital images of breast cancer tissue samples with immunohistochemical expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) classes 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+. Breast cancer tissue samples were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE), followed by the preparation of paraffin blocks and 5-µm sections. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using a Ventana Benchmark Ultra automated immunostainer with PATHWAY anti-HER2/neu (4B5) rabbit monoclonal antibodies and ULTRA VIEW detection system. Digital images were acquired via a fully automated digital system (KFB PRO 120 scanner) at INVIVO LLP with 40x magnification and one focusing layer, ranging in size from 50 MB to 2 GB, depending on the size of the tissue sample fixed on the original slide. The dataset consists of 418 subfolders with images, each corresponding to a source image and containing a different number of tiles depending on the size of the source image. The original images were preprocessed using a conversion script that transformed SVS files into sub-images with a 1:1 aspect ratio in JPEG format. A non-overlapping sliding window approach was applied to generate these sub-images, optimized for machine learning applications. A square window of 1000 × 1000 pixels was used to crop sub-images with a 1:1 aspect ratio. The stride of the sliding window was set to a value that was a multiple of the image resolution (as determined during preprocessing). As a result, a variable number of sub-images were generated from each original SVS image, depending on its size. The output file format was JPEG. Clinical labeling of the data was provided by reference laboratory pathologists with expertise in advanced oncological morphology evaluations. This dataset allows training and validation of machine learning models for the diagnosis, recognition, and classification of breast cancer using the available labeling, as well as for educational purposes for residents and pathologists.

The samples were stained using a Ventana Benchmark Ultra automated immunostainer with PATHWAY anti-HER2/neu (4B5) rabbit monoclonal antibody and the ULTRA VIEW detection system. Data source location The immunohistochemically stained glass slides of HER2 from breast cancer patients diagnosed between 2022 and 2024 were collected from the archives of the Immunohistochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at the Almaty Oncology Center and the Center for Morphological Diagnostics at the Kazakh Institute of Oncology, Almaty, Kazakhstan Data accessibility The images are available online on Huggingface (in JPEG PNG https://zenodo.org/records/15872690 https://huggingface.co/datasets/aidosSarsembayev/adel_dataset_1 Related research article None 1 Value of the Data  • This dataset provides a collection of digitalized immunohistochemistry images of breast cancer tissues expressing HER2 at grades 0, 1+, 2+, and 3+. The combination of expert pathological labeling and high-resolution image acquisition makes it a robust resource for the development and benchmarking of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms in digital pathology. • The dataset offers a comprehensive and clinically relevant distribution of HER2 scores, including detailed ISH status for equivocal cases, providing valuable material for training and validating AI models in HER2 assessment, including HER2-low cases. • These data fill the gap in publicly available, labeled clinical datasets, which is particularly valuable for improving diagnostic accuracy, reducing interobserver variability, supporting AI-powered HER2 scoring systems, and making a positive contribution to bringing automated diagnostics of routine processes closer. • The clinical dataset can be used for training for educational purposes for residents and pathologists. 2 Background Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cancer in the world population, with >2.3 million new cases and 700 thousand deaths annually [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 [7] [8] [9] Manual IHC assessment of HER2 is a complex and time-consuming process that requires a high level of specialist training [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 3 Data Description The dataset hosted on the Hugging Face platform Each main archive (e.g., HER2_001_009.tar.gz A CSV file named labels.csv, located at the path [ HER2 Breast Cancer Digital Image Dataset (ADEL Dataset) 4 Experimental Design, Materials and Methods 4.1 Patient samples The IHC-stained glass slides of HER2 from patients with BC diagnosed between 2022–2024 were collected from the archives of the Immunohistochemistry and Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at the Almaty Oncology Center and the Center for Morphological Diagnostics at the Kazakh Institute of Oncology. The glass slides contained both primary and metastatic tumors, primarily biopsies with fewer surgical samples. In addition to the slides, we obtained the pathological reports of the patients with HER2 assessment, which included scores (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) and were interpreted as positive, negative, or equivocal results. In the case of an equivocal score (2+), the pathological report was supported with in situ hybridization amplification test results. All included slides were evaluated for technical adequacy and examined for the presence of any evident invasive carcinoma. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of al-Farabi Kazakh National University (No. IRB-A310 dated 05/20/2021) with the approval extension accepted in 2024. The study was conducted using fully anonymized immunohistochemical digital images derived from archived human BC tissue samples. All data were obtained retrospectively from existing institutional archives and did not involve any direct interaction with human subjects or the collection of new specimens. Although the images were fully anonymized and contained no personally identifiable information, they were derived from human breast cancer tissue. Therefore, ethical approval was nevertheless obtained from the Institutional Review Board to ensure compliance with institutional and international standards. The IRB waived the requirement for informed consent. 4.2 HER2 IHC staining The HER2-stained slides were prepared from 5 µm sections of the original formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples and stained according to the manufacturer’s instructions using an automated immunostainer (Ventana, Benchmark Ultra) with PATHWAY anti-HER2/neu (4B5) rabbit monoclonal primary antibodies (Ventana) and ULTRA VIEW systemic detection. To ensure staining quality, internal laboratory controls were used: the negative control consisted of a section from the block under study with Rabbit Monoclonal Negative Control Ig applied, while the positive control was a section from a tumor block with a confirmed HER2 status verified by the ISH method. 4.3 HER2 IHC scoring The IHC expression of HER2 was assessed and scored according to the 2018 ASCO/CAP (American Society of Clinical Oncology / College of American Pathologists) guidelines [ 17 HER2 IHC scoring encompasses three key criteria: staining intensity, circumferential membrane staining pattern, and the proportion of positive cells. Cases with no staining or faint, barely perceptible membrane staining in <10 % of invasive tumor cells are classified as 0 (HER2-negative). When faint or barely noticeable membrane staining is observed in >10 % of invasive tumor cells, the case is reported as 1+ (HER2-negative). Cases are classified as 2+ (HER2-equivocal) if fewer than 10 % of invasive cancer cells show complete membrane staining or if >10 % of tumor cells display weak to moderate membranous staining. If >10 % of cancer cells exhibited strong, complete membrane staining, the case is classified as 3+ and considered HER2 positive. HER2-equivocal (2+) cases require additional in situ hybridization (ISH) testing. HER2 gene amplification in the nucleus is evaluated via ISH, most commonly fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), although chromogenic ISH (CISH) and silver-enhanced ISH (SISH) are also used. HER2 gene amplification is a key diagnostic criterion and is defined as a HER2 gene-to-chromosome 17 (HER2/CEP17) ratio of at least 2.0 by FISH or by HER2 copy number analysis. According to the ASCO/CAP guidelines, HER2 expression with an IHC level of 1+ or 2+ with a negative ISH result is currently classified as HER2-low status. Table 1 Table 1 HER2 status scoring. Table 1 HER2 score and interpretation Staining patterns IHC 0 No staining or incomplete membrane staining that is faint or barely perceptible and in ≤10 % of tumor cells IHC 1+ Incomplete membrane staining that is faint or barely perceptible and in >10 % of tumor cells IHC 2+ Weak to moderate complete membrane staining in >10 % of tumor cells IHC 3+ Complete and intense staining of circumferential membrane in >10 % of tumor cells A total of 425 images were initially scanned, of which 7 were excluded due to poor quality or the absence of reliable ground truth annotations. The final dataset comprises 418 high-quality images. Among them, the largest proportion represents cases with negative HER2 expression (“0”): 138 images. Cases with weak HER2 expression (“1+”) account for 102 images. There are 75 images with an equivocal “2+” score, representing a group of uncertain HER2 status that typically require confirmatory testing by in situ hybridization (ISH). To clarify these, ISH results were specified: 19 were ISH positive (HER2 amplification), and 45 were ISH-non-amplified. Finally, 103 images correspond to cases with high HER2 expression (“3+”) ( Table 2 Table 2 Distribution of digital images in the dataset by HER2 score. Table 2 HER2 assessment n “0” 138 (33 %) “1+” 102 (24.4 %) “2+” 75 (17.9 %) “3+” 103 (24.6 %) Total 418 (100 %) The mean age of patients whose slides were scanned was 58.1 ± 12.2 years, with 110 patients (26.3 %) in the premenopausal age group (<50 years) and 308 patients (73.7 %) in the ≥50 years age group. Of the known 399 histological types, 92.7 % were nonspecific carcinomas, predominantly invasive ductal carcinomas. Grade 2 malignancy (281/366), hormone-positive BC (297/410), and a high proliferative index (310/410) were most prevalent. 4.4 HER2 IHC scanning The original HER2 slides were scanned using the fully automated KFB PRO 120 digital pathology system at the INVIVO LLP laboratory, with 40x magnification and a single focal layer. The resulting image files were saved in SVS format on the lead author's hard drive with encrypted access. The file sizes of the digital slides ranged from 50 MB to 2 GB, depending on the size of the biopsy material on the original glass slide. 4.5 Image preprocessing Due to the substantial file size of SVS images, conversion to lighter formats was necessary to facilitate experimental work, particularly since the primary goal of the dataset is its application in AI algorithm development. A non-overlapping sliding window approach was applied to each image, moving from left to right and top to bottom. A square window of 1000 × 1000 pixels was used to crop sub-images with a 1:1 aspect ratio. The stride of the sliding window was set to a value that was a multiple of the image resolution, as determined during preprocessing. As a result, a variable number of sub-images were generated from each original SVS image, depending on its size. The output file format was JPEG. The custom conversion script for restoring (“stitching”) the original image from JPEG tiles is available on GitHub, a web-based platform for hosting IT projects ( https://github.com/asarsembayev/her2_data_processing Because the “sliced” images are indexed in a strict order, the restoration script accurately reassembles the full image without any loss of spatial relationships between image elements or quality.

Fig 4 Limitations During data collection, we encountered the following limitations. First, the dataset is imbalanced, particularly in the low HER2 score categories (1+ and 2+ ISH non-amplified), which are clinically significant for automation and second-opinion assessment. Second, the dataset is currently labeled, but it has not yet been annotated. In future work, we plan to enhance the analysis by implementing image patching techniques and conducting an internal review of the images as part of quality control measures. This approach will allow for more detailed feature extraction and may improve the classification performance of our model.
