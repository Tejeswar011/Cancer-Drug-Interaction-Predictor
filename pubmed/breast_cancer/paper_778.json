Among these diseases, including acute lung injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), and pathogenic infections, the immune system plays a significant role in whole-body pathophysiology. These occurrences have been recognised to affect the ocular system, bringing about the novel idea of the lung–eye axis with emerging literature highlighting the fundamental connection of exacerbation between systems. Prior literature has recognised axial activity across systems, the gut and eye, where gut microbiota has an indicated correlation with the ocular environment. In addition, crosstalk has been hypothesized in a brain–lung axis via neurological anatomy, immune mechanisms and microbial pathways. Such cascades offer foundation for the lung–eye axis, supporting the potential for a correlative relationship between the ocular and respiratory system through anatomical, mucosal and inflammatory crosstalk. Although in its infancy, the interconnection between ocular and respiratory systems has been considered in the development of chronic diseases. Amid chronic diseases, COPD, OSA and glaucoma exhibit underlying mechanisms, incorporating hypoxia, oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction, postulating dual system pathophysiology. Finally, potential biomarkers are proposed following pathophysiological mechanism exploration, with an advocation for longitudinal studies in future. The current review proposes a novel axis in the field of lung diseases and aims to provide significant insights for respiratory and ocular clinicians, in addition to translational researchers, paving a new path for understanding systemic disease and treatment modality.

Noncommunicable disease interplay is explored, ranging from ocular and lung cancer, to COPD, OSA, and glaucoma, emphasizing connections between distant systems and the role of the lung–eye axis. Immunological and inflammatory mechanisms are explored by analysing anatomical, physiological, and pathogenic processes involved in the interplay between the systems. Furthermore, this review aims to offer a comprehensive understanding of the proposed lung–eye axis and attempts to enhance knowledge of systemic disease interactions. Respiratory and ocular immunity Mucosal immune systems and regulations have had great attention within the literature, albeit in isolated mucosal sites, with dysregulation of such immunity suggested to play central roles underpinning a meriad of chronic diseases ranging from asthma and COPD, to dry eye disease and uveitis (Lee et al. 2014 2016 Comprising primarily of the conjunctiva and cornea, the ocular surface is home to an ecosystem of micro-organisms. This is now recognised despite previously being considered a sterile environment (Allam et al. 2024 2021 2005 Bacterial genera identified have included Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Cornyebacterium, Bifidobacterium, Moraxella, Dolosigranulum, Propionibacterium 2021 2021 Chlamydia trachomatis 2021 2013 Similar to the newer discovery of the ocular microbiota, the lungs were once thought to be devoid of bacteria; however, there is now compelling evidence of the lung and the respiratory system containing a diverse community of micro-organisms (Dickson et al. 2016 2006 2016 2014 Staphylococcus aureus Moraxella catarrhalis 2008 2015 Prevotella, Veillonella Streptococcus 2017 The imperative antibody, secretary immunoglobin A (sIgA), has been found to be pivotal in the maintenance of both EALT and MALT regulation through the neutralisation of invading pathogens and the stimulation of anti-inflammatory responses. Within the ocular surface, sIgA is secreted in the lacrimal glands and is secreted by the lacrimal glands and regulated by the ocular microbiota to promote interleukin-10 (IL-10) production as well as dendritic cell modulation (Allam et al. 2024 2024 . 2015 P 2015 P P 2015 1996 1996 Alluding further to the connection between the ocular and lung microbiome is the dissemination of micro-organisms, along with their products and immune cells, pioneers the communication between the lung and the eye (Allam et al. 2024 2023 2002 2002 P 2002 2002 The potential for ocular inflammatory mediators to spill into systemic circulation, a key mechanism required for a lung–eye axis, is further posited by the rat model of endotoxin-induced uveitis (Hoekzema et al. 1991 1991 1991 There is growing evidence regarding the importance of the microbiome in a diverse range of diseases. Changes to the respiratory microbiome are shown to be intrinsically related to clinical perturbations in a range of chronic lung diseases, including asthma (Huang et al. 2011 2014 2014 2024 2013 2023 Ocular–respiratory connection: exploring the role of the nasolacrimal duct The nasolacrimal duct (NLD) acts as the physical bridge between the ocular and respiratory systems, connecting the eye-associated lymphoid tissue and the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue, both of which are pivotal components of the mucosal immune system (Belser et al. 2013 2010 2023 1 2023 2013 1 Fig. 1 Anatomical linkage between the ocular and respiratory system. The nasolacrimal duct acts as the physical connection between the ocular surface and the respiratory tract, demonstrating a probable route for immune, microbial and pathogen interactions in the lung–eye axis. The image depicts the drainage route from the ocular surface to the inferior meatus of the nasal cavity and descension of pathogens into the respiratory system Instances of NLD transmission have been documented in human coronavirus (HKU1), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus genomes using dacryocystorhinostomy samples (Yanık et al. 2021 2021 2023 The movement of eye commensal translocation through the NLD, to the lung, is mirrored by other viruses (Allam et al. 2024 2018 2020 2013 2020 2020 2020 2015 The NLD plays a pivotal role in the physical linkage between the ocular and respiratory systems and facilitates more than tear drainage but the transmission of pathogens. With viral detection throughout the ocular and lacrimal system, the potential exposure of the environment to the respiratory system is depicted and demands further investigation for the safeguarding of both systems. Even during NLD obstruction, the route is still viable for the transmission of pathogens, removing misconceptions about obstructive mechanisms. The implications for understanding these mechanisms can yield progress in both the understanding of pathogen and inflammation movement as well as novel treatment options. The respiratory to ocular system In the nasolacrimal system, two crucial valves exist to intercept tear reflux, the backward passage of tears and constituents from the NLD into the eye: the valve of Hasner and the valve of Rosenmuller. Despite one-way ensuring mechanisms, the force of coughing enables secretions from the nasopharyngeal tract to penetrate the conjunctival sac via the NLD (Yener 2021 2020 2020 2006 2023 The bidirectionality of this anatomical link has not been extensively investigated amongst current literature but cannot be overlooked in its pathogenic-transmission capability. The potential for comprehending such transmission may help disease management via early diagnosis, systemic spread mechanisms, and inflammatory communication between systems. Finally, recognising this interaction can extend to the understanding of respiratory noncommunicable and inflammatory diseases and their impact on the ocular system, allowing for early intervention, such as clinical tear draining and improved prognosis. Viruses Incidence of invasion of the respiratory system through the ocular surface Communication between the ocular and respiratory systems extends to a variety of shared receptors, allowing for pathogen entrance into both systems (Belser et al. 2013 2013 2022 2024 2023 2013 2024 2022 Influenza viruses and the ocular surface The human nasal mucosa and trachea are abundant in alpha2-6-linked epithelial sialic acid (SA) glycoprotein receptors, with the lower respiratory tract being dominated by alpha2-3-linked sialic acids (Belser et al. 2013 2013 2013 2011 2005 2005 2011 2011 2011 2013 Of note, mutations in respiratory viral subtypes have been suggested to play a role in ocular surface infection. Specifically, the substitution of lysine at position 627 in the polymerase basic 2 protein, seen in H7N7 and H5N1 among others, has been postulated to enhance replicative ability of the virus in the human ocular system (Creager et al. 2018 2012 2018 2018 2006 Due to a lack of rigorous investigation surrounding viral entrance through the eye, individuals, including healthcare workers, are often less adherent to eye protection usage. This hypothesis was suggested in 1986 by Gala and colleagues, who found that the use of eye goggles resulted in a decline of RSV infections among both children and adults (Gala et al. 1986 1986 2011 2018 Using a live attenuated influenza viral formulation containing two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and one influenza B strain, engineered to replicate at cool temperatures, Bischoff and colleagues exposed 6 groups of healthy individuals to viral particles via a vibrating-orifice aerosol generator (Bischoff et al. 2011 2011 2011 To further emphasize the importance of ocular protection, the variations between groups 1 and 2 suggest a strong association with group 2 having the lowest amount (5 copies) of detected RNA through RT-qPCR extracted from nasal wash samples (Bischoff et al. 2011 2011 . 2011 Here the reciprocal potential for tropism amongst the eye and lung systems is outlined amongst the influenza viral strains, both human and avian. With the literature elucidating such mechanisms being sparse and experimental evidence in its infancy, further studies should look to uncover the influence of receptor distribution amongst the ocular and respiratory environment and its influence on respiratory exposure. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) family The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), like its predecessor, SARS-CoV, responsible for the 2002 SARS pandemic, enters host cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and is then primed by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), a protease shared by the influenza virus for activation (Glowacka et al. 2011 2020 2022 2023 2020 2013 2021 2021 2020 2021 2021a b 2021a b 2021a b Li and colleagues tested for the expression of ACE2 receptors in human conjunctival tissue to determine expression variations in inflammatory ocular diseases, including conjunctivitis, conjunctival nevi, conjunctival papilloma, conjunctival cyst and conjunctival polyps, against a normal control (Li et al. 2020 P 2020 P 2020 2020 2021 2020 2021a b To address uncertainty surrounding the systemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, Jeong et al . 2022 2022 2022 2022 2022 2022 At both the molecular and clinical levels, a tropism is exhibited by the coronavirus family, highlighting the possibility for ocular entrance. With the pathogenic family being vastly transmissive and having caused multiple pandemics, the susceptibility of the ocular system can bring to light improved transmission-preventing protocols. The presence of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 on the ocular surface epithelium supports the idea of independent viral replication within the ocular surface and its role as a point of viral entry, highlighting the exploitation of the ocular mucosal immune system. Together, the above findings promote the importance of ocular swabs for coronavirus detection and emphasizes the necessity of understanding viral molecular targets. Bacteria Dissemination of bacteria from the lung to the eye Dissemination through the blood, hematogenous spread, has become the most agreed upon mechanism by which bacterial transmission occurs between the lung and eye, as seen in ocular manifestations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 2006 2017 2004 2011 2020 2020 Mycobacterium tuberculosis Aerosols containing M. tuberculosis 2020 2009 2020 2011 2011 2 3 2011 2011 2011 2011 2011 2025 2019 2011 The potential involvement of a lung–eye axis in multiple strains of Mtb translocation has been showcased throughout various animal models and forms of infection. Abhishek and colleagues intravenously injected mice with the H37Rv strain of Mtb (Abhishek et al. 2019 2019 6 2019 2019 Of importance, microarray analysis of the transcriptome of the infected eye detected 12 Mtb genes, five of which ( Rv0962c, Rv0984, Rv2612c, Rv0974c, Rv0971c 2020 2019 2019 - 2016 2020 The potential implications of the lung–eye axis across species and strains of tuberculosis have been inadvertently observed for over 100 years, with the first recorded in 1899, where systemic changes were studied in animals following infection of living bacilli into the arterial circulation (Finnoff 1924 M. bovis 1924 2017 Mycobacterium bovis, 2017 Seventy percent of the rabbits administered with the dead bacterium exhibited ocular inflammation, and 100% of the rabbits injected with the live bacterium developed ocular inflammation (Finnoff 1924 1924 2 2025 1924 2025 Fig. 2 Ocular and respiratory system vascularity within the lung–eye axis. Bacteria and viruses, among other pathogens, can invade the respiratory system through inhalation, allowing for lung infection. Pathogenic transmission to the ocular system can arise through hematogenic dissemination via the common carotid artery and its subsequent branches, the internal carotid artery and the ophthalmic artery, resulting in invasion. The above schematic illustrates the physiological connection linking the ocular and respiratory systems, highlighting potential passage for distant organ immune communication and inflammation More recently, other animal models, such as the zebrafish model, have been used to study the spread of other bacteria strains outside of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex to the ocular system (Takaki et al. 2018 M. marinum 2018 2016 2018 2010 2018 2011 Bacterial transmission from the lung to the eye is not only possible but has been documented in various animal studies (Mathis et al. 2019 Mycobacterium Cancer metastasis Despite minimal literature exploring a connection between the ocular and respiratory system in cancer, the proposal has been around for over 100 years, tracing back to the nineteenth century and built upon in 1926. Tooker assumed that carcinomas in the choroid and iris are secondary, with documented primary carcinoma arising from other organs, namely, the breast and lung (Tooker 1926 1926 1926 2014 2024 A 142-patient evaluation study of uveal (choroid, ciliary body and iris) metastasis concluded that lung cancer was the most common primary tumour site, accounting for 35% of cases (Shields et al. 1997 2017 2017 Non-small cell lung cancer and the choroid The choroid, being one of the highest receivers of blood, has a relatively high incidence of non-small cell lung cancer metastasis from the lung (NSCLC) (Riess et al. 2013 2013 2014 2014 2021a b 2014 2014 2014 Due to gaps in the literature, no definitive mechanism has been established, yet hypotheses of metastasis have been suggested. The anatomical–mechanical mechanism suggests probable involvement of the vascular system to the choroid, yet this is discredited due to the lack of afferent lymphatics vessels in the choroid and points to hematogenous dissemination as the primary mechanism (Mathis et al. 2019 2021 The posterior ciliary arteries, a branch of the ophthalmic artery, provide abundant blood supply to the choroid and offer access of tumour emboli to capillary beds within the ocular structure (Fig. 2 2021 2021a b Paget’s “seed and soil” theory for metastatic cancer advocates that tumour cells demonstrate preferences when metastasizing, determined by compatibility of the tumour emboli (seed) and microenvironment (soil) (Akhtar et al. 2019 2021a b 2021a b Finally, arterial infiltration of circulating tumours promotes emboli access to the “soil” via the loosely attached capillary endothelial cells in the choroid, as represented in ocular metastasis of squamous cell lung cancer, where the microenvironment of the iris allows for successful seeding of tumour cells despite comparably less blood flow than the choroid (Hiraki et al. 1998 2021a b 2021a b 1979 Lung cancer and the ocular surface While choroidal metastasis is more frequently documented, the anterior segment, including the conjunctiva of the eye, has also been subjected to lung carcinoma metastasis. The mechanism of hematogenous spread is supported by the higher incidence of choroidal metastasis, a region with rich blood supply, compared to the anteriorly located conjunctiva, ciliary body, and iris (Karunanithi et al. 2014 1926 2 In another study, a 50-year-old male was found with a vascularised nodule on the palpebral conjunctiva and diagnosed with highly aggressive stage IV NSCLC (Chew et al. 2014 2016 2016 Immune system crosstalk in cancer metastasis With immunology at the forefront of the lung–eye axis, the complex interplay of these immune systems may very well extend to cancer-associated diseases that cross into functionally distinct systems. The eye is home to an immune privileged site, consisting of tight junction barriers creating a blood–retinal barrier (BRB), and vascular endothelium, along with immunosuppressive factors, supporting a sanctuary resistance to immune threats in systemic circulation (Qu et al. 2021a b 2018 2007 2010 2007 2007 1996 1996 1996 Concurrently, dysbiosis in the lung microbiome involvement has been suggested in immune modulation and tumour migration to distant sites, including the eye. A KP mouse model of lung cancer was infected with Veiollena parvula 2021 2021 Prevotella P Veillonella P 2025 P 2025 Lung cancer metastasis from the eye It is important to recognize the potential for bidirectionality of metastatic spread of cancers between the ocular and the respiratory systems. Rishi et al . 2015 2015 2015 2015 1995 Robinson et al . 2006 2006 2016 2016 2016 . 2016 With lung cancer becoming more prevalent in recent times, the ocular implications are becoming vital to comprehend for potential biomarkers and metastatic activity. A clear translational gap exists between the clinical manifestations of ocular metastasis in patients and the ability of experimental models to replicate the process, highlighting a need for more robust approaches and investigation. Such models could utilise zebrafish with transparent architecture and human-like ocular structures to follow cancer cell circulation. Furthermore, it has been substantiated that a lack of understanding about said pathways has yielded faster mortality rates and unsuitable treatment options. Being that metastasis to the eye is an initial symptom of advanced lung cancer, improving understanding of this area can lead to earlier detection and more appropriate planning. Finally, monitoring of the ocular tissues, should be implemented to cancer observations for both clinicians and patients for improving prognosis. Glaucoma and chronic lung diseases Glaucoma Glaucoma is the primary cause of irrevocable blindness across the world, with more than a 31% increase in incidence between 2010 and 2020 and impacting up to 79.6 million individuals in 2020 (Flaxman et al. 2017 2023 2021 3 2006 2023 2023 2018 2021 Fig. 3 Chronic respiratory disease impact on glaucoma pathology. This figure highlights the potential communication between the ocular and respiratory systems, accentuating the impact of hypoxia induction (HIF-1a), oxidative stress (O-2) and inflammation in disease acceleration and pathogenesis. Key inflammatory signalling molecules, including NF-kB and TNF-a, are emphasized, prompting their role in inflammatory responses, including neutrophil and lymphocyte activation, culminating in vasoconstriction along with hypoxia-induced mechanisms. Ocular implications, encompassing optic nerve damage, retinal ganglion cell depletion, optic disc cupping and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thinning, are frequently noted in illnesses related to systemic hypoxia and inflammation of which is prevalent in COPD and OSA. The mechanisms observed postulate the existence of a bidirectional relationship between the lung and eye, with manifestations of inflammation and oxygen deficiency conducing to ocular and pulmonary pathophysiology Glaucoma and COPD Due to a lack of documented systemic impact in glaucoma, pulmonary function has sustained little consideration in its pathogenesis. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has a high global prevalence with a rising trend and system-wide repercussions that include systemic inflammation, hypoxia, oxidative stress, and vascular dysfunction (Nucera et al. 2022 2018 2020 2024 2012 . 2012 Ocular structures, including the choroid, RNFL, and retinal vascular vessels, are suspected to be affected by the pulmonary disease as evidenced by Ozcimen and colleagues (Ozcimen et al. 2016 2016 2016 2016 2016 2016 Ugurlu et al . 2018 2015 2015 2022 2024 2002 2018 A 2022 study from Korea investigated the presence of OAG in female with COPD against females with normal pulmonary performance (Lee et al. 2022 p 2022 A possible sex difference may be highlighted in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and is further supported when considering the divergence of disease courses compared to males. In COPD, females tend to be subjected to higher recurrence of exacerbations, greater airway inflammation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17 (Torres et al. 2007 2011 2019 2019 2022 2019 2013 2022 To summarise, the above section offers evidence of COPD-related mechanisms influencing glaucoma progression through the induced hypoxia and its downstream effects. Furthermore, this section has demonstrated the involvement of hypoxia and oxidative stress on the hallmark characteristic, RGC loss, in the absence of elevated IOP. Despite early stages of the above literature, numerous occasions of a relationship have been demonstrated with pathogenesis separate from IOP and in multiple forms of the degenerative disease. Finally, differences not yet explored have been noted in glaucomatous patients with COPD, including sex implications, and offer new routes of investigation for a better understanding of both diseases and the interplay between them. Importantly, the lung–eye axis becomes more prevalent when considering the correlation between hypoxia-induced mechanisms and structural changes present in jeopardised lung function, as mentioned earlier. Finally, the evidence presents a new scope, viewing altered pulmonary function as a risk factor for glaucoma, pushing future research to further investigate this relationship. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and glaucoma Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic respiratory disease, existing under the umbrella term of sleep apnea, and is one of the most ubiquitous respiratory diseases in patient care (McNicholas 2009 2012 2012 2010 1997 2015 2000 1998 . , 2024 2024 With an ocular connection established, hypotheses have postulated implications of the upper respiratory disease in glaucoma pathogenesis. Walsh and Montplaisir initially proposed a possible relationship, noting more severe glaucoma correlated with more, and longer, episodes of sleep apnoea in the same generation (Walsh & Montplaisir 1982 1999 1999 1999 1999 Similar to COPD–glaucoma implications, RNFL thinning has been observed in OSA patients and has resulted in glaucomatous symptoms. Lin and colleagues undertook an investigation comparing RNFL thickness and optic nerve head measurements in OSA/hypopnea patients (Lin et al. 2011 p 2011 Furthering the pathogenic role of OSA in glaucoma, Yamada et al . 2018 2018 2018 2011 2018 . 2019 2019 2019 The implication of the chronic upper respiratory disease, OSA, has demonstrated mechanisms which can cause glaucomatous characteristics to worsen. Both structural and functional evidence exists and thereby implicates the role of the respiratory system in the health of the ocular system. The lung–eye axis is supported by the above section through the inflammatory markers, structural, and functional alterations induced by the respiratory implications. Such changes have included those directly afflicted in the degenerative disease, glaucoma, encompassing RGC loss, thinning of the RNFL and compromised oxygen supplementation, all of which have been evidenced apparent in OSA. Endothelin-1 and the lung–eye axis Endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been observed to be elevated both in the pulmonary system and in systemic circulation of patients with chronic respiratory diseases, namely, COPD and OSA. The vasoconstrictor protein is secreted by epithelial cells in both the airway and ocular system and has been notably elevated through prolonged hypoxia, as seen in COPD and OSA, resulting in vascular alterations (Nikolaou et al. 2003 2016 2010 2017 2007 2001 P 2024 2003 2006 Mechanism of endothelin-1 Being the most potent vasoconstrictor known, ET-1 advances the degeneration of axons of the optic nerve via vascular dysregulation, and activates apoptosis in RGCs, with their axons predominantly composing the RNFL, resulting in thinning of the layer (Kazantzis et al. 2024 2014 A 2010 A 2010 2010 2009 2011 Endothelin-1 in glaucoma pathogenesis Despite a lack of extensive investigation, ET-1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of varying glaucomatous subtypes, including POAG, ACG and NTG (Li et al. 2016 2013 . 2016 2016 The original research by Chen et al . 2013 2013 . 2023 2023 2022 2023 2016 2023 2024 The pathophysiological connection between glaucoma, COPD, and OSA is critical for the understanding of all three diseases. The demonstrated shared risk factors of hypoxia and oxidative stress suggest an underlying link with the potential for early indications and biomarkers of glaucoma and respiratory disease management. Acknowledging the inter-relationships between these diseases can optimise treatments and understanding the fluctuations in blood vessel function, including vessel diameter and resistance to prepare better treatment options. Conclusions and future directions Despite the infancy of the lung–eye axis field, implications of a connection between the respiratory and ocular systems have been around since the 1800 s, with the implication of cancer metastasis from the lung to the eye. Since its initial inception, associations have been documented throughout diseases, ranging from acute bacterial and viral infections to chronic conditions, where immune system and microbiome have been suggested to communicate and affect systemic health. The anatomical bridge, the nasolacrimal duct (NLD), has been delved into as a point of transmission for both acute and cancerous diseases, summating in evidence for pathogen transfer as well as a bidirectional pathway for malignant tumours. This review has highlighted the process of cancer metastasis, with a focus on malignant transfer through hematogenous spread and further postulates the bidirectionality regarding transmission from the eye to the lung, with limited previous literature focusing on the unidirectional movement of lung to eye metastasis. The connection established here has previously been underexplored and prompts further investigation. Chronic respiratory diseases, including OSA and COPD, are discussed in relation to a potential sharing of pathophysiological mechanisms to chronic ocular diseases, namely, glaucoma. The frequent hypoxia amongst such diseases is characterised and, together with vascular dysfunction and increased ET-1 expression, are explored as a potential connection within worsening respiratory and eye health. With axial networks, the eye–gut and gut–lung, gaining further traction and investigation in the scientific community, the potential influence of systemic crosstalk is becoming more prevalent. The interconnection of these axes offers a broad spectrum for future research, suggesting that human health may be far more reliant on intersystem linkages than previously thought. With the notion of a lung–eye axis still in its inception, the future of literature should focus on closing the gaps regarding systemic interaction. The microbiome interactions between the ocular and respiratory system represent an area lacking in understanding, particularly the specific communication between mucosal immunity of which both systems have. Studies going forward should explore the ocular microbial communities, as the tissue was originally assumed devoid of bacteria, and the implications such species may have in the cross-communication of inflammatory conditions. While the idea of ocular metastasis in cancer and bacteria has been present for over 100 years, specific mechanisms, be it hematogenous or lymphatic, are not yet known, demonstrating the need for future research to investigate biomarkers expressed in early inflammation to allow for specific monitoring and targeted therapies. The involvement of hypoxia-induced damage has been implicated across respiratory conditions and ocular diseases, with inter-relationships between the systems progressing, and possibly accelerating, diseases. The prevalence of hypoxic pathways between these systems should be explored, allowing potential therapies, such as oxygen supplementation, to enable the extent of hypoxic involvement in the development of disease. The introduction of the lung–eye axis has allowed for research to come to light in the impact of the respiratory system on the ocular system; however, the bidirectional relationship of the eye’s impact on the pulmonary system should be further investigated. Such investigations could yield inflammatory mediators expressed in the lungs of ocular-diseased patients, allowing for a stronger understanding of the shared pathophysiology in disease states. Finally, long-term studies, with a focus on the crosstalk between the ocular and respiratory systems during disease progression with an emphasis on the acceleration on disease severity and pulmonary medications that have off-target ocular implications, as seen in some asthmatic medications. Such studies may offer insight into treatment plans and better mechanistic understandings of systemic communication under therapeutic intervention. The complex field of the lung–eye axis is a new area with little understanding yet vast potential for its role in human health. The interplay between these systems highlights the idea of crosstalk throughout systems. New insights and therapeutic strategies can not only fill voids in the understanding of the ocular and respiratory system but may also elucidate similar channels of interaction between other systems. Looking across all disease states, acute, chronic, and cancerous, a relationship appears prevalent across the eye and lung and may open a new world for innovative treatments and new understanding to human health.
