Ligase-recruiting ligands deliver ubiquitin ligases like E3 ligase to the Protein of Interest (POI). The vicinity of the POI-PROTAC-E3 ternary complex enables the E3 ligase to ubiquitinate the surface lysine residues of the POI. The Ubiquitin–Proteasome System (UPS) then degrades the POI. However, despite the considerable advances in the design of PROTACs targeting several types of enzymes and receptors, this strategy is still facing the challenges of precision target delivery and duration of action. In this review, we highlight the recent approaches for the development of PROTAC prodrugs or pro-PROTAC to control the delivery of PROTACs and achieve the required on-target exposure. This strategy may facilitate the application of the PROTAC technology and expand its clinical benefits.

Introduction Proteolysis Targeting Chimera (PROTAC) technology is a revolutionary approach designed to induce protein degradation. It offers a unique solution to deal with the limitations of traditional small-molecule drugs. The PROTAC concept was developed by the Crews and Deshaies groups in 2001. Since then, it has been efficiently employed to target various functional proteins with different subcellular localizations, especially in the degradation of several kinases implicated in cancer. PROTACs were found advantageous in overcoming resistance induced by the protein target overexpression or mutation compared to small molecule inhibitors [ 1 2 3 4 PROTACs consist of three main components: a ligand that binds to the target protein or the Protein of Interest (POI), an E3 ligase-binding ligand, and a linker connecting the two moieties ( Figure 1 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 As of the date of this review, there are no FDA-approved PROTAC drugs on the market. However, these hybrid molecules have demonstrated unique advantages in addressing several drug targets, and some representative PROTACs are being studied in clinical trials for the treatment of cancers and other diseases, such as neurodegenerative and immune system disorders [ 13 14 15 16 14 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Figure 1 ( A B C B C Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy 21 PROTACs significantly reduce multiple genetic or phenotypic resistances, which are typically developed by protein targets against small molecules through mutation and overexpression. An example is the resistance developed by the androgen receptor against Enzalutamide. In addition, PROTACs possess additional advantages related to their effective therapeutic concentration. There is a need to sustain a specific concentration of the traditional small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) to achieve a sufficient level of occupancy at the active site of a protein of interest (POI), eventually interfering with the biological process. In contrast, the targeted protein ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation are catalytic in nature, which permits a minor concentration of PROTACs to elicit enhanced biological activities [ 24 25 26 27 28 Despite the prominent advantages of PROTACs, they have a number of disadvantages. First, PROTACs are less selective or non-specific to the malformed cells or the disease-causing proteins, leading to some side effects and toxicity. Thus, careful consideration is needed while designing novel PROTACs to precisely target the proteins implicated in the disease. Second, low expression and/or mutation of the recruited E3 ligase may lead to resistance of the target protein to degradation, negatively influencing the PROTAC efficacy. Latent PROTACs or pro-PROTACs are protected with various labile groups that can be selectively removed under certain physiological or experimentally induced conditions, releasing the biologically active form. PROTAC latentiation could serve the following purposes: (1) selective targeting of oncogenic proteins; (2) prolonging the biological action; (3) selectively investigating poorly studied protein signaling pathways in vitro. The development of PROTACs has been extensively reviewed in recent literature. However, our review focuses on the emerging strategies to develop “prodrugs” of PROTAC (pro-PROTAC). These strategies address the inherent limitations by offering a controlled release of PROTAC molecules, thereby enhancing on-target exposure and potentially expanding the clinical application of this groundbreaking technology. Notably, only a few reviews covered the concept of PROTAC prodrugs, especially for tuning the on-target effect and avoiding toxicity [ 6 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 2. Photocaged PROTACs (opto-PROTACs) One of the most interesting approaches for latentiation is the design of photocleavable PROTACs, which are protected or “caged” with a photolabile group such as 4,5-dimethoxy-2-nitrobenzyl moiety (DMNB). In this approach, a light with a specific wavelength is used to activate and release the functional PROTACs from the caged ones ( Figure 2 36 PROTAC caging is mostly achieved by installing a photolabile group on the −NH of the glutarimide group of the Cereblon (CRBN) ligand or the hydroxyl group of the Von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) ligand. This moiety should prevent the critical H-bond interactions with the corresponding E3 ligase, thus inhibiting the formation of the ternary complex needed for ubiquitination of the protein of interest. Another strategy is to install the caging group on the ligand targeting the POI, hindering the biological target engagement. One of the first examples of photocaged PROTACs is the work by Xue et al., who used the DMNB group to develop BRD4-targeting photocaged degraders (compounds 1 2 Figure 3 37 3 36 6 38 39 3. In-Cell Click-Formed Proteolysis-Targeting Chimeras (CLIPTAC) The properties of current PROTACs may limit their potential use for protein degradation in vivo. For instance, the incorporation of both a target protein-ligand and an E3 ligase recruiting element leads to hetero-bifunctional molecules characterized by having high molecular weight and polar surface area, typically in the range 800–1000 Da and ~200 Å 2 37 40 41 42 41 43 To overcome these problems, in 2016, Lebraud and his colleagues developed a new strategy for the development of functional PROTACs [ 41 trans 43 44 trans Figure 4 42 1/2 1/2 1/2 1/2 Copper (Cu) is a vital element for humans with an essential role in cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Studies showed that Cu concentration was 46% higher in certain cancer tissues than in the normal ones. Thus, tumor-targeted therapies based on this differential tissue distribution have been developed [ 45 +1 Figure 5 12 13 14 15 46 47 4. Folate PROTAC As mentioned above, a downside of certain PROTACs is their lack of selectivity towards the biological target of interest, leading to the degradation of both healthy and defective proteins inside the cells. This is sometimes inherent in the design due to the poor selectivity of the small molecule ligand used to target the POI [ 48 Researchers have identified the folate receptor (FOLR1) as a biomarker for tumor cells in ovarian, breast, and lung cancers [ 32 49 48 50 51 Figure 6 52 53 54 54 55 Figure 6 53 54 55 53 5. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) PROTAC Hydrogen peroxide, superoxide radicals, and hydroxyl radicals have an impact on oxidative stress and cellular signaling in various biological systems [ 32 32 56 Scientists at ShanghaiTech University introduced a series of ROS-activated PROTACs that recruit CRBN E3 ligase for the selective degradation of BRD3. The prodrug contained an aryl boronic acid acting as a cage installed on the Lenalidomide ligand (19 in Figure 7 56 2 2 56 Furthermore, another research group from China designed a VHL-based pro-PROTAC where the hydroxy group of the VHL ligand was caged with an aryl boronic ester; thus, preventing the E3 ligase recruitment (20 in Figure 7 57 57 58 58 6. Hypoxia-Activated PROTAC Hypoxia is one of the solid tumor’s hallmarks and one distinguishing feature that occurs due to a mismatch in oxygen consumption and delivery [ 59 Figure 8 59 60 61 62 Del19 63 63 Del19 23 64 50 Recently, Do et al. introduced a novel enzyme-based clicking PROTACs (ENCTACs) strategy [ 65 24 65 7. Radiotherapy-Activated PROTAC (RT-PROTAC) X-ray radiation therapy is a first-line clinical treatment for cancer [ 66 67 68 69 70 71 Figure 9 72 Xu et al. focused on developing an X-ray radiation-responsive PROTAC nanomicelle (RCNprotac) for tumor-specific proteolysis-enhanced radiotherapy. They aimed to integrate radiotherapy with protein degradation-mediated radiosensitization to prevent the repair of DNA and, thus, optimize anti-tumor therapy and avoid non-target toxicity [ 73 74 75 76 Figure 9 73 77 73 8. Semiconducting Polymer Nano-PROTAC (SPNpro) Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of malignancies by activating innate and adaptive immune systems. However, fear of the development of immune-related adverse effects led to low patient response and restricted clinical trials [ 78 79 78 79 80 78 Figure 10 80 81 82 78 82 Figure 10 Figure 10 79 Moreover, SPNpro can be activated by photoirradiation as it generates singlet oxygen ( 1 2 1 2 1 2 80 1 2 1 2 9. Poly-PROTAC Recently, Gao et al. reported the development of a series of polymer-based PROTACs (Poly-PROTACs) arranged into micellar nanoparticles to induce BRD4 degradation to provide precise cancer therapy [ 83 Figure 11 83 The Poly-PROTAC NPs were i.v. administered 2 h after the DBCO-modified pretargeted NPs. This allowed the selective targeting of the tumor tissues, followed by sequential cleavage of the Poly-PROTACs by extracellular matrix metalloproteinase-2 and the intracellular acidic and reductive tumor microenvironment. Interestingly, these techniques showed several advantages over the conventional PROTAC approach, including (i) prolongation of the blood circulation time; (ii) higher tumor accumulation (3.9-fold) than their small molecule counterparts; (iii) the availability of several methods of activation (extracellular MMP-2, intracellular acidity, and reduction with glutathione) to release the active PROTACs. The study demonstrated that the administration of the small molecule PROTAC alone slightly suppressed the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in vitro. However, the combination of the bioorthogonal NPs dramatically inhibited 95% of tumor growth. Moreover, the co-administration of the pretargeted NPs with the Poly-PROTACs prolonged the survival of the tumor-bearing mice by 40% compared to those that received the Poly-PROTACs only. Collectively, these results highlight the great potential of this strategy for selective and prolonged delivery of the anti-cancer PROTACs to the tumor sites [ 83 10. Challenges and Perspective The utilization of PROTACs in drug development presents both promise and obstacles. While PROTACs offer a unique approach by targeting proteins for degradation rather than inhibition, several challenges impede their clinical translation. One significant hurdle is achieving specificity, as PROTACs must precisely recognize the target protein amidst a complex cellular environment to avoid off-target effects. Additionally, issues related to pharmacokinetics, such as stability and bioavailability, require careful optimization to ensure effective drug delivery. Furthermore, the potential for immunogenicity and toxicity remains a concern, necessitating thorough preclinical evaluation. Transforming the PROTAC into a prodrug can add to the complications of the situation, requiring additional synthetic steps and more careful optimization of the pharmacokinetic properties. Generally, the challenges facing the development of PROTAC prodrugs are related to three aspects of the drug discovery process: (i) medicinal chemistry, (ii) bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, (iii) in vivo activation [ 18 84 85 86 84 87 88 Finally, it is imperative to predict the off-target effects of not only the PROTAC but also its metabolites, including the “promoiety” upon its cleavage. Like with any prodrug, the rate of release of the active form of the PROTAC should be carefully studied and tailored to ensure the delivery of the appropriate therapeutic dose. For instance, the opto-PROTAC developed so far can only target skin and blood diseases due to the low tissue penetration of the activating UV radiation. On the other hand, prolonged exposure to these UV wavelengths may lead to DNA damage. Therefore, the development of novel caging groups that can be cleaved using near-IR radiation could open new avenues for the clinical applications of opto-PROTACs. Despite these challenges, the innovative mechanism of PROTACs holds immense potential for addressing previously undruggable targets and advancing precision medicine. The limitations in the scope of this review include the discussion of the toxicity that could be imparted by the “pro moiety” as well as the pharmacokinetic challenge resulting from increasing the bulkiness and, probably, the lipophilicity of the already large PROTAC molecule. These limitations, among others, will be the subject of our future mini-review. 11. Methods To make our literature survey as comprehensive as possible, we performed two searches using the Reaxys database. First, we searched for the keyword “pro-PROTAC” in the publication titles or abstracts to retrieve 169 documents. Then, we searched for the more general term “PROTAC” and obtained 2040 original research titles, which were screened to retrieve any documents describing a PROTAC prodrug. The search was performed on 1 April 2025, and the review covers the prodrugs of PROTAC published till that date. Chemical structures were prepared using ACD Chemsketch Version 12 (Advanced Chemistry Development Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada).
