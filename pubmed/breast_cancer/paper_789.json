This article is available from https://cureus.com/articles/364688-the-preclinical-effects-of-prolonged-intermittent-fasting-in-an-animal-model-on-the-development-of-multiple-sclerosis-pathology Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated neurological disorder that affects many individuals globally, with a marked female predominance. MS is characterized by demyelination within the central nervous system (CNS), leading to impaired synaptic transmission and a wide range of neurological symptoms, including visual disturbances, motor dysfunction, cognitive decline, and vertigo. The pathophysiology of MS involves autoreactive white blood cells attacking the myelin sheath, resulting in lesion formation and progressive neuronal damage. Despite advancements in pharmacologic therapies, such as interferons, chemotherapeutic agents, and immunosuppressants like glatiramer acetate and Novantrone, current treatments primarily aim to mitigate symptoms or delay disease progression, often at the cost of severe side effects. These therapies do not address the root causes of the disease, and patient responses vary significantly. Recent research has explored novel approaches to MS management, including non-pharmacologic interventions. This paper proposes the use of prolonged intermittent fasting (IF) (>6 months) as a therapeutic strategy for MS. Emerging preclinical evidence, particularly in animal models, suggests that IF may reduce neuroinflammation, promote remyelination, and improve motor outcomes, thereby enhancing quality of life while minimizing reliance on medications with potentially life-threatening adverse effects. These findings come from the existing literature and are not derived from the present study, but they provide a rationale for further preclinical investigation. Although clinical data remains limited, this proposal highlights the need for further investigation into IF as a promising adjunct or alternative treatment modality for MS. daily caloric restriction inflammation intermittent fasting multiple sclerosis neurodegeneration nutrition and metabolism relapse-remitting symptomatic management of multiple sclerosis pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction and background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a very prevalent disease, affecting roughly 302 out of 100,000 persons in the twenty-first century, amassing nearly two-and-a-half million individuals globally. Women are three times more likely to develop MS [ 1 1 2 MS can be considered an autoimmune condition because our immune system is destroying our axons, which aid in the conduction of electric impulses in the central nervous system (CNS). The white blood cells of our body, which are of paramount importance to our immune system, recognize the insulating layer as foreign and start attacking the myelin, causing vision loss, motor issues, and other vital processes that require functioning nerve conduction. This can lead to the development of lesions that may partially or permanently block the electrical impulse required to lift an arm or move a leg. A large area of research in academia today includes developing proper treatment and potential cures for patients with ongoing MS; the MS Research Program at the United States Department of Defense was granted $16 million for MS research alone [ 2 Current MS treatments The current research is focused on developing pharmaceutical treatments that range from anti-inflammatories, chemotherapies, and steroidal drugs, all of which try to treat or dampen the hallmark symptoms of MS. Popular drugs taken today for MS include Avonex, Betaseron, Novantrone, and many others [ 2 2 2 Intermittent fasting as a therapeutic approach This proposal examines prolonged intermittent fasting (IF) (>6 months) as an intervention in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. Although the benefits of caloric restriction in this context have not been experimentally tested, this paper aims to discuss how IF may influence MS-like symptoms in preclinical models, with potential implications for future human research. IF has been heavily implicated in scientific literature as a way to improve metabolism and provide cognitive benefits [ 3 3 4 5 6 Key variables A possible confounding factor of this finding includes significantly altering the diet in a patient with T2DM and how this change can cause drastic results in overall metabolism and energy expenditure. Inflammation and MS are heavily linked when looking at previous research. Moreover, the two are connected by the idea that an increase in axonal demyelination is directly proportional to a sudden increase in acute inflammation [ 6 3 Figure 1 6 6 7 7 Figure 1 Inflammatory pathways upregulated in the hippocampus during MS and the secondary messengers involved. A: Neurons in the dentate gyrus (yellow) receive inputs from the entorhinal cortex (EC), which acts as a conduit for sensory information originating from higher cerebral cortical regions involved in processing sensory inputs and internally generated cognitive functions. Neurons in the hippocampus are crucial for learning and memory and are particularly vulnerable to dysfunction and degeneration in conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and epilepsy. B: Glutamate, BDNF, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) activate signaling pathways that enhance neuronal bioenergetics and protect neurons from neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic injury. BDNF: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor; mTOR: mammalian target of rapamycin; MS: multiple sclerosis Source: Reference [ 8 Review Different forms of IF for mice and homo sapiens IF is often perceived by the general public as a form of extreme restriction or as being synonymous with “starving oneself,” which may contribute to misconceptions. However, the scientific use of IF encompasses structured dietary approaches that should be described in detail. Three popular and widely adopted fasting protocols are used today: alternate-day fasting, whole-day fasting, and time-restricted eating [ 3 3 5 9 In mouse model studies, however, IF and time-restricted eating have shown auspicious results regarding the alleviation of cognitive impairment and increased mental acuity across the board [ 10 10 11 Specific aims The primary aim of this study is to assess whether prolonged IF may have beneficial effects on hallmark symptoms associated with MS in the experimental autoimmune EAE mouse model. These symptoms include cognitive, motor, sensory, and other neurological impairments. This study is exploratory in nature and intended to generate preclinical evidence to guide future investigations in humans. IF is a time-restricted eating schedule where the body's metabolism is downregulated for an extended period, typically 14 to 18 hours. This method of feeding has gained popularity in modern society because of its potential for weight loss and longevity [ 1 12 In addition to proper adherence to IF, intake of specific food groups during non-fasting periods should be studied across the board via ratios of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. For example, research could further assess the breakdown of micronutrients concerning complex vs. non-complex carbs, saturated fats, unsaturated fats, lean protein vs. animal protein, etc. This variable of food choice could introduce confounding factors in our results because, as we know, different foods are processed differently by each individual based on varying metabolisms, based on criteria such as weight, fat metabolism, energy expenditure, and weight changes. It is also important to note that mice and humans differ significantly in their metabolism, which limits the direct generalizability of findings from the EAE model to human MS outcomes. Recognizing this distinction reinforces the preclinical scope of the present study. As an exploratory preclinical study, this work may generate evidence suggesting that IF could potentially delay or alleviate MS-like symptoms in the EAE mouse model. Such findings would not establish clinical conclusions but could provide valuable insight into mechanisms affecting cognitive dysfunction, motor control, and muscle weakness, thereby supporting the rationale for future investigation in humans. To fully understand the effect of IF on patients with MS, it is critical to look at what is happening intracellularly. To do this, the proposed study will look at specific transcription factors that are upregulated and/or downregulated after placing the MS patients on a strict, timed diet. Furthermore, specific secondary messenger cascades and signaling pathways will be closely observed before, during, and after the study. Specific pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), will be measured. Studies in the past have shown that there is a possibility that inflammatory pathways are activated independently of neurodegenerative-associated MS, while others have shown that the two are interrelated [ 3 3 Three main transcription factors, FOXP3, SOX30, and NFAT5, will be examined to determine the specific intracellular signaling. These three transcription factors have been implicated in activating pro-inflammatory cytokines within MS candidates [ 13 Does IF Mimic Caloric Restriction, or Are There Two Separate Activated Pathways? If it can be deduced that calorie restriction and IF show similar outcomes, most likely identical pathways are activated within the mouse model. This can eventually lead to more future research where calorie restriction and IF are adopted in the same mouse model to observe if the effects are amplified and if this is a safe practice method for MS patients. This study’s approach to answering these questions will start with necessary and insightful background research and try to discover how MS is connected to caloric restriction and IF. Intermittent fasting and multiple sclerosis From previous research, we understand that fasting decreases insulin levels, aids in cellular repair, elevates human growth hormones, and helps regulate genes that mediate longevity and protection from disease [ 3 14 14 2 14 Figure 2 Cytokine levels were measured in MS-induced C57BL/6 mice for the intermittent fasting control group. This data was acquired by adopting cytokine content in supernatant and ELISA kit quantification. MS: Multiple sclerosis; TNF-alpha: tumor necrosis factor-alpha; IL-12: interleukin-12; IL-10: interleukin-10 Source: Ref [ 14 Another essential aspect to consider for this study is how the human body usually responds under fasting conditions, because there are multiple similarities between regular caloric restriction/typical fasting and IF. Under normal fasting conditions, IF has been proven to decrease resting insulin levels and shift your body's metabolism to breaking down fats for energy. In addition, the human body begins to promote cellular pathways involved in stress resistance, lipolysis, and anti-aging effects [ 8 8 Exploring IF effects on MS with animal models To answer the aims of this research proposal, a specific experimental design needs to be appropriately carried out. For the primary objective of determining if prolonged IF (> 3 months) relieves any hallmark symptoms of MS, a randomized controlled animal experiment is best suited, as there needs to be extensive time to evaluate metabolic changes in the EAE mouse model. The EAE mouse model is popular in scientific studies today to measure MS pathologies in human and mouse models. The process for generating this mouse model from scratch is described below. A total of 20 pathogen-free C57BL/6 mice will be used for this experiment. The sample size was determined based on a power calculation (α=0.05, 80% power) and effect sizes reported in prior EAE studies (Cohen’s d ≈ 1.0-1.2), which indicate that 11-13 mice per group are typically sufficient to detect meaningful differences in cytokine expression and clinical scoring. To allow for potential variability in disease induction and attrition, we conservatively selected 20 mice. This ensures adequate statistical power while adhering to ethical principles of minimizing unnecessary animal use. Then, active immunization will be used to induce MS demyelinating symptoms and neuroinflammation. This active immunization works by injecting a toxin, in most cases, pertussis toxin, to purposely elicit an immune response from the mice. Injection of pertussis toxin induces MS-like symptoms via the induction of the proinflammatory cascade of TGF-β, IL-6, and Th17 in the CNS, which has been seen as essential in the development of the EAE mice model [ 15 Parameters for this study include: the mice must adhere to a rigorous eating schedule, and the mice need to be immune to secondary diseases (verified via screening) such as T2DM, hypertension, immunodeficiency/autoimmune diseases, or any condition that would affect the results of this study. After the 20 randomly selected MS-induced mice are chosen, the next step is administering or outlining a diet for the non-fasting hours. Next, they will be split into two groups, with ten mice following the 16:8 fasting method and the other ten following the 14:10 fasting method, to see if there are significant differences between them. For the methods of the experiment, immunohistochemistry will be utilized to see if there is proper migration in the dentate gyrus from the marginal zone to the submarginal zone, where there is sufficient neuronal proliferation. A lack of migration or proliferation of hippocampal neurons in the dentate gyrus can contribute mainly to the symptoms seen in MS. Before experimentation, data relating to each mouse’s body weight, baseline inflammation measured by cytokine levels and C-reactive protein, and fasting insulin levels in the blood will be recorded. LDL-C, triglycerides, and blood pressure will also be measured. From previous research, these are adequate parameters to measure overall metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction [ 16 17 17 6 3 Figure 3 Chronic EAE mice model that will be used to induce MS and the timeline of pertussis injection EAE: Encephalomyelitis; MS: multiple sclerosis Source: Ref [ 18 After generating the MS mouse model, the next step is to fast the eight-month-old mice for 24 hours and have them injected with cytokine markers that measure pro-inflammatory cytokines. A radiolabeled dye such as fludeoxyglucose (18F) will measure glucose utilization in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus because these are the two areas of the brain that are impacted by MS the most [ 19 19 To measure the expression levels of the chosen transcription factors, we will generate a new transgenic mouse model with the KO of SOX30 while also looking at inflammatory responses within these mice after IF (two mice). This will be done using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, a tool used in gene therapy, where certain genetic diseases, such as MS, can be potentially alleviated. Gene therapy will allow for the insertion of a particular vector carrying a gene of choice into the genome of the recipient. This therapy can replace a damaged gene or restore the total function of the protein. Specific TF’s like FOXP3, SOX30, and NFAT5 will be studied using an SDS-PAGE. These transcription factors have been previously implicated in progressive MS in mouse models as having significant upregulation and are thought to play a significant role in secondary inflammatory processes. At the end of every week, glucose and insulin levels will be measured using HOMA-IR. Inflammatory cytokine levels, specifically IL-1 and IL-6, will be measured in the same time frame to see if there are significant inflammation levels as shown by elevated cytokine levels in blood. In the brain, using F18 radiolabeling and confocal microscopy, we can quantify levels of marked inflammation within the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. At the end of the IF period, data will be collected from all enrolled mice for each parameter (glucose/insulin levels, inflammatory cytokines, and expression levels of SOX30/FOXP3). These measurements are expected to yield 20 data points per group, corresponding to the planned sample size. This reflects the study design rather than the results obtained. Statistical analysis will include one-way ANOVA and t-tests to observe if there is a significant difference between the control mice and the experimental mice. Another experimental measure to be looked at is the demyelination of the spinal cord itself in mice that is induced by activated immunization (EAE). The adopted method is immunohistochemistry and uses LUXOL Fast Blue and Cresyl violet staining. In this stain, the images will have a distinct blue and purple pattern: purple represents the areas of demyelination, and blue represents the still intact myelin. From these images, the proportion of demyelination using the ratio of blue area to purple pattern will be quantified and plotted on a bar graph for each mouse after the three months have concluded. Figure 4 14 Figure 4 Immunohistochemistry results from Cresyl Violet staining IF-1: Intermittent fasting after appearance of the first clinical sign for 10 days, IF-2: Intermittent fasting 30 days post immunization for 10 days, Control-1: normal diet for 21 days, Control-2: normal diet for 40 days Source: Ref [ 14 Inflammation as a catalyst for MS disease progression Inflammation is a key driver in the pathogenesis of MS, contributing to both demyelination and neurodegeneration. MS is primarily mediated by autoreactive T cells, particularly Th1 and Th17 subsets, which infiltrate the CNS after breaching the blood-brain barrier, leading to an inflammatory cascade [ 20 21 22 23 24 Understanding these inflammatory mechanisms has led to the development of disease-modifying therapies that target immune responses, aiming to slow disease progression and mitigate neuronal damage [ 20 Emerging research suggests that dietary interventions, such as IF, may help modulate inflammation in MS by altering immune responses and metabolic pathways. IF has been shown to reduce systemic inflammation and promote a more anti-inflammatory immune profile, which could be beneficial in MS management [ 25 26 27 28 The persistence of inflammation in MS is driven not only by autoreactive T and B cells but also by dysregulated innate immune responses. Microglia and infiltrating macrophages become chronically activated in the MS lesion environment, releasing proinflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitric oxide, which amplify neurotoxicity and contribute to ongoing demyelination [ 29 30 31 32 8 33 Future implications of the study The results of this study point to the significance of IF on MS pathologies. Suppose it is concluded that there is a significant difference; in that case, future questions should be asked. If this method of IF translates to human models, and similar intracellular pathways will be affected, can this therapy be generalized to most individuals affected by MS? Also, suppose there is a marked increase or decrease in the frequency and size of brain lesions measured by the fludeoxyglucose. What does this mean for future experimentation using EAE mouse models using IF protocols? For the last aim, if calorie restriction mimics IF, previous research will be compared to the research gathered from experimentation. Data will be cross-matched to see if it can be hypothesized that calorie restriction mimics IF. If this is the case, many of the proven benefits provided by caloric restriction from prior studies, such as increased cognitive function and anti-aging effects, are also produced from a strict IF diet [ 17 4 It should also be noted that in previous studies, it has been shown that sometimes when first following the IF routine, there is a significant improvement in the MS patient’s symptoms, but then eventually falls back to baseline; this means that there is another possible time component that needs to be accounted for when interpreting results. If there is a considerable reduction in cytokines and overall inflammation after just one week of abiding by the IF diet, it can be a result of the body getting adjusted to a new lifestyle. The results midway and towards the end of the study are more important indicators as to how the mice are adjusting to IF, compared to the first couple of hours or days. Conclusions MS is a prevalent neurodegenerative autoimmune disorder for which current therapies are predominantly pharmacological, with varying levels of effectiveness and a number of serious side effects. IF has been linked to improved weight regulation, reduced systemic inflammation, and favorable metabolic effects in both experimental and clinical settings. These findings provide a rationale for considering IF as a potential non-pharmacological strategy for investigation in MS; however, the current evidence remains preclinical, and there is no direct clinical evidence in MS patients to date. The experimental autoimmune EAE mouse model provides a safe and reproducible means to study the effects of IF without involving human participants. While this model allows mechanistic insights, important physiological differences between mice and humans limit direct translation, underscoring the need for validation in clinical trials. Research in this area remains hypothesis-generating but is promising for understanding inflammatory processes in MS and other autoimmune or neurodegenerative diseases. Because IF has been associated with reductions in systemic inflammation, it represents a promising, cost-effective, non-pharmacological approach worth exploring in the EAE model of MS. However, its applicability to human MS remains unproven, and clinical studies will be required to establish safety and efficacy. To advance toward clinical relevance, future investigations must demonstrate consistent reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines, measurable improvements in demyelination by histopathology, stabilization of glucose-insulin homeostasis, and the absence of adverse immune reactions. Until such criteria are met in well-designed human studies, the role of IF in MS should be regarded as preliminary and exploratory Disclosures Conflicts of interest: Payment/services info: Financial
