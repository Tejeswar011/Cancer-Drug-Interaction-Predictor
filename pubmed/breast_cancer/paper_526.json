Methods We identified women aged 18–75 diagnosed with BC in Ontario from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2019, followed them to December 31, 2023, and identified legal immigrants from the Immigration, Refugee, and Citizenship Canada Permanent Resident (CIC) database. We linked administrative data sources for the date of diagnosis, molecular subtype, death due to breast cancer, and death due to all other causes. Using adjusted competing risks regression (Fine and Gray method), we analyzed the influence of immigration on breast cancer survival and calculated the sub‐distribution hazard ratios (sHR). Results There was no increased risk of death among legal immigrants on univariate or multivariable analysis. They had a sHR of 0.95 (0.77–1.19) on univariate analysis and 1.06 (95% CI: 0.83–1.36) on multivariable analysis for breast cancer deaths, and for other causes of death, 0.63 (0.47–0.83) on univariate analysis, and 0.85 (95% CI: 0.62–1.15) on multivariable analysis compared to long‐term residents. Patients with HER2‐positive status had a lower risk of death from breast cancer and other causes compared to those with triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC). Patients with Stage 2 cancer had a significantly higher hazard of death from breast cancer compared to Stage 1 (HR = 3.72, 95% CI: 2.96–4.66, p Conclusions In Ontario, legal immigrants do not have an increased risk of death from breast cancer or other causes compared to long‐term residents. breast cancer Her‐2 positive immigration status Ontario triple negative Ministry of Health 10.13039/100009647 Ministry of Long‐Term Care 10.13039/501100025090 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:30.09.2025  O.

The Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) provides healthcare benefits for all legal permanent residents. 2.2 Study Design We conducted this population‐based retrospective cohort study by identifying women in the Ontario Cancer Registry between the ages of 18 and 75 diagnosed with breast cancer in Ontario from January 1st, 2012 to December 31st, 2019. We followed them up to December 31st, 2023, and stratified them into two groups: legal immigrants and long‐term residents, using the Immigration, Refugee, and Citizenship Canada Permanent Resident (CIC) database. Legal immigrants were defined as individuals who have been granted the right to live in Canada permanently, having moved from another country from 1986 or later, and therefore registered in the CIC database. Long‐term residents were defined as individuals already established in Canada and not included in the CIC database, including those who relocated between provinces in Canada. Using linked administrative data sources, we extracted information on the date of diagnosis, cancer stage, molecular subtype, demography, ACG System Resource Utilization Band (RUB), death due to breast cancer, and death due to all other causes. We included only Stage 1 and 2 breast cancer patients to ensure a homogenous study population of operable, early stage breast cancer potentially eligible for adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We excluded women with previous breast cancer in the OCR or a history of invasive non‐breast cancer malignancy within 10 years before the diagnosis, male patients, and women with pre‐invasive breast cancer (DCIS). 2.3 Data Sources ICES is a non‐profit research institution in Canada that informs influential research and policy development by utilizing health and social data. Administrative datasets are linked using unique encoded identifiers and analyzed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). Data sources for this study include the Registered Persons Database (RPDB), Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP), Citizenship and Immigration Canada IRCC Permanent Residents Database (CIC), Ontario Cancer Registry (OCR), Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database (CIHI‐DAD), National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (CIHI‐NACRS) database, and the Same Day Surgery (CIHI‐SDS) database. Covariates included the following: Age at diagnosis was recorded from the OCR and categorized into three groups (< 50 years, 50–69 years, and > 70 years). We assessed marginalization using the ethnicity domain of the Ontario Marginalization Index (ONMARG). ONMARG is a census area‐based index used to show differences in marginalization and describe potential inequalities between geographical areas [ 16 17 18 To assess resource utilization and morbidity, we identified each woman's ACG System Resource Utilization Band (RUB) based on OHIP and CIHI records [ 19 2.4 Outcome Measures The primary outcomes were breast cancer‐specific survival, defined as the time from the initial diagnosis to the date of death, specifically due to breast cancer, and the time to death from other causes. These events were treated as competing risks, as one type of death event precludes the occurrence of the other. Patients alive at the end of the study period or lost to follow‐up were censored at the date of last contact. 2.5 Statistical Analysis We compared the baseline covariates of legal immigrants to long‐term residents and between patients who died during follow‐up and those who survived—summary statistics, including median survival times with interquartile ranges (IQR). Cumulative Incidence Functions (CIFS) were calculated and plotted to estimate the probability of death due to breast cancer and death due to other causes over time, accounting for the competing risks. To assess the association between legal immigration status and cause‐specific mortality while adjusting for potential confounders, multivariable competing risks regression models based on the Fine and Gray sub‐distribution hazard (SDH) approach were constructed [ 20 p 3 Results Table 1 p p p p TABLE 1 Study population: Stage 1 and 2 Her‐2 positive and triple‐negative breast cancer by immigration status and vital status.

Our primary finding shows that legal immigrants did not have an increased hazard of death due to either breast cancer‐specific mortality or mortality from other causes after accounting for factors such as Her2 status, cancer stage, RUB score, demographic ethnicity concentration quintile, and age. There was also no increased risk of death among immigrants at either univariate or multivariable analyses. Our analysis confirmed several known prognostic factors consistent with established breast cancer literature [ 1 21 2 22 23 24 25 26 27 Higher resource utilization/morbidity (RUB) scores (Levels 4 and 5) were also associated with increased mortality, particularly from other causes, reflecting higher comorbidity burdens or frailty not fully captured by age alone. This suggests a complex relationship between morbidity and patient survival, which aligns with existing literature on the relationship between healthcare utilization and patient survival rates. For instance, studies have shown that patients with greater healthcare utilization often have more complex health needs, which can complicate treatment and lead to poorer survival outcomes [ 28 5 Strengths A key strength of this study is the application of a competing risks analysis of mortality patterns in this population. Understanding survival outcomes in breast cancer requires understanding the competing risks of other causes of death events that preclude the occurrence of the primary event of interest, death from breast cancer [ 29 26 29 30 6 Limitations While this study contributes valuable insights, limitations should be acknowledged. This research relies on administrative databases and retrospective data, which may lead to biases in patient selection and treatment categorization, as well as potential misclassification and missing data [ 31 32 7 Conclusion In this cohort of Stage 1 and 2 HER‐2 positive and triple‐negative breast cancer patients, being a legal immigrant was not associated with an increased risk of death from either breast cancer‐specific mortality or death from other causes on univariate or multivariable analysis compared to long‐term residents.
