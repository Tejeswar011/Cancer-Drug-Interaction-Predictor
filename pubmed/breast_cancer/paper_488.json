Liver steatosis, characterized by excessive hepatic fat accumulation, is closely linked to metabolic dysfunction and may be associated with infertility. However, the relationship between liver steatosis and female infertility remains unclear. Methods This study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2013–2018, including 1,167 women aged 20–44 years. Liver steatosis was assessed using the Fatty Liver Index (FLI), Hepatic Steatosis Index (HSI), and ZJU index. Infertility status was determined based on self-reported pregnancy history. Weighted multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between liver steatosis and female infertility. Dose-response relationships between liver steatosis and female infertility were explored using weighted restricted cubic spline analysis. Subgroup analysis further investigates the stability and population differences of these associations. ROC curve demonstrates the predictive ability of hepatic steatosis for female infertility. Results Among the participants, 161 women (13.80%) were infertile. Higher values of FLI, HSI and ZJU index were significantly associated with increased prevalence of infertility even after adjusting for multiple covariates. The dose-response relationship was linear for all indices. Subgroup analyses revealed significant interactions in different age, race, marital status and physical activity groups. ROC curve analysis showed no significant difference in the predictive ability of the three indices for infertility. Conclusions This study highlights the significant association between hepatic steatosis and female infertility. However, the FLI, HSI and ZJU index, as independent screening tools for female infertility, have limited roles in clinical applications. Given the limitations of cross-sectional design, further longitudinal studies or intervention studies are needed in the future to explore the causal relationship between hepatic steatosis and female infertility.

Despite the potential link between liver steatosis and female infertility, no large-scale studies have yet investigated this relationship. In light of this, we selected women aged 20–44 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database as the study population, and evaluated liver steatosis using FLI, HSI and ZJU index to investigate the potential relationship between liver steatosis and female infertility. This study aims to provide foundational data and theoretical support in this underexplored area, thereby laying the groundwork for future research. Through risk assessment based on these indices, it is expected to provide clinicians with new auxiliary tools to help identify patients with metabolism-related infertility at an early stage and provide a scientific basis for the development of personalized intervention strategies. Method Study design and population NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) is a national survey led by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [ 16 https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Default.aspx For this research, we extracted data from the NHANES database covering four survey cycles from 2013 to 2018, which included a total of 29,400 participants. On the basis of the exclusion criteria in Fig. 1 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 n 5 n  Fig. 1 The flow chart of inclusion and exclusion criteria in the study Assessment of infertility The Reproductive Health Questionnaire (RHQ section) in NHANES is a number of female-only questions about reproductive health including menstrual history, pregnancy history, and other relevant reproductive conditions. Female infertility is assessed from two questions about pregnancy history (questionnaire RHQ-074 and questionnaire RHQ-076) [ 17 Assessment of liver steatosis We used FLI, HSI and ZJU index to assess liver steatosis. The larger values of these indices typically indicate a higher degree of fat deposition in the liver and a greater degree of liver steatosis [ 18  \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mathrm{FLI}=\\frac{\\mathrm e^{0.953\\ast In\\mathit(TG\\mathit)\\mathit+\\mathit0\\mathit.\\mathit{139}\\mathit\\ast BMI\\mathit+\\mathit0\\mathit.\\mathit{718}\\mathit\\ast In\\mathit(GGT\\mathit)\\mathit+\\mathit0\\mathit.\\mathit{053}\\mathit\\ast WC\\mathit-\\mathit{15}\\mathit.\\mathit{745}}}{1+\\mathrm e^{0.953\\ast\\mathrm{In}\\mathit(\\mathrm{TG}\\mathit)\\mathit+\\mathit0\\mathit.\\mathit{139}\\mathit\\ast\\mathrm{BMI}\\mathit+\\mathit0\\mathit.\\mathit{718}\\mathit\\ast\\mathrm{In}\\mathit(\\mathrm{GGT}\\mathit)\\mathit+\\mathit0\\mathit.\\mathit{053}\\mathit\\ast\\mathrm{WC}\\mathit-\\mathit{15}\\mathit.\\mathit{745}}}\\ast100^{\\left(\\mathrm a\\right)}$$\\end{document}  \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mathrm{HSI}=8\\ast\\frac{\\mathrm{ALT}}{\\mathrm{AST}}+\\mathrm{BMI}+\\mathrm\\alpha^{\\mathrm{Diabetes}}+\\mathrm\\beta^{\\mathrm{Gender}}\\left(\\mathrm b\\right)$$\\end{document}  \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\mathrm{ZJU}\\;\\mathrm{index}=\\mathrm{BMI}+\\mathrm{FPG}+3\\ast\\frac{\\mathrm{ALT}}{\\mathrm{AST}}+\\mathrm{TG}+\\mathrm\\beta^{\\mathrm{Gender}}\\left(\\mathrm c\\right)$$\\end{document} (a) 2 (b) 2 α Diabetes Diabetes Diabetes β Gender Gender Gender (c) 2 β Gender Gender Gender Additional, these participants were categorized into fatty and non-fatty livers based on the fatty liver cut-off values for each index. According to Bedogni et al.’s research, FLI ≥ 60 is regarded as an effective cut-off value for indicating a higher possibility of having fatty liver [ 19 20 21 Assessment of potential covariates The potential covariates considered in this study included demographic characteristics, body measurements, lifestyle, and medical history, which included age, race, education level, marital status, poverty-to-income ratio (PIR), body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2 2 2 2 2 22 Statistical analysis This study strictly followed the analysis guidelines for NHANES data issued by the NCHS of the United States. To correct for complex sampling designs and non-response bias, all analyses used the sampling weights provided by NCHS. When choosing weights, the principle of “least common denominator” should be followed, and the fasting weights wtsaf2 year for specific sub-samples should be adopted. The baseline characteristics of the study participants were delineated on the basis of infertility status. The continuous variables were examined via weighted Mann-Whitney U tests and are expressed as medians and quartiles. The categorical variables were compared via weighted Chi-square test and are described as number (n) and percentage (%). The weighted multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to examine the association of FLI, HSI and ZJU with female infertility across three distinct models, each with a different set of covariates for adjustments. Model 1 adjusted for no variables. Model 2 adjusted for age (categorization), race, education level, poverty and marital status. Model 3 adjusted for age (categorization), race, education level, poverty and marital status, smoking status, alcohol consumption, physical activity, menstrual regularity, pelvic infection disease and age at menarche. The analysis results are presented in terms of the odds ratios (OR) along with its 95% confidence interval (95%CI). The dose-response relationship between these liver steatosis and female infertility was depicted via a weighted restricted cubic spline (RCS) curve in the fully adjusted Model 3. The weighted subgroup analysis was conducted to assess potential factors that could affect the association between liver steatosis and female infertility in Model 3. A cross-product term was included in the weighted logistic regression models to explore the interactions tests with potential modification effects. Furthermore, we identified the fatty liver population among these female participants based on the fatty liver cutoff values for each of these three indices. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the association between fatty liver and female infertility in the same three model. Eventually, we plotted the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to examine the predictability of liver steatosis for female infertility. The area under the curve (AUC) and the delong To determine whether the association between hepatic steatosis indicators and infertility is independent of overall obesity, we conducted a sensitivity analysis. Based on the fully adjusted Model 3, we separately included BMI and WC as covariates to re-evaluate the association between FLI, HSI and ZJU index and female infertility. By comparing the results before and after adjustment, we can better understand the role of obesity in this association. In this study, we utilized the R software environment to carry out the statistical analyses ( https://www.r-project.org/ P Result Baseline characteristic A total of 1,167 women aged 20 to 44 were included in this study, representing 43,669,098 women of the same age in the United States.

The results indicated that when BMI or WC was included, the associations between FLI, HSI and ZJU index and female infertility were no longer significant (Supplementary Table S3). These results indicate that the association between hepatic steatosis indicators and female infertility is significantly weakened after controlling obesity. Discussion In this study, we investigated the association between liver steatosis indices, including the FLI, HSI and ZJU index, and female infertility using NHANES data with 1,167 participants. Our results demonstrated that higher FLI, HSI and ZJU index values were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of female infertility. These associations remained robust even after adjusting for multiple potential confounders, including demographic, lifestyle factors and past personal history. Furthermore, the dose-response relationship analysis suggested a linear correlation between these indices and infertility risk. Additionally, when defining fatty liver using standard cutoff values, we found that FLI-defined and ZJU index-defined fatty liver remained significantly associated with infertility, while HSI-defined fatty liver lost statistical significance after adjusting for confounders. Notably, subgroup analyses indicated significant interactions between these indices and factors such as age, race, marital status and physical activity, suggesting that the relationship between liver steatosis and infertility may vary across different population subgroups. A low AUC value indicates that the predictive ability of these indices in clinical applications is limited and they are not suitable to be used as independent predictive tools for diagnosing or ruling out infertility. On the contrary, these indices may be more suitable to be used as risk markers to indicate the possible risk of infertility in women. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that when BMI or WC was additionally included in the fully adjusted Model 3, the associations between FLI, HSI and ZJU index and female infertility were no longer significant. Our findings align with and expand upon previous studies exploring the relationship between fatty liver and reproductive dysfunction. Recently, some studies have explored the association between hepatic steatosis and female infertility. Wu et al. found that HSI was positively correlated with the incidence of female infertility (OR = 1.02, 95%CI:1.01–1.04; P 24 P 25 26 27 28 29 30 The mechanisms linking hepatic steatosis to female infertility are multifaceted and may involve several interrelated metabolic and endocrine pathways. Insulin resistance is an important risk factor for female infertility, and hepatic steatosis is associated with insulin resistance [ 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 Chronic inflammation is associated with female infertility [ 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 Oxidative stress is associated with infertility in women with hepatic steatosis [ 49 50 51 52 53 54 56 57 This study further reveals significant heterogeneity in the association strength between hepatic steatosis and infertility across different subgroups. We observed significant interactions with age, race, marital status, and physical activity, suggesting these factors may be linked to variations in the hepatic steatosis-infertility association. First, in the age-stratified analysis, the positive correlation between hepatic steatosis and infertility was more significant in young women (aged 20–34). This discovery may be due to the biological feature that the female reproductive system is potentially more sensitive to metabolic disorders during the young reproductive years. Hepatic steatosis, as a marker of early-onset metabolic disorders, has a more prominent association with infertility during the peak childbearing age group. In the group of older women, age-related changes in ovarian function and the mixture of other causes of infertility may relatively weaken the independent associated signals of hepatic steatosis. Second, a stronger hepatic steatosis-infertility association was observed among non-Hispanic White and Mexican American women compared to non-Hispanic Black and other race women. This variation may relate to differences in genetic susceptibility, patterns of hepatic fat accumulation, and lifestyle factors across racial groups [ 58 59 Our findings suggest that FLI and ZJU index may be valuable tools for assessing infertility risk in clinical practice. These indices are easily calculable using routine clinical and laboratory data, making them accessible for use in primary care and reproductive health settings. Given the high prevalence of fatty liver and its association with infertility, incorporating FLI and ZJU index into routine reproductive health assessments could help identify women at higher risk of infertility, allowing for early interventions. The results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that although hepatic steatosis was associated with infertility, this association disappeared after obesity was controlled. This indicates that hepatic steatosis may be more of a sign of obesity rather than an independent causal factor. In other words, obesity may be the main driving factor for female infertility, while hepatic steatosis is merely a metabolic manifestation of obesity. Previous studies have shown that weight loss, dietary modifications, and increased physical activity can improve both fatty liver and reproductive outcomes [ 60 61 The use of NHANES data provides a diverse population sample, enhancing the generalizability of our findings. We accounted for numerous confounders, strengthening the robustness of our results. The use of RCS allowed for a nuanced understanding of the relationship between liver steatosis and infertility. Furthermore, it is necessary to note that when constructing the model, we did not choose to include obesity-related indicators (BMI and WC) as covariates in Model 3, as these indicators are fundamental components of hepatic steatosis related indicators (FLI, HSI and ZJU index). Similarly, the same is true for liver enzymes, blood lipids and blood sugar. Adjusting these indicators in the regression model would overly control the factors on the causal path, thereby possibly masking the potential effect between hepatic steatosis and female infertility. This method enables us to more accurately assess the association between hepatic steatosis as a comprehensive metabolic marker and female infertility. Despite its advantages, this study also has its limitations that should be acknowledged. Given the cross-sectional nature of our study, we cannot determine the temporal sequence of hepatic steatosis and infertility. It is possible that other factors, such as obesity, PCOS, or genetic predispositions, may contribute to both conditions. While our results suggest a significant association between hepatic steatosis and infertility, we cannot definitively conclude that hepatic steatosis directly causes infertility. Future longitudinal or intervention studies are needed to establish causality and to explore the potential mechanisms underlying this association. Another important consideration is the potential for reverse causation. Infertility itself, or its treatment, could lead to changes in weight or lifestyle that might exacerbate fatty liver. For example, the psychological stress of infertility and the treatments involved could lead to weight gain or unhealthy lifestyle choices. Additionally, some treatments for infertility, such as ART, might involve hormonal interventions that could affect metabolic health. While our study design does not allow us to directly assess these potential reverse causal pathways, future research should explore these possibilities to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between hepatic steatosis and infertility. Infertility was defined based on self-reported data, specifically whether the participant had tried to conceive for 12 months without success and had sought medical help. While this definition is practical and aligns with clinical criteria, it has limitations. On the one hand, women who have never attempted to conceive would be automatically classified as ‘non-infertile,’ which could underestimate the true prevalence of infertility, particularly among younger or unmarried women who may have undiagnosed fertility issues. Conversely, some women classified as ‘infertile’ may eventually conceive, indicating that their infertility was temporary. Therefore, our results reflect self-reported difficulty conceiving within the past year rather than confirmed permanent infertility. This highlights the importance of interpreting our results with caution and recognizing the potential for misclassification. On the other hand, the NHANES dataset lacks etiological differentiation in defining infertility, which is a limitation of the data source. It is failed to distinguish between female factor infertility and infertility caused by male partner factors or a combination of both, while male factors account for a considerable proportion of infertility. This may lead to an overestimation of the association between female metabolic health and infertility. In addition, other factors such as blocked fallopian tubes may also lead to infertility and weaken this association. Unfortunately, this information is not available in the NHANES dataset and thus was not included in our analysis. If future research can incorporate relevant data from male partners and more detailed classifications of infertility causes, it will help to more accurately assess the direct relationship between female metabolic health and infertility. Although this study adjusted for numerous confounding factors, there are still some confounding factors that are difficult to include. PCOS is the main cause of anovulatory infertility and often coexists with fatty liver. It may be a common cause of hepatic steatosis and infertility. In addition, other factors such as thyroid diseases and fertility treatments may also have a certain impact on infertility. However, NHANES lacked data on PCOS, thyroid diseases and other related diseases, and thus could not be included in the analysis. Biomarkers measured at a single time point may not accurately reflect chronic diseases. Infertility data was collected through self-reported questionnaires, lacking detailed reproductive history or reproductive medical treatment information, which may introduce recall bias. Self-reported data may underestimate or overestimate the actual prevalence of infertility. Despite this, this data collection method is common in large-scale epidemiological investigations and can provide basic data for subsequent more in-depth research. In our research, we conducted subgroup analyses and interaction effect tests on multiple stratified variables. However, we did not further conduct multiple correction tests on the results, which might lead to the significance of some interactions being caused by accidental factors. In this study, FLI, HSI and ZJU index were used to evaluate hepatic steatosis, which are non-imaging alternative markers. Although these indicators have the advantages of low cost and easy accessibility, they cannot completely replace imaging diagnostic methods (such as ultrasound or transient elastography). Future research will verify the diagnostic efficacy of these alternative markers through imaging methods, which will further enhance the accuracy of the assessment. Conclusion Our research has revealed a significant association between hepatic steatosis and infertility in women aged 20 to 44, particularly in terms of FLI and ZJU indices. These relationships may vary due to differences in age, race, marital status and physical activity. However, the relatively low AUC value limits their clinical application as independent screening tools for female infertility. These findings suggest that metabolic health may be associated with reproductive outcomes and suggest the potential value of fatty liver screening for infertile women. However, due to the limitations of the cross-sectional design of this study, the causal relationship could not be determined. The future longitudinal studies or intervention studies are crucial for determining whether reducing hepatic steatosis can improve fertility outcomes.
