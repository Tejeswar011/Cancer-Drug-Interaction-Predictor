Methods This prospective single-center study included patients with intra-abdominal abscesses or hematomas who underwent shear wave elastography prior to ultrasound-guided drainage in an interventional radiology clinic between 2021 and 2022. An independent samples t Results A total of 50 patients (33 with abscesses and 17 with hematomas) were included in this study. The elastography values of the patients were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (minimum–maximum). The mean shear wave velocity of hematomas (1.11 ± 0.41 (0.54–1.98) m/s) was significantly higher than that of abscesses (0.68 ± 0.16 (0.36–1.07) m/s) (p < 0.001). In the receiver operating characteristic analysis, the area under the curve was 84.8%. When the optimal cutoff value was defined as 0.72, the sensitivity and specificity were 82.4% and 67%, respectively.

Hematomas may have different sonographic appearances, depending on the age of blood products.  7  7  8 Ultrasound elastography is a widely used method that has been increasingly adopted across various clinical fields. Elastography measures tissue stiffness through a dynamic examination in addition to conventional B-mode ultrasonography. Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography is a radiation force–based imaging technique combined with ultrasound for the quantitative measurement of tissue elasticity. Acoustic pulses are generated in real time by a B-mode ultrasound probe, leading to localized tissue displacement, and the resulting shear wave velocity (SWV) is displayed as an ARFI image. This technique has proven to be useful in differentiating tissue characteristics across various body parts. 9 13 Although the differential diagnosis of intra-abdominal abscess and hematoma can usually be made based on clinical laboratory findings and imaging findings of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CT and MRI may not always be available. The determination of contrast enhancement in the walls after the administration of an intravenous contrast agent in CT and MRI can support the diagnosis of abscess, although contrast administration may be contraindicated in patients with allergies or a history of renal impairment, limiting the diagnostic performance of cross-sectional imaging methods.  14 As exudative fluids show higher elastography velocity values because of the more prominent proteinaceous and blood contents than transudative fluids in the pleural space,  12 Material and methods Patients Patients who were referred to the tertiary university hospital interventional radiology department with a preliminary diagnosis of intra-abdominal abscess for imaging-guided aspiration between 2021 and 2022 were consecutively included in this study. Patients lacking laboratory results or elastography measurements of the lesion were excluded. In addition, patients with a history of antibiotic or immunosuppressive use within 2 weeks prior to aspiration were excluded. Patients with lesions located deeper than 8 cm from the skin surface were excluded due to technical failure of elastography measurement at this depth. Patients whose lesions lacked microbiological (presence of leukocytes/erythrocytes in the lesion or bacterial growth in culture) or macroscopic (pus formation in the lesion) evidence, which is compatible with seroma or lymphocele, and those who had a history of renal–hepatic diseases associated with ascites were not evaluated. Finally, the study included a total of 50 consecutive patients who met all the inclusion criteria. This prospective cross-sectional study was approved by the Yüzüncü Yıl University Ethics Committee (approval number: 2021/10-10), and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. All patient details have been de-identified. This study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2024. The reporting of this study conforms to the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) guidelines.  15 Imaging Sonographic examinations were performed by a radiologist, who had 15 years of ultrasonography and 7 years of elastosonography experience, using an Affiniti 70 G (Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA, USA) ultrasound device with a C5-1 convex probe. Before drainage, the patients were evaluated in the supine position to identify the location and sonographic features of the fluid via B-mode ultrasonography. For each lesion, gain and focal depth adjustments were made for optimal visualization and measurements. Then, SWV measurements were performed using the ElastPQ option in ARFI elastography application via the same ultrasound probe. Before the elastography examination, all patients were instructed to hold their breath and remain still during the procedure. The probe was applied with gel and placed in slight contact with the skin, and the lesion site was identified via B-mode ultrasound. A region of interest box (10 × 5 mm) was placed in the most central and homogeneous area of the lesion, and at least four measurements were obtained for each lesion ( Figures 1 2 Figure 1. Microscopic examination of a pelvic fluid collection in a 35-year-old woman who underwent a cesarean section showed multiple erythrocytes, which is compatible with a hematoma. Figure 2. Microscopic examination of a pelvic fluid collection in a 33-year-old man who underwent appendectomy showed multiple neutrophils, which is compatible with an abscess. Statistical analysis The descriptive statistics for continuous variables were expressed as mean ± SD and minimum–maximum, while the categorical variables were presented as numbers and percentages. A Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to examine the distribution of variables. An independent samples t Results Among the 50 patients (26 women and 24 men) with a mean age of 51 ± 15.4 (18–79) years, 33 (66%) had abscesses and 17 (34%) had hematomas. All hematomas included in this study were in the acute stage. Chronic hematomas were excluded as they cannot be drained because of their prominent clot components. In addition, chronic intra-abdominal hematomas may become infected, leading to misinterpretation of the results. The mean age of women (46.7 ± 16 (18–79) years) was significantly lower than that of men (55.7 ± 14 (21–79) years) (p = 0.0402) ( Table 1 Table 1.

An evaluation of the localizations and etiologies of the hematomas revealed that 13 hematomas developed following various operations in the pelvic region (cesarean section, hysterectomy, salpingectomy, and myomectomy), 3 after intra-abdominal operations in the upper abdominal quadrants (gastric cancer, gastric perforation, and cholecystectomy), and 1 following treatment for ureteral calculus in the perirenal area ( Figure 1 Among the 33 abscesses, 17 developed in the upper quadrants of the abdomen (postoperatively or spontaneously), 9 in the pelvis (postoperatively or spontaneously), and 7 in the liver (spontaneously) ( Figure 2 There was no statistically significant difference in the volume of the fluid contents between abscesses (91.06 ± 47.96 mL) and hematomas (119.29 ± 57.97 mL) (p = 0.0726). Patients in the abscess group (55.2 ± 15.1 (18–79) years) were significantly older than those in the hematoma group (42.9 ± 13.4 (20–68)) (p = 0.0062) ( Table 1 The mean SWVs were 0.68 ± 0.16 (0.36–1.07) m/s ( Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 3.

Discussion Hematoma, abscess, biloma, urinoma, seroma, anastomotic leak, or ascites may present as loculated or diffuse intra-abdominal fluid collections, either spontaneously or secondary to trauma or surgery.  1  3 Ultrasonography remains the first-line radiological modality for evaluating intra-abdominal fluid collections and guiding drainage procedures, as it is noninvasive, inexpensive, and widely available. Ultrasound elastography is a relatively new technology that provides quantitative information on tissue elasticity.  7 Various CT studies on the differentiation of intra-abdominal fluid collections have reported contradictory results. In a study by Karcaaltıncaba and Akhan,  4  8  16 Previously, diffusion-weighted MR imaging (DWI) was explored for differentiating abdominopelvic abscesses from noninfected fluid collections. It was suggested that DWI is superior to T2-weighted imaging and that quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient measurements has a potential diagnostic value for this differentiation.  14  17 The ultrasonographic features of intra-abdominal fluid collections may vary depending on the nature of their contents. In a study by Akhan et al.,  18  12  19  20 20 21 Gaspari et al.  22 Awadallah et al.  23  24 In the literature, only a few studies have investigated sonoelastography for cystic lesions, and data on hemorrhage and abscess are extremely limited. Previous studies have suggested that SWV values are higher in hemorrhagic lesions and lower in abscesses. Consistent with the literature, we found that the SWV values were significantly higher in hematomas than in abscesses. In addition, we found a cutoff value of 0.72 m/s with a sensitivity of 82.4% and specificity of 67% for differentiation. We did not include chronic hematomas in this study because of the increased risk of infection and the likelihood of aspiration failure due to their semi-solid clot contents. As increased stiffness of hematoma is associated with degraded blood products, high protein levels, and high iron concentrations, we believe that chronic hematomas would show higher SWV values than acute hematomas. Consistent with this hypothesis, another study conducted at our institute revealed that the mean SWV values were significantly higher in subacute deep venous thrombosis than in acute deep venous thrombosis.  9 Because abscesses have thick, enhancing walls and show restricted diffusion, contrast agent administration and additional sequences are required to differentiate hematomas from abscesses on sectional radiological examinations. An advantage of this method is that it does not require contrast administration and does not expose patients to ionizing radiation. In addition, CT and MRI may not be available in certain centers and conditions. Moreover, it takes only 1–2 min to obtain quantitative results. Another advantage is that it is a very feasible method that can be performed at the bedside, even in patients who have undergone surgical interventions that restrict their movement. The main limitation of elastography for this differentiation is that not all ultrasound devices include the elastography modality, and operators must be well-trained in the technique as this is a dynamic method in which the patients are asked to hold their breath and remain still for a short time. Calculating the mean SWE values in such lesions provides rapid information through a safe and readily available method, allowing aspiration of the content in the same procedural session in cases of abscess. The major limitation of this study was that a single observer performed the calculations, as elastosonography is an operator-dependent technique. Moreover, the sample size in the hematoma group was relatively small. Furthermore, as only acute hematomas were included, elastographic features were not analyzed according to hematoma age. Because of the technical failure of elastography in lesions with a depth of >8 cm, we could not evaluate deeper lesions. Confounding factors, including localization of effusion, amount of effusion, depth of the effusion, age of the effusion, and sex and age of the patients, which may influence SWE values, were not examined in this study. These factors should be evaluated in further studies with larger sample sizes, particularly in hematoma patients. In addition, future studies should assess the response to antimicrobial treatment by comparing pre- and post-treatment SWV measurements. Conclusion Radiological differentiation between intra-abdominal abscesses and hematomas, which have different treatment options and complications, is essential and challenging in most cases, as gray-scale ultrasound, CT, and MRI have some disadvantages and limited diagnostic accuracy. The results of this study support our hypothesis, demonstrating that intra-abdominal abscesses have significantly lower SWV values than hematomas, thereby aiding differentiation between these entities. We believe that if further studies with larger sample sizes confirm these findings, SWE measurements may become a routine radiological tool for differentiating intra-abdominal abscesses from hematomas.
