BioMed Research International published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. 2025 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ This is an open access article under the terms of the http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) serves as a standard in medical coding. Researchers in artificial intelligence, including those focused on natural language processing and machine learning, have made a significant effort to build and develop automatic ICD encoding systems and algorithms. Many algorithms have been developed to implement automatic ICD encoding, but almost all of these algorithms depended on the raw text input without taking into consideration the important medical entities in this input. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for automatically predicting ICD codes based on patient claims. Our algorithm contains several steps for finding the most relevant ICD codes. Primarily, our proposed algorithm employs medical named entity recognition (NER) to find the most important medical entities in a patient claim. For this purpose, the Medical NER model was used based on the BERT model. Next, the algorithm generates embeddings for the extracted entities using the ClinicalBERT model. To identify the most relevant ICD code, the algorithm creates embeddings for an ICD catalog, which contains various information such as chapter descriptions, long descriptions, short descriptions, and ICD codes. The embedding process is primarily based on the long descriptions, and the results are stored in a local database that contains embedding vectors and corresponding mapped ICD codes. The final step of the algorithm calculates the cosine similarity between the embedding vector generated from the patient complaint and the ICD long description vectors. The strength of this new algorithm is that it first detects the medical entities in the textual input and then predicts the most similar ICD codes. Also, our developed algorithm does not need such huge data for training. We tested the developed algorithm on a medical dataset, and the results indicate that the proposed method is highly efficient, achieving a precision rate of approximately 90%.

Introduction The integration of computer‐supported technology and medicine has tremendous potential for creating positive outcomes. Medical health is expected to enhance healthcare by providing access to high‐quality medical information, enabling patients to take better care of their health and avoid neglecting medical issues. This information can be easily accessible on mobile phones or devices connected to the internet, anytime and anywhere. Also, AI technology is developing at a rapid rate, including machine learning technology, which has now become very popular and is utilized in all fields. Additionally, word/sentence embedding models, which have now become popular and free, can be utilized in a huge range of applications. Many medical encoding models have been built and used in the last years, and the main important thing is that these models have been trained on a huge dataset, which in turn affects the accuracy and the bias of these models. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) serves a broad range of uses globally and provides critical knowledge on the extent, causes, and consequences of human disease and death worldwide via data that is reported and coded with the ICD. Clinical terms coded with ICD are the main basis for health recording and statistics on disease in primary, secondary, and tertiary care, as well as on cause of death certificates. These data and statistics support payment systems, service planning, administration of quality and safety, and health services research. Diagnostic guidance linked to categories of ICD also standardizes data collection and enables large‐scale research. Automatic disease ICD prediction has become a crucial and significant issue in the medical industry and medical insurance. ICD [ 1 2 3 Usually, the ICD coding is an essential step in the healthcare process and applications. The problem of ICD coding is that there are many coding errors made by specialized persons based on guidelines for choosing the most suitable ICD codes according to patient diagnosis, and this, in turn, causes a lot of problems in detecting the specific diagnosis of the patient’s disease. In the following, we will explain the most common errors in the coding process [ 4 • Maybe doctors use abbreviations in writing diagnoses; this in turn leads to incorrect matching in ICD codes. • In many cases, the one diagnosis may relate to more than one ICD code. • In many cases, two or three diagnoses may relate to the same ICD code. To avoid such errors, many researchers’ efforts were adapted to automatic ICD coding; many algorithms have been developed to implement automatic ICD coding. The essential problems of the current developed algorithms of automatic ICD coding are that these algorithms need a huge dataset to be trained on and also the precision rate of these algorithms; thus, we proposed a new algorithm with a high accuracy rate and without any need for a dataset to be trained on by using transfer learning technology. Named entity recognition (NER) [ 5 Text embedding [ 6 n • PubMedBERT‐base: model fined‐tuned using sentence transformers. It maps sentences and paragraphs to a 768‐dimensional dense vector space and can be used for tasks like clustering or semantic search [ 7 • Clinical‐BR‐Mistral‐7B‐v0.2 is a fine‐tuned language model specifically designed for generating clinical notes in Portuguese [ 8 • MedEmbed: MedEmbed is a family of embedding models fine‐tuned specifically for medical and clinical data [ 9 The following of this paper will contain the following sections: the related work in ICD automatic prediction, proposed algorithm for ICD prediction, evaluation, and conclusion. 2. Related Work Many algorithms have been developed by researchers to predict the ICD codes based on the textual data; in general, this textual data is related to the patient’s records. Almost all ICD prediction algorithms include textual feature extraction steps before building the algorithm. We will mention the general techniques that are applied to the textual data; we can classify these techniques as follows: • Stop words removing: in this step, the stop words are removed from the textual input; these words are useless and removing them will reduce the complexity of the text manipulation; the stop words list varies from language to language; it is a language‐oriented feature. • Text stemming: in this step, all the words in the textual input are returned to their roots using the popular natural language processing (NLP) stemmers; the implementation of the stemming algorithms is varied according to the language rules. Stanford stemmer [ 10 • Term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF/IDF) evaluates the importance of the word in a document or corpus [ 11 • Bag‐of‐words (BoW): a vocabulary of unique words is created, where each word represents an independent and discriminative feature [ 12 •  N N 12 • Word2Vec is a method to construct embeddings using two models: skip‐gram and continuous bag of words (CBOW). The skip‐gram model learns from the existing words available in a sentence to predict the next word, whereas the CBOW model uses the neighboring word to predict the next word [ 13 • Doc2Vec and Paragraph2vec are variants of word2vec. They focus on predicting words in the document or paragraph. Doc2vec creates a numeric representation of a document irrespective of its length [ 14 • Global vectors (GloVe) is another commonly used word embedding method that derives the relationship between the words from the global corpus statistics [ 15 • FastText builds on a specific limitation of word2vec and GloVe. It can handle out‐of‐vocabulary terms by extending the skip‐gram model with internal subword information [ 16 Also, ICD coding algorithms can be classified according to the methodology into the following categories: • Rule‐based ICD coding algorithms: These systems rely on a predefined set of rules, keywords, and phrases mapped to specific ICD codes. They often use terminologies like SNOMED CT or MeSH and may involve simple if‐then logic or Boolean operators [ 17 o. Brittleness: cannot handle synonyms, abbreviations, or variations in language. o. Low recall: misses complex cases where the diagnosis is implied rather than stated explicitly. o. High maintenance: requires constant manual updates by experts to remain current. • Traditional machine learning ICD coding algorithms: as researcher in [ 18 19 • Deep learning ICD coding algorithms: these algorithms are a type of machine learning technique that utilizes a multilayered neural network architecture to learn the hierarchical representation of data. Deep learning models have demonstrated successful results in many NLP tasks such as language translation [ 20 21 22 • Hybrid ICD coding algorithms: these algorithms use a mixed methodology from various algorithm types that there are many algorithms that use rule‐based ICD coding with deep learning ICD codes and also many algorithms that use text classification with rules for detecting the right ICD codes according to the input. Many systems and algorithms have been developed to generate or predict the ICD codes automatically based on medical texts, as the accuracy and efficiency of manual ICD coding have always been a concern of clinical practice. In [ 23 24 25 26 27 In [ 28 Also, many researchers try to identify the patient disease ICD based on identifying the medical concepts in the patient records; for this type of algorithms, concept‐based features are extracted using either medical ontology such as SNOMED‐CT2 [ 29 In general, artificial intelligence, including machine learning, has been utilized in the medical sector to predict disease. In [ 30 31 32 33 34 In [ 35 In, researchers made a systematic literature review of automated ICD coding and classification systems using discharge summaries. In Table 1 Table 1 Comparison of the developed algorithm with existing algorithms.  Algorithm category  Manual feeding  Training data Rule‐based ICD coding algorithms Need continuous feeding to add new rules to detect the ICD codes Need a huge data which must extract from domain experts and then need to format this data in rules Traditional machine learning ICD coding algorithms Need continuous data updating to retrain the models to extract ICD codes Need a huge labeled data to train the models to extract ICD codes Deep learning ICD coding algorithms Needs continuous data representation to extract features that will be used in model training Need huge features which must be extracted from existing datasets Our developed algorithm No need from manual feeding No need for data for training 3. Materials and Methods Figure 1 Figure 1 Proposed algorithm steps. We will talk in detail about each step in the following. 3.1. Get Claim Raw Data In this step, the input is loaded to the system; the input is textual raw data which contains medical information about the patient status; this information contains symptoms, body parts, diseases, and other information. 3.2. Medical NER The goal of this step is to detect the most important information in the claim textual data that NER is essentially a technology that enables automatic identification and classification of entities—such as patient names, medical conditions, symptoms, diseases, medications, and procedures—in a sea of unstructured text data. In order to detect these entities, we have used a Medical NER model which is fine‐tuned on the BERT model to recognize 41 medical entities [ 36 37 We are focusing our algorithm on the following entity types: • Biological structures • Symptoms • Age • Gender • Diseases We have used this model as it trained and fine‐tuned on BERT model which contains 110M parameters. By the end of this step, the claim unstructured text data is converted to a list of entities. The following figure describes the NER process; Figure 2 Figure 2 Medical named entity recognition process. As we see from the figure above, the input of this step is unstructured textual data and the output of the step is a list of medical entities. 3.3. Medical Entity Embedding In this step, the extracted entities from the previous step are converted to vector embeddings. The embedding is done by using the ClinicalBERT [ 38 e By the end of this step, the detected entities will be converted to vector representations. For example: detected medical entities: [cough, runny nose, headache, sneezing…] will be converted to [embed‐vec1, embed‐vec2, embed‐vec3., embed‐vec4…]. Then, after finishing the conversion of entities to vectors, we will take the average of all these vectors representing the relative information from all of them. Figure 3 Figure 3 Medical entity embedding. 3.4. Disease Embedding In this step, the diseases are embedded based on the ICD catalog (the long description of the ICD code is embedded); that after finishing this step, all the ICD‐10 codes are converted to numeric numbers based on text description for every ICD code; that the ICD catalog [ 28 2 Table 2 ICD code embedding.  ICD-10 code  ICD-10 long description embedding vector Code1 V1 Code2 V2 .. .. CodeN Vn 3.5. Find Relevant Diseases to the Input In this step, the algorithm tries to find the most relevant ICD codes (most similar ICD codes) to the input as the following: • By calculation, the similarity between input‐generated average vector (which was generated in Step 3) • The ICD codes’ descriptions (which are already encoded and converted to numeric vectors and stored into system database) based on the following formula (Equation 1) which calculates the cosine similarity between vectors [ 39 cos θ = ∑ i = 1 n A i B i ∑ A i 2 ∑ B i 2 where A B So the similarity score will be as the following: Similarity  score  input  vector , ICD  codes = cosine − similarity  input  vector , ICD  codes 4. Results and Discussion 4.1. Dataset As we mentioned in the proposed algorithm, the second layer calculates the similarity between the input (patient complaint) and the local database records, which include labeled patient complaints, which means that each record contains a patient complaint and its validated ICD code. This validation is done by the medical encoders. The local database contains 10,000 records of labeled and valid data. 4.2. Evaluation Metric The data is divided into two parts, each part contains 5000 records; the first set is used in training the algorithm, and the second set is used in validation. We have used the precision metric for evaluating our development to calculate the accuracy of the developed algorithm because we are depending on our evaluation of human ICD labeled data and measuring our developed algorithm’s accuracy by comparing results returned by our algorithm with the actual ICD codes. The precision formula is defined as follows: Precision = extracted  ICD  codes ∩ ICD  codes extracted  ICD  codes cos Θ = A ∗ B A ∗ B where extracted ICD codes are codes that are returned by the developed algorithm and ICD codes are the actual codes which are related to the patient complaint. After testing the algorithm on the testing dataset (5000) records, the precision is as shown in Table 3 Table 3 Precision result.  Precision 90.03 As a comparison of the current developed algorithm with the existing algorithm for ICD prediction, our developed algorithm’s performance is greater than these algorithms because of its two layers. In the first layer, the algorithm detects the medical entities using the Bert‐Medical NER model (which is fine‐tuned version of DeBERTa on the PubMed dataset) and excludes the useless textual data, which will highly affect the accuracy of our algorithm. Then, these entities are used for ICD prediction by using ClinicalBERT (which was trained on a large multicenter dataset with a large corpus of 1.2B words of diverse diseases); for performance, our proposed model was in real time because we have used a vector database to get the relevant ICDs for the input, instead of memory allocation of the similarity. 5. Conclusion In this study, we presented a multilayer algorithm for ICD prediction that utilizes word embedding and NLP. Our algorithm employs PubMedBERT, a pretrained model built from abstracts in PubMed and full‐text articles from PubMedCentral, to achieve medical text word embeddings. This model demonstrates state‐of‐the‐art performance across various biomedical NLP tasks and currently holds the top score on the biomedical language understanding and reasoning benchmark. Our developed algorithm layers significantly enhance accuracy by predicting the ICD code related to patient complaints through two primary similarity layers. The first layer assesses similarity between patient complaint and ICD long description, while the second layer evaluates the similarity between the patient complaint and local database records. We established a certainty factor of 0.3 for the first layer and 0.7 for the second layer to generate the final similarity results. We tested our developed algorithm on a dataset comprising 1000 records, which was split into two sets: 5000 records for training and 5000 records for testing. The developed algorithm successfully generated ICD codes relevant to patient complaints with an impressive accuracy rate of approximately 90%. The current version of this algorithm is designed to be utilized by any system, as we have developed it as a standalone service API that can be called from other systems. In the future, we aim to further enhance the accuracy of our algorithm by implementing hierarchical classification in machine learning and employing modeling concepts using medical ontologies to discover relationships among various diseases. This developed algorithm has one limitation: that this algorithm’s accuracy rate cannot be 100% because it is an automatic ICD coding algorithm decision support, and the final decision will be taken by the clinical expert.
