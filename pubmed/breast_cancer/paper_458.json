This study contributes to the field by examining the direct and indirect effects of quality of care (QC), patient-centered communication (PCC), perceived health (PH), and emotional well-being (EW) on SS in American adults with knowledge of palliative care. Methods A predictive-crossover design study was conducted. Data from N = 1154 adult respondents to the 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 5, cycle 2 were used. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to report the direct and indirect effects for the proposed mediation model. Results QC had a strong, significant association with PCC (β =0.930, p <0.001). PCC was significantly associated with PH (β =0.104, p <0.01) and EW (β =0.098, p <0.01), but not directly with SS (β =0.030, p >0.05). SS was significantly predicted by PH (β =0.659, p <0.001) and EW (β =0.178, p <0.001). Indirect effects of PCC on SS via PH and EW were confirmed. Conclusion These findings highlight the importance of promoting perceived health and emotional well-being as key mechanisms by which care quality and communication impact self-efficacy. This study underscores the need to prioritize patient perceptions in palliative care interventions aimed at enhancing self-care capacity.

In the healthcare setting, this implies that patient-provider communication and care quality can serve as environmental sources of efficacy information. Evidence supports this view: nurse-led interventions and motivational interviewing have been shown to increase self-efficacy in individuals with chronic illnesses, such as heart failure. 8 21 22 Despite growing interest in SS, current literature has primarily focused on its associations with clinical outcomes in specific chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart failure, and cancer. However, limited attention has been given to how broader psychosocial and communicative factors—such as emotional well-being, patient-centered communication, and perceived quality of care—interact to shape SS, particularly among adults knowledgeable in palliative care. Additionally, few studies have examined these relationships using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to explore both direct and indirect effects simultaneously. By addressing these gaps, the present study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the psychosocial and communicative mechanisms that influence SS, offering insights that can inform person-centered strategies and policy efforts in palliative care settings. Therefore, this study examined the effects of Perceived Health (PH), Patient-Centered Communication (PCC), Quality of Care (QC), and Emotional Well-being (EW) on SS in adults familiar with palliative care. The following hypotheses were proposed: O1: Perceived health has a significant indirect effect on the relationship of patient-centered communication to self-care self-efficacy. O2: Emotional well-being has a significant indirect effect on the relationship of patient-centered communication to self-care self-efficacy. O3: Patient-centered communication and perceived health have a significant indirect effect on the relationship between quality of care and self-efficacy in self-care. O4: Patient-centered communication and emotional well-being have a significant indirect effect on the relationship between quality of care and self-efficacy in self-care. Materials and Methods Participants A cross-sectional predictive study 23 24 We used data from the 2018 HINTS-5 Cycle 2, collected between January and May 2018. The survey employed a two-stage stratified sampling method: in the first stage, a random sample of residential addresses was selected from a master address file; in the second stage, one adult was randomly selected per household using predefined protocols. Surveys were administered by mail in English and Spanish. The full methodology and sampling design have been documented in detail elsewhere. 25 26 The HINTS-5 cycle 2 was collected from January to May 2018 and consists of 3,504 subjects. 27 27 Instruments Quality of Care (QC) It was assessed by a single item of the HINTS-5, where patients are asked: “ In general, how would you rate the quality of health care you have received during the past 12 months?”; the answers are Likert-type with five options ranging from 1 (Excellent) to 5 (Poor). Scores were inverted to consider higher values to represent higher quality of medical care, eg 1 for “Poor” and 5 for “Excellent”. This measure has been used in different studies, where they reported adequate evidence of internal consistency reliability. 28 29 Patient-Centered Communication (PCC) The Patient-Centered Communication Scale, developed by Epstein and Street, was used. 30 Emotional Well-Being (EW) It was identified through the inverse scores of the Patient-Health Questionnaire 4 (PHQ-4), developed by Kroenke et al 31 Perceived Health (PH) It was measured through a single HINT-5 item: “In general, would you say your health is.”, with Likert-type responses with five options: 1 = Excellent, 2 = Very good, 3 = Good, 4 = Acceptable and 5 = Poor. Scores were inverted to consider that higher values represent a higher perception of health, eg 1 for “Poor” and 5 for “Excellent”. This measure has been used in different studies to assess perceived health and has reported acceptable evidence of internal consistency. 32 33 Self-Care Self-Efficacy (SS) It was assessed by means of a single item of the HINT-5: “In general, how confident are you in your ability to take care of your health?”. Responses were Likert-type and ranged from 1 (I trust completely) to 5 (I do not trust). These scores were inverted so that higher values represent higher self-efficacy, eg 1 for “I do not trust” and 5 for “I trust completely”. Other studies using this measure recognized adequate values for internal consistency. 15 Data Analysis We began with the presentation of the descriptive data (mean and standard deviation), the normality test to determine the distribution of the data 34 Unweighted Least Squares (ULS) 35 36 Mediation models with significant direct and indirect effects are partial, but if the direct effect is reduced and becomes non-significant, the model shows full mediation in the relationship of the variables. In partial models, the third (mediating) variable has a significant impact on the relationship between the independent and dependent variable. In contrast, in fully mediated models, the third variable fully explains the relationship between the independent and dependent variable, and the direct effect is no longer relevant. All statistical analyses, both descriptive and direct and indirect effects, were performed with the open access program Jamovi (v. 2.3.26). Jamovi was chosen for its support of ULS estimation in SEM models and its accessible interface for applied health research.

SS is known to positively influence patient outcomes and functioning, among other variables, 2 16 18 According to our results, QC had a significant and direct effect on PCC, which in turn had a significant effect on SS, through the mediation of EW and, more strongly, of PH. QC and PCC are intrinsically related: according to the Institute of Medicine (US), QC is defined as a care that is “safe, effective, timely, efficient, equitable and patient-centered”; 39 40 41 42 43 44 As stated previously, perceived quality of care (as assessed in our study) is associated with many factors, including subjective ones that are not always directly related to quality itself or health outcomes. Moreover, quality has been considered as a social construct co-produced by different actors; 45 46 47 48 46 According to our model, PCC indirectly influenced SS through the mediation of HP. PCC includes not only being empathic towards patients´ feelings but also delivering positive messages to help them cope with problematic issues. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis found that this type of interaction not only diminishes negative emotions such as anxiety but also improves health-related quality of life and even pain, 49 50 2 19 51 As mentioned before, we also found that PCC had an indirect effect on SS through the mediation of EW. A higher SS in chronically ill patients has been linked to lower distress and depression, higher quality of life, and more positive health status, 2 19 20 22 Previous studies have evidenced an association between clinician–patient communication and patient health outcomes; however, there might be different pathways to explain this relationship. 42 52 53 Despite the well-established theoretical link between patient-centered communication and self-efficacy, it is important to note that in our study, PCC did not show a significant direct association with SS. This finding may reflect the complexity of how communication is perceived and processed by patients, or the influence of other mediating psychosocial variables—such as perceived health or emotional well-being—which may capture more proximal determinants of self-care confidence. 54 55 Finally, Self-efficacy is known to influence health perceptions 56 2 19 57 2 Limitations and Future Research Our study, while providing insightful findings, has certain limitations that should be considered. Firstly, the cross-sectional nature of the data derived from the HINTS database limits the ability to draw causal inferences. Although associations were found between care quality, patient-centered communication, perceived health, emotional well-being, and self-care self-efficacy, the directionality of these relationships remains uncertain. Secondly, some variables—such as SS, QC, and PH—were assessed using single-item measures. While this approach is supported in the literature for concrete, unidimensional constructs and helps reduce participant burden, it may imply limitations in measurement reliability and construct validity. Third, SS remains a relatively novel concept in the literature, and its theoretical foundations are still evolving. Lastly, the study relied entirely on self-reported data, which may introduce response bias or inaccuracies due to social desirability or recall limitations. Additionally, the sample included only participants who reported being aware of palliative care, which may limit the generalizability of findings to the broader population of adults without such awareness or experience. Future studies should consider longitudinal designs and multi-item instruments to strengthen theoretical and psychometric robustness. Despite these limitations, our findings provide a valuable basis for further research into the psychosocial determinants of self-care self-efficacy in palliative care contexts. Theoretical Implications This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of self-care SS by applying Bandura’s SCT to a complex health context—palliative care. The findings reinforce SCT’s core principle of reciprocal determinism by demonstrating how environmental factors (eg, quality of care and patient-centered communication) indirectly influence individual behavior through personal cognitive-affective variables (eg, perceived health and emotional well-being). Furthermore, by identifying SS as a key mediating mechanism, the study extends the application of SCT to new pathways relevant to end-of-life care, where confidence in self-management is often undermined by psychological and health-related distress. The structural equation model used in this research provides empirical support for these theoretical relationships and underscores the importance of examining both direct and indirect influences in complex healthcare settings. Practical Implications The results of this study have direct implications for clinical practice and health policy, particularly in the design of person-centered interventions in palliative care. Enhancing patients’ perceived health and emotional well-being may strengthen their self-efficacy in managing care-related tasks, even in the face of advanced illness. This suggests that improving care quality and communication strategies— through staff training in patient-centered approaches and empathy—may yield indirect yet meaningful benefits for self-care outcomes. Healthcare providers should be aware that fostering a supportive emotional environment and promoting positive health perceptions can empower patients and improve their engagement in self-management. Additionally, these findings support the integration of psychosocial components into standard care protocols for patients dealing with serious illnesses. Conclusion In conclusion, according to our model, SS is predicted by PCC with the mediation of PH, and less strongly, EW; PCC is, in turn, predicted by QC. The concept of SS is relatively new in the scientific literature and, consequently, few studies include this variable. However, it has shown to be associated to relevant outcomes in healthcare, justifying the focus on it. Our findings suggest that improving the quality of care and fostering effective, patient-centered communication can have a significant impact on patients’ perceived health and emotional well-being, which, in turn, positively influences their self-efficacy in self-care. This chain of effects highlights the importance of comprehensively addressing aspects of health care to strengthen patients’ ability to manage their own health, especially in advanced or chronic disease settings.
