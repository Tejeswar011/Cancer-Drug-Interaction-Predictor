This chronic inflammatory condition causes the degradation of dental supporting tissues, resulting in bone loss. In patients with periodontitis, the expression and activation of MMPs, especially MMP-8 and MMP-9, significantly influence tissue degradation. In periodontitis treatment, various natural or synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs) and antibiotics are used in sub-antimicrobial doses. However, while the evidence supports a role for MMPIs in reducing inflammation, preserving connective tissue, and improving the results of conventional periodontitis treatment, their clinical application is limited. In this review, we summarize MMPIs, their characteristics, and the mechanisms of action that may support their use in the treatment of periodontitis. In conclusion, MMPIs are a therapeutic alternative with great potential in the management of periodontitis, especially when combined with mechanical treatments, although further research is needed to optimize their clinical use. metalloproteinases metalloproteinase inhibitors periodontitis Fondos Estatales Genéricos de la Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo The APC was funded by “Fondos Estatales Genéricos de la Universidad Autónoma del Estado de Hidalgo”, 2005. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Periodontitis is a multifactorial chronic inflammatory disease associated with a dysbiotic biofilm and characterized by the degradation of dental supporting tissues, manifesting as loss of clinical attachment, alveolar bone loss, the presence of periodontal pockets, and gingival bleeding [ 1 2 3 2 4 5 Periodontitis is not only a bacterial infection of the gums, but also the result of an imbalance between the inflammatory response and the host immune system. This immunological imbalance plays a crucial role in disease progression and periodontal tissue destruction [ 5 6 5 MMPs are a family of zinc- and calcium-dependent endopeptidases involved in the degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components such as collagen, elastin, and fibronectin. They are among the most important ECM proteases. These enzymes activate various growth factors, cell surface receptors, and adhesion molecules [ 7 8 9 7 There is a common structure to most MMPs. They comprise a pro-peptide with an N-terminal signaling peptide end that varies in length, a catalytic domain containing a zinc ion, a linker peptide known as the hinge region, a hemopexin domain, and a tail [ 9 10 Figure 1 11 12 13 14 Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs) belong to a subgroup of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family, distinguished by their location in the cell membrane. These enzymes play roles in the restructuring of the extracellular matrix and the regulation of physiological and pathological processes. Currently, six MT-MMPs have been identified, divided into two categories, namely membrane-type (MT-1, 2, 3, and 5 MMPs), which have an intracellular domain and a transmembrane region that anchors them to the plasma membrane, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored type (MT-4 and 6 MMPs), which are linked to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol. MT-MMPs are involved in ECM degradation, the activation of other MMPs, and the regulation of cellular processes. MT1-MMP plays a crucial role in osteoclastic activity, facilitating bone matrix degradation during bone restoration [ 15 2. Methods In this review, a systematic search of the scientific literature, including reviews and clinical trials, was conducted in various databases, such as PubMed and Scopus, up to June 2025. The search strategy employed a combination of keywords related to metalloproteinase inhibitors/periodontitis. The search strings used were “metalloproteinases”, “matrix metalloproteinases”, “metalloproteinase inhibitors”, “periodontitis”, and “periodontal inflammation”, using Boolean operators. Included were articles with population, in vitro, and animal studies, reviews, and meta-analyses. Articles written in languages other than English were excluded. 3. Pathophysiology of Periodontitis and MMPs Periodontitis is associated with an imbalance between MMPs and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase, collagenases, and gelatinases. These are the main enzymes involved in periodontitis because the main component of the ECM is collagen type I, present in the periodontal ligament [ 16 16 17 17 MMPs are produced by various cells and tissues such as connective tissue, vascular tissue, endothelial tissue, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, endothelial cells, macrophages, and neutrophils [ 9 11 18 16 19 20 21 22 22 9 Different types of MMPs are expressed in the oral cavity. MMP-8 is one of the main MMPs responsible for the irreversible destruction of periodontal tissues [ 11 23 17 24 17 25 16 26 27 28 29 26 16 25 30 31 32 33 34 19 9 Figure 1 35 Active MMP-8 (aMMP-8) can be measured to detect periodontal tissue damage, according to previous research. This helps guide treatment and suggests that adding aMMP-8 testing to the periodontitis classification system could improve diagnostic accuracy [ 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 41 Another MMP present in the progression of inflammation in patients with periodontitis is MMP-9, which degrades collagen types IV, V, and XI, as well as proteoglycans and elastin [ 16 43 11 44 44 11 44 45 46 47 48 In periodontitis, the accumulation of plaque with bacteria initiates a chronic inflammatory response that induces the overexpression of various MMPs through secretion or activation. Increased MMP-8 levels are associated with bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum 49 Tannerella forsythia Treponema denticola 50 51 22 52 53 Treponema denticola 54 16 Porphyromonas gingivalis 53 4. Types of MMP Inhibitors (MMPIs) Although several MMPIs are known, limited information exists regarding their application in periodontitis, whether in experimental or population studies. This article summarizes the MMPIs, their characteristics, and their mechanisms of action, which may support their clinical use in treating periodontitis. The different MMPI types discussed below, with their mechanisms of action, are summarized in Table 1 Figure 2 Because excessive MMP activity causes excessive ECM degradation, these enzymes can be considered therapeutic targets of MMP inhibitors [ 11 8 81 82 81 83 81 Non-hydroxamate-based inhibitors have been designed to prevent metabolic inactivation and unselective metal chelation of other MMPs. Carboxylates, sulfonamides, and phosphates are examples of non-hydroxamate-based inhibitors created to circumvent the drawbacks of first-generation hydroxamate-based inhibitors. By providing stability and selectivity, these substances can inhibit MMP without the negative side effects of hydroxamates. Some of these inhibitors have also demonstrated improved binding capacity and efficacy by targeting sites other than the MMP catalytic site [ 81 84 85 In periodontitis treatment, adjuvants are used that act as MMPIs, such as bisphosphonates, which prevent MMP production by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts, exerting a chelating effect on catalytic ions [ 23 23 86 55 87 On the other hand, controlling the biofilm associated with peri-implantitis treatments (an inflammatory complication affecting the tissues surrounding dental implants) is a considerable challenge. Despite treatment, a systematic review of clinical trials revealed the presence of Prevotella intermedia Fusobacterium nucleatum Peptostreptococcus micros Prevotella intermedia Tannerella forsythia Treponema denticola Porphyromonas gingivalis 88 89 90 5. Clinical Application of MMPIs in Periodontitis 5.1. Zinc Chelators MMPs, composed of a variety of proteases, use metal ions to bind to the substrate and to polarize water molecules to carry out hydrolytic reactions. MMPs are among the human enzymes that employ zinc ions for this function. Molecules that block zinc metalloproteinases bear a chemical moiety that replaces the zinc-coordinating water molecule in the catalytic site, deactivating the zinc ion. Phosphinate (PO 2 TPA (tri-2-pyridinemethylamine) inhibited MMP-14 with a Ki of 1.2 µM, whereas compound Zn148 showed effective inhibition of both pseudolysine (PLN), a zinc metalloproteinase secreted by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and MMP-14, with a Ki of 5 µM. Furthermore, compounds such as dipicolylamine have been shown to increase the rate of substrate cleavage by MMP-14 by enhancing the interaction of the substrate with the enzyme binding site, suggesting complex effects on enzyme activity [ 56 Zinc niflumate is a zinc complex of niflumic acid, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). This compound exhibited selective cytotoxic effects on endometriotic cells, inhibiting cell proliferation and metalloproteinase activity, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of endometriosis and other related disorders. In endometrial cell lines, 10 µM of zinc niflumate inhibits the activity of the metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, altering gene expression and reducing proteolytic activity, which could be related to the regulation of signaling pathways such as MAPK and COX-2 [ 57 Thiolutin is a zinc chelator activated by reduction to its dithiol form. It exhibits antibiotic properties and inhibits zinc-dependent JAB1/MPN/Mov34 metalloenzyme (JAMM) domain metalloproteinases, at concentrations ranging from 0.53 to 2.5 µM, which are responsible for protein deubiquitination. Thiolutin may have the potential to inhibit other extracellular MMPs and angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE). This is attributed to its ability to chelate zinc, but its efficacy in living cells may be limited because thiolutin is activated intracellularly [ 58 The efficacy of zinc inhibitors has been assessed in other experimental models. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, 1H10 (a chemical inhibitor of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) that also acts as a weak zinc chelator, with a CI50 of 10 µM) significantly reduced the activation of MMP-9 in mice. In addition, a decrease in demyelination, microglia activation, infiltration of immune cells, and disruption of the blood–brain barrier was detected, suggesting that 1H10 reduces the severity of experimental encephalomyelitis [ 59 While zinc chelators represent a specific treatment for periodontitis control, their clinical adoption as MMPIs has proven difficult due to their limited selectivity and bioavailability. Furthermore, dose-limiting side effects and inadequate trial designs were reported during clinical trials of these MMPIs. The evaluation of topical zinc chelating inhibitors for the relief of periodontitis presents several challenges, including leaching by saliva and gingival fluid, which can affect the therapeutic concentration, specificity, and local cytotoxicity to fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Furthermore, zinc chelator inhibitors of specific MMPs must present specific structural characteristics. MMP-12 inhibitors, for example, require a hydrophobic group occupying the S1’ space, a zinc-binding motif to chelate the catalytic Zn ion, and a flexible hydrogen bonding region between them to interact with the catalytic amino acid residues and the Ω loop [ 91 92 5.2. Bisphosphonates Bisphosphonates are non-biodegradable analogs of pyrophosphate that can release calcium ions and have a high affinity for hydroxyapatite crystals. They are used as low-toxicity therapeutic agents to slow the progression of bone loss and prevent radicular resorption by inhibiting osteoclast activity and phagocytosis of bone crystals containing bisphosphonates [ 60 61 61 62 63 62 64 93 94 Porphyromonas gingivalis 95 A randomized, double-blind, placebo study over 12 months was conducted in patients with moderate to severe periodontitis, excluding those with diseases affecting bone metabolism. Patients received nonsurgical periodontal treatment, consisting of scaling and root planing and periodontal maintenance every 3 months. Patients were randomized into groups receiving bisphosphonate (alendronate 10 mg/day or risedronate 5 mg/day) or placebo, plus calcium citrate (1000 mg/day) and vitamin D3 (400 IU/day). Those in the bisphosphonate groups showed significant improvement in clinical attachment level, reduced probing depth, and decreased bleeding on probing, so bisphosphonate therapy may be an effective adjunctive treatment for preserving periodontal bone mass [ 96 Bisphosphonates offer a potential treatment for periodontitis by optimizing clinical parameters and promoting bone regeneration. However, their use requires careful evaluation due to associated risks, such as the adverse effect of osteonecrosis after prolonged treatment lasting 6 to 12 months. Further clinical and experimental studies are needed to assess the incidence of osteonecrosis related to bisphosphonate treatment and to evaluate the effectiveness of short-course bisphosphonate treatment [ 97 5.3. Peptide Mimetics Peptide mimetics are compounds created to closely resemble the structure and functionality of natural peptides to maximize characteristics like biological activity, stability, and bioavailability. They have been used to stimulate and regulate cells in various physiological processes, such as inflammatory response, metabolism, cell signaling, and tannin regeneration, as well as to create new medications that mimic peptides linked to certain disorders [ 98 Collagen mimetic peptides (CMP) are short, single-chain peptides that mimic the structure of collagen, specifically with a repeating sequence of prolines and glycines, such as Pro-Pro-Gly. They have a high affinity for damaged collagen, intercalating at breaks in collagen strands and helping to restore its original structure. These peptides have been used in treatments to repair damaged ocular tissue, promoting healing and improving collagen fibril alignment after injury. In a recent study, tissue stiffness measurements were conducted using atomic force microscopy (AFM) on rat optic nerve head sections. The tissues were treated with MMP-1 for 30 min, followed by a 60 min treatment with the collagen-mimetic peptide CMP-3. Treatment with MMP-1 significantly decreased tissue stiffness in the peripapillary space. Following treatment with CMP-3, improved tissue stiffness restoration, a significant decrease in collagen fragmentation in the sclera and glial lamina, and improved collagen fibril alignment were observed, suggesting its potential to repair damaged collagen in ocular tissues [ 99 In another study, the effect of the Ac2-26 peptide mimetic of the annexin A1 protein was evaluated in an in vitro experimental study using HaCaT human keratinocyte cells and a D551 human fibroblast line. Annexin A1 (AnxA1) is a member of the annexin family and has demonstrated strong anti-inflammatory properties in acute, chronic, and systemic inflammation. Treatment with the Ac2-26 peptide showed inhibition of metalloproteases MMP-1 and MMP-8, assessed by Western blot analysis. In addition, an increase in the level of COL1A1 (gene encoding type I collagen) was observed, suggesting a decrease in collagen degradation. The authors concluded that treatment with the Ac2-26 peptide has anti-inflammatory effects and promotes collagen synthesis, suggesting its potential as a cosmetic treatment for skin conditions related to inflammation and aging [ 65 100 6KApoEp is an apolipoprotein E (ApoE) peptide mimetic designed to mimic the functions of ApoE in the nervous system. In an experimental study, after inducing hemorrhage, different doses of 6KApoEp were administered to evaluate its effect on blood–brain barrier permeability and neurological function. Neurological scores were measured using the Longa method, blood–brain barrier permeability was assessed by Evan’s blue content in brain tissue, and levels of MMP-9 and other proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. 6KApoEp reduced MMP-9 expression by activating the LRP1 receptor, which inhibits the CypA/NF-κB/MMP-9 signaling pathway. This activation reduces inflammation and the degradation of tight junction proteins, thereby improving the integrity of the blood–brain barrier. Consequently, after intracerebral hemorrhage, the presence of MMP-9 in the affected area decreased [ 66 The effect of peptide mimetics on wound healing was demonstrated in an experimental study in mice using wound biopsies. Wounds were treated with different formulations, including platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-loaded cogels and cogels containing PDGF polyplexes with collagen-mimicking peptide (CMP) modifications in various percentages, and were evaluated over 14 days to observe healing and other histological parameters. The inclusion of the CMP in the PDGF polyplex-loaded cogels resulted in increased collagen deposition, with a 24% greater rate of wound closure compared to PDGF cogels without CMP. Furthermore, cogels with 20% CMP modification exhibited collagen expression similar to that of healthy skin, enhancing the ratio of type I to type III collagen. These results indicate that CMP improves wound healing by facilitating the controlled release of PDGF and by promoting fibroblast activity [ 101 Regarding the potential of peptide mimetics in treating periodontitis, a synthetic cationic antimicrobial peptide, Nal-P-113, has been shown to inhibit and kill periodontal bacteria in a planktonic state (bacteria suspended in a liquid medium, such as saliva, and not adhered to any surface) at concentrations less than 320 μg/mL. This peptide also inhibits biofilm formation and eradicates polymicrobial biofilms at 1280 μg/mL. The mechanism by which Nal-P-113 inhibits and kills periodontal bacteria may involve pore formation within the bacteria’s cytoplasmic membranes and permeabilization, leading to bacterial death [ 102 The influence of annexin A1 (ANXA1)-mediated formylpeptide receptor-2 (FPR2) on periodontal pathology was studied in a rodent model of periodontitis and human periodontal ligament cells. ANXA1-FPR2 signaling influenced periodontal tissue destruction. WRW4, a selective antagonist of FPR2 signaling, increased alveolar bone resorption and osteoclast counts, while Ab2-26 reduced these effects. In human cells, the FPR2 antagonist increased the secretion of IL-8 and other factors by silencing ANXA1 and FPR2. The results suggest that ANXA1-FPR2 plays a role in regulating inflammation in periodontal disease [ 67 68 Streptococcus mutans 69 5.4. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) A precursor of reduced glutathione, NAC is a synthetic derivative of the endogenous amino acid L-cysteine, known for its use as an antidote to acetaminophen poisoning. Following oral administration, NAC is quickly absorbed in the small intestine and converted to cysteine, which the liver uses to produce glutathione (GSH). Due to its intestinal metabolism, high hepatic first-pass metabolism, and rapid cellular diffusion and conversion to GSH, NAC has a low oral bioavailability [ 103 103 104 105 106 107 108 Regarding the effect of NAC on MMPs, MMP-9 is involved in mediating neuropathic pain through increased activity and expression in dorsal root ganglia following nerve injury. MMP-9 is also involved in degenerative and proinflammatory mechanisms that exacerbate neuropathic pain. Intraperitoneal administration of NAC at a dose of 150 mg/kg significantly inhibited MMP-9 activity in dorsal root ganglia and dorsal horn segments of the spinal cord in rats. NAC administration resulted in a significant reduction in remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia, suggesting its efficacy in modulating neuropathic pain through MMP-9 inhibition [ 109 70 110 Currently, there is limited information to evaluate the efficacy of NAC in periodontal tissue. Recently, however, the properties of NAC have been applied in the dental field. Nanosilver-based hydrogels containing NAC showed antibacterial and antibiofilm properties, inhibiting Acinetobacter baumannii Pseudomonas aeruginosa 111 71 NAC polysulfide (NAC-S2) was also shown to have a beneficial effect on periodontitis in a mouse model. NAC-S2 was administered intraperitoneally (120 mmol/kg) for one week before inducing periodontitis. Macrophages derived from bone marrow and gingival tissue were isolated and cultured. In mice with periodontitis, NAC-S2 decreased the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β), reduced the distance between the cementoenamel junction and the bone crest, and alleviated TLR4/NF-κB-mediated inflammation [ 72 5.5. Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) NSAIDs are medications used to treat pain and inflammatory conditions, primarily by inhibiting cyclooxygenase/prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 and 2 [ 112 113 114 115 114 115 116 73 74 117 On the other hand, naproxen has been reported to increase the production of pro-MMPs-1, -3, and -9 [ 118 119 120 75 5.6. Doxycycline An antibiotic belonging to the tetracycline class, doxycycline is a broad-spectrum bacteriostatic agent that is synthetically derived from oxytetracycline, a naturally occurring tetracycline produced by Streptomyces 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 The detrimental effects of MMP overexpression in chronic lesions, the function of MMPs and their inhibitors in the wound healing process, and the potential of topical doxycycline as a synthetic inhibitor to support tissue regeneration have all been previously established [ 130 131 132 133 134 One study assessed the effects of subantimicrobial doxycycline treatment in patients with stage 2 type 2 diabetes and grade B periodontitis. One group of patients received scaling and root planing (SRP) only, and the other received SRP plus doxycycline. In patients with SRP and a subantimicrobial doxycycline dose of 20 mg/day for three months, a significant reduction was observed in probing depth, gingival index, and gingival crevicular fluid MMP-9 and MMP-13 levels, and improvement was seen in the clinical indices of gingival index and plaque index [ 135 136 137 138 In a study evaluating the efficacy of an 8.5% nanostructured doxycycline gel in a rat model of periodontal disease, the effect of doxycycline was evident in preventing alveolar bone loss. Experimental periodontitis was induced by placing a ligature around the neck of the rat’s left maxillary second molar. Topical doxycycline gel (1 g) was applied to the ligated areas three times daily for 11 days, and the efficacy of the gel was assessed by histopathological analysis and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Alveolar bone loss was also measured. Treatment with the doxycycline gel significantly reduced alveolar bone loss, and surface roughness analysis showed that periodontal structures were rougher and better maintained their integrity [ 139 In an in vitro study, the proliferation and osteogenic capacity of periodontal stem cells (1 µg/mL) were assessed with doxycycline, which decreased IL-17-induced migration and MMP-2 expression while stimulating osteogenic differentiation and affecting mitochondrial respiration in PDLSCs [ 140 141 142 143 Similarly, “host modulation therapy”, a concept introduced in 1980, is recommended for the treatment of periodontitis. This therapy employs strategies that modulate the host immune response to mitigate inflammation and tissue damage in diseases such as periodontitis, thus facilitating the treatment of microbial biofilms [ 143 144 While adverse reactions such as phototoxicity have been reported with doxycycline and demethylchlortetracycline, which could cause sunburn in patients with certain conditions, a lower risk of phototoxicity is associated with monocycline and lymecycline. Photosensitization reactions to tetracyclines vary according to factors like drug concentration in the skin, skin type, and radiation properties. Regarding toxicity mechanisms, the formation of toxic photoproducts, covalent photobonding of skin molecules, energy transfer, and free radical production have been proposed [ 76 145 5.7. Proanthocyanidins (PACs) PACs are natural compounds classified as flavonoid polyphenols. They are condensed tannins generated by the combination of flavan-3-ol units such as catechin and epicatechin. Present in the fruits, seeds, bark, and leaves of many plants, well-known sources of PACs include grapes, blueberries, pomegranates, and green tea. PACs have been highlighted for their antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and anticancer properties, as well as for protecting and strengthening collagen and elastin [ 146 In the field of dentistry, polyphenols such as resveratrol (10 mg/mL) and myricetin (0.2 mg/mL) have demonstrated beneficial effects on the durability of the resin-dentin bond by modifying collagen and inhibiting MMP activity, as evaluated in an in vitro model of human dentin [ 147 77 78 Blueberry PACs (500 μg/mL) have been shown to inhibit the growth of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans A. actinomycetemcomitans 79 The use of PACs to improve resin-dentin bonding has also been studied, both in etch-and-rinse adhesives and self-etch adhesives. PACs can crosslink the dentin collagen matrix, thus improving the mechanical properties of the exposed collagen, and can dehydrate the fibrils, creating a better collagen substrate for hybridization. These properties are important for achieving a biostable resin-dentin hybrid interface, which is essential for improvements in current adhesive dentistry [ 148 Alkimavičienė et al. studied the effect of PACs in minimally invasive non-surgical therapy in patients with stage III-IV periodontitis. Collagen hydrogels containing PACs were applied to the subgingival region and, after 8 weeks of treatment, clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. The PAC hydrogels caused a significant decrease in pocket probing depth and an increase in clinical attachment level in periodontal pockets compared to the collagen hydrogel alone. Furthermore, the addition of PACs caused a significant reduction in MMP-3 levels in saliva after 8 weeks of treatment. The concentration of MMP-3 in saliva reflects periodontal health status, so this outcome demonstrates that PACs provide additional beneficial effects on clinical and immunological parameters in the treatment of periodontitis [ 80 5.8. Chlorhexidine Chlorhexidine gluconate is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent used in dentistry, primarily as an antiseptic mouthwash to prevent oral biofilm buildup and as an adjuvant treatment for periodontal disease [ 149 150 23 48 55 In restorative dentistry, adhesive systems are used that, over time, lose their bonding to the dentin tissue through hydrolysis of the collagen matrix of the hybrid layer and through degradation of the hydrophilic polymers of the adhesive systems [ 151 152 153 55 154 155 156 The identification of reliable biological markers that demonstrate enzymatic activity is crucial for monitoring the efficacy of MMPIs. Various research indicated that salivary levels of MMP-8 and MMP-9, regulated by tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), are useful for diagnosing periodontal disease [ 157 158 159 160 6. Conclusions MMPs have great potential in the treatment of periodontitis due to their ability to slow the degradation of connective and bone tissue. They are also involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix during periodontal inflammation, so MMP inhibition can reduce disease progression and provide dental support in treatments complementary to conventional mechanical therapy, such as scaling and root planning. However, further experimental studies and clinical trials are needed to evaluate less-explored natural and synthetic compounds that have shown potential to improve the treatment outcomes of periodontitis.
