CYP1A2 is involved in the metabolism of many drugs and environmental chemicals and is induced by polycyclic hydrocarbons in tobacco smoke and charcoal-broiled meat.

The contribution of each parameter, however, was only low to moderate. Therefore, other, still unknown factors must be involved in the large interindividual variability observed in this enzyme.

It is located mainly in the liver and accounts for about 13%–15% of liver P450s, but is also present in the brain, lung, and intestines. 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 CYP1A2∗1F CYP1A2∗1C CYP1A2∗1D 8 9 10 11 12 13 1 2 3 4 5 , 9 1 2 3 4 5 However, in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that CYP1A2 polymorphisms, impaired liver function due to cholestasis or inflammation, medication, and dietary or lifestyle factors such as coffee consumption and smoking habits explain no more than 40% of the variability in CYP1A2 expression and activity in Europeans. 10 , 14 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 CYP1A2 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals Eosin, ethoxycoumarin, ethoxyresorufin, glucose-6-phosphate disodium salt, hematoxylin, 7-hydroxycoumarin, methoxyresorufin, NADPH, picric acid, resorufin, and Sirius red were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All other analytical-grade chemicals were from commercial sources. 2.2 Human liver tissue samples CYP1A2 expression and activities were evaluated in liver tissue samples from the tumor-free resection margins of 103 patients, who underwent partial liver resection for a primary liver tumor or metastasis. Samples were obtained from the Department of General, Visceral and Vascular Surgery, Jena University Hospital. All patients were Caucasian. Immediately after finishing the liver resection, half the liver tissue samples were fixed in 10% formalin and later embedded in paraffin, and the other half were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C for subsequent analysis. During surgery, 2 mL EDTA blood was drawn from an indwelling venous catheter for genotyping. Clinical data were gathered from patient records. Samples were anonymized by assigning them consecutive numbers. The local ethics committee (Ethikkommission der Friedrich-Schiller-Universität Jena an der Medizinischen Fakultät) granted permission for this study (approval no. 1138-06/03). Written informed consent for the use of tissue and blood samples for scientific purposes was obtained from each participant in the study. All procedures involving human participants were performed in accordance with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. 2.3 Patient characteristics Liver tissue samples from 54 female (52.4%) and 49 male (47.6%) patients were evaluated. The mean age at surgery was 59.0 years (median, 62.3 years; range, 25.7–79.6 years), and the mean BMI amounted to 27.0 kg/m 2 2 2 n n n n n n n n n n n 2.4 Genotyping Genomic DNA was extracted from 200 μ CYP1A2 −3860G>A CYP1A2∗1C Dde 23 −739T>G CYP1A2∗1E Ava 7 −163C>A CYP1A2∗1F Bsp 11 −729C>T; 7 558C>A CYP1A2∗11 Taq 24 2.5 Histology and immunohistochemistry From the paraffin-embedded tissue specimens, 4- μ Immunohistochemistry was performed by indirect peroxidase labeling.

Only in few sections a uniform distribution of the enzyme throughout the liver lobule was observed ( Fig. 1 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 The frequency distribution of the IRS scores for the liver samples was non-Gaussian, with wide variability and a skewed distribution ( Fig. 2 P P P Fig. 2 P Fig. 2 P P Fig. 2 Frequency distribution of CYP1A2 protein expression and enzyme activities in human nonneoplastic surgical liver samples.

In both cases, the frequency distribution was non-Gaussian and exhibited at least 2 peaks ( Fig. 2 P Fig. 2 P P P P Regarding ELISA values, there was no impact of the CYP1A2∗1C (−3860G>A) CYP1A2∗1F (−163C>A) U P P Fig. 3 CYP1A2∗1E −739T>G U P Fig. 3 CYP1A2 CYP1A2∗1C (−3860G>A) U P CYP1A2∗1E (−739T>G) U P CYP1A2∗1F −163C>A P Fig. 3 There was no effect of smoking habits on ELISA or WB data (ELISA, P P Fig. 4 P Supplemental Fig. 1 P Supplemental Fig. 1 U P P For markers of liver damage, we found a negative correlation between ELISA data and serum ALT values (rsp = −0.232, P P P Supplemental Fig. 2 Regarding liver function parameters, we did see a positive correlation between ELISA data and serum total protein content (rsp = 0.329, P P P Supplemental Fig. 3 α Lastly, there was no correlation between ELISA or WB data and the extent of fat deposition in the livers ( Supplemental Fig. 4 P P Supplemental Fig. 5 P P Fig. 5 3.3 CYP1A2 monooxygenase activities Across all samples, the mean ECOD activity amounted to 250.1 pmol/(mg protein × min) (median, 234.8 pmol/(mg protein × min); SD, 111.8 pmol/(mg protein × min)). Mean EROD activity was 127.2 pmol/(mg protein × min) (median, 108.4 pmol/(mg protein × min); SD, 83.4 pmol/(mg protein × min)), and average MROD activity was 256.6 pmol/(mg protein × min) (median, 217.4 pmol/(mg protein × min); SD, 143.9 pmol/(mg protein × min)). The large SD values indicate a great variability in P450 activities among individuals, with 10-fold differences in ECOD values from 62.3 to 620.5 pmol/(mg protein × min), 22-fold differences in EROD values from 21.1 to 469.6 pmol/(mg protein × min), and 12-fold differences in MROD values from 67.6 to 793.1 pmol/(mg protein × min). The ECOD, EROD, and MROD activities exhibited a skewed, nearly two-peaked distribution that trailed far to the right, with a few samples showing enzyme activities that were 3–5 times higher than the activities of the subjects below the main peak ( Fig. 2 All 3 model reactions correlated strongly with each other (ECOD vs EROD, rsp = 0.690, P P P Fig. 6 P P P Fig. 6 P P P Fig. 6 P P P P P P Fig. 6 Correlations of CYP1A2 enzyme activities measured by ECOD, EROD, and MROD (A–C) with each other and with CYP1A2 protein expression assessed (D–F) by the IRS or (G–I) by the DS (DS-AUs).

Although some in vitro studies revealed no differences in CYP1A2 expression and activities in liver microsomes from smokers versus nonsmokers, 19 , 21 14 , 20 9 , 10 , 13 , 17 , 23 , 49 , 50 , 53 , 56 , 57 , 60 61 62 In contrast to tobacco smoking, we and others found that frequent alcohol consumption did not affect in vitro CYP1A2 expression and activities. 14 , 19 20 21 In the present investigation, neither patient age nor patient gender showed any clear-cut effect on CYP1A2 expression and activities, and, for age, our findings confirm previous in vitro and in vivo data. 13 , 15 , 17 , 20 , 23 , 47 , 63 64 65 17 , 19 , 21 , 63 , 65 9 , 10 , 13 , 23 14 , 20 , 47 49 50 51 , 56 , 62 , 64 , 66 9 , 10 , 17 , 49 , 50 , 67 , 68 69 Our study revealed a significant negative association between CYP1A2 expression/activities and BMI or blood glucose concentrations, which has not been reported previously. We also noted a negative association between CYP1A2 expression/activities and the serum levels of markers indicating liver damage (ALT, GLDH, and GGT) or inflammation (CRP and fibrinogen), and a positive association with the serum levels of 3 markers of liver function, total protein, albumin, and CHE. Similar in vitro and in vivo results have been reported for CRP and GGT. 14 , 70 71 72 73 74 75 16 , 21 , 48 , 76 , 77 5 Conclusions We found great variation in CYP1A2 expression and activities among the subjects in our study, which was partially explained by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors such as tobacco smoking, nutritional status, inflammatory conditions, and the extent of liver damage. However, the contribution of each parameter was low to moderate. Although we identified other factors, these also cannot explain the large variability among individuals. Hence, other unknown factors must play a role in CYP1A2 expression and activities. Conflicts of interest All authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest that could be perceived as prejudicing the impartiality of the research reported. References 1 Gunes A. Dahl M.L.
