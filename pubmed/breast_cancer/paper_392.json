This study aimed to identify vulnerable BM locations through voxel-wise analysis of clinical characteristics. Method We retrospectively analyzed 161 breast cancer patients with BMs (2007–2019) and performed voxel-wise MRI analysis using standardized templates. Segmentation results were superimposed on standard brain templates to construct stereo-specific frequency thermograms and compared under the same voxel. Two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was performed. Overall survival (OS) and post-progression survival (PPS) after confirmation of brain metastases were tested by Kaplan-Meier, Cox regression analysis calculation, and log-rank test. Result The frequency heat map shows lesions of patients with breast cancer brain metastases were more inclined to the cerebellar hemisphere. Older patients’ lesions mainly occurred in the right frontal lobe, the left parietal lobe, and adjacent meninges compared with white matter of the right parietal lobe and cerebellar vermis among younger patients. ER-positive and PR-positive and HER2-overexpressed patients presented significance in the parieto-occipital lobe, cerebellum and adjacent meninges. Metastases with high levels of CEA were found in areas around the central anterior gyrus. HER2-overexpressed in primary sites and a normal level of serum CA15-3 were two independent protective factors in determining prognostic outcomes. Conclusion The preferred locations of breast cancer with brain metastases could be observed based on different clinical and biological characteristics, which could be clues for further study and helpful for clinical strategies.

Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (CE-T1WI) at the first diagnosis of brain metastases or pre-operation were extracted from the database of the center. Correspondingly, clinical and biological features include age, sex, operation or not, the status of ER, PR, HER2, luminal subtypes, tumor markers including CEA, CA19-9, and CA15-3 in periphery blood. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and statistical analysis All patients in the cohort underwent either 1.5 or 3.0-T MRI and an intravenous injection of gadodiamide or iodine was used to obtain the CE-T1WI. The pre-operative and first diagnosis scan when BCBMs were confirmed was used for analyses. All images were 3–5 mm thick with a 0–1 mm intersection gap. The locations of BCBMs tumors were identified according to the surgical and image description as well as tumors in imaging. Results were reviewed by two neurosurgeons and a neuroradiologist. Images were collected as the standard Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format then converted into the Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format by a python module: simpleITK [ 14 16 . 17 18 ITK-SNAP http://www.itksnap.org/ For meningeal involvement assessment, standardized contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (3–5 mm slice thickness) were independently analyzed by two neurosurgeon and one neuroradiologists using ITK-SNAP Segmentations were superimposed on the standard brain template to construct stereospecific frequency heatmaps. Two different phenotypes were compared under one feature (e.g., comparing age) and calculated the significance of one single voxel to build p-value heatmaps. The two-tailed Fisher’s exact test was taken with custom Python scripts, as described by Ellingson et al.

All survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier methods with log-rank tests. Key survival endpoints were rigorously defined: (1) overall survival (OS), calculated from initial diagnosis to death from any cause or last follow-up; and (2) post-progression survival (PPS), measured from the date of radiologically confirmed disease progression (including brain metastasis diagnosis per RECIST v1.1 criteria) to death or censoring. Patients lost to follow-up were right-censored at their last documented clinical evaluation. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for multivariate analyses. All statistical tests were performed using SPSS version 27.0 (IBM Corp), with p Results Demographics Among the 161 breast cancer brain metastases patients, there is a male patient (ratio of sex, 1:161). Age ranged from 21 years old to 73 years old and the median age is 49 years. 31 (19.3%) patients chose surgery, while most of them (130 patients, 80.7%) turned to systematic conservative methods, including classical chemotherapy (Docetaxel plus Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide, Cyclophosphamide plus Epirubicin and Fluorouracil, Docetaxel plus Epirubicin and Cytoxan, and Temozolomide et al.), radiotherapy(at primary or secondary sites), endocrine therapy (tamoxifen, letrozole, fulvestrant, and everolimus et al.), target therapy(trastuzumab, bevacizumab, and lapatinib et al.). It is worth noting that leptomeninges (5.6%) were shown to be affected by adjacent lesions when brain metastasis occurred. It should be noted that primary leptomeningeal metastasis (reported as 5.6%) must be distinguished from the adjacent meningeal involvement described above, with key differential criteria including: (1) anatomical connection to parenchymal lesions, (2) enhancement patterns (focal vs. diffuse/nodular), and (3) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology results. The demographics of BCBMs are summarized in Table 1  Table 1 Demographics of 161 patients with BCBMs Clinical/biological features Numbers Proportion Age Min 21 Max 73 Median 49 Sex Male 1 0.6% Female 160 99.4% Number of lesions Single 64 39.8% Multiple 97 60.2% Treatment Surgery 31 19.3% Conservative treatment 130 80.7% Luminal subtype Luminal A 16 9.9% Luminal B 57 35.4% HER2-overexpressed 45 28.0% Basal-like 43 26.7% Location Frontal lobe 74 46.0% Cerebellum 72 44.7% Parietal lobe 55 34.2% Temporal lobe 36 22.4% Occipital lobe 42 26.1% Basal ganglia 11 6.8% Skull 17 10.6% Ventricle 14 8.7% Meninges 9 5.6% Pons 5 3.1% Insular lobe 4 2.5% Midbrain 3 1.9% Thalamus 2 1.2% Aqueduct of midbrain 2 1.2% BCBMs distribution in the brain The frequency heatmap was built up by overlapping the ROIs for visualizing the spatial landscape of BCBMs. Biological and clinical features, consisting of age, treatment methods, the status of ER, PR, and HER2 in primary lesions, luminal subtypes, and tumor markers in peripheral blood were statistically analyzed. 49 years old was set as the cut-off value to stratify the patients. The selection of 49 years as the age cut-off in this study was based on the following considerations: Firstly, this threshold has been widely recognized in the field of BCBM research, with multiple authoritative studies confirming its clinical value as a prognostic stratification criterion [ 21 1  Fig. 1 Frequency and p-value heatmaps of breast cancer brain metastases (BCBMs) comparing age. A B The color ranging from dark to Light blue, and red to bright yellow, both indicated the frequency from 1 to 50% and the p-value from 0.05 to 0.0001. Tumor frequency heatmap showed that patients with localized lesions close to the brain surface (such as frontal lobe, parietal temporal lobe, and the brain feet) or with skull and leptomeningeal metastases were more inclined to choose surgical treatment, while the lesions at midline structure area, basal ganglia, and thalamus, skull base or functional areas were usually treated conservatively. (Fig. 2  Fig. 2 Frequency and p-value heatmaps of breast cancer brain metastases (BCBMs) comparing treatments. A B The color ranging from dark to Light blue, and red to bright yellow, both indicated the frequency from 1 to 50% and the p-value from 0.05 to 0.0001. Brain metastases from breast cancer in hormone receptor or HER2-negative (including HER2-low status and HER2-zero status) patients were less significant than in receptor-positive patients and were more concentrated in the cerebellar hemispheres and around the fourth ventricle. Lesions in HER2-positive patients were more statistically distinct in the left temporal lobe, right frontal lobe, pons, fourth ventricle, and cerebellum ( 3  Fig. 3 Frequency and p-value heatmaps of breast cancer brain metastases (BCBMs) comparing HER2 status in primary tumor. A B The color ranging from dark to Light blue, and red to bright yellow, both indicated the frequency from 1 to 50% and the p-value from 0.05 to 0.0001. Frequency heat maps based on luminal classification identified clusters in the frontal, parietal, and temporo-occipital lobes as more frequently associated with luminal A breast cancers, whereas clusters in the peri-lateral ventricular region, frontal lobe, temporo-occipital lobe, and cerebellum were more frequently associated with luminal B. Lesions in the HER2-overexpressed subtype tended to be scattered and partially concentrated in the anterior peduncle of the lateral ventricle, occipital lobe, and peri-cerebellum. (Fig. 4  Fig. 4 Frequency heatmaps of breast cancer brain metastases (BCBMs) comparing luminal subtypes in primary tumor. The color ranging from red to bright yellow, indicated the frequency from 1–50% Similar to the results of hormone receptor-negative patients, in patients whose peripheral blood CEA, CA19-9, and CA15-3 were not elevated, brain metastases mostly occurred in the cerebellar hemisphere. However, the lesions of CA15-3 positive patients were mostly located in the right frontal lobe, the white matter of the right paracentral lobule, the right occipital lobe, and the cerebellar leptomeninges thickened (Fig. 5  Fig. 5 Frequency and p-value heatmaps of breast cancer brain metastases (BCBMs) comparing CA15-3 in peripheral blood. A B Survival outcome The median overall survival (mOS) of patients with BCBM, defined from the date of primary breast cancer diagnosis to death, was 71.36 months (IQR: 33–83 months). When calculated from the date of brain metastasis diagnosis, the mOS significantly decreased to 21.43 months (IQR: 5–29 months),underscoring the adverse prognostic impact of brain metastasis, underscoring the adverse prognostic impact of brain metastasis.

A B C D E F Discussion Location is known as a fundamental feature not only to characterize tumors, but also to indicate tumor origin and biological behaviors—even to determine treatment strategies and predict prognosis. Current studies have proven that the lateralization of glioma locations is related to clinical symptoms, tumor growth, and underlying gene mutations [ 22 Voxel-based normalization and segmentation for MR images are practical methods to present spatial distribution and even significance comprehensively and directly. It was applied by T Schroeder et al. for mapping brain metastases from different primary tumors [ 11 Moreover, our study indicates the most three preferred BCBMs were centered in the frontal lobe, cerebellum, and parietal lobe. The results are in line with earlier studies that investigated brain metastasis site preference employing autopsy: cerebellum metastasis among breast cancer patients; occipital lobe along with cerebellum among lung cancer patients [ 8 23 24 25 26 27 29 30 32 33 34 Our study shows that age indicates metastatic tumor frequency at variance, the older patients: (> median, 49-year-old) right frontal lobe, the left parietal lobe, the cerebellar hemisphere, and the leptomeninges of the left cerebellar hemisphere; the younger (≤ median, 49 years old): parietal-occipital lobe, cerebellar vermis, lateral ventricles, and adjacent area of it. Younger age is one of the factors inclined to leptomeningeal metastasis, then eventually ventricle metastasis. Additionally, younger age in leptomeningeal metastasis implies inferior survival, while others consist of Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 70, biological features: ER/PR+/HER2-, systemic treatment, intrathecal treatment, and radiation therapy [ 35 36 At the time of diagnosis, approximately 64% of breast cancer patients have local-stage breast cancer, 27% occur regional stage, and 6% acquire distant (metastatic) disease [ 37 38 39 40 35 41 42 Secondary tumor with ER, PR, and HER2-positive in a primary tumor significantly clustered in the frontal lobe and cerebellum. Especially, patients with a HER2- overexpressed primary breast tumor were significantly more inclined to develop cerebellar metastatic lesions compared with HER2-negative patients (59.8% vs. 44.5%, p 43 44 45 46 47 Interestingly, we also found a molecular component of BCBMs differs from that of the primary tumors, as well as from metastases at other sites. Receptor statuses (ER, PR, and HER2) of brain metastases might present discordances with those of primary tumors, though without significant difference [ 48 50 49 51 52 53 54 55 56 This study revealed a significant correlation between tumor marker expression and the distribution patterns of brain metastases. CA15-3-positive patients predominantly exhibited metastases in the right cerebral hemisphere (frontal lobe, paracentral lobule, and occipital lobe) along with meningeal involvement, whereas marker-negative cases mainly presented with cerebellar hemisphere metastases. This disparity likely reflects distinct metastatic biological characteristics: CA15-3-positive tumors may possess unique hematogenous dissemination routes or blood-brain barrier penetration capabilities. In clinical practice, integrating CA15-3 levels with imaging features facilitates primary tumor identification and therapeutic decision-making, such as employing intrathecal chemotherapy for leptomeningeal metastases. The study further confirmed the prognostic value of CA15-3 serial monitoring. Future investigations with larger cohorts are warranted to validate these findings and elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms, ultimately optimizing personalized management of breast cancer brain metastases. Clinical studies in breast cancer patients demonstrate a significant correlation between serum CA15-3 levels and disease progression. Patients with elevated CA15-3 levels exhibit markedly earlier tumor metastasis compared to those with normal CA15-3 levels. Further analyses confirm that dynamic changes in serum CA15-3 levels show significant association with metastatic status, particularly in patients with distant metastases, where both the magnitude of CA15-3 elevation and detection positivity rate are substantially increased. These findings support the utility of CA15-3 as an important biological marker for monitoring breast cancer metastasis. When persistent elevation of CA15-3 levels is observed, clinical evaluation should be promptly conducted with consideration for more aggressive therapeutic strategies, including intensification of chemotherapy, addition of radiotherapy, or switching to endocrine therapy regimens. Our study results are consistent with this perspective, while also suggesting that patients maintaining normal CA15-3 levels may have a more favorable prognosis [ 57 CEA is a glycoprotein secreted by tumor cells, and its associated CEACAMs [ 58 This study provides novel insights into therapeutic decision-making for BCBM by integrating anatomical localization with molecular subtyping data. Traditionally, the feasibility of surgical resection has been primarily determined by tumor anatomical location, with superficial lesions generally considered surgical candidates while deep-seated lesions often receive conservative treatment. However, our findings demonstrate that molecular subtype characteristics can significantly influence this decision-making framework. Of particular note, even for anatomically resectable parietal lobe tumors, optimal treatment strategies show marked variations across different molecular subtypes. HER2-positive patients may derive significant survival benefits from surgery combined with targeted therapy. For HER2-positive BCBM patients with well-controlled local symptoms, priority consideration could be given to central nervous system (CNS)-active anti-HER2 agents (such as TKIs or ADC drugs) under close MRI surveillance. Meanwhile, the comparable survival benefits between radiotherapy combined with endocrine therapy versus surgical intervention in Luminal A subtype patients warrant further investigation. These findings suggest that molecular subtyping should carry equal weight as anatomical location when evaluating surgical indications. Furthermore, the predictive value of biomarkers cannot be overlooked. The predominant localization of CEA-elevated lesions in high-risk areas like the precentral gyrus provides objective evidence for preoperative risk assessment. The protective effects associated with HER2-overexpression and normal CA15-3 levels offer new therapeutic possibilities for deep-seated lesions. Collectively, these results indicate that BCBM treatment decisions require establishment of a multidimensional evaluation system that comprehensively considers anatomical accessibility, molecular characteristics, and biomarker profiles to develop truly personalized treatment strategies for patients. There are several extra limitations in the present study. It should be particularly emphasized that the observed survival advantage associated with surgical intervention requires cautious interpretation within the context of patient selection bias. The surgical cohort fundamentally represented a more favorable prognostic subgroup at baseline, as evidenced by significantly better preoperative KPS scores, more limited metastatic burden, and superior systemic disease control. Although we attempted to account for these imbalances in our analyses, residual confounding from unmeasured variables (e.g., molecular profiles, exact steroid dosing regimens) persists. Importantly, the apparent “surgical benefit” may partially reflect the patients’ inherent capacity to tolerate aggressive therapies rather than the intervention per se. Until randomized controlled data become available, our findings should primarily inform patient selection rather than justify universal surgical adoption, particularly for borderline candidates where stereotactic radiosurgery may achieve comparable local control with lower morbidity. Future investigations should incorporate comprehensive frailty indices and molecular biomarkers to better distinguish true surgical effects from selection artifacts. What’s more, due to the nature of the retrospective study, controlling field strength and imaging-section thickness were difficult to achieve. Besides, analyzing more clinical characteristics [e.g., symptoms and details of treatments] for more valuable prognostic prediction, would be appropriate. What’s more, owing to the single-center nature of the study, we could only include a limited number of patients and were unable to obtain ER/PR/HER2 status at secondary lesions in the brain. To go further, the mechanism of preferred locations (e.g., laterality) and discordance of hormone receptors and HER2 status were not revealed here. Lastly, the application of Fisher’s exact tests may give a hint to the nature of BCBMs, but we need extra evaluation by more sophisticated statistical analysis. In conclusion, our study visualized the preferred locations of breast cancer brain metastases and construct frequency and p-value heatmaps according to different clinical features. The findings might be a clue elucidating the mechanism underlying metastases formation and a valuable reference facing clinical decisions. Supplementary Information  Supplementary material 1.
