Background Evidence supporting exercise stress echocardiography (ESE) for breast cancer survivors treated with chest radiotherapy is scarce, and its association with clinical outcomes has not been evaluated. Objectives The objectives of the were to evaluate the prognostic value of ESE for breast cancer survivors treated with chest radiotherapy and to assess the relationship of radiotherapy with cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (CVD + NFMI), major adverse cardiac events (MACE), and all-cause mortality. Methods For this retrospective study, we included 507 breast cancer survivors treated with chest radiotherapy who underwent ESE from 2000 through 2020. Results The median (IQR) follow-up was 7.8 (4.9-10.8) years; the mean (SD) age at ESE was 65.9 (9.9) years and the median time from radiotherapy to ESE was 4.3 (2.0-7.4) years. Patients completed 7.33 (2.03) metabolic equivalents. Seventy-six patients had ischemia on ESE. They were older than those with normal ESE (67.3 vs 65.6 years) and had more atrial fibrillation (14.5% vs 6.3%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5.3% vs 0.7%). There were 35 CVD + NFMI, 61 MACE, and 80 deaths. Ischemic ESE was associated with an increased risk of CVD + NFMI (HR: 2.25; 95% CI: 1.05-4.76) and MACE (HR: 3.62; 95% CI: 2.07-6.32) even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, metabolic equivalents achieved, and cardiotoxic chemotherapy; the risk of all-cause mortality in these patients was not increased (HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 0.78-2.26). Conclusions An ischemic ESE predicts CVD + NFMI and MACE in patients with breast cancer treated with chest radiotherapy, independent of cardiovascular comorbid conditions and aerobic capacity. These patients should have closer follow-up and intense strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk.

In consideration of patient privacy, study data will not be made publicly available. These data could be available on reasonable request from the corresponding author. We screened electronic health records for all patients with a history of breast cancer treated with radiotherapy who underwent ESE at the 3 Mayo Clinic campuses (Arizona; Jacksonville, Florida; and Rochester, Minnesota) and the Mayo Clinic Health System (Minnesota and Wisconsin) between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2020. We excluded patients without chest radiotherapy, with ESE before chest radiotherapy, and without complete clinical, oncologic, or radiotherapy follow-up data. Relevant demographic information, clinical characteristics, cardiovascular comorbidities, echocardiographic results, and follow-up data were obtained from the health record. The baseline demographic and clinical information were retrieved at the time of ESE. Exercise stress echocardiography Every patient participated in an exercise protocol, for instance, Bruce, modified Bruce, Naughton, stress O 2 23 23 ischemic fixed abnormal ESE 23 24 Follow-up The primary outcome was CVD + NFMI. The secondary outcome was MACE, defined as CVD, myocardial infarction, revascularization, and stroke. The third outcome was all-cause mortality. These outcomes were chosen in concordance with previous literature about ESE in other populations. 19 20 21 22 Statistical analysis Continuous variables are presented as mean (SD) or median (IQR), and categorical variables are presented as number and percentage. Patients were divided according to the ESE results into 2 groups: those with non-ischemic findings and those with ischemic findings. For between-group comparisons, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used for nonbinomial responses, and the Pearson chi-square test was used for binomial responses. For outcome analyses, time to first event was used. The Kaplan-Meier method with a log-rank test for comparison between groups was used to estimate events free of the primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes. For independent variables associated with outcomes, univariable and multivariable Cox regression were performed, and results are presented as HRs with 95% CI. For the multivariable model, variables were selected according to the results of the univariable analysis, including those with a significance level < 0.1, as well as the use of cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, which was included regardless of its significance in the univariate analysis. A comparison was also made of the C P Results Clinical characteristics From 2000 through 2020, we identified 507 breast cancer survivors who had undergone ESE (504 women and 3 men) and had a history of chest radiotherapy. The mean (SD) age at ESE of the study population was 65.9 (9.9) years, the mean age at radiotherapy was 60.4 (10.7) years, and the median (IQR) time from radiotherapy to ESE was 4.3 (2.0-7.4) years. At the time of ESE, most patients had at least 1 cardiovascular risk factor: 277 (55%) had a history of hypertension; 301 (59%), dyslipidemia; 64 (13%), diabetes; 187 (37%), obesity; 38 (8%), atrial fibrillation; and 7 (1%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Of the patients, 34 (7%) had a history of myocardial infarction, and 44 (9%) had undergone revascularization—37 (7%), percutaneous coronary intervention and 7 (2%), coronary artery bypass grafting.

After dividing the study population by group (ischemic vs nonischemic result on ESE), patients with an ischemic result were slightly older (67.3 vs 65.6 years) and had significantly more atrial fibrillation (15% vs 6%; P P Table 1 Supplemental Table 1 Table 2 Aerobic capacity for both groups is presented in Table 3 P P P 2 2 P P P P P Table 3 Outcomes During a median (IQR) follow-up of 7.8 years (4.9-10.8 years) after the ESE, 35 CVD + NFMI, 61 MACE events, and 80 deaths had occurred. Eleven patients (14.5%) with an ischemic ESE result had CVD + NFMI. The estimated 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year CVD + NFMI-free rates were significantly worse for patients with an ischemic result than for patients without ischemia (98.7% vs 99.8%; 95.9% vs 99.1%; 93.0% vs 98.0%; and 81.3% vs 92.7%, respectively).

The study had 3 main findings ( Central Illustration Central Illustration Association Between Ischemic Results of Exercise Stress Echocardiography and CVD + NFMI, MACE, and All-Cause Mortality Among Patients With a History of Breast Cancer Treated With Chest Radiotherapy An ischemic ESE predicts CVD + NFMI and MACE in patients with breast cancer treated with chest radiotherapy, even after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors and METS. aHR = adjusted HR; CVD + NFMI = cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction; ESE = exercise stress echocardiography; MACE = major adverse cardiac events; RT = radiotherapy. ESE is a noninvasive, widely available, and radiation-free technique that can be used to quantify cardiac structure and function. 25 26 , 27 21 21 10 , 12 19 , 20 , 22 An earlier study of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma showed that the prevalence of ischemic results in ESE after 15 years of radiotherapy was only 5%. 28 29 28 30 In addition to echocardiography, other imaging modalities could be used to screen for CAD, particularly in asymptomatic patients. 12 , 16 10 , 11 Echocardiography remains the first-line imaging modality for screening, diagnosis, and surveillance of cardiotoxicity related to cancer treatment, 16 14 , 17 23 , 31 16 , 23 Our results support the usefulness of ESE in RIHD as recommended by current guidelines. 8 , 14 15 16 17 14 , 17 12 Conclusions In this retrospective cohort study of 507 survivors of breast cancer treated with chest radiotherapy who underwent ESE, an ischemic result predicted CVD + NFMI, MACE, and all-cause mortality. This association persisted after adjusting for cardiovascular comorbidities and FAC. Future studies should evaluate whether screening for CAD should be performed earlier than 5 years to reduce the cumulative incidence of cardiovascular disease and to improve quality of life for breast cancer survivors. Study limitations This study has some limitations. It is a single-center study with limited race and ethnic diversity among the patients, who were predominantly White. ESE as all the echocardiographic evaluations, is subject of interobserver variability; to reduce this, our echocardiography laboratory adheres strictly to international society guidelines, including those of the American Society of Echocardiography, with standardized imaging protocols, experienced board-certified sonographers and cardiologists, among other strategies to reduce this variability. Despite these limitations of interobserver variability ESE has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for detecting obstructive CAD with reported sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 83% as per the ASE Stress Echocardiography Guidelines. 23 Perspectives COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Funding support and author disclosures The authors have reported that they have no relationships relevant to the contents of this paper to disclose.
