Although the first outbreak of COVID-19 occurred in 2019, the virus continues to circulate globally, even years later. In Taiwan, the novel traditional Chinese medicine formulas, NRICM101 and NRICM102, have been extensively used to treat COVID-19, with Chinese medicine practitioners frequently prescribing them to manage the disease. According to data from the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, approximately 22% of COVID-19 patients opted for NRICMs’ treatments between 2021 and 2022. Despite the widespread use and reported effectiveness of these treatments, it is critical to evaluate the potential risks associated with their prolonged or frequent use. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive toxicological assessment of NRICM101 and NRICM102. Acute oral toxicity was evaluated by administering a single 5 g/kg bw dose to ICR mice and SD rats. No mortality, sex-related differences, or clinical signs of toxicity were observed. Subchronic toxicity was assessed through a 28-day repeated oral administration study with doses of 1.6, 3.1, and 4.8 g/kg bw per day of NRICM101 or 102, which showed no treatment-related deaths or organ pathology. While some hematological changes were noted, they were generally within physiological ranges and showed no consistent dose-dependent trends. Genotoxicity was assessed using three standard assays. The Ames test revealed no mutagenic activity.

People with underlying conditions still face a higher risk of mortality and recurrent infections when repeated mutations evolve into strains with more severity. Existing immunomodulatory and antiviral therapies, as well as vaccines are imperfect, and their availability remains a challenge ( Usher, 2022 Lai et al., 2023 Su et al., 2022 Ho et al., 2023 Tsai et al., 2021 Tseng et al., 2022 Tsai et al., 2021 Tseng et al., 2022 Wei et al., 2022 Cheng et al., 2022 Wei et al., 2023 Chang et al., 2024 Traditional medicines such as NRICM101 and NRICM102, are generally considered to be effective, given their rising popularity at a global level. The association between use and adverse reactions is little researched. In particular, concerns persist regarding the lack of standardized quality control and comprehensive scientific evidence supporting the safety of many herbal preparations ( Neergheen-Bhujun 2013 Tseng and Chang, 2019 While individual ingredients of NRICM101 and 102 are classified as dietary supplements in many countries, including the United States, the safety aspects of their combined effects as a brand-new prescription remain unclear. Thus, addressing the issues regarding the association between plant metabolites and liver and kidney problems, the nervous system, cardiovascular system, and mutagenicity, among others, is necessary. To this end, in this study, we aimed to fill the knowledge gap by evaluating the safety of NRICM101 and 102, including genotoxicity using in vitro 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals The following chemicals were obtained from specified sources: 4-nitro- O N 2.2 Formula and preparation of NRICM101 and 102 NRICM101 formula comprised baked Liquorice Root (7.50 g), Heartleaf Houttuynia (18.75 g), Indigowoad Root (18.75 g), Magnolia Bark (11.25 g), Peppermint Herb (11.25 g), Mulberry Leaf (11.25 g), Fineleaf Nepeta (11.25 g), Saposhnikovia Root (7.50 g), Scutellaria Root (18.75 g), and Mongolian Snakegourd Fruit (18.75 g), while the NRICM102 formula contains baked Liquorice Root (7.50 g), Heartleaf Houttuynia (18.75 g), Scutellaria Root (18.75 g), Magnolia Bark (11.25 g), Mongolian Snakegourd Fruit (18.75 g), Fragrant Solomonseal Rhizome (11.25 g), Indian Bread (18.75 g), Pinellia Tuber (11.25 g), Oriental Wormwood (18.75 g), and Prepared Common Monkshood Daughter Root (7.50 g). All botanical species referenced in NRICM101 and NRICM102 have been taxonomically validated by Dr. Chia-Ching Liaw (National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine, Ministry of Health and Welfare; Taipei 112, Taiwan), a qualified expert in pharmacognosy. Corresponding voucher specimens have been deposited at the Herbarium of the NRICM (MOHW, Taiwan). The decoctions of NRICM101 and 102 were further dried by cryodesiccation to obtain the extract powder. The chemical profiles and extract compositions of NRICM101 and 102 have been rigorously analyzed in our previous studies ( Tsai et al., 2021 Wei et al., 2022 The tested doses of NRICM101 or 102 were determined based on the recommended clinical dosage of 15 g of powder per day provided by the National Research Institute of Chinese Medicine (NRICM), MOWH. These doses were then normalized according to body surface area using allometric scaling ( Chaturvedi et al., 2001 2.3 Animals All animal experiments received approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of “Good Laboratory Practice for Non-clinical Laboratory Studies” and “Healthy Food Safety Assessment” as prepared by the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan. For the acute oral toxicity test, a total of twenty animals were used, consisting of ten Institute for Cancer Research (ICR) mice (5 males and 5 females, aged 6–8 weeks) and ten Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (5 males and 5 females, aged 5–6 weeks), all procured from BioLASCO Taiwan Co. They were randomly housed in polypropylene cages, with two animals per cage during the tests. For the repeated oral toxicity test, 80 SD rats (40 female and 40 male rats) obtained from BioLASCO Taiwan Co. were also randomly housed in polypropylene cages, with two animals per cage during the tests. The animals were maintained in conditions with a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, a temperature range of 20 °C–24 °C, and a relative humidity range of 50%–70%. They had ad libitum Table 1 TABLE 1 Summary of animal grouping for toxicity studies.

Additionally, SD rats were included to enhance the robustness of the evaluation, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of the potential toxic effects of NRICM101 and 102. ICR mice were divided into four groups, each consisting of five males and five females. For NRICM101 and NRICM102, separate control groups (vehicle only) and treatment groups (5 g/kg bw) were established. SD rats were categorized into three groups for treatment with either NRICM101 and 102. Each group of SD rats comprised five individuals of each sex, including both control groups and those administered 5 g/kg body weight of NRICM101 or 102. The selection of 5 g/kg body weight for the acute oral toxicity test was based on the OECD #423 (OECD, 2002), which recommends testing within a range of 2–5 g/kg BW. The upper limit of this range was selected to thoroughly evaluate the acute safety profile under the most rigorous conditions. A single dose of 5 g/kg bw of NRICM101 or 102 was administered via gavage, with the negative control group receiving an equal volume of sterile water. The animals were weighed weekly, and their behavior, clinical signs, and mortality were monitored twice daily for 14 days. Following the 14-day acute oral toxicity testing period, the animals were euthanized, and serum samples were collected and analyzed for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (CREA). Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc P 2.5 Subchronic oral toxicity study: repeated-dose 28-day toxicity evaluation in rats The 28-day repeated-dose oral toxicity study was performed in accordance with OECD #407: Repeated Dose 28-day Oral Toxicity Study in Rodents, to evaluate the systemic toxicity of NRICM formulations following subchronic oral exposure. Forty rats (comprising an equal number of females and males) were distributed into four groups: control (administered 10 mL of sterile water/kg bw/day); low dose (1.6 g/kg bw/day); middle dose (3.2 g/kg bw/day); and high dose (4.8 g/kg bw/day), with five female and five male rats in each group. Throughout the 28-day study period, all animals and food consumption were weighed weekly, and their behaviors, clinical signs, and mortality were monitored daily. Additionally, their body functions were assessed weekly through detailed examinations, including responses to stimuli, muscle strength, salivation, secretions, and respiratory sounds. At the end of the 28-day repeated administration, the animals were euthanized for a comprehensive evaluation, including clinical observations, hematology, serum biochemistry examinations, urinalysis, ophthalmological assessments, and pathological examinations. The vital organs were weighed, including the thymus, heart, spleen, kidney (paired organs were weighed together), adrenal gland, ovary, and brain. The tissues, including the adrenal gland, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen, thymus, epididymis, testis, ovary, and oviduct, were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and subjected to examination using light microscopy. This staining and subsequent microscopic assessment were performed on all tissues derived from both the control group and the high-dose NRICM101 or 102 groups. Blood samples were subjected to hematological and serum biochemistry analysis with evaluation of following indices: RBC (red blood cell), HGB (hemoglobin), HCT (hematocrit), MCV (mean corpuscular volume), MCH (mean corpuscular hemoglobin), MCHC (mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration), PLT (platelet), PT (prothrombin time), APTT (activated partial thromboplastin time), INR (international normalized ratio), NEU (neutrophil), Lym (lymphocyte), MONO (monocyte), EOS (eosinophil), BASO (basophil), ALB (albumin), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase), GGT (γ-glutamyl transferase), T-BIL (total bilirubin), T-PROT (total protein), GLU (glucose), BUN CREA (creatinine), CHOL (cholesterol), HDL (high density lipoprotein), TG (triglyceride), P 3- + + − 2+ Urinalysis parameters included specific gravity, pH value, glucose levels, protein levels, bilirubin levels, urobilinogen levels, occult blood, ketone levels, nitrite levels, leukocyte count, urine volume over 6 h, and sediment composition, including white blood cells, RBC, casts, crystals (Cry), bacteria (Bac), squamous epithelial cells (NEC), and spermatozoa. The parameters of specific gravity, pH, leukocyte count, and urine volume (6 h) were quantitatively expressed, whereas some parameters listed in Table SX ( Supplementary Material post hoc P 2.6 Genotoxicity assessment 1: Ames bacterial reverse mutation test The Ames test was performed in accordance with a previous study ( Maron and Ames, 1983 Salmonella Typhimurium 2 2.7 Genotoxicity assessment 2: mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase gene mutation assay (MLA) The in vitro In Vitro +/− −/− Clive and Spector, 1975 5 4 − 2 2.8 Genotoxicity assessment 3: micronucleus assay in mouse peripheral blood The micronuclei assay in the mouse peripheral blood was performed also in accordance with the guidelines of “Good Laboratory Practice for Non-clinical Laboratory Studies” and “Healthy Food Safety Assessment” and the recommendations of OECD guideline #474 (OECD, 1997b). For the micronuclei assay, Thirty-six ICR mice (comprising Thirty-one males and five females) were distributed into five groups: negative control (administered sterile water), positive control (cyclophosphamide, 0.1 g/kg bw), low dose (2.25 g/kg bw/day), middle dose (4.50 g/kg bw/day), and high dose (6.75 g/kg bw/day), with five male rats in each group and a female high dose group. The time points for assessing the micronucleus test in mouse peripheral blood, following the preliminary test of the high dose (6.75 g/kg bw/day) of NRICM101 or 102, were selected at 48 h after administration. The micronucleus test was performed on peripheral blood cells by cardiac puncture blood collection. At the end of the study, animals were sacrificed, and the peripheral blood was collected and mixed with heparin and subsequently fixed in methanol at −80 °C overnight. Then, samples were mixed with NaHCO 3 post hoc P 2.9 Statistical analysis All data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.

Over a 14-day observation period, we monitored behaviors, mortality, clinical signs, and body weights, and found no deaths, unusual behavior changes, abnormal clinical signs, or body weight variations in either group ( Figure 1 Supplementary Table S1 Figure 2 Supplementary Table S2 FIGURE 1 Effect of NRICM101 or 102 on body weight gain in the single doe acute oral toxicity test. Male and female SD rats (A) (B) Chart A shows the body weight of SD rats, comparing control, NRICM101, and NRICM102 groups over 14 days. Chart B displays body weight of ICR mice, separated into two comparisons: control versus NRICM101 and control versus NRICM102, over the same period. Both charts differentiate by sex and show increasing weight trends. FIGURE 2 Effect of NRICM101 or 102 on serum biochemical parameters in the acute oral toxicity study in rats. Male and female rats (5 animals per group) were administered a single oral dose of NRICM101 or NRICM102 (5 g/kg bw) or an equal volume of sterile water (control). After 14 days, serum samples were collected prior to sacrifice and analyzed for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine (CREA) levels. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (n = 5). * P Bar charts show serum biochemical indexes for male and female groups in control (blue), NRICM101 (green), and NRICM102 (brown). Indices include AST, ALT, BUN, and CREA. In the male group, all four parameters showed no significant differences across groups. In the female group, AST was significantly reduced in NRICM101 and NRICM102 compared to control, while the other indices remained relatively consistent across all groups and genders 3.2 A 28-day repeated oral sub-acute toxicity study of NRICM101 and 102 in rats 3.2.1 Clinical observation, body weight changes, and food consumption We assessed sub-acute chronic toxicity by orally administering NRICM101 or 102 to SD rats at doses of 0 (vehicle control), 1.6 (low dose), 3.2 (mid dose), or 4.8 g/kg bw/day (high dose) for 28 days. Throughout the 28-day study, no abnormal clinical signs and deaths were noted.

No unusual appearances were noted in major organs such as the thymus, heart, spleen, liver, kidney, adrenal gland, ovary, testicle, and brain for rats subjected to either NRICM101 or 102. The assessment of external appearance and internal or structure of eyes also showed no difference compared to the control group. In NRICM101-treated rats, ROWs of major organs did not significantly differ from controls in either sex ( Table 2 TABLE 2 Effect of NRICM101 or 102 on relative organ weights (ROWs) in the repeated subacute oral toxicity test.

ICR mice were administered sterile water (negative control), cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg bw; positive control), or NRICM101/NRICM102 at low (2.25 g/kg bw/day), middle (4.50 g/kg bw/day), or high (6.75 g/kg bw/day) doses.

In the toxicological evaluation study, we comprehensively evaluated the potential toxicity and genotoxicity of NRICM101 and 102 in vitro in vivo We also verified the repeated dose toxicity of NRICM101 and 102 by conducting a 28-day subchronic toxicity test in rats. During the experiment, daily repeated oral administration with NRICM101 or 102 for 28 days showed no evident abnormal clinical signs, and deaths were not recorded at any dose or in the control group. The impact of NRICM101 and NRICM102 on body weight and percent body weight change was also examined in both males and females. While significant differences were observed in some groups for both NRICM101 and 102, notably, these fluctuations were rapidly normalized, with animals regaining weight at rates similar to the control group in subsequent weeks. Given the sporadic nature of these changes and their absence of a dose-dependent trend, these changes may not be associated with the test materials. Similarly, notable reductions were observed in food consumption in certain groups. However, these changes were sporadic and lacked a dose-dependent pattern, indicating that the reductions were not primarily attributed to the test substances. Therefore, overall, these results suggest that NRICM101 and NRICM102 had minimal and temporary effects on body weight, body weight change, and food consumption, with no clear evidence of adverse impacts. Although ROW analysis showed significant differences in the adrenal gland in female rats that were administered a middle dose of NRICM102 and male rats that were administered a low dose of NRICM102 compared to the control group, these results may be attributed to the normal physiological changes in rats or not treatment-related effects. Moreover, hematological analysis revealed no severe effects of NRICM101 and NRICM102 in male and female rats ( Table 5 6 6 6 2+ 6 2+ Shifting to NRICM102, only low-dose-treated male rats exhibited a significant decrease in PLT levels (1104 ± 132 × 10 3 3 Necropsies conducted on rats subjected to NRICM101 and 102 revealed a notable absence of pathological abnormalities in vital organs, irrespective of the administered doses, following a 28-day repeated administration period. Additionally, in-depth necropsy analysis indicated no dose-dependent gross morphological differences of toxicological significance. Microscopic examination of the examined organs in both control and high-dose treatment groups showed no noteworthy histopathological alterations ( Figure 6 The recommended human therapeutic dose of NRICM101 and NRICM102 is 300 mL/day of decoction (15 g/day lyophilized powder), approximately 0.25 g/kg/day for a 60 kg adult. Using allometric scaling (conversion factor 0.625 for rats), this translates to 1.6 g/kg/day in rats. Accordingly, our 28-day subchronic oral toxicity study used 1.6 g/kg/day as the reference dose, with additional groups receiving 2× (3.1 g/kg/day) and 3× (4.8 g/kg/day), showing no treatment-related deaths or histopathological changes. Furthermore, a single oral dose of 5 g/kg in both SD rats and ICR mice showed no mortality or observable signs of toxicity. Importantly, the in vivo in vivo Genotoxicity refers to the ability of substances to directly or indirectly damage DNA, potentially leading to mutations without necessarily causing cytotoxicity. In this study, we evaluated the genotoxic potential of NRICM101 and NRICM102 using three established assays, including the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test), the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA), and the in vivo Hayashi, 2022 S. typhimurium in vivo Pinter et al., 2020 +/− in vivo in vivo in vitro in vivo in vivo NRICM101 and NRICM102 both incorporates a blend of 10 botanical plants, sharing five common and five distinct. They both enrich in flavonoids, particularly baicalin, wogonoside, and quercetin 3-rhamnoside ( Tsai et al., 2021 Wei et al., 2022 S. baicalensis Dinda et al., 2023 Huynh et al., 2025 Hu et al., 2022 Bernasinska-Slomczewska et al., 2024 Xu et al., 2021 Narayanankutty et al., 2021 Ho et al., 2024 in vitro in vivo O'Connor et al., 2009 5 Conclusion With this study, we primarily aimed to evaluate the safety and genotoxicity of NRICM101 and 102. First, in the acute oral toxicity study, where a single dose of 5 g/kg bw of NRICM101 or 102 was administered to both ICR mice and SD rats, no significant differences were observed between the sexes. No mortality-related effects or clinical signs attributed to the substances were observed, and body weight remained consistent. Blood serum biochemistry analysis revealed similar effects on liver and renal function parameters, with a notable decrease in AST levels in male rats. Second, the 28-day repeated subchronic toxicity study in rats indicated that daily repeated oral administration of NRICM101 or 102 did not lead to observable abnormal clinical signs, deaths, or significant variations in body weight. Some differences in ROWs were noted but were attributed to normal physiological changes or unrelated factors. Hematological analysis revealed dose and gender-dependent effects, impacting specific parameters, implying potential effects on blood parameters, though generally within acceptable limits. Third, genotoxicity was assessed using the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA), and the in vivo in vivo in vitro in vivo The authors express their gratitude to the dedicated team members in the NRICM laboratory who contributed to and supported this study.
