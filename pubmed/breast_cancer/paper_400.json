Objectives Preclinical models that accurately recapitulate the human immune response, particularly within the tumor microenvironment (TME), are needed for the translational and predictive testing of new therapies. Here, we examine whether the genO-BRGSF-HIS model—characterized by robust reconstitution of both human lymphoid and myeloid cells following engraftment with CD34 + Methods genO-BRGSF mice were reconstituted with human CD34 + Results We show that myeloid, dendritic and lymphoid cells (including NK and γδ T cells) are functional and recruited into the TME in genO-BRGSF-HIS mice implanted with different tumor cell lines, and that different immune cell populations are activated and get polarized within the TME. The composition of the TME is dependent on tumor type and tumor burden, demonstrating plasticity in the crosstalk between the human immune system and the tumor cells. Furthermore, we observed polarization of the cells recruited to the TME, as well as a wide diversity of recruited cell populations, suggesting that this model reproduces human physiopathology in the context of cancer. Based on the recruitment of the different cell populations according to tumor type, we also demonstrate that this model can be used for testing new therapies targeting lymphoid cells, such as T-cell engagers.

Lymphoid, myeloid and dendritic cells (DCs) are known to be involved in tumor establishment and progression, and to influence therapeutic outcomes. In particular, T cells have been described to play a dual role in tumor immunity: cytotoxic T cells are crucial for eliminating tumor cells, while regulatory T cells (Tregs) foster an immunosuppressive environment that supports tumor growth. Consequently, much effort has been devoted to harnessing the T cell’s unique ability to selectively target and kill tumor cells for the development of novel anti-tumor therapies. However, these approaches still face many challenges, such as an immunosuppressive environment within the TME and T-cell exhaustion, which limit the efficacy and safety of these therapies. The myeloid cell population is also known to play an essential role in modulating the tumor response, and the balance between pro- and anti-tumor function of myeloid cells is a critical factor in determining the overall response to treatment. The infiltration of certain subsets of myeloid cells can contribute to the establishment of an immunosuppressive environment in the tumor, promoting immune evasion and supporting tumor growth. Due to these characteristics, several strategies focus on targeting the myeloid cell population for cancer treatment. Modern immunotherapies are designed not only to target cancer cells directly but also to modulate the immune system in highly specific ways. A key strategy involves co-targeting both lymphoid and myeloid cells to enhance anti-tumor immunity while overcoming the immune evasion mechanisms employed by tumors ( 1 4 2 3 5 To facilitate the development and improvement of these therapies, significant efforts have been made to develop translational mouse models. An increased number of mouse models with human immune systems (HIS) are being developed for the study of human diseases ( 6 7 + 8 9 10 12 12 14 10 + 15 The BRGS model (BALB/c Rag2 tm1Fwa c tm1Cgn NOD 16 17 20 Flt3 21 22 23 in vivo 2 Results 2.1 genO-BRGSF-HIS mice display a stable and long-term engraftment with human CD34 + The presence of human T cells in the BRGSF-A2-HIS model containing a human leukocyte antigen serotype A2 (HLA-A2) class I transgene has been shown to be maintained for up to 55 weeks post engraftment in the blood and lymphoid tissues ( 22 + 22  Figure 1A +  Supplementary Figures 1A, B 21 24 25 +  Figure 1B  Supplementary Figure 1B  Figure 1B  Supplementary Figure 1B  Figures 2A, B  Supplementary Figures 2A–C  Figure 2A  Supplementary Figure 2B  Figure 2B  Supplementary Figure 2C 25  Figure 2B  Supplementary Figure 2C Figure 1 genO-BRGSF-HIS mice develop stable lymphoid, myeloid, and dendritic compartments for 31 weeks, and the myeloid and dendritic compartments can be restimulated.

Characterization of the myeloid and dendritic cell population demonstrated that exogenous treatment with hFlt3L resulted in a significant increase in the frequency and numbers of dendritic cells, including pDCs and cDCs (cDC1 and cDC2) (  Supplementary Figures 3A, B 11 21 24  Figures 3A, B  Figure 3B  Figure 1A  Figure 3B 21 Figure 3 The myeloid and dendritic compartments in genO-BRGSF-HIS mice can be restimulated.

Altogether, this data shows that hCD34 + 2.2 genO-BRGSF-HIS’ human myeloid cells are functional and feature responsive pattern-recognition receptors Macrophages and dendritic cells are involved in tumor recognition and initiation of inflammation, and do so by expressing pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that recognize different signals such as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) ( 26  Supplementary Figure 4 in vitro +  Figure 4A  Figure 4B In vivo  Figure 4C in vivo  Figure 4D + 27  Figure 4E +  Supplementary Figure 5 Figure 4 Human immune cells in the genO-BRGSF-HIS model express different PRRs and are functional.

To analyze whether tumor cell composition and cell activation in the genO-BRGSF-HIS mice recapitulated the diversity reported in patient tumors, the composition of the MDA-MB-231 TME was investigated. Characterization of immune cell infiltration into the tumor was performed at three tumor-growth timepoints, averaging a size of 200, 500 or 800 mm 3  Figure 5C + + 3 3 + 3 3 3 3  Figure 5D +  Supplementary Figure 6A +  Supplementary Figure 6B + +  Figure 5E  Figure 5F - - + + +  Figure 5G  Figure 5H 2.4 The TME of A549 tumors is dominated by human NK cells Given the diversity of immune cells present in the TME of MDA-MB-231 tumors, we questioned whether the composition of the TME in this mouse model would also significantly change upon implantation with different tumor cell lines, allowing the testing of immunotherapies targeting different cell populations. In recent years, NK-targeted therapies have received much attention due to their role in tumor elimination and immune surveillance, leading us for interrogate whether the genO-BRGSF-HIS mice would be suitable for testing such therapies. Since the A549 cell line, a tumor model of human lung carcinoma, has been reported to be highly infiltrated by NK cells ( 29  Figure 6A  Figure 6B  Supplementary Figure 7A +  Supplementary Figure 7B 3  Figure 6C  Figure 6D 30  Supplementary Figure 8  Supplementary Figure 9 3 31  Figure 6E 30 Figure 6 NK cells are recruited to the A549 TME and display activation markers.

Pie charts D detail the immune cell distributions, including T cells and NK cells, for each tumor volume. Bar charts E compare percentages of CD244+, DNAM-1+, and 4-1BB cells across tumor volumes, with statistical significance indicated. 2.5 The tumor microenvironment of HPAF-II tumors is mostly composed of T cells, enabling T-cell-targeted anti-cancer therapies Among the many therapies targeting different cell types, T-cell engagers (TCEs) have shown great promise in cancer treatment, with several approved TCE therapies already on the market. However, new TCEs targeting different types of cancer and with improved properties are still being developed, so preclinical models are needed to test these therapeutics. TCEs were recently shown to efficiently decrease HPAF-II tumor growth in genO-BRGSF-HIS mice ( 32  Supplementary Figure 10A  Supplementary Figure 10B 32  Figure 7A  Figure 7B  Figure 7C +  Supplementary Figures 11A, B  Figure 7D 33 32  Figure 7E  Figure 7E  Figure 7F +  Figure 7G 34 32 Figure 7 HPAF-II tumors in genO-BRGSF-HIS mice have a T-cell dominated TME and respond to T-cell engager combotherapy.

These models have also enabled the preclinical testing of new cancer immunotherapies with a much greater degree of translatability and, consequently, success ( 3 35 37 + As previously shown by us and others ( 12 24 38 + 15 20 21 39 40 41 The human myeloid and dendritic cells in genO-BRGSF-HIS mice were also shown to respond to a second boost of hFlt3L, resulting in increased production of cells to levels similar to those observed after the first boost. This data shows that the myeloid and dendritic compartments can be boosted at specific times that would be more relevant to a given experimental design, as well as extending the experimental window. As expected, the lymphoid cells did not strongly respond to hFlt3L, while the NK cells did, as previously reported ( 21 42 43 in vitro/ex vivo In vivo + - - + + - - + 28 Despite the differences in composition of genO-BRGSF-HIS blood and human blood, we show that myeloid, dendritic, and lymphoid cells are recruited into the TME in genO-BRGSF-HIS mice, and that one hFlt3L boost, or even none, is enough to observe this response. By analyzing the composition of the TME in three different cancer models—breast, lung and pancreatic adenocarcinoma—we observed a strikingly different composition of the immune cell infiltrate, consistent with what is reported for cancer patients ( 36 37 44 The characterization of the cell populations in the TME of different tumor types, as well as the markers they express, allows for the strategic and evidence-based development of new anti-cancer therapies. The demonstration of PD-L1 expression in tumor-associated macrophages, the suggested activation/exhaustion profile of T cells in the MDA-MB-231 tumor, or the identification of different NK cell subsets in the A549 tumor provide key examples for the development of targeted therapies. Blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis has been shown to be a successful strategy to enhance T-cell responses in TBNC patients and ultimately improve treatment outcomes ( 45 46 32 47 48 Furthermore, T-cell targeted therapies aiming at repolarizing the TME displayed promising results in the genO-BRGSF-HIS model ( 48 47 A current drawback in the steps of preclinical evaluation of new therapies is the lack of available models to enable simultaneous assessment of efficacy and safety, making it difficult to correlate the results, and highlighting the need to be able to perform both efficacy and safety analysis in the same model. Previous studies have shown the relevance of the genO-BRGSF-HIS model for safety studies by testing for the onset of cytokine release syndrome ( 3 24 49 50 The ability to thoroughly characterize the cell populations present in the TME is of particular importance due to the potential to develop new anticancer strategies such as 1) reprogramming of cells to an pro-inflammatory, anti-cancer phenotype; 2) development of precisely targeted anticancer therapies, either by targeting a specific cell type or a specific protein, such as an immune checkpoint; 3) prediction of cancer and treatment outcome; and 4) identification of new biomarkers that would allow the development of new therapies and stratification strategies. The development of both myeloid and lymphoid compartments makes this model a useful tool for studying human immune responses in the context of disease or not, as well as allowing the evaluation of therapies targeting either lymphoid or myeloid cells. 4 Materials and methods 4.1 genO-BRGSF-HIS mice Newborn BALB/c Rag2 tm1Fwa c tm1Cgn NOD tm1lrl 5 + + + ad libitum ® 4.2 Animal treatments genO-BRGSF-HIS mice received four intraperitoneal injections every two to three days (D0, D2, D4 and D7) of 10 µg (in 150 µL of PBS 1x) of recombinant human Flt3L (recombinant Flt3L-Ig (hum/hum), BioXcell, cat. BE0098). For experiments in which mice received a second boost of hFlt3L, genO-BRGSF-HIS mice received another four intraperitoneal injections every two to three days (D21, D23, D25 and D28) of 10 µg of recombinant human Flt3L. For stimulation of TLR4, mice were intraperitoneally injected with LPS at 2 mg/kg (serotype O127:B8), one day after the final day of hFlt3L treatment. Blood was collected 4 hours later into EDTA-coated tubes by intracardiac punction for cytokine analysis. For efficacy assessment of bispecific antibodies (BsAb), mice were subcutaneously implanted with 1.5 x 10 6 33 32 4.3 Clinical monitoring Following randomization based on hCD34 + 4.4 Cell line maintenance Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin and incubated at the 37°C with 5% CO 2 MDA-MB-231, an adherent cell line originating from human breast adenocarcinoma, was purchased from ATCC (#HTB-26) and maintained according to manufacturer’s recommendations. A549, an adherent cell line originating from human lung carcinoma, was purchased from ATCC (#CCL-185) and maintained according to manufacturer’s instructions. HPAF-II cells, a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma adherent cell line, were purchased from ATCC (#CRL-1997) and maintained in EMEM supplemented with 10% of heat-inactivated complete fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, #G7513) and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich, #S8636). Cells were sub-cultured upon reaching a maximum confluency of 80% during routine culture at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 4.5 Cell preparation for subcutaneous injection On the day of injection, the cells were detached using 1x TrypLE. The cell suspension was gently homogenized and counted using trypan blue exclusion and a Malassez hemocytometer. Cells were washed once with HBSS to ensure complete FBS elimination, before being centrifuged for the second time. Cell pellet was resuspended in HBSS to obtain the desired concentration for injection. The day before injection, animals were shaved over their right flank. On the day of injection, mice were anesthetized with gaseous isoflurane and cells were subcutaneously injected into the flank. 4.6 Splenocyte and bone marrow activation assay CD86 expression on monocytes was investigated using the spleens from 8 genO-BRGSF-HIS mice treated with hFLt3L.

Supernatants containing sera were collected into new tubes and stored at -80°C until processed for cytokine analysis. 4.8 Cytokine quantification Blood or cell culture media were collected at the indicated timepoints and kept on ice for processing. Blood was processed as described above for serum collection. Supernatant was centrifuged at 4°C for 5 minutes, at 500g.
