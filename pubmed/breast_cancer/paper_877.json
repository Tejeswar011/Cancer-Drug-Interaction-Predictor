Histone acetylation (HA) neutralizes the positive charge on histones by converting amine groups into amide groups 1 2 3 4 5 There are 18 subtypes of HDACs encoded in the human genome. These enzymes are categorized into two main groups; the first group comprisesis zinc-dependent HDACs, which are further divided into the following sub-classes: class Ia (HDAC1, HDAC2), class Ib (HDAC3), and class Ic (HDAC8), class IIa (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7, and HDAC9), class IIb (HDAC6 and HDAC10), and class IV (HDAC11). The second group consists of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + 6 7 8 11 11 Several HDAC inhibitors have been identified, and some (Fig. 1 vorinostat 12 13 belinostat romidepsin 14 15 panobinostat 16 17 19 20 21 22  Fig. 1 Example of approved HDAC inhibitors by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Recently, HDAC10 has been shown to play a unique role in neuroblastoma cells, where its inhibition lead to the accumulation of autolysosomes. This result indicates that HDAC10 may be potential therapeutic target for neuroblastoma treatment 23 24 12 22 Investigating the biological relevance of HDAC10 and evaluating its pharmacological role in cancer cell lines highlight the need for selective HDAC10 inhibitors. To date, only few inhibitors targeting HDAC10 have been identified 25 26 27 28 29 30 Most HDAC inhibitors exhibit a conserved pharmacophoric features, including a ‘cap’ group and hydrophobic chain (linker); both of which influence selectivity. Additionally, the zinc-binding group (ZBG) is critical for the inhibitor’s potency 31 12 1 12 16 29 30 Results and discussion Chemistry The compounds in this study were synthesized as outlined in Schemes 1 2 N N 3 3 1  Scheme 1 Reagent and condition: ( a b 2 2 3 3 r c 2 2 2 r  Scheme 2 Reagent and condition: ( a 2 2 3 3 b 2 2 Similarly, indole-3-carboxaldehyde and quinolone were treated in the same manner as indole-3-carboxaldehyde to produce compounds 2a-b 2f g 1 2 Pharmacology/biology Synthesis and in vitro testing of novel inhibitors Recently, piperidine-4-acryl hydroxamates ( PZ45 PZ48 30 PZ45/48 In the current work, we extended the structure-activity relationships of HDAC10 inhibitors by synthesizing a series of benzhyldroxamic acid derivatives featuring a zinc-binding group (ZBG) and a bicyclic aromatic moiety as a capping group. These derivatives were designed with a methylene spacer linked to a basic amine group, maintaining the common pharmacophoric features essential for HDAC inhibition as previously described. All prepared derivatives were evaluated in vitro for their inhibitory activity against HDAC10 (from zebrafish) and human HDACs 1, 6, and 8 (Table 1 2a 50 1 2c 50 3 2d 2f 50 S1 S1  Table 1 Chemical structure and IC 50 ID Structure IC 50  2a  0.41 ± 0.02  2b  2.0 ± 0.1  2c  4.5 ± 0.3  2d  290 ± 60  2e  75 ± 12  2f  110 ± 10  2g  11 ± 1.0  Tubastatin A  50 ± 3 The second series of compounds comprise of 4-(1-piperazinyl)benzhydroxamic acid derivatives that bear a bicyclic aromatic moiety as a capping group. Compound 2b 50 2e 50 2 2b 2g 50 In conclusion of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis, the absence of a strong basic amino group was found to reduce the inhibitory activity against HDAC10. Additionally, modifying the capping group with a hydrophobic tosyl moiety also led to a decrease in inhibitory activity. The preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis revealed that the incorporation of bicyclic aromatic moiety enhanced HDAC10 inhibitory activity. We designed and synthesized seven compounds featuring various substituents at the cap position and linker. Among these, the benzhydroxamic acid derivative bearing an indole ring, compound 2a 2e Enzymatic in vitro testing All the synthesized compounds were evaluated in vitro against zebrafish HDAC10 (drHDAC10), and human HDAC 1, 6, and 8 (details see Methods section). DrHDAC10 was chosen as the close homolog of human HDAC10 since it was found to be more stable and easier to express compared to the human HDAC10 30 32 2 30 2a 50 50  Table 2 In vitro selectivity of newly synthesized HDAC10 inhibitors.

Values are represented as mean ± SD ( n In the first screening, all compounds were tested at a concentration of 80 µM by the MTT assay. The result showed all compounds had cytotoxicity at 80 µM, and hence they were carried out for the second round of screening at a lower concentration. Data showed that all compounds displayed moderate cytotoxicity than the control compound, doxorubicin. Observing the dataset noted that all HDAC10 inhibitors were weakly toxic for LLC-PK1 and VERO kidney cell lines. Molecular docking Molecular modelling studies Docking studies have been conducted to elucidate the binding mode of the synthesized compounds in various HDAC isoforms, including HDAC1 (PDB ID: 5ICN), HDAC6 (PDB ID: 5EDU), HDAC8 (PDB ID: 2V5X) and drHDAC10 (PDB ID: 6UHU). To test the plausibility of the docking results, we compared them with several crystal structures of structurally related hydroxamic acids, including those we recently reported for drHDAC10.

Obtained RMSD plots from the molecular dynamic simulations revealed that the HDAC10-inhibitor structures (Figure S3c, Figure S4c, Figure S5c, and Figure S6c) are stable with an RMSD below 1.5 Å while the Zn ions generally show lower root mean square deviation (RMSD) values (Figure S3d, Figure S4d, Figure S5d and Figure S6d). Meanwhile, the ligand molecules tended to show higher fluctuations (Figure S3a, Figure S4a, Figure S5a, and Figure S6a) which was majorly attributed to the flexibility of the capping groups as observed in the ligand root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) plots (Figure S3b, Figure S4b, Figure S5b and Figure S6b). We further performed molecular dynamics simulation studies on the obtained docking pose of the most active compound 2a 4 2a 2a 4 O 3 4 4  Fig. 4 ( a 2a 2a b 2a 2a c d Conclusion In this study, we synthesized novel bicyclic hydroxamic acid derivatives, characterized their inhibitory activity against class I, and class IIb HDACs. Our findings highlight compound 2e 2a 2f 2c 2d Structural insights obtained from HDAC10–inhibitor complexes, along with the SAR study, provide a detailed understanding of the HDAC10 active site and highlight the critical structural features necessary for achieving potent and selective HDAC10 inhibition. Docking models with HDAC6 further elucidate the structural basis for HDAC10 selectivity over HDAC6, which is largely driven by the hydrophilic properties of the amino group integrated into the SAHA linker. Compounds lacking a strongly basic amino group exhibited a notable reduction in HDAC10 inhibitory activity. This decline can be explained by the loss of key interactions, such as salt bridges with D94 and E274, as well as cation-π interactions with W205 in HDAC10, which were consistently observed with other compounds in this study. As anticipated, only hydrogen bond interactions between the NH-group and D94 were detected (Figure S1 S1 On the other hand, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal that the indole capping group can occupy one of two distinct hydrophobic regions at the rim of the binding pocket. In two clusters (with occupancies of 55% and 15%, respectively), the capping group engages in hydrophobic interactions with I27, A28, and P29. In a third cluster (17% occupancy), the capping group is positioned between F204 and W205 (Fig. 4 Experimental Chemistry General Reagents and hydrous or anhydrous organic solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Darmstadt, Germany) and Alfa Aesar Chemicals (Tewksbury, MA, USA) and were used without further purification. Reaction progress was monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on pre-coated 0.20 mm silica gel GF Uniplates from Macherey-Nagel (Düren, Germany). The TLC plates were visualized using a 254 nm UV lamp and chemical indicators such as ninhydrin, potassium permanganate (KMnO 4 J General procedure for the synthesis of HDACs inhibitor General synthesis methods Preparation of 1-tosyl-1 H This compound was prepared from 1 H p 37 39 1 H 1 N N 3 2 2 2 2 f 1 3 d 3 J J J J J J 13 3 d C 3 C m z + 16 14 3 General procedure for preparation of ((1-tosyl-1 H H 1a g To a solution of 1-tosyl-1 H 2 3 H 1 3 3 2 2 2 4 1a-g Preparation of ethyl 4-((((1 H 1a This compound was synthesized from 1 H 1 3 3 p f 3 1 3 d J 2 3 2 J 2 J 2 3 J J J J J J 13 3 d 2 C 3 C 2 C 2 C 2 3 m z + 21 23 2 4 + 19 21 2 2 Preparation of ethyl 4-(4-((1 H 1b This compound was synthesized from 1 H 1 3 3 p f 3 1 3 d J 2 3 J J 2 J 2 3 J J J J 13 3 d 2 C 3 C 2 C 2 3 m z + 22 26 3 2 Preparation of ethyl 4-((((1-tosyl-1 H 1c This compound was synthesized from 1-tosyl-1 H 2 3 3 p f 3 1 3 d J 2 3 J J J J J J J J 13 3 d 2 C 3 C 3 C 2 3 m z + 52 53 4 8 2 + 26 26 2 4 Preparation of ethyl 4-(((1-tosyl-1 H 1d This compound was synthesized from 1-tosyl-1 H 2 3 3 f 3 1 3 d J 2 3 3 J 2 3 J 2 J J J J J J 13 3 d 2 C 3 C 3 2 C 2 3 + Preparation of ethyl 4-(4-((1-tosyl-1 H 1e This compound was synthesized from 1-tosyl-1 H 2 3 3 p f 3 1 3 d J 2 CH 3 CH 3 H 2 J CH 2 3 J J J J J J J 13 3 d 2 C 3 C 3 C 2 C 2 3 m z + 29 32 3 4 + 29 31 3 4 Preparation of ethyl 4-((quinolin-3-ylmethyl)amino)benzoate ( 1f This compound was synthesized from 3-quinolinecaboxaldehyde ( 3 3 3 40 42 p f 3 1 3 d J 2 CH 3 J CH 2 3 J CH 2 - H J J J J J J J J 13 3 d 2 C 3 C 2 C 2 3 m z + 19 19 2 2 Preparation of ethyl 4-(4-(quinolin-3-ylmethyl)piperazin-1-yl)benzoate ( 1g This compound was synthesized from 3-quinolinecaboxaldehyde ( 3 3 3 p f 3 1 3 d J 2 CH 3 J J H 2 J CH 2 3 J J J J J J J J 13 3 d 2 C 3 C 2 3 C 2 m z + 23 26 3 2 General procedure for preparation of corresponding hydroxamic acid derivatives of ( 2a g To a solution of benzoate derivatives ( 1a-g 2a-g Preparation of 4-((((1 H N 2a Compound 2a 1a 2a p 1 d 6 H 2 J H 2 13 d 6 C 2 C 2 m z + 17 16 3 2 8 9 2 2 + 9 8 Preparation of 4-(4-((1 H N 2b Compound 2b 1b 2b p 1 d 6 H 2 J J J J J J H 13 d 6 C 2 m z + 20 21 4 2 35 + 20 22 4 2 Preparation of N H 2c Compound 2c 1c 2c p f 2 2 1 d 6 CH 3 CH 2 CH 2 J J J J J J J J H H 13 d 6 C 3 C 2 C 2 m z + 24 22 3 4 + 48 45 6 8 2 Preparation of N H 2d Compound 2d 1d 2d 2 2 p f 2 2 1 d 6 CH 3 J CH 2 J J H- 2 J J J J J J J H H 13 d 6 C 3 C 2 m z + 23 21 3 4 + 46 43 6 8 2 Preparation of N H 2e Compound 2e 1e 2e p f 2 2 1 d 6 CH 3 J J H 2 J J J J J J J J H H 13 d 6 C 3 C 2 m z + + 27 27 4 4 − Preparation of N 2f Compound 2f 1f 2f p 1 d 6 J CH 2 J J H- 2 J J J J J J H J H 13 d 6 C 2 m z + 17 14 3 2 Preparation of N 2g Compound 2g 1g 2g p 1 d 6 H 2 J J J J J J H H 13 d 6 C 2 m z + 21 24 4 2 Pharmacological/biological assays The cytotoxic activity The cytotoxic activity of all pure compounds was determined towards a panel of four human solid tumour cell lines: melanoma (SK-MEL), epidermal carcinoma (KB), breast carcinoma (BT-549), and ovarian carcinoma (SK-OV-3). Moreover, non-cancer kidney cell lines (LLC-PK1 and VERO) were also employed to determine if the anti-cell proliferative activity of these compounds was selective for the tested tumour cell lines. All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The cells were seeded in 96-well plates (10,000 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h. All ligands were dissolved in DMSO, diluted in media, and added to the cells at concentrations of 80, 40, 20, and 10 µM. After incubating for 48 h, cell viability was determined using a tetrazolium dye WST-8, which is converted to a water-soluble formazan product in the presence of 1-methoxy PMS by the activity of cellular enzymes. The colour of the formazan product was measured at 450 nm on a plate reader. Doxorubicin was used as a positive control for the cytotoxicity assay, and DMSO (0.25%) was used as the vehicle control.
