Introduction Cancer remains a leading global health burden, with limited therapeutic efficacy and debilitating complications [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 10 ® 12 13 ® 14 15 To overcome the limitations of conventional carrier-based nanomedicines, carrier-free nanoassemblies composed of small-molecule drugs or prodrugs have emerged as a promising platform for cancer therapy [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 19 25 Precise modulation of intermolecular forces is a key driver in the formation of prodrug nanoassemblies, enabling stable self-assembly and efficient delivery [ 26 27 19 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 Guided by fundamental principles of molecular self-assembly, we engineered a next-generation DOX delivery system that couples π–π stacking with spatially programmed disulfide bonds (α, β, γ), achieving dual benefits of reduced carrier toxicity and controlled, efficient release. By leveraging the strong π–π stacking capability of Fmoc moieties to facilitate robust nanoassembly formation while systematically investigating the impact of disulfide bond positioning on both structural stability and redox-responsive drug release kinetics. As illustrated in Scheme 1 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Experimental Materials Chemical reagents including HBTU, DIPEA, DMAP, DOX‧HCl, and Fmoc were sourced from Anaiji Chemical Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). DSPE-PEG 2K 2.2. Design and Synthesis of Position-Specific Disulfide-Bridged DOX Prodrugs We referred to the methods in the literature and synthesized three position-specific disulfide bridging DOX prodrugs (FAD, FBD, FGD) through a standardized three-step protocol [ 33 37 2 2 2 + m z 1 6 2.3. Preparation of DOX Prodrug NAs The three prodrug-based nanoassemblies (FAD NAs, FBD NAs, and FGD NAs) were synthesized using a standardized nanoprecipitation protocol [ 38 39 v v 2K w w Prior to full-scale production, comprehensive parameter optimization was conducted. This systematic evaluation assessed the impact of different organic solvents (THF, ethanol, methanol, acetonitrile, and various combinations) and stirring speeds (650–1950 rpm) on nanoassembly characteristics. Based on extensive characterization data, the THF/ethanol (1:1) cosolvent system combined with 1050 rpm stirring was identified as the optimal formulation condition, yielding nanoassemblies with the most favorable physicochemical properties. For quality control, the prepared nanoassemblies were characterized using dynamic light scattering (Malvern Zetasizer, NanoZS, Malvern Co., Worcestershire, UK). Samples were appropriately diluted (50 μL nanoassemblies in 950 μL deionized water) and equilibrated for 120 s prior to measurement. We evaluated three critical parameters (hydrodynamic diameter, PDI, and zeta potential) with triplicate measurements to verify reproducibility. 2.4. In Vitro Stability Study of NAs The colloidal stability of PEGylated FAD NAs, FBD NAs, and FGD NAs (0.5 mg/mL) was systematically evaluated under three conditions: (1) in PBS containing 10% FBS (pH 7.4) at 37 °C with shaking (100 rpm), with particle size monitored over 24 h; (2) during 30-day storage at 4 °C; and (3) the formulations were mixed with 100 mg sucrose in 2 mL tubes, vortexed for complete dissolution, transferred to vials, and lyophilized (−80 °C pre-freeze for 24 h followed by 24 h primary drying) in a freeze-dryer. Reconstitution with 1 mL of deionized water yielded homogeneous nanosuspensions, with stability assessed via pre-/post-lyophilization particle size changes and powder morphology. In addition, the encapsulation rates of the three nanoassemblies during the stability experiment were determined by ultrafiltration and HPLC. 2.5. Evaluation of Intermolecular Interaction We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the driving forces underlying nanoassemblies. The computational analysis was performed using the Yinfu Cloud platform (Guangzhou Yinfu Information Technology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China), which involved the following: (1) constructing energy-minimized three-dimensional prodrug structures (in mol2 format) with precise disulfide bond positioning and (2) performing small-molecule docking through conformational searching to characterize hydrogen bonding, π–π stacking, and hydrophobic interactions. Then three chemical disruptors were used to probe intermolecular forces in NAs: 50 mM NaCl (electrostatic interactions), 50 mM urea (hydrogen bonds), and 50 mM SDS (hydrophobic interactions). For each test, 900 μL of disruptor solution was mixed with 100 μL of PEGylated prodrug nanoassemblies in 2 mL tubes, then incubated (37 °C, 100 rpm, 3 h). Particle size and PDI were measured pre- and post-incubation. Significant increases confirmed force-specific disruption. 2.6. Drug Release The release study was conducted using PBS (pH 7.4) containing 25% ethanol as the solvent, with three different dithiothreitol (DTT) concentrations (0, 10, and 100 μM). PEGylated FAD NAs, FBD NAs, and FGD NAs were introduced into 5 mL of release medium at a DOX-equivalent concentration of 200 μg/30 mL. The mixtures were then incubated in a constant-temperature shaker maintained at 37 °C with 100 rpm agitation. Aliquots were collected at specified time points: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h for standard conditions; 0, 0.5, 1, and 4 h for FAD NAs in 10 μM DTT; and 0, 0.167, and 0.333 h for FAD NAs in 100 μM DTT. The released DOX prodrug was quantified by HPLC through peak area analysis. 2.7. Cell Culture The mouse breast tumor cell line (4T1 cells), human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) epithelial cell line (A549 cells), and murine fibroblasts (3T1 cells) were derived from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing, China). For cryopreservation, adherent cells at logarithmic growth phase (80% confluency) were trypsinized (0.25% trypsin, 1 min), centrifuged (1000 rpm, 5 min), and resuspended in freezing medium before storage at −80 °C. For recovery, frozen vials were rapidly thawed (37 °C, <1 min), centrifuged, and seeded in pre-warmed medium. Subculture followed the same trypsinization procedure, with a 1:5 split ratio into fresh medium. All cells were maintained at 37 °C/5% CO 2 2.8. Cellular Uptake C-6-labeled nanoassemblies were prepared by co-dissolving DOX prodrug and C-6 (1.0 mg each, at a 9:1 molar ratio) in THF/ethanol (1:1, v v 2K w w After incubation periods of 0.5 or 2 h, 4T1 cells were processed for flow cytometric analysis (BD FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) following the same protocol used for confocal microscopy. Cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4), then filtered into flow cytometry tubes for quantitative fluorescence measurement. All procedures were performed under light-protected conditions to prevent fluorophore degradation. 2.9. In Vitro Cytotoxicity Investigation The cytotoxic effects of DOX Sol, FAD NAs, FBD Nas, and FGD NAs on tumor cells (4T1 and A549 cells) and normal cells (3T3 cells) were evaluated by MTT assay. Briefly, cells were enzymatically detached with trypsin, pelleted by centrifugation (1000 rpm, 5 min), and adjusted to 10 4 2 50 2.10. Animal Housing All experimental animals were purchased from Liaoning Changsheng Biotechnology Co., Ltd., with confirmed good health status, without genetic modification, and without any prior experimental procedures. Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shenyang Pharmaceutical University (Shenyang, China). The animal study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (Approval Code: SYPU-2ACUC-S2024-0919-201; Approval Date: 19 September 2024). The study used adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (8–12 weeks old, ~200 g) and adult female BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old, ~20 g). 20 SD rats and 68 BALB/c mice were housed under standard laboratory conditions with free access to food and water. Randomization of treatment order and cage positions was implemented, with blinded assessments to minimize handling and environmental biases. 2.11. Pharmacokinetics A total of 20 SD rats were randomly allocated into four treatment groups: DiR Sol, FAD@DiR NAs, FBD@DiR NAs, and FGD@DiR NAs ( n 2.12.

Processing of Animal Experimental Data Animals were randomly assigned to control and treatment groups to prevent selection bias (e.g., avoiding unintentionally assigning healthier animals to one group), balance confounding variables (e.g., weight, age, litter effects), and meet statistical assumptions (e.g., independence of observations). For basic comparisons (e.g., *t*-tests or one-way ANOVA), n 2.15. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism version 9.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Between-group differences were analyzed by two-tailed Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post hoc test, respectively, for two groups and multiple groups. Statistical significance was defined as p p p p 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Synthesis of Three Redox-Specific Prodrugs of DOX To systematically investigate the impact of disulfide bond positioning on prodrug release kinetics and therapeutic efficacy, we designed three DOX prodrugs with distinct disulfide linkage modes at the α-, β-, and γ-positions relative to the amide bond (designated as FAD, FBD, and FGD, respectively). This structural optimization focused on the amino terminus of DOX, which represents an ideal site for chemical modification. The synthetic routes and chemical structures for these prodrugs are illustrated in Figure S1 Figure 1 1 Figure S2–S7 3.2. Preparation and Characterization of NAs Three disulfide-bridged DOX prodrug nanoassemblies (FAD NAs, FBD NAs, FGD NAs) were successfully prepared through optimized one-step nanoprecipitation ( Figure 1 2K Tables S1 and S2 Figure 1 Table S3 Table S3 w w Figure S8 Mechanistic studies employing intermolecular force disruption ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Stability assessments under physiological conditions (10% FBS/PBS, pH 7.4) showed that FAD and FBD NAs maintained their original size distribution over 24 h, while FGD NAs reached a stable plateau at 130 nm ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Table S4 Figure S9 Figure 1 3.3. Redox-Responsive Drug Release Behavior of NAs In Vitro Malignant cells maintain substantially elevated intracellular GSH levels compared to their normal counterparts, creating a characteristically reductive tumor microenvironment. The disulfide bonds incorporated into DOX prodrugs undergo selective cleavage under these conditions, releasing DOX–thiol derivatives (DOX–SH). As established in previous studies, the release mechanism proceeds through sequential thiol–disulfide exchange reactions: (1) initial nucleophilic attack by GSH generates DOX-SSG, followed by (2) a second GSH-mediated cleavage that releases oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and yields the active DOX–SH species. The amide linkage in these prodrugs exhibits greater stability than ester bonds, preventing further hydrolysis to free DOX and maintaining DOX–SH as the terminal active form, which retains potent antitumor activity [ 17 The drug release behavior of DOX prodrug NAs was evaluated by monitoring prodrug degradation under simulated reductive conditions using DTT-containing media. In the absence of DTT, all three NA formulations (FAD NAs, FBD NAs, and FGD NAs) exhibited minimal degradation, demonstrating excellent stability ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 A clear concentration-dependent release pattern was observed, with accelerated degradation kinetics at higher DTT concentrations. As shown in Figure 2 3.4. Cellular Uptake The three DOX prodrug variants, differing in disulfide bond positioning (α, β, and γ), all formed monodisperse nanoassemblies via self-assembly. Following PEGylation, these nanoassemblies exhibited enhanced colloidal stability and distinct redox-responsive drug release profiles, suggesting promising antitumor potential. To evaluate cellular uptake, we employed C-6 labeled formulations (C-6 Sol, FAD@C-6 NAs, FBD@C-6 NAs, and FGD@C-6 NAs) in 4T1 cells. Confocal microscopy analysis demonstrated time-dependent cellular internalization, with significantly greater fluorescence intensity observed at 2 h compared to 0.5 h ( Figure 3 Figure 3 p 3.5. Cytotoxicity Previous in vitro characterization revealed distinct reduction-sensitive release profiles among the three prodrug nanoassemblies (FAD NAs, FBD NAs, and FGD NAs). While rapid drug release typically enhances cytotoxicity, the structural variations in the liberated DOX–thiol derivatives—with sulfhydryl groups at distinct positions (α, β, or γ) relative to the amide bond—may significantly influence their biological activity. To elucidate these structure-activity relationships, we conducted comprehensive cytotoxicity evaluations using 4T1 cells, A549 cells, and 3T3 cells as normal cell controls. Comparative analysis demonstrated a consistent cytotoxic hierarchy in tumor cells (4T1/A549 cells): DOX Sol > FBD NAs > FAD NAs > FGD NAs ( Figure 3 Table S5 All nanoformulations showed significantly reduced cytotoxicity in 3T3 cells compared to malignant cells ( Figure 3 3.6. Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution Our three strategically designed NAs with different disulfide bond positions demonstrated excellent stability, redox-responsive release of DOX–thiol derivatives, efficient tumor cell uptake, and significant in vitro cytotoxicity in previous studies. These promising properties necessitated further in vivo evaluation to assess their therapeutic potential. Following intravenous administration, nanotherapeutics must successfully reach tumor sites to exert pharmacological effects, raising the question of whether disulfide position variations would affect their pharmacokinetic behavior and tumor accumulation profiles. Due to its strong binding affinity with NAs, excellent fluorescence properties, minimal interference with in vivo fate, and low toxicity, DiR was selected as the fluorescent tracer to investigate the pharmacokinetic behavior of three DOX prodrug-based nanoassemblies. Pharmacokinetic analysis in SD rats revealed distinct plasma concentration-time curves for DiR Sol versus the three prodrug NAs ( Figure 4 Figure S10 0–24h 0–24h Table S6 Effective intratumoral drug accumulation represents a fundamental requirement for therapeutic efficacy, with drug concentration directly correlating with antitumor activity. Through quantitative in vivo fluorescence imaging, we evaluated the tumor-targeting capability of DiR-labeled prodrug nanoassemblies, where fluorescence intensity served as a direct indicator of tumoral drug enrichment. All three nanoformulations demonstrated superior tumor accumulation compared to DiR Sol ( Figure 4 Figure 4 3.7. In Vivo Antitumor Efficacy Our designed DOX prodrug nanoassemblies with distinct disulfide linkages demonstrate four key advantages: (1) simple preparation with minimal excipients and high drug loading (~50%), (2) redox-responsive drug release in tumor microenvironments, (3) enhanced cellular uptake and cytotoxicity, and (4) prolonged circulation with tumor accumulation. While sharing these benefits, the α (FAD), β (FBD), and γ (FGD) configurations displayed differential release kinetics, cytotoxicity, pharmacokinetics, and biodistribution profiles due to their structural variations. This prompted a comprehensive evaluation of their therapeutic efficacy and safety in 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice. Using 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice, we assessed antitumor efficacy through tumor volume measurements, burden rates, and histopathological analysis (H&E staining) across six treatment groups: Saline, DOX Sol, Doxil, and three prodrug nanoassemblies (FAD, FBD, and FGD NAs) at 10 mg/kg DOX-equivalent doses once every 3 days through injection for 5 times ( Figure 5 3 3 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure S11 Comprehensive safety evaluation in 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice demonstrated superior biocompatibility of the prodrug nanoassemblies (FAD, FBD, FGD NAs) compared to conventional DOX formulations. While DOX Sol and Doxil (10 mg/kg DOX-equivalent) caused 100% mortality within 8 days, all nanoassembly-treated groups maintained stable body weights ( Figure S12 Figure S13 Figure S14 Capitalizing on the established safety and efficacy profile of FBD NAs, we investigated its dose–response relationship in 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice at escalating DOX-equivalent doses (10, 25, and 40 mg/kg). The dosing regimen is shown in Figure 5 3 3 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure S15 Comprehensive safety assessment of FBD NAs at escalating doses (10–40 mg/kg DOX-equivalent) revealed excellent in vivo tolerability. All dose groups maintained stable body weights ( Figure S16 Figure S17 Figure S18 4. Conclusions and Discussion In this study, we elucidate that the antitumor efficacy of precisely engineered prodrug nanoassemblies is intricately governed by the strategic placement of disulfide bonds in conjunction with π–π stacking interactions. These two factors synergistically modulate the drug release kinetics, thereby offering a solution to the long-standing delivery-release paradox that has plagued the field of nanomedicine. Our investigations reveal that robust π–π stacking interactions endow the prodrug nanoassemblies with exceptional self-driven assembly properties, facilitating their formation and stability. Concurrently, the systematic manipulation of disulfide bond locations within the prodrug architecture provides a precise means of controlling the drug liberation dynamics. Our experimental results clearly demonstrate position-dependent drug release kinetics, following the order of α > β > γ. Notably, the β-disulfide configuration emerges as the most clinically promising candidate, as it strikes an optimal balance between systemic stability and specific drug release, thus achieving the desired therapeutic efficacy. This research represents an innovative integration of tumor reduction-responsive prodrug design with carrier-free nanoassembly technology. We have successfully developed three DOX prodrug nanoassemblies, namely FAD, FBD, and FGD NAs, which are distinguished by the different positions of disulfide bonds (α, β, and γ). To enhance the intermolecular interactions within these nanoassemblies, we incorporated 9-fluorenylmethanol as an aromatic conjugated side chain. Subsequently, we conducted a systematic evaluation of the impact of disulfide bond positioning on the properties of these nanoassemblies. The results indicate that the β-disulfide modified FBD NAs exhibit superior performance across multiple aspects. Firstly, they possess high stability, as evidenced by a particle size of approximately 110 nm, a zeta potential of −40 mV, and a drug loading capacity ranging from 45% to 50%. Secondly, they demonstrate controlled reduction-responsive release, with the release rate following the order of FAD > FBD > FGD. Thirdly, compared to their α- and γ-modified counterparts, FBD NAs exhibit superior cytotoxicity, more favorable pharmacokinetics (as indicated by the highest AUC 0–24h Acknowledgments We appreciate the valuable advice provided by Zhonggui He and Jin Sun.
