Introduction RB is the most common malignant intraocular tumor in children, accounting for about 8000 new cases diagnosed globally each year. Prior research has demonstrated notable variations in the prevalence of RB according to factors such as gender, ethnicity, and infections brought on by inadequate sanitation [ 1 2 1 2 Figure 1 3 4 2. Types of Retinoblastoma 2.1. Hereditary Retinoblastoma The normal RB1 helps regulate uncontrolled cell growth, but genetic mutations can prevent it from functioning properly. Depending on the timing and location of RB1 allele alterations, RB can manifest in two different forms [ 5 6 Figure 2 7 2.2. Non-Heritable Retinoblastoma Non-heritable retinoblastoma, which accounts for about 60% of cases, arises when both RB1 mutations occur somatically in a single retinal progenitor cell, typically resulting in unifocal, unilateral disease ( Figure 2 8 8 9 3. Global Burden of Retinoblastoma The cancer of the retina has become an extremely widespread pediatric ocular malignancy and it is frequently treatable if detected early and treated according to routine protocols. Currently, high-income countries are investing economic resources that are increasing life expectancy and quality of life in patients with RB. However, such results do not apply to healthcare institutions across nations with moderate to low incomes [ 10 11 12 13 12 14 4. Epidemiology of Retinoblastoma RB represents three percent of all tumors. The incidence of cancer of the retina occurs in approximately 1 in 14,000 to 1 in 20,000 live births. In the USA, 300 new instances are reported per year. RB affects both genders equally. Approximately 90% of instances occur before the age of three years. The disease’s incidence varies by geographical area. According to research, the incidence of RB is six cases per million people in Mexico, compared with four cases per million in the USA. The highest incidences are observed in African countries and India [ 15 16 17 18 18 5. Intraocular to Extraocular Metastasis: A Major Clinical Challenge in Retinoblastoma Management Metastatic illness occurs in approximately 10–15% of individuals with retinoblastoma and is usually associated with particular ophthalmic pathologic characteristics including profound choroidal or scleral encroachment and the invasion of the ciliary system and retinal nerve outside the cribrosa layer. In the future, biological markers detected in plasma will certainly be used to identify individuals at elevated risk of acquiring tiny metastases. One promising approach is the discovery of microRNAs as therapeutic targets [ 19 Figure 3 20 21 Individuals experiencing retinal cancer in nations with high incomes in North America or Europe face only a three to five percent probability of metastasis-related death, compared to about forty percent in other nations [ 17 22 Pathways/Routes of Metastatic Spread Figure 3 23 Direct Distribution Orbit Tissue Adjacent tissues: 24 Homogenous Distribution Lymphatic Distribution Common sites of Metastases Liver (pulmonary metastatic lesions): symptoms include hepatomegaly (expanded hepatic), yellowing of the skin, and stomach discomfort. Central nervous system (skull and spinal cord): acute elongation through the nerve that supplies vision may result in cerebral dissemination. Consequences could involve migraines, convulsions, and disorders of the brain [ 25 6. Risk Factors of Retinoblastoma Currently, the sole known cause of RB is a genetic mutation or gene alteration. The hereditary variant of RB accounts for around 40% of occurrences and invariably affects extremely young children, usually one year old or less. When RB affects both eyes, it is almost always due to a heritable germline RB1 mutation. However, only 10–15% of children with RB have a family history of the condition, since many germline mutations arise de novo. Although less common, heritable RB can sometimes present in only one eye. Importantly, both heritable and non-heritable forms of RB are caused by genetic mutations in the RB1 26 In some studies, the only characteristics consistently identified as high-risk factors for recurrence throughout cancer organizations were post-laminar retinal canal intrusion, involvement of retinal neuron layers, and extra-skeletal tumor progression [ 27 28 RB1 29 7. Genetics of Retinoblastoma RB1 stretches 180 kb and contains 27 exons. It is found on chromosome 13q14.2 [ 30 CM000675.2 31 32 33 34 RB1 35 8. Epigenetic Mechanisms of Retinoblastoma In addition to the non-coding RNAs mentioned previously, it has been discovered that RB etiology is also caused by other epigenetic processes. The global methylation patterns of RB cells have revealed new information on the need for epigenetic modifications to support the growth and progression of RB [ 36 37 RB1 38 39 40 41 9. Non-Heritable Causes of Retinoblastoma In approximately 60% of cases, RB arises from non-heritable, somatic mutations in the RB1 9 RB1 10. Symptoms and Diagnosis of Retinoblastoma A lumbar puncture with a spinal tap may be performed at the time of systemic staging, though many institutions do not include this exam in the workup of a newly diagnosed patient. If imaging exams are inclusive of disease outside the eye, additional tests may be performed to stage both the ocular and extraocular disease. This may include a bone marrow aspiration, bilateral bone marrow biopsy, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the human brain and orbits [ 42 In addition to clinical and imaging studies, molecular genetic testing of the RB1 gene plays an essential role in diagnosis and management. Genetic analysis identifies children with heritable RB who may transmit the mutation to their offspring, as well as unilateral patients at risk of bilateralization. It also allows the detection of non-carriers within families, sparing them from repeated surveillance and procedures requiring anesthesia. Thus, genetic testing complements ocular and systemic examinations, guiding both treatment planning and family counseling. Retinal cancer is the most common recurrent ocular neoplasm in children and is diagnosed by an ophthalmologist, preferably a pediatric ophthalmologist, after a complete examination of the retina with indirect ophthalmoscopy. Symptoms of RB, as shown in Figure 4 42 11. Multidisciplinary Treatment Strategies for RB Treatment for RB remains individualized and depends on multiple factors, including family psychosocial issues, cultural attitudes, germline mutation status, accessible institutional resources, and the staging as classified by the International Classification of Retinoblastoma (ICRB), as shown in Figure 5 43 11.1. Primary Diagnosis and Subsequent Assessment of RB It is important to ascertain the size of the tumor, both inside and outside the eye, before making treatment plans. This assessment helps to determine disease severity and whether the malignancy has spread beyond the globe. Each affected eye is then assigned a cancer stage [ 44 45 11.2. Intravenous Chemotherapy Systemic IVC became available in the first half of the 1990s and is now a vital therapy option for retinal cancer. IVC generally entails a monthly insertion of two, three, or four chemotherapeutic drugs utilizing a centralized and periphery catheterization for a total of six to nine cycles. The most commonly prescribed chemotherapy regimen consists of three medications: vincristine, etoposide, and carboplatin (VEC) [ 46 47 48 49 11.3. External Beam Radiotherapy Globe salvage therapy was performed with external beam radiation (EBRT) before IVC was introduced. Since an effective treatment for RB was introduced, EBRT has largely lost its historical significance in the majority of developed nations because of the numerous adverse effects it has and the improved results that followed. Nonetheless, EBRT continues to play a part in cases of orbital recurrence and extension of extraocular tumors, with positive optic nerve border after enucleation. It has been found that 71% of patients with orbital RB respond well to the mixture of EBRT plus IVC for tumor management [ 50 51 11.4. Plaque Radiotherapy Plaque radiation, also known as brachytherapy, was first introduced in 1929 and was a means of salvage management for recurring tumors after EBRT. Nowadays, when chemo-resistant small-to-medium tumors (≤16 mm in greatest receptive size or >3 to <9 mm in width) relapse after IVC and IAC, brachytherapy is usually employed as a subsequent treatment [ 52 53 11.5. Enucleation Despite significant advances in globe-salvaging techniques, eye-globe enucleation remains a crucial treatment for advanced RB. In most group D and particularly group E cases (grouping based on IIRC classification), where the disease is life threatening, enucleation is often necessary to save the patient’s life. It is especially indicated for tumors with extraocular extension, optic nerve or choroidal invasion, or when the disease has proven resistant to conservative therapies [ 54 53 11.6. Genetic Counseling Chromosomal analysis and molecular genetic testing can help determine whether an individual carries a germline RB1 mutation. This allows for the accurate identification of first-degree relatives who are mutation carriers, who have approximately a 90% likelihood of developing RB, distinguishing them from non-carriers who are not at increased risk. Genetic testing therefore provides a more precise estimate of risk than family history alone. In addition, patients with heritable RB have an increased lifetime risk of developing subsequent primary non-ocular malignancies, making genetic counseling essential for long-term management and family planning. Screening for RB1 mutations is clinically important for distinguishing heritable cases from non-heritable cases. Tumor analysis, in combination with blood testing, can establish whether the mutation is present in the germline (heritable) or restricted to tumor tissue alone (non-heritable). This information is critical for guiding clinical management, family counseling, and avoiding unnecessary procedures in non-carriers, while also contributing to research on the long-term impact of RB1 alterations. Candidates for genetic counseling include individuals with a track record of bilateral RB, as well as those with unilateral disease and the relatives of affected individuals. Genetic counseling is also essential for planning surveillance and management strategies in RB-prone families. In addition, unilateral RB survivors should undergo long-term ophthalmic monitoring, including visual function assessment, since they are at risk of developing hereditary RB in the other eye. 11.7. Long-Term Follow-Up and Monitoring The life expectancy of survivors of RB has generally improved over time, as contemporary therapies confer fewer treatment-related sequelae. Given the value of patient medical data, the demographic details and future vision results of survivors are important. Some contemporary medical facilities have reported on their survivors and their outcomes, characterizing the different disease manifestations in children and adults with hereditary RB. However, the comparatively rare prevalence of hereditary RB means that very few RB specialists have patients solidly into their adulthood or even older adults/survivors; there have, until now, been international attempts to analyze this unique cohort’s visual function and overall health. Significant unmet needs exist for advancing methodologies in both occupational and global quality-of-life assessments conducted on a population-based sample of chronic RB victims. Before completing treatment, all patients need to undergo the following evaluations: a vision assessment; examination under anesthetic (or examination of an under-anesthetic depending on whether the patient will have further examinations); examination by a member of the multidisciplinary treatment team; radiation retinopathy and RB recurrence through serial imaging; the timing of specialist follow-up; and long-term oncology/general practitioner follow-up. Expectation management as to visual outcomes post-treatment and post-remission is important, as are short discussions of current long-term radiation retinopathy and second primary malignancy data. Survivors of hereditary RB are a relatively unique cohort in terms of their ongoing cancer risks and require consistent coordinated follow-up from dedicated RB specialists. Many quality-of-life studies show vision is associated with daily functioning and mental health, and visual problems have been associated with neuro-psychological, economic, educational, and social sequelae. The visual development of children with hereditary RB may not necessitate a significant discrepancy with either their healthy peers or their parents with hereditary RB. Through premature apoptosis of susceptible developing retinal cells and peri-ocular adnexa, other difficulties are theoretically superior in sporadic RB, but further specific hereditary group comparisons are needed. 12. Clinical Trials Investigating Novel Therapeutic Approaches T-cell immunotherapy has demonstrated remarkable anticancer results in severe B-cell malignancies and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. This treatment involves isolating the patient’s T cells and modifying them to express CD19-specific receptors for chimeric antigens (CARs) [ 55 56 57 56 57 Oncolytic virotherapy involves genetically modified or attenuated viruses, such as VCN-01, which selectively infects tumor cells, replicates within them, and induces systemic immune reactions [ 57 58 13. Nanoparticle-Based Therapy for Retinoblastoma Nanoparticles have been widely studied in relation to the detection and management of eye disorders. Their micro dimensions, form, and exterior characteristics allow them to penetrate visual organs, eliminating visual obstacles and increasing accessibility or effectiveness in therapy. They provide the benefits of regulated, enduring, and localized medication administration while limiting adverse reactions [ 59 60 13.1. Bioactive Nanoparticles Natural bioactive nanoparticles are molecules of organic materials formed by non-covalent interactions between molecules, making them extremely adaptable and supplying an avenue for expulsion through the body’s tissues, as depicted in Figure 6 61 13.2. Inorganic Nanoparticles Inorganic nanoparticles, which are made up of non-carbon-based particles, have drawn an enormous amount of study in the optical administration of drugs due to their ability to change their dimensions, shape, and crystallization, as well as their substantial surface area, elevated probability of exterior drug bonding, and ease of integration, as depicted in Figure 6 2 3 62 13.3. Transport of Lipid-Encapsulated Nanostructures NLCs are the subsequent version of SLNs with fluid lipids displacing the partial lipid solid elements found in SLNs, resulting in a larger pharmaceutical storage region. NLCs outperform standard transporters for the visual administration of medications in several respects: notably, increased lubricity, the capacity to boost preservation equilibrium, greater absorption, flexibility, extended lifespan, minimal negative reactions, and dependence on tissue distribution [ 63 Distribution of medications within the retina is difficult due to safeguards in the ocular structures. Furthermore, the administration of drugs using different nanotechnologies works well sufficiently to overcome these constraints. The most widely utilized and beneficial multi-functionalized tiny particles for curing RB include multi-functionalized NPs, lipid-based NPs, and metal-based NP multi-functionalized nanomaterials for the ophthalmic administration of medications that can overcome optical hurdles and eliminate retinal cancer; however, generated NPs possess the ability to preserve the medicinal molecule and enhance persistence duration. Polymerized NPs are disposable and might be utilized for targeted or reliable intravitreal allocation in RB [ 64 13.4. Polymerized Nanoparticles Polymerized nanoparticles (PNPs) number among the most effective nanoparticles with multiple functions for the medical management of a retinal tumor. They have been extensively investigated and have received far greater scrutiny than other particles. As a result, PNPs may be more efficient at identifying and eliminating malignant cells. Polylactic acid nanoparticles containing rhodamine dye have been used in rat models to deliver agents to the retina. During a single intravitreal injection, these nanoparticles were able to diffuse through the layers of the retina and accumulate within the macular pigmented cells for up to four weeks. Fortunately, only minor irritation was observed in the lower vitreous humor and the ciliary body, which subsided within forty-eight hours [ 65 13.5. Lipid Encapsulated Nanoparticles Lipidic tiny particles contain molecules of lipids as a molecular framework. Lipid-based tiny carriers are establishing themselves as attractive options for administering medicines for the treatment of specific cells inside the cornea. Due to their biological compatibility and delivery through eye flexibility, small particles of lipids (LNPs) are widely utilized as nucleic acid delivery systems for the treatment of disorders of the eyes because they can cross the optical membrane and effectively transfect DNA throughout different tissues of the eyeball. The dimension of phospholipid tiny carriers influences their capillary digestion, dispersion, and biological distribution, resulting in an appealing substrate and enabling the precise administration of drugs. Membrane-based tiny particles encompass many transportation systems [ 66 14. Treatment Modalities of Retinoblastoma: Unilateral vs. Bilateral The main goals in treating retinoblastoma are to save the patient’s life, preserve the eye, and maintain vision, and these objectives influence the choice of treatment strategy. This method was customized for each patient, considering elements such as the tumor affecting one eye or both eyes, the tumor’s position and stage, the possibility of vision loss, and family wishes [ 67 68 69 15. Discussion Retinal tumors, a type of cancerous eye malignancy commonly found in children, have long been linked to the RB1 variant. Recent studies, however, have expanded our understanding by highlighting the significant roles of additional genetic and environmental factors in the progression of retinal tumors. Beyond the RB1 mutation, other gene abnormalities, such as MYCN amplification, have been identified, indicating a more complex genetic basis for the disease. These discoveries open the door to new treatment strategies. Moreover, the field of cancer ecology is gaining attention, with the interactions between retinal tumor cells and their environments, especially immune system cells, being increasingly acknowledged as critical for tumor growth and treatment outcomes. This has led to a reevaluation of chemotherapy’s potential as a therapeutic option. Innovations in scanning and detection are transforming the treatment of retinal tumors. Advanced imaging technologies facilitate easier and more accurate identification, thereby improving prognosis. Additionally, liquid biopsy techniques, which detect tumor DNA in bodily fluids, offer a non-invasive method for detection and monitoring. Personalized healthcare is becoming increasingly prevalent, incorporating treatment strategies tailored to the genetic or genomic attributes of individual tumors. This approach aims to optimize therapeutic benefits while minimizing adverse effects, signifying a marked shift towards customized and effective retinal cancer treatment. These distinctive perspectives highlight the complex characteristics of retinal tumors and advocate for the development of innovative testing and treatment methods, aiming primarily to improve the prognosis for pediatric patients. 16. Conclusions The WHO has designated RB as a priority malignancy in its Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer. Even though it is quite treatable in its early stages, if treatment is not received, it can be lethal. Because of significant advancements in eye-globe salvage techniques over the past few decades, intraocular RB is now the most treatable juvenile malignancy in high-income nations. An unparalleled rate of eye globe and vision preservation has been achieved with the invention of local drug delivery techniques, including OAC and a safety-enhanced IVi injection technique, which optimize chemotherapy exposure in the retinal, subretinal, and vitreous areas. Children with disseminated RB have minimal treatment options, typically restricted to high-dose chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, and local radiation, in contrast to this remarkable improvement in treatment results. Patients with CNS metastases have a considerably worse prognosis since, despite rigorous treatments, they rarely survive. Therefore, results may be enhanced by more recent therapies and better ways of targeting medication delivery to the central nervous system. The lack of an appropriate molecular targeted therapy for RB, even though it is one of the oldest malignancies to be found, suggests that there are numerous unidentified secondary mutations that contribute to the disease and have yet to be identified. New, more effective treatments with a lower risk of toxicity are required for all cases of intraocular and extraocular illness. Developing new approaches with reduced toxicity is a priority, including immunotherapy, oncolytic virotherapy, and targeted drug delivery systems. Nanotechnology-based platforms may further enhance the precision and safety of these treatments. However, in order to ensure that RB is a pediatric cancer that may be cured, we must advance our knowledge of a number of topics pertaining to tumor biology and efficient treatments.

The illustration depicts a cross-sectional view of the human eye highlighting the presence of cancerous cells within the retina, indicative of retinoblastoma. The tumor cells originate in the retinal layer and are shown spreading toward the inner layers of the eye. The inset image displays a clinical manifestation of retinoblastoma, often seen as a white reflex (leukocoria) in the pupil. The figure was created in Biorender by V.Y. (2025) https://app.biorender.com/illustrations/6893d3bab24c555bb9767535 Figure 2 Distribution of sporadic and hereditary forms of retinoblastoma. The left pie chart illustrates that approximately 60% of RB cases are non-heritable, while 40% are heritable. The right pie chart provides a subdivision of the heritable cases, showing that approximately 80% present as bilateral disease and approximately 15–20% as unilateral disease. Among all heritable cases, positive familial history ranges from approximately 5–15%, with the remainder occurring sporadically due to de novo germline mutations.
