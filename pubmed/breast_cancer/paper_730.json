Previous studies have primarily explored the binary relationship between perpetrators and victims, with limited research examining the emotional exhaustion of bullying roles from the perspectives of victims and bystanders. Therefore, this study recruited 597 participants and conducted a scenario-based experiment to investigate whether generative AI can alleviate the poor work states of bullying roles in the medical workplace, thereby demonstrating the interaction between generative AI’s information delivery methods and bullying roles in relation to emotional exhaustion. The results showed that bullying roles in the medical workplace significantly influence emotional exhaustion, with victims experiencing significantly higher levels than bystanders. Moreover, generative AI’s information delivery methods can effectively moderate the work states of victims. Thus, this study advances the field of human-computer interaction by shifting its focus from functional adaptation to emotional ecology. It also provides empirical evidence from medical scenarios for the uncanny valley theory. Furthermore, this research lays a theoretical foundation for the design of emotional interaction functions in medical AI systems. generative AI information delivery methods workplace bullying bullying roles emotional exhaustion bystander victim The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Whereas the Job Demands–Resources Model explains exhaustion as a function of chronic job demands and resources ( 58 Second, The Emotion Event Theory uniquely elucidates how external interventions (e.g., AI-generated information) reshape event appraisals. For victims, emotional AI inputs may mitigate threat appraisals by fostering affective coping ( 69 Based on the above analysis, this study proposes the following hypotheses: H1: H2: H2a: H2b: 2 Methods 2.1 Participants To test the four hypotheses, we designed a 2 (medical workplace bullying role: victim vs. bystander) × 2 (generative AI information delivery: professional information vs. emotional information) between-subjects experiment. We converted the paper questionnaires into electronic questionnaires and uploaded them to a professional data collection platform Credamo. 1 The inclusion criteria for this study were: (1) being a medical staff member; (2) working in a tertiary hospital; (3) having normal language communication skills and no obvious cognitive impairment; (4) not having participated in a similar study in the past month; (5) having used generative AI to query information and chat in the past month; and (6) completing the questionnaire within 10 min. The inclusion criterion (6) is due to the fact that our study uses the form of video and pictures for manipulation, where video and picture materials contain a lot of information and require a certain amount of time to understand and analyze. Therefore, in the process of questionnaire design, we set the playing time and presentation time of video and picture materials (2 min for picture materials and 2 min for video materials) to ensure that participants could effectively read and understand the responding materials. Regarding participants longer than 10 min, this is often seen with pausing and forgetting of patient questionnaires, which tends to reduce the accuracy of the data and should be eliminated. The data collection period was from April to May 2025, and a total of 648 participants were recruited. After excluding 51 participants who did not meet the inclusion criteria (8 non-medical staff, 29 non-tertiary hospital staff, 12 participants took less than 5 min to respond, and 2 participants who had not used generative AI in the past month) ( 72 In terms of demographic characteristics, there were 269 male participants and 328 female participants. The age distribution was: 18–25 years (12.9%), 26–40 years (52.1%), 41–60 years (29.6%), and 61 years and above (5.4%). The education level of the participants was: 82 (13.8%) with a junior college degree, 271 (45.4%) with a bachelor’s degree, 135 (22.6%) with a master’s degree, and 109 (18.3%) with a doctoral degree. Notably, the number of participating doctors was significantly lower than that of nurses, which may be due to the 1:2 doctor-to-nurse ratio in Chinese clinical hospitals, with a 1:4 ratio in key departments. 2.2 Experimental procedure We randomly assigned all participants to either the victim or observer group. We asked all participants to imagine themselves in a medical workplace bullying scenario. We showed the victim group a video of workplace bullying in a medical setting, featuring only the bully and the victim. Meanwhile, we showed the observer group a video of workplace bullying from the observer’s perspective. We then asked both groups: “After watching the video, do you agree that you have had similar workplace experiences?” (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) ( 73 Supplementary material In the victim group: The video shows a total of 2 participants, a man, the attending physician, and a woman, the nurse, in the operating room after the surgery. However, due to the work errors of the nurses, the operation time was prolonged, which increased the workload of the attending physicians. Consequently, the attending physician grabbed the nurse by the back of the head and verbally abused the nurse. In the observer group: The video shows a total of 3 protagonists in the hospital corridor. The man in blue was the attending physician, and the two thin women were the nurses. Among them, a nurse’s work error caused an increase in the workload of the attending physician, which made the attending physician very angry. The attending physician beat and verbally scolded one of the nurses, while the other nurse witnessed the proceedings. We then limited the generative AI’s response mode to either professional information or emotional information and asked the same question to the AI, obtaining different answers as the experimental stimulus materials. We guided both groups to use the generative AI and randomly assigned them to either the professional information or emotional information group. We showed the victim group’s two subgroups the professional information and emotional information stimulus materials, respectively. We asked the participants: “After reading the generative AI’s response, do you agree that your emotions have been comforted?” (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree) ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Stimulus map of the way information is transferred in generative AI.

Each panel describes different scenarios: emotional information with bystander and victim roles, and professional information with bystander and victim roles. Each text revolves around witnessing bullying or feeling isolated as a newcomer in a medical setting, and AI provides supportive analysis and advice. Panels are labeled A, B, C, and D. Finally, participants completed the measurement questionnaires for work emotional exhaustion, adapted from Maslach and Jackson ( 74 75 3 Results Manipulation Check.

Based on Schadenhofer et al. ( 77 F p In view of the research findings of Fan et al. ( 78 Vs F p 4 Discussion 4.1 Theoretical implications This study explores the interaction between generative AI’s information delivery methods and the emotional exhaustion of bullying roles in the medical workplace, making significant theoretical contributions to organizational psychology and the application of artificial intelligence in workplace interventions. First, the findings expand the theoretical framework of workplace bullying by revealing the differential effects of various bullying roles on emotional exhaustion. While traditional research has primarily focused on the negative psychological consequences for victims ( 79 80 81 82 The study finds significant interactions between the information delivery methods of AI and bullying roles, suggesting that the effectiveness of AI interventions is not universal but highly dependent on the psychological state and role identity of the recipients. This aligns with the media synchronicity theory, which states that the effectiveness of information delivery depends on how well it matches the needs of the audience. Specifically, the alleviating effect of emotional information on victims may stem from its emotional support function, consistent with the core hypothesis of social support theory, which argues that emotional support reduces stress ( 83 84 Emotional exhaustion, as a core dimension of job burnout, has traditionally been studied through the lens of the job demands-resources model ( 85 86 87 4.2 Practical implications The medical workplace is a high-pressure, high-intensity environment where healthcare professionals face demanding tasks and complex interpersonal relationships. This study demonstrates that workplace bullying in the medical field significantly impacts employees’ mental health, particularly in terms of victims’ emotional exhaustion. Therefore, hospitals should establish and improve anti-bullying policies by conducting regular training, anonymous surveys, and psychological counseling to enhance employees’ awareness of workplace bullying and reduce its occurrence. Additionally, hospitals should prioritize the integration of generative AI technologies, particularly AI systems with emotional support capabilities, to provide employees with psychological support and emotional relief resources. In terms of professional information delivery, AI systems can help employees complete tasks more efficiently, thereby reducing workload pressure. In terms of emotional support, AI systems can offer victims timely psychological comfort and resource guidance. Hospital management should also foster an open and inclusive organizational culture by encouraging supportive communication among employees, reducing feelings of isolation and helplessness, and thereby lowering the risk of emotional exhaustion. As an emerging technology, the application of generative AI in the medical workplace requires a balance between emotional support and professional information delivery. This study finds significant differences in how AI’s information delivery methods alleviate emotional exhaustion among medical professionals. This suggests that AI designers should optimize its information delivery functions to flexibly adjust the nature of the information based on the needs of different roles. For instance, when interacting with victims, AI systems should provide more emotional support and psychological comfort. When engaging with bystanders, AI systems should offer professional support while avoiding purely factual information transmission to prevent worsening emotional burdens. Furthermore, generative AI should possess interaction capabilities to sense users’ emotional states and automatically adjust its information delivery methods to better meet diverse user needs. This study shows that victims of workplace bullying in the medical field experience significantly higher levels of emotional exhaustion than bystanders. Victims often need to take active measures to address bullying behaviors and alleviate emotional exhaustion. Victims can proactively utilize generative AI technology to obtain psychological comfort and resource suggestions through its emotional support functions. For example, AI systems can provide victims with access to psychological counseling resources, legal support channels, and assistance pathways within and outside their organizations. Additionally, victims should learn to actively seek support rather than endure the situation in silence. Support systems within hospitals and positive interactions among colleagues are crucial pathways to alleviating emotional exhaustion. Bystanders play a critical role in workplace bullying in the medical field, but this study finds that the professional information delivery methods of generative AI may exacerbate bystanders’ emotional exhaustion. Therefore, bystanders should actively learn to become positive influencers by offering support and resources to victims, thereby reducing their own emotional burdens. Based on the study’s findings, bystanders can utilize the emotional support features of generative AI to alleviate the emotional distress caused by witnessing bullying behaviors. At the same time, bystanders need to learn to regulate their emotional responses rationally, avoiding feelings of helplessness that may arise from purely factual information transmission. 4.3 Limitations and future research directions Despite the aforementioned findings, this study has several limitations. First, this study acknowledges critical limitations in geographical and cultural generalizability. Our sample was exclusively drawn from hospitals in Nanchang and Nanchong, which represent urban centers in Central and Western China. While these regions exhibit typical characteristics of China’s high-pressure medical systems, the findings may not fully generalize to: (1) Rural healthcare settings with distinct resource limitations; (2) Hospitals in Eastern Chinese megacities where organizational cultures may differ; (3) Non-Chinese contexts where cultural norms modulate bullying dynamics and help-seeking behaviors. For instance, Confucian values prevalent in China may amplify bystanders’ moral conflict when witnessing authority figures engage in bullying, potentially intensifying the negative effect of professional AI information observed in our study. Conversely, cultures with lower power distance might show attenuated effects. Future research should prioritize multi-regional sampling within China and comparative designs across cultures to disentangle cultural from systemic factors. Second, this study primarily discusses the transmission of professional and emotional information but does not delve into the issue of individualized adaptation of generative AI across different workplace roles. For example, can the emotional support functions of generative AI dynamically adjust based on individual differences? Future research can further optimize generative AI algorithms to enable more personalized information delivery based on users’ actual needs and emotional states, thereby more effectively alleviating emotional exhaustion. Additionally, whether generative AI’s information delivery may influence other roles in the medical workplace is another direction worth exploring. Third, this study employs a cross-sectional research design, which only captures the static relationship between variables at a single time point and cannot reveal the long-term dynamic mechanisms by which generative AI’s information delivery methods interact with medical workplace bullying roles. For example, can the emotional support functions of generative AI sustainably alleviate victims’ emotional exhaustion over long-term use? Can the professional information transmission of generative AI produce cumulative effects on bystanders’ emotional states? To address these questions, future research can adopt a longitudinal design to examine the long-term impact of different information delivery methods of generative AI on emotional exhaustion among medical professionals. Additionally, this study measures emotional exhaustion using self-report questionnaires, which may introduce subjective biases. Future research could incorporate physiological indicators (e.g., skin conductance, heart rate variability) or objective behavioral data (e.g., work efficiency, error rates) to validate changes in emotional exhaustion. Fourth, while our scenario-based experiment effectively captured immediate emotional responses to AI interventions, the cross-sectional design inherently limits insights into long-term effects. According to the Conservation of Resources Theory ( 88 Fifth, our measurement of emotional exhaustion relied on self-reported data collected immediately after participants viewed emotionally charged bullying videos. While this design aligns with Emotion Event Theory’s focus on immediate cognitive-emotional sequencing ( 64 Finally, while this study reveals the potential role of generative AI in mitigating emotional exhaustion caused by workplace bullying in the medical field, its practical application still faces challenges. For instance, could generative AI’s information delivery raise concerns about privacy and data security among employees? Can the emotional support functions of generative AI gain acceptance and trust from employees? Future research can conduct field-based empirical studies to examine the practical effects of generative AI in real-world medical workplaces and explore its applicability across different cultures and organizational environments. Furthermore, this study did not examine other potential influencing factors in the medical workplace, such as organizational culture, leadership styles, and team collaboration. Future research can incorporate these variables into the model to develop a more comprehensive theoretical framework. 5 Conclusion This study conducted a scenario-based experiment with 597 participants to verify the impact of generative AI’s information delivery methods and their interaction with medical workplace bullying roles on emotional exhaustion. Specifically, the findings show that under the influence of professional information delivery by generative AI, bystanders experience increased emotional exhaustion. Conversely, under emotional information delivery by generative AI, victims’ emotional exhaustion is alleviated. This research not only expands the application of emotion event theory but also advances the progress of anti-bullying initiatives in organizations, providing specific suggestions and practical references.  1 https://www.credamo.com/ Data availability statement The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ Supplementary material Ethics statement The studies involving humans were approved by Academic Ethics Committee of Jiangxi Normal University (Approval No.: IRB-JXNU-PEC-20240508).
