The development and differentiation of germ cells (Gcs) are supported by Sertoli cells (Scs). Differentiated Scs support the development of Gcs into sperm, and hence, male fertility. We previously reported on a developmental switch in Scs around 12 days of age onwards in rats. During the process of the differentiation of Scs, the differential expression of mitophagy-related genes and its role in male fertility are poorly understood.

Introduction The increase in cases of male infertility worldwide has become a global concern [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 The development and function of Scs are important for the process of spermatogenesis, which regulates the division, differentiation, and survival of male Gcs, which develop into sperm [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 One such pathway involves mitochondrial homeostasis and its dysfunction, which contribute significantly to the rising number of cases of male infertility [ 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Mfn1 Mfn2 Opa1 Mfn1 Mfn2 Opa1 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 Indeed, in many infertile male patients, various mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been reported [ 43 44 45 46 47 45 48 49 50 Similarly, the inhibition of mitochondrial fusion by the deletion of Mfn1 Mfn2 51 Mff 52 53 54 Atg7 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 Our previous work provides the foundation for this study. We reported that Scs remain in an immature, proliferative state in 5-day-old rats [ 61 GSE48795 62 GSE48795 Bcl2 Fos Nor1 NR4A3 , Bcl2 Fos, Nor1 Nor1 63 Nor1 64 Nor1 Pgc1α Tfam Mfn2 Nor1 65 Nor1 66 Nor1 67 Nor1 Smad3 68 Nor1 Nor1 2. Results 2.1. Identification of Mitophagy-Related Genes (MRGs) During the Development of Scs To investigate the role of MRGs in Sc development, we analyzed microarray data from the GSE48795 Figure 1 We used an adjusted p 2 69 70 71 Figure 2 Supplementary File S1 Thus, there were a total of 488 mitophagy-related genes in Sc development (MRGSCD) considering both the phases. A total of 66 MRGSCDs were identified to be common between the two experimental conditions, i.e., 5d vs. 12d and 5d vs. 60d ( Figure 2 Figure 3 Supplementary Figure S1 The reconstruction of a protein interaction network for 66 common MRGSCDs would unravel the vital signaling cascade of mitophagy-related genes in Sc development common to both stages. So next, with these 66 MRDEGs, we reconstructed a protein–protein interaction network (PPIN) using STRING v12 (with a confidence score > 0.4) ( Figure 4 This PPIN consists of 33 nodes and 76 edges. In a PPIN, hub genes are the nodes with the greatest number of edges or the most connections. Subsequently, using a network analyzer in Cytoscape 3.10.3., we identified 12 hub genes in the PPIN, viz. epidermal growth factor receptor ( Egfr Bcl2 Ccl2 Mmp2 Apoe Fos Cxcl12 Ocln Dcn Snca Figure 4 Nor1 Figure 2 Supplementary File S1 Nor1 Bcl2 Fos Nor1 2.2.

Attenuation of Spermatogenesis in Testes of Sc-Specific Nor1 Knockdown Tg Rats The Tg rat line could not propagate beyond the F1 generation as the positive male pups born from the mating of F1-generation siblings were infertile ( Figure 6 The F1-generation male rats from the Tg rats and the LacZ control male rats were analyzed for defects in reproductive functions. The testis weight of the Tg rats (0.79 ± 0.11 g) decreased significantly ( p Figure 6 p 6 6 Figure 6 Qualitative histopathological evaluations of the testes of the Tg rats (2 months old and 10 months old) and LacZ control rat (10 months old) were performed to determine the effect of NOR1 knockdown. We observed that that of the LacZ control rat showed a normal tubular structure, whereas those of the Tg rats showed the sloughing of spermatogenic cells in the majority of the tubules ( Figure 6 Nor1 3.

Further studies will be needed to determine the effect of Nor1 In conclusion, our integrative genomic and functional analyses identified 12 key hub genes related to mitophagy that are differentially expressed during the development of Scs.
