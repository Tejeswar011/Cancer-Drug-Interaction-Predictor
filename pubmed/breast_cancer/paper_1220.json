This review explains how this metabolic problem is a significant risk factor for several major cancers, including those of the breast, liver, and endometrium. The high levels of insulin, chronic inflammation, and altered cellular energy usage associated with insulin resistance create an environment that can fuel the growth and spread of tumors. Since insulin resistance is a modifiable condition, understanding this link opens up new strategies for cancer prevention and treatment, emphasizing the importance of lifestyle interventions and metabolic health. Abstract Insulin resistance (IR) is a prevalent metabolic condition characterized by reduced cellular responsiveness to insulin and consequent hyperinsulinemia, and it is a key component of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. A growing body of evidence suggests IR is a critical accomplice in the pathogenesis of various cancers. This review synthesizes evidence on underlying molecular mechanisms, including the integrated roles of the insulin/IGF system, chronic inflammation, metabolic reprogramming, and mitochondrial dysfunction. This review proposes that metabolic dysregulation should be viewed as a modifiable oncogenic force. This perspective illuminates new pathways for understanding cancer development and offers promising avenues for prevention and therapeutic intervention. insulin resistance obesity breast cancer colorectal cancer endometrial cancer liver cancer pancreatic cancer This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Insulin resistance (IR) is a pathological condition in which the body’s cells become less responsive to the action of insulin, leading to elevated blood insulin levels. Traditionally associated with type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance has gained significant attention for its potential role in cancer development and progression. Insulin, along with insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), is involved in regulating cell growth, metabolism, and survival. Given that cancer is fundamentally a disease of dysregulated cell growth, the potential connection between insulin resistance and cancer has become a focal point of research. This review will examine the evidence supporting the link between insulin resistance and cancer, explore the underlying pathophysiology, and discuss the clinical implications for cancer prevention and treatment. The relationship between metabolic disorders and cancer has been known for over 100 years and represents a significant public health challenge [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2. Search Strategy This narrative review is based on a literature search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases for articles published up to July 2025. The search terms included “insulin resistance and cancer,” “hyperinsulinemia,” “IGF system,” “diabetes and cancer,” “obesity and cancer,” “inflammation,” “metformin,” “mitochondrial dysfunction,” and “Warburg effect,” in combination with specific cancer types such as “breast,” “colorectal,” “pancreatic,” “liver,” and “endometrial.” Foundational experimental studies, large epidemiological cohorts, meta-analyses, and clinical trials were prioritized for inclusion to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic. 3. Core Molecular Mechanisms Linking Insulin Resistance and Cancer The link between IR and cancer is underpinned by several interconnected biological mechanisms that create a systemic environment rich in growth-promoting signals, inflammatory mediators, and metabolic substrates that can initiate and fuel tumor growth. These mechanisms do not operate in isolation but form a vicious cycle where metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, and oncogenic signaling reinforce one another. 3.1. The Insulin/IGF System: An Integrated Signaling Axis The etiology of insulin resistance reflects a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors, including a sedentary lifestyle and obesogenic diets [ 10 11 12 13 This system’s key components include the insulin receptor (IR) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R). The IR exists in two isoforms: IR-A and IR-B. While IR-B is the primary metabolic isoform in adult tissues, IR-A is the predominant isoform in fetal tissues and is frequently overexpressed in cancer cells [ 14 15 15 16 17 In the state of IR-driven hyperinsulinemia, Direct Mitogenic Signaling: Sustained hyperinsulinemia can directly activate the IR and, at high concentrations, the IGF-1R. Upon binding, these receptors activate two major signaling cascades: ○ The Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt Pathway: This pathway is pivotal, promoting glucose uptake, protein synthesis, and cell growth while strongly inhibiting apoptosis (programmed cell death) [ 18 19 ○ The Ras/Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) Pathway: This pathway primarily drives cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation, contributing to tumor expansion and metastasis [ 18 Altered IGF-Axis Signaling: Hyperinsulinemia suppresses the hepatic production of IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2), which may increase the bioavailability of IGF-1 [ 20 21 22 23 24 3.2. Chronic Inflammation and Dysregulated Adipokines Chronic low-grade inflammation, driven largely by obesity, is a hallmark of insulin resistance and plays a pivotal role in cancer development [ 24 25 26 27 25 Generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause DNA damage and genetic instability [ 28 29 Promoting angiogenesis through factors like VEGF [ 30 Suppressing anti-tumor immune surveillance [ 31 This process is further mediated by adipokines, bioactive molecules secreted from adipose tissue. In obesity, there is a dysregulated secretion of these molecules, characterized by Elevated Leptin: This pro-inflammatory adipokine promotes cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis, partly by activating the PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways [ 32 33 Reduced Adiponectin: This anti-inflammatory adipokine normally exerts anti-tumorigenic effects by activating AMPK, which inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. Its reduction in obesity removes this protective mechanism [ 34 35 The imbalance between high leptin and low adiponectin, coupled with the systemic inflammation from IR, creates a pro-tumorigenic environment that is highly conducive to cancer initiation and progression [ 36 3.3. Metabolic Reprogramming, Hypoxia, and Plasticity Insulin resistance profoundly alters cellular metabolism, creating conditions that support tumorigenesis. Cancer cells exhibit metabolic reprogramming, most famously the Warburg effect, where they preferentially metabolize glucose through aerobic glycolysis rather than more efficient oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). This metabolic shift, while less efficient for ATP production, rapidly generates the biosynthetic precursors (nucleotides, lipids, and amino acids) needed for fast proliferation [ 18 19 This altered metabolism is intimately linked to hypoxia. The rapid, disorganized growth of tumors often outstrips their blood supply, leading to hypoxic (low-oxygen) regions. Hypoxia activates master regulatory proteins called hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), particularly HIF-1α. HIFs reinforce the Warburg effect by upregulating glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes, and they also promote angiogenesis and metastasis, contributing to a more aggressive cancer phenotype [ 19 37 A critical emerging concept is metabolic plasticity. To survive therapeutic stress or nutrient deprivation, cancer cells can adapt their metabolism by shifting to alternative fuel sources. In insulin-resistant states, where circulating free fatty acids are elevated, cancer cells can increase their reliance on fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, many cancers become dependent on glutamine metabolism to support biosynthesis and maintain redox balance [ 38 39 40 41 3.4. Mitochondrial Dysfunction Mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical mechanism linking insulin resistance and cancer, serving as both a consequence of IR and a driver of carcinogenesis [ 40 42 Increased Oxidative Stress: Dysfunctional mitochondria generate excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS). This chronic oxidative stress damages mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, contributing to the genomic instability that drives cancer initiation [ 43 44 45 Impaired Apoptosis: Mitochondria are central to programmed cell death (apoptosis). In cancer, this process is often dysregulated by the upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins like Bcl-2, which prevents the release of cytochrome c and blocks cell death. This not only promotes tumor survival but is also a key mechanism of resistance to many chemotherapies [ 46 47 48 49 Pro-inflammatory Signaling: Damaged mitochondria release signals that activate inflammatory pathways, such as the NLRP3 inflammasome, further contributing to the chronic inflammatory state that fuels both IR and cancer progression [ 50 51 4. Insulin Resistance and Specific Cancers Epidemiological studies consistently link IR with an increased risk of several cancers. A summary of the malignancies with the strongest association is provided in Table 1 Table 2 52 Endometrial Cancer: This cancer has one of the strongest associations with IR and obesity. Hyperinsulinemia directly promotes endometrial cell proliferation and indirectly increases risk by reducing sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which increases the bioavailability of estrogens [ 53 54 Liver and Pancreatic Cancers: IR is a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which can progress to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [ 55 56 57 58 Colorectal Cancer: High levels of insulin and IGF-1 are associated with an increased risk of colorectal adenomas and carcinomas by stimulating epithelial cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis [ 59 60 Breast Cancer: Particularly in postmenopausal women, IR is linked to increased risk. The key drivers are hyperinsulinemia and increased IGF-1 bioavailability, activating the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways, along with interactions with estrogen signaling [ 61 62 63 5. Therapeutic Strategies and Future Outlook The mounting evidence linking IR to cancer development has opened new avenues for prevention and treatment strategies. Understanding this relationship provides a clear rationale for targeting metabolic health. 5.1. Lifestyle Interventions Lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of managing insulin resistance and reducing cancer risk. Diet: Dietary patterns that are low in refined sugars and processed foods and high in fiber have been shown to significantly improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammatory markers [ 64 65 66 Physical Activity: Regular physical activity, including both aerobic and resistance training, improves insulin sensitivity, reduces visceral fat, and lowers systemic inflammation. A minimum of 150 min of moderate-intensity activity per week is associated with a reduced risk for multiple cancer types [ 67 68 69 Interventions that combine both dietary changes and physical activity have been shown to produce superior outcomes for metabolic health [ 70 5.2. Pharmacological Approaches Beyond lifestyle, several pharmacological agents that target insulin resistance are under investigation for their role in oncology. Metformin: This first-line drug for T2DM improves insulin sensitivity, primarily by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn inhibits the pro-growth mTOR pathway [ 71 72 73 Targeting the insulin/IGF system: Given its central role in driving cell proliferation and survival, the insulin/IGF system is an attractive therapeutic target. Strategies have included IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies (e.g., Cixitumumab) and dual IR/IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g., Linsitinib) [ 74 75 ▪ Metabolic Side Effects: Cross-reactivity with the insulin receptor’s metabolic functions can lead to hyperglycemia, complicating treatment. ▪ Resistance: Tumors often develop resistance by activating alternative growth factor pathways, limiting the long-term effectiveness of these inhibitors [ 76 5.3. Future Directions and Emerging Research To overcome these limitations, future research must focus on a more nuanced and personalized approach. Predictive Biomarkers: A key priority is the identification of biomarkers to predict which patients will respond to metabolically targeted therapies. This could include circulating markers of IR (e.g., C-peptide and HOMA-IR) or tumor-specific markers like the expression level of the IR-A isoform. Understanding how a patient’s metabolic state influences their response to immune checkpoint inhibitors is another critical area for future investigation. Metabolic Plasticity as a Resistance Mechanism: Cancer cells can evade therapy by adapting their metabolism, for instance by shifting their reliance from glucose to alternative fuel sources like fatty acids or glutamine [ 38 39 40 High-Risk Populations: The IR–cancer link has profound implications for specific high-risk groups that warrant further study. This includes investigating the long-term cancer predisposition of newborns of mothers with gestational diabetes, who are exposed to hyperinsulinemia in utero. Similarly, rare tumors that ectopically secrete IGF-2, inducing severe hypoglycemia, represent a unique clinical model of IGF-driven malignancy and can provide valuable mechanistic insights. 6. Conclusions Insulin resistance is a significant and modifiable risk factor for the development and progression of several major cancers. Its oncogenic influence is exerted through a complex and integrated network involving the insulin/IGF system, chronic inflammation, and profound metabolic reprogramming. As the global prevalence of metabolic disease continues to rise, a deeper understanding of this connection is crucial for developing effective prevention and therapeutic strategies. While lifestyle interventions are fundamental, the future of pharmacological treatment lies in personalized medicine. Significant research gaps remain, and addressing them will require a focus on three key areas: robust biomarker discovery to guide patient selection, the development of intelligent combination therapies that can overcome metabolic plasticity, and a better understanding of cancer risk in metabolically vulnerable populations. Successfully navigating these challenges will be critical to reducing the global cancer burden in our increasingly insulin-resistant world.
