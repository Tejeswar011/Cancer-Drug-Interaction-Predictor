Introduction Brucellosis, a global zoonotic infection caused by the genus Brucella 1 2 3 Currently, various methods are employed to detect brucellosis, including bacterial isolation, pathogen identification, and serological testing. Several pathogen detection techniques have been developed and validated, such as conventional PCR, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), and recombinase-aided amplification (RAA) [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), a labeled immunoassay combining a chemiluminescent system with an immune reaction [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Listeria monocytogenes 2 7 18 Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a critical factor in Brucella 19 20 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Material Sources Bovine standard positive serum with a potency of 4000 IU/mL was obtained from the China Veterinary Drug Control Institute, while sheep standard positive serum with a potency of 400 IU/mL was provided by the China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center (CAHEC, Qingdao, China). A total of 33 sheep serum samples (13 brucellosis-positive and 20 brucellosis-negative) and 23 bovine serum samples (11 brucellosis-positive and 12 brucellosis-negative) were sourced from CAHEC (Qingdao, China). All brucellosis-positive sera were confirmed by RBPT and a commercial Brucella Brucella Escherichia coli Mycobacterium tuberculosis Vibrio cholerae Legionella Salmonella Foot and mouth disease virus types O and A Bovine viral diarrhea virus Sheep contagious pleuropneumonia Goat pox virus Peste des Petits Ruminants virus Streptococcal 2.2. LPS Extraction Brucella abortus 21 2.3. Conjugation of LPS to MPs LPS was coupled to magnetic particles (MPs) with slight modifications to a previously described method [ 22 2.4. Conjugation of AE to SPG The SPG antibody was labeled with acridinium ester (AE) according to the following procedure. Briefly, 0.1 mg of SPG was dissolved in AE labeling buffer 4. After ultrafiltration, 100 μL of SPG at 1 mg/mL was obtained. Then, 4 μL of AE solution was added, and the reaction was carried out at 25 °C in the dark for 30 min. The reaction was blocked with 4 μL of blocking reagent and incubated for an additional 30 min at 25 °C in the dark with gentle shaking. Finally, AE labeling buffer 5, glycerol, and AE labeling protectant were added to the reaction solution to achieve a final AE-SPG concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. 2.5. Optimization of the Reaction System To achieve the optimal conditions for Bru-CLIA, five critical parameters were optimized. Bovine standard positive serum was serially diluted with FBS, yielding concentrations of 500 IU/mL, 125 IU/mL, 31.25 IU/mL, 7.81 IU/mL, and 1.95 IU/mL. FBS was used as a negative control serum. The aforementioned six sera were used as a serum plate for the optimization of the reaction system. Other reaction conditions were tentatively set as follows: reaction diluent with 0.02 M PB, pH 7.4, magnetic bead concentration at 0.1 mg/mL (diluted with reaction diluent), acridinium ester concentration at 1:10,000 (diluted with reaction diluent), sample dilution at 5-fold (diluted with reaction diluent), and reaction procedure 1. The serum plate was subjected to triplicate testing, and the chemiluminescence values generated at each concentration point were recorded. The average values were calculated to determine the P/N ratio, and the group with the highest P/N ratio was selected as having the optimal reaction conditions. Dilutions of LPS-MPs LPS-MPs were diluted to concentrations of 0.2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL, and 0.05 mg/mL. The other conditions were set as described in paragraph 2.5, section one. The serum plates were subjected to three repeated trials following the procedure, and the average values were calculated to determine the P/N ratios. The group with the highest P/N ratio was selected as the optimal LPS-MPs concentration. 2. Dilutions of AE-SPG AE-SPG was diluted at ratios of 1:5000, 1:10,000, 1:15,000, and 1:20,000. Other conditions were kept as provisional, in line with the specifications detailed in paragraph 2.5, section one. Following the experimental protocol, the serum plates were tested three times with each dilution to establish reproducibility. The average values were then determined to calculate the P/N ratios. The group exhibiting the highest P/N ratio was identified as the optimal dilution factor for AE-SPG. 3. Dilutions of serum samples Serum plates that had been diluted with reaction diluent at factors of 5, 10, 20, and 40 times were prepared. Other preliminary conditions were set according to those described in paragraph 2.5, section one. The experimental procedure was followed, with the serum plates subjected to three repeated trials. The average values were calculated to determine the P/N ratios. Based on these ratios, the optimal sample dilution factor was determined as the one yielding the highest P/N value. 4. Sample dilution buffers Various types of reaction diluents were prepared, with their specific compositions as follows: buffer 1 (0.02 M PB, pH 7.4), buffer 2 (0.02 M Tris, pH 7.4), buffer 3 (0.02 M PB + 0.9% NaCl), buffer 4 (0.02 M Tris, pH 7.4 + 0.9% NaCl), buffer 5 (0.02 M PB, pH 7.4 + 0.9% NaCl + 0.1% Tween 20), buffer 6 (0.02 M PB, pH 7.4 + 0.9% NaCl + 0.2% Triton), and buffer 7 (1% casein sodium salt). Maintaining other conditions as provisionally described in paragraph 2.5, section one, three replicate experiments were conducted on the serum plates. The chemiluminescence values generated at each concentration point were recorded. Following the calculation of the average values, the P/N ratios were determined. The group with the highest P/N value was identified as the optimal reaction diluent. 5. Detection procedure Four assay procedures were optimized: Procedure 1 (two steps) involved adding 50 μL of LPS-MPs, 5 μL of diluted serum sample, and 50 μL of dilution buffer to a test tube, followed by a 10-min incubation at 37 °C. After washing with TBST, 50 μL of AE-SPG, 100 μL of pre-excitation solution, and 100 μL of excitation solution were added, with a further 10-min incubation at 37 °C, after which RLU was measured. Procedure 2 (two steps) used 100 μL of LPS-MPs, 5 μL of diluted serum sample, and 100 μL of dilution buffer, followed by the same incubation steps. Procedure 3 (one step) involved combining 50 μL of LPS-MPs, 5 μL of diluted serum sample, 50 μL of dilution buffer, 50 μL of AE-SPG, 100 μL of pre-excitation solution, and 100 μL of excitation solution, followed by incubation for 10 min and RLU measurement. Procedure 4 (one step) involved adding 100 μL of LPS-MPs, 5 μL of diluted serum sample, 100 μL of dilution buffer, 100 μL of AE-SPG, 100 μL of pre-excitation solution, and 100 μL of excitation solution, followed by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C and RLU measurement. 2.6. Qualitative Analysis To determine the cut-off value, diagnostic sensitivity, and specificity of Bru-CLIA, a total of 33 sheep serum samples and 23 bovine serum samples were tested. These parameters were calculated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis performed with GraphPad Prism version 10.0.0. 2.7. Analytical Sensitivity, Repeatability, and Cross-Reactivity Sensitivity The bovine standard positive serum was diluted to 500 IU/mL with FBS. Both the diluted bovine serum (500 IU/mL) and sheep standard positive serum (400 IU/mL) were serially diluted two-fold from 1:2 to 1:1024. The RLU values were simultaneously measured for each dilution in the Bru-CLIA. The highest dilution of serum that produced an RLU value exceeding the cut-off was considered the analytical sensitivity of the test. 2. Repeatability Repeatability was assessed by calculating the intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs). This was carried out using five sheep serum samples and five bovine serum samples with varying RLU values in three replicate experiments. The mean, standard deviation (SD), and percent coefficient of variation (CV) were computed. 3. Cross-reactivity Cross-reactivity was assessed by testing positive sera against various pathogens, including Escherichia coli O157:H7 Mycobacterium tuberculosis Vibrio cholerae Legionella Salmonella Foot and mouth disease virus types O and A Bovine viral diarrhea virus Sheep contagious pleuropneumonia Goat pox virus Peste des Petits Ruminants virus 2.8. Comparison of Coincidence Rates The concordance between Bru-CLIA and the ID-VET commercial ELISA kits was evaluated using 81 sheep serum samples and 96 bovine serum samples. 3. Results 3.1. Optimization of Working Condition This study applied the developed Bru-CLIA to detect Brucella Optimization of LPS-MPs and AE-SPG concentration The dilution ratios of LPS-MPs and AE-SPG were found to be critical factors influencing the sensitivity and specificity of the immunoassay. When LPS-MPs were diluted to 0.1 mg/mL, the P/N ratio reached its maximum value ( Figure 1 Figure 1 2. Optimization of serum sample dilutions For serum sample dilution, a ratio of 1:5 resulted in the highest P/N ratio ( Figure 1 3. Optimization of sample diluent buffer Seven sample dilution buffers were tested, including buffer 1 (0.02 M PB, pH 7.4), buffer 2 (0.02 M Tris, pH 7.4), buffer 3 (0.02 M PB + 0.9% NaCl), buffer 4 (0.02 M Tris, pH 7.4 + 0.9% NaCl), buffer 5 (0.02 M PB, pH 7.4 + 0.9% NaCl + 0.1% Tween 20), buffer 6 (0.02 M PB, pH 7.4 + 0.9% NaCl + 0.2% Triton), and buffer 7 (1% casein sodium salt). As shown in Figure 1 4. Optimization of detection procedure Regarding the detection procedure, both one-step and two-step assays were evaluated. Among the four procedures tested, two-step assay procedure 1 exhibited the highest P/N ratio ( Figure 1 3.2. Qualitative Analytical Performance For qualitative analysis, a total of 33 sheep sera and 23 bovine sera were tested. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 10.0.0, and ROC curve analysis was conducted to calculate the cut-off value and generate an interactive scatter plot. In the detection of sheep brucellosis, the results indicated that at a cut-off value of 86,075, the diagnostic sensitivity was 100% and the diagnostic specificity was 95% ( Figure 2 Figure 2 p 3.3. Sensitivity, Cross-Reactivity, and Repeatability for Bru-CLIA To assess the sensitivity of Bru-CLIA, serum samples with different dilution ratios were tested using the established Bru-CLIA method. For sheep and bovine brucellosis detection, the sensitivity of Bru-CLIA was 1:512 and 1:256, which corresponds to approximately 1 IU/mL and 2 IU/mL, respectively ( Table 1 The cross-reactivity of the Bru-CLIA was evaluated using both positive and negative brucellosis sera, as well as positive sera for Escherichia coli Mycobacterium tuberculosis Vibrio cholerae Legionella Salmonella Foot and mouth disease virus types O and A Bovine viral diarrhea virus Goat pox virus Small ruminant plague virus Table 2 Ten brucellosis sera, comprising 5 sheep and 5 bovine serum samples, were tested. The CVs for intra- and inter-batch repeatability ranged from 0.9% to 4.2% and 0.3% to 8.1%, respectively ( Table 3 3.4. Comparison of Coincidence Test To assess the suitability of the detection method developed in this study for clinical brucellosis antibody detection, a concordance test was conducted between Bru-CLIA and commercial kits. As shown in Table 4 4. Discussion Serological tests play a pivotal role in diagnosing human and animal brucellosis. While pathogen isolation and nucleic acid testing are essential, serodiagnostic methods such as RBT and ELISA are prioritized in many endemic regions due to their ease of implementation in clinical settings with limited resources [ 23 24 10 11 25 26 Treponema pallidum breast cancer hepatitis E virus COVID-19 27 28 29 30 In this study, Bru-CLIA was established based on LPS-MPs and AE-SPG. The method demonstrated pertinent specificity, sensitivity, and rapidity in detecting sheep and bovine brucellosis antibodies ( Table 1 Table 2 Table 3 31 32 33 Escherichia coli Mycobacterium tuberculosis Vibrio cholerae Legionella Salmonella foot-and-mouth disease virus types O and A Bovine viral diarrhea virus Goat pox virus Small ruminant plague virus This study is the first to evaluate and analyze Bru-CLIA for the clinical diagnosis of brucellosis. For detecting sheep and bovine brucellosis, the cut-off fluorescence values were 86,075 and 89,487, respectively, with AUC values of 0.9962 and 1.0, demonstrating excellent diagnostic accuracy. The concordance rates between Bru-CLIA and the ID-VET ELISA commercial kits were 87.65% and 93.75%, respectively. Bru-CLIA showed greater sensitivity and faster results than ELISA, providing significant technological support for epidemiological surveillance, immune efficacy evaluation, and even the quantitative analysis of standard serum.
