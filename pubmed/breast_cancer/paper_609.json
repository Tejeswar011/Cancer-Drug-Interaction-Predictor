Background Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disorder marked by irregular expansion and maturation, giving rise to the aggregation of immature myeloid precursor cells. Although most patients achieve remission with initial treatment, the majority of relapses lead to poorer overall survival. The bone marrow (BM) immune microenvironment has been proven to significantly affect the progression of AML. However, the mechanisms that cause the imbalance of immune cell subsets and phenotypes remain partially obscure. Therefore, this research sought to explore the immune-regulatory genes and to determine their role in AML. Methods Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained through differential analysis of the AML cohort. Enrichment analyses were applied to explore their biological functions. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify the key module of AML. ROC curve analysis was performed to identify hub genes with good predictive power. CIBERSORT and the ESTIMATE algorithm were used to assess the correlation between hub genes and the immune microenvironment of AML. The impact of hub gene expression on the prognosis of AML was verified through prognostic traits and clinical samples. Results Through differential analysis and WGCNA, seven genes were identified as markedly related to the development of AML. By mapping ROC curves, three hub genes were verified: CCR7, SLC16A6, and MS4A1, which have high diagnostic value for AML. Additionally, an imbalanced immune microenvironment was found to be common in AML. Three hub genes were significantly associated with immune components, including immune cells and immunomodulatory factors. Ultimately, through the validation of clinical samples and the analysis of prognostic characteristics, three genes were confirmed to be reduced in AML patients, and their high expression suggested a favorable prognosis. Conclusion Our study identified and validated the efficacy of SLC16A6, CCR7, and MS4A1 as tumor suppressors implicated in AML progression and related to immune cell infiltration. acute myeloid leukemia tumor immune microenvironment Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis tumor suppressor immune response The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

An effective strategy involves focusing on the BM niche to counteract the immunosuppressive microenvironment, which includes two primary methods: diminishing the quantity of immunosuppressive cells and repolarizing them toward an anti-tumor phenotype ( Vatner and Formenti, 2015 2 Methods 2.1 AML dataset acquisition and processing We retrieved the AML datasets [ GSE9476 Stirewalt et al., 2008 GSE114868 Huang et al., 2019 GSE9476 GSE114868 2.2 Differential analysis and functional enrichment R version 4.3.3 was used to complete this research. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of AML were obtained using the package “Limma” ( McCarthy and Smyth, 2009 Yu et al., 2012 2.3 Immune cell infiltration and immunity index score analysis The package “ESTIMATE” was used to assess stromal scores and immune scores ( Yoshihara et al., 2013 Newman et al., 2015 2.4 Correlation analysis Correlation analysis was performed using the “Corrplot” package. 2.5 WGCNA Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was applied to explore the crucial module of AML ( Langfelder and Horvath, 2008 2.6 Identification of hub genes Seven overlapping genes were obtained by intersecting the three candidate gene sets. The “pROC” package was applied to construct the ROC curve ( Robin et al., 2011 2.7 Prognostic analysis of three genes Using the threshold determined by the minimum p-value from the log-rank test, AML patients were split into groups with high and low expression levels. The Kaplan–Meier survival curve was then generated to evaluate survival differences between these two groups ( Gyorffy, 2024 GSE76008 Ng et al., 2016 GSE83533 Li et al., 2016 2.8 Isolation of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNCs) The acquisition and utilization of the samples were performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Bone marrow was collected from AML patients and healthy donors of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients at the Central People’s Hospital of Zhanjiang, and we used human lymphocyte separation medium to isolate the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNCs) according to the manual. BMNCs were placed in TRIzol for preservation. 2.9 Real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) Real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was applied to evaluate the difference in hub genes between healthy controls and AML patients. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent, and 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed into stable complementary DNA (CDNA) using reverse transcriptase. A volume of 20 µL of qPCR reaction mixture was prepared, containing SYBR, primers, nuclease-free water, and template cDNA. After obtaining the CT values, relative gene expression was assessed using the comparative CT method [2 (-ΔΔCT) Gene Forward Reverse GAPDH ACA​ACT​TTG​GTA​TCG​TGG​AAG​G GCC​ATC​ACG​CCA​CAG​TTT​C SLC16A6 CGC​TGT​GTT​TGC​TTT​CGC​ACC​A TTT​TCG​GTG​ACG​CTG​GTC​CTC​T CCR7 CAA​CAT​CAC​CAG​TAG​CAC​CTG​TG TGC​GGA​ACT​TGA​CGC​CGA​TGA​A MS4A1 CTG​GTC​CAA​AAC​CAC​TCT​TCA​GG GGC​AAT​GTG​GAA​GAG​CCC​ATT​C 2.10 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses in R were performed using the “ggpubr” package, and images were generated using “ggplot2.” SPSS 19.0 was used for statistical analysis. An independent-samples t-test or a Mann–Whitney U test was selected based on whether the sample conformed to a normal distribution and whether variances between groups were equal. All data were presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). The images were edited using Adobe Photoshop (PS) 2022 software. 3 Results 3.1 Flowchart of this study  Figure 1 GSE9476 GSE114868 FIGURE 1 Flowchart for this study.

Therefore, the CIBERSORT algorithm was applied to explore the immune landscape in the training dataset GSE9476 Figures 3A,B + Figure 3C FIGURE 3 The immune landscape of the training dataset GSE9476 (A) (B) (C) GSE9476 Panel A presents a stacked bar chart showing the cell proportion of various immune cells in control and AML groups.

(A–C) (D) (E) Correlation plots and heatmaps illustrate relationships between gene expressions and immune metrics. Panels A, B, and C show scatter plots with correlation coefficients for CCR7, SLC16A6, and MS4A1 against immune scores, stromal scores, and ESTIMATE scores. Panels D and E display heatmaps indicating significant correlations of these genes with various immune cells, cytokines, and factors, using a color scale to denote correlation strength and p-values. The immune score merely indicated the overall quantity of infiltrating immune cells, but not the actual immune state within the TIME. Therefore, the CIBERSORT algorithm was used to analyze the associations between three genes and 22 types of immune cells in GSE114868 Figure 6D Figure 6D Figure 3 Binder et al., 2018 Luciano et al., 2022 Figure 6E Figure 6E 3.7 High expression of hub genes indicated favorable prognosis for AML As previously described, hub genes may affect the development of AML by reshaping the TIME. We next explored the association among three genes and prognosis from three aspects: survival curves, relevance to LSC, and recurrence. Patients with high expression of three genes consistently displayed better prognosis, whereas those with low expression typically faced shorter survival times ( Figure 7A Figure 7B + Figure 7C GSE37642 Sun et al., 2024 Tang et al., 2009 Supplementary Figure 1 FIGURE 7 Exploration of the prognostic and clinical correlation of three genes in AML.

Box plots compare normalized expression levels of CCR7, SLC16A6, and MS4A1 between LSC− and LSC+ groups. 3.8 Decreased expression of hub genes in AML clinical samples It is considered that the BM cell niche promotes leukemogenesis. We collected BMNCs from 5 healthy controls and 13 AML patients to detect the expression of three genes between two groups. The clinical and molecular characteristics of the 13 AML patients can be found in Supplementary Table 1 Figures 8A–C FIGURE 8 Detecting the expression of three genes in BMNCs of AML patients. (A–C) Bar graphs labeled A, B, and C compare relative mRNA levels for genes SLC16A6, MS4A1, and CCR7 between control (N=5) and patient (N=13) groups. Graph A shows significantly higher levels in controls for SLC16A6. Graph B shows significantly higher levels in controls for MS4A1. Graph C shows a significant difference for CCR7, with controls higher. Significance is indicated by asterisks. 4 Discussion AML is a highly heterogeneous disease; although current therapies may achieve remission in some patients, the overall survival rate remains poor ( Nair et al., 2021 Baryawno et al., 2019 Liu et al., 2022 In our study, the enrichment analysis results from 26 AML patient samples and 20 healthy donor samples indicate that AML had characteristics of immune response dysregulation. We compared the differences in 22 types of immune cells between normal controls and AML patients and identified several distinct immune cells with varying expression levels between the two groups. Anti-inflammatory cells, like Tregs and M2-like macrophages, were upregulated in AML patients, while the expression of activated CD4 + Corradi et al., 2022 Weinhauser et al., 2023 Guo et al., 2021 Through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, we ultimately identified CCR7, SLC16A6, and MS4A1 as hub genes of AML, which had high diagnostic value and indicate prognostic traits related to AML. More importantly, hub genes were highly correlated with the immune microenvironment, mainly reflecting in their close association with various immune cells and immune-regulatory factors. CCR7, as a chemokine receptor, exhibits high expression levels on naive T/B cells and DCs, and it can coordinate inflammatory responses while regulating the migration and function of white blood cells ( Salem et al., 2021 In addition, CCR7 has been confirmed to be related to multiple tumors ( Zlotnik et al., 2011 Takanami, 2003 Sperveslage et al., 2012 Shang et al., 2009 Rickmann et al., 2013 Lau et al., 2016 Tiberio et al., 2018 Ohl et al. (2004) MS4A1 encodes a 33–37-kDa non-glycosylated protein CD20, which is present on both normal and malignant B lymphocytes ( Tedder et al., 1989 Jeha et al., 2006 Milne et al., 2009 Mudd et al., 2021 Han et al., 2008 Sato et al., 2020 + + Song et al., 2022 SLC16A6 belongs to the solute carrier family. Current research has not yet characterized the relationship between SLC16A6 and the immune system, but evidence suggests that SLC16A6 participates in taurine transport and may promote the release of taurine from cytoplasmic membranes. Taurine functions as a key organic osmolyte, playing a dual role in both regulating cell volume and modulating immune responses ( Higuchi et al., 2022 + Cao et al., 2024 In addition, our research found that three genes were significantly under-expressed in LSC + 5 Conclusion In this study, we identified and validated three tumor suppressors (SLC16A6, CCR7, and MS4A1) in AML; they were markedly reduced in AML patients. It was demonstrated that three genes may influence the TIME by modulating immune cell infiltration and contributing to the regulation of cytokines. In addition, patients with high expression of three genes consistently displayed better prognosis, whereas those with low expression typically faced shorter survival times. These findings will provide novel biomarkers for AML and offer new insights into precision therapy.
