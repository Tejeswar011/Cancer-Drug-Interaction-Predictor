Palmitoylation, a reversible lipid modification, plays a critical role in cancer progression. However, its prognostic value in BLCA remains unclear. Methods We analyzed 3629 palmitoylation-related genes (PRGs) from the TCGA-BLCA and GEO datasets. Differentially expressed PRGs were identified, and a prognostic signature was constructed through Cox and LASSO regression analyses. Survival analysis, ROC curves, immune microenvironment profiling, drug sensitivity prediction, and mutational landscape comparison were performed. Mendelian randomization (MR) and mediation analyses explored the causal role of DNA methylation and gene expression, focusing on GRK5. Results A 13-PRG prognostic model was established and validated internally and externally, with AUCs exceeding 0.7. High-risk patients exhibited poorer survival, a distinct immune landscape, and altered drug sensitivities. Mutation analysis showed higher RB1 mutation rates in the high-risk group. MR and mediation analyses identified GRK5 as a key gene linking DNA methylation to BLCA risk, with cg09337049 methylation significantly suppressing GRK5 expression and influencing disease development. Conclusion This study presents the first palmitoylation-related prognostic model for BLCA, highlighting GRK5 methylation as a potential biomarker for early detection and personalized treatment.

By integrating high-throughput sequencing data and computational analysis, our model seeks to identify potential palmitoylated proteins associated with tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. We further focus on the hub gene GRK5 and apply Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate its potential causal relationship with BLCA incidence. MR utilizes genetic variants as instrumental variables to infer causality between an exposure and an outcome [ 5 6 7 Methods Data collection The RNA sequencing data (FPKM) of 412 BLCA samples and 19 normal samples, along with their corresponding clinical information, were downloaded from the TCGA database ( https://www.cancer.gov/tcga https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ GSE32894 https://www.eqtlgen.org/cis-eqtls.html 8 http://www.GoDMC.org.uk/ 9 https://www.genecards.org n S1 Development and multi-cohort validation of a PRGs prognostic signature for BLCA The differential expression profiling of 3,629 PRGs between normal urothelium and tumor tissues was performed using the “limma” package in R, with statistically significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) defined as those exhibiting |log2 fold change| >1 and adjusted p-value < 0.05. Subsequent univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was employed to screen OS-associated PRGs. To construct the prognostic signature, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-penalized Cox regression model was implemented via the “glmnet” package, with the optimal regularization parameter (λ) determined through 10-fold cross-validation to retain variables exhibiting non-zero coefficients. The multivariate risk score was calculated as: Risk score = Σ(β × mRNA Exp), where β represents the LASSO-derived coefficient and Exp denotes the normalized mRNA expression level of each selected gene. Using the model’s median risk score as the stratification threshold, BLCA patients were dichotomized into prognostically distinct high-risk and low-risk subgroups. Survival disparities between cohorts were evaluated through Kaplan-Meier estimator analysis with Mantel-Haenszel log-rank test, while predictive accuracy was quantified by time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (“timeROC” package). The model’s robustness was confirmed through external validation in the GSE32894 Clinical characteristics of subtypes and nomogram construction TCGA-BLCA samples were stratified into high-risk and low-risk subgroups based on the PRGs prognostic signature. Inter-group clinical characteristic differences were analyzed and visualized through box plots. Then the distribution of clinical characteristic data in the sample is displayed using a heat map. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent prognostic value of the model based on the risk score and clinical variables. Subsequently, a nomogram was constructed using the “rms” R package, integrating the risk score and clinical characteristics to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) probabilities for BLCA patients in the TCGA cohort. Interaction network and function enrichment analyses Based on the differentially-expressed PRGs, we constructed the protein-protein interaction network through the STRING database ( https://cn.string-db.org P Immune microenvironment analyses 7 different immune algorithms were used to evaluate the distribution of immune cells between two PRG groups. Then using the “Limma” package and “pheatmap” package, the results were visualized by the heat map. And the TIMER (Tumor Immune Estimation Resource) database ( https://cistrome.shinyapps.io/timer/ 10 Drug sensitivity analyses To explore the potential clinical value of the palmitoylation-related gene (PRG) prognostic model, we evaluated the predicted response of bladder cancer patients to commonly used chemotherapeutic agents. Drug sensitivity prediction was performed using the “pRRophetic” package, which utilizes ridge regression models trained on the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database to estimate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of anti-cancer drugs based on transcriptomic data [ 11 Mutation analyses Somatic mutation data of bladder cancer patients were obtained from TCGA-BLCA cohort. Mutation annotation format (MAF) files were processed and visualized using the “maftools” R package. Mutation characteristics were independently assessed in two PRG groups and total TCGA-BLCA samples to investigate potential differences in genomic alterations. The results were visualized through SNV mutation types plots, SNV composition plots, tumor mutation burden (TMB) distribution boxplots, mutation landscape and mutation summary plots. Exploration of the hub gene mechanism In the eQTL data, SNPs were selected as instrumental variables based on the following criteria: (1) genome-wide significance threshold ( p − 8 2 11 The R package“TwoSampleMR” (version 0.5.7) was used to estimate the potential causal relationship between the above genetically predicted palmitoylation genes and BLCA. Causal relationship estimates were made for genes, using methods such as inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR Egger, weighted median, simple mode, and weighted mode. In the analysis, the odds ratio (OR) of BLCA risk corresponding to each one standard deviation (SD) increase in the PRG level was calculated. Steiger filtering was applied to rigorously assess causal directionality by confirming that genetic instruments accounted for greater variance in the exposure than in the outcome. Instrumental variables (IVs) that did not satisfy the directional assumption (labeled as “FALSE”) were excluded from the analysis. Subsequently, Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses were re-conducted using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method based exclusively on the remaining IVs that met the assumption (labeled as “TRUE”). To investigate the causal relationship between DNA methylation and palmitoylation and evaluate the mediation role of palmitoylation in the DNA methylation-BLCA’s disease association, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis followed by causal mediation analysis. Then the methylation site data of the hub gene was extracted from mQTL data, and filtered instrumental variables (SNPs) using the following criteria: p-value < 5 × 10⁻⁸, clumping window = 10,000 kb, and r² < 0.1. The resulting mQTL data are designated as the exposure. The total analysis process was as follows: First, compute the effect size of mQTL on the hub gene (β₁) and the effect size of the hub gene’s eQTL on BLCA (β₂). Then, the mediation proportion (β₁₂_p = (β₁₂ / β_all) × 100%) was calculated. Finally the total effect of DNA methylation on BLCA risk (β_all), which includes the direct effect (β_dir) and the indirect effect mediated by palmitoylation gene expression (β₁₂ = β₁ × β₂), the potential mediating role of the hub gene in the relationship between DNA methylation and BLCA was quantified (Fig. 11 Collection of clinical samples and immunohistochemistry A total of three BLCA tissue samples, along with matched adjacent normal tissues, were obtained from clinically diagnosed BLCA patients undergoing surgical tumor resection at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College between March 2025 and May 2025. All patients provided written informed consent for the use of their clinical specimens. Freshly excised tissues were immediately frozen in liquid formalin within 15 min of resection. These samples were subsequently used for immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. BLCA tumor and adjacent normal tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), sectioned, and incubated overnight with a primary antibody against GRK5 (Proteintech, BC064506 Statistical analyses All statistical analyses in this study were performed using the open-source R software (version 4.4.2, available at: https://www.r-project.org/ Results Identification of prognostic PRGs The flow chart of the study is illustrated in Fig. 1 2 p 2  Fig. 1 The flow chart of the study  Fig. 2 ( a b c d Construction and validation of the PRG model Based on the above 164 PRGs, LASSO regression analysis was used to develop a prognostic model, and the outcomes of the LASSO regression analysis and the associated cross-validation process are shown in Fig. 2 1 GSE32894 S1  Table 1 The information of 13 prognosis PRGs Gene Full name Location Function of the encoded protein GRK5 G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 10q26.11 Phosphorylates activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), leading to desensitization of GPCR signaling.

To evaluate the prognostic performance and robustness of the PRG (palmitoylation-related gene) risk model, we conducted a comprehensive validation using the TCGA-BLCA dataset and an external cohort ( GSE32894 3 3 3 3 p 3 3 3 3 p 3 3 GSE32894 3 3 p 3 3  Fig. 3 Validation of the prognostic model. ( a, e, f e f b, f, j b f j c, g, k g k Clinical characteristic analyses between high- and low-risk groups To explore the clinical relevance of the risk model, we compared the risk scores between different clinical subgroups in the TCGA-BLCA cohort (Fig. 4 2 p p p p p p p p 4  Fig. 4 The box plots show the difference of clinical characteristics between high and low risk groups. Including pathologic stage ( a b c d e f g h i  Table 2 Clinical characteristics of BLCA patients from TCGA Clinical characteristics Group No. of cases Total 412 Age ≤ 65 162 >65 250 Gender Male 304 Female 108 Smoking History Never smoker 111 Smoker 288 Unknown 13 Pathologic Stage Stage I 2 Stage II 131 Stage III 141 Stage IV 136 Unknown 2 Pathologic T Stage T0 1 T1 3 T2 120 T3 196 T4 59 Unknown 33 Pathologic N Stage N0 239 N1 47 N2 76 N3 8 Unknown 42 Pathologic M Stage M0 196 M1 11 Unknown 205 Histologic Stage Low grade 21 High grade 388 Unknown 3 Weight ≤ 77 184 >77 185 Unknown 43 Moreover, stratified survival analysis based on various clinical features consistently demonstrated that patients in the high-risk group had worse overall survival across most subgroups (Supplementary Figure S2), further confirming the prognostic value of the risk model. Construction of the nomogram A nomogram was developed based on multivariate regression analysis to predict patient survival by translating multiple clinical variables into individual line segments within a two-dimensional Cartesian plane. To evaluate whether the prognostic model-derived risk score independently predicts OS in BLCA patients, both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted in conjunction with relevant clinical parameters. Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that age, pathologic stage, and risk group were significantly associated with OS ( p 5 p 5 5 5  Fig. 5 Construction of the nomogram.

Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis was performed using the STRING database with a minimum required interaction score set to 0.7. After removing isolated nodes, a complex PPI network which included 1335edges, was constructed (Fig. 6 6  Fig. 6 After removing isolated nodes, the protein-protein interaction network of 673 differential PRGs ( a b c d e f GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were then performed to investigate the biological functions and pathways of the PRGs. GO analysis indicated significant enrichment in biological processes such as muscle system process, muscle contraction, and regulation of blood circulation. Enriched cellular components and molecular functions included contractile fibers, myofibrils, and ion channel activities (Fig. 6 6 Furthermore, GSEA was conducted to compare the biological differences between high-risk and low-risk groups defined by the prognostic PRG model. In the high-risk group, the top five positively correlated gene sets included complement and coagulation cascades, extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction, and focal adhesion pathways, which are often associated with tumor progression and metastasis (Fig. 6 12 13 6 14 15 Immune microenvironment analyses To elucidate the relationship between the risk score and immune cell infiltration, we performed a comprehensive immune microenvironment analysis using multiple computational algorithms, including TIMER, CIBERSORT, CIBERSORT-ABS, QUANTISEQ, MCP-counter, XCELL, and EPIC (Fig. 7  Fig. 7 The heatmap showed the relationship between the risk score and immune cell infiltration with multiple computational algorithms, including TIMER, CIBERSORT, CIBERSORT-ABS, QUANTISEQ, MCP-counter, XCELL, and EPIC ( a b In addition, we evaluated the expression of immune checkpoint-related genes between the high- and low-risk groups. As shown in Fig. 7 p 10 The association between the PRG model and the immune microenvironment in BLCA was assessed by analyzing the correlations between the 13 model genes and various immune cell types using the TIMER database, including B cells and CD8 + T cells. Key results are presented in Fig. 8  Fig. 8 The TIMER database showed the relationship between the part of the genes in the PRG model and the common immune infiltrating cells Drug sensitivity analyses The predictive capacity of the risk score for drug treatment efficacy in BLCA patients was evaluated by calculating the log-transformed IC50 values of several drugs used in clinical in each TCGA-BLCA sample, as detailed in Supplementary Table S4. The results indicated that the high-risk group was predicted to be more resistant to AKT inhibitor VIII and Amethopterin, while demonstrating increased sensitivity to Doxorubicin, Docetaxel, Gemcitabine, Cisplatin, and Paclitaxel. No significant difference in drug response was observed for Mitomycin C (Fig. 9  Fig. 9 The box plots showed the sensitivity of high and low risk groups of PRG model to common clinical drugs of BLCA Mutation analyses A comprehensive somatic mutation analysis was conducted on the TCGA-BLCA cohort and its subgroups, which were stratified according to the PRG prognostic model, to explore the mutational landscape in bladder cancer. As shown in Fig. 10 10 10  Fig. 10 Mutational landscape of TCGA-BLCA cohort and stratified risk groups based on PRG prognostic signature. Mutation profile of all TCGA-BLCA samples ( a d g b e h c f i Overall, these findings highlight the mutational heterogeneity of bladder cancer and emphasize the potential prognostic significance of specific gene alterations identified through the PRG-based risk model. Mediation analysis of DNA methylation‑palmitoylation‑blca relationship To further explore the regulatory mechanism between DNA methylation, palmitoylation-related genes, and bladder cancer (BLCA), we performed a mediation analysis to assess whether DNA methylation influences BLCA progression through palmitoylation genes. And GRK5 was identified as the hub gene to make an impact on the outcome of BLCA through MR analysis (Table 3 11 P 11  Table 3 The results of the hub gene based on MR analysis id nsnp method b se or or_lci95 or_uci95 pvalue GRK5 16 MR Egger 0.58014 0.26984 0.559818 0.329879 0.950035 0.049521 GRK5 16 Weighted median 0.30545 0.14387 0.736789 0.555749 0.976804 0.033743 GRK5 16 Inverse variance weighted 0.23151 0.111066 0.793335 0.638139 0.986275 0.037121 GRK5 16 Simple mode -0.34653 0.213654 0.707134 0.465196 1.074899 0.125641 GRK5 16 Weighted mode -0.35727 0.187179 0.699583 0.48474 1.009645 0.075621 However, the analysis of survival data and GRK5 expression levels in the TCGA-BLCA cohort revealed that elevated GRK5 expression is significantly correlated with unfavorable patient outcomes (HR = 1.51 (1.11–2.05), P 11 Through MR analysis of GRK5 methylation patterns, we identified several SNP sites that are significantly associated with clinical outcomes in BLCA (Supplementary Table S6). As the details of the analyses were shown in Supplementary Figures S5-8, sensitivity analyses revealed no signs of heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy, as indicated by Cochran’s Q test and MR-Egger regression. Additionally, the MR-PRESSO analysis identified no outliers, and the leave-one-out analysis demonstrated consistent results, reinforcing the robustness and reliability of our Mendelian randomization findings. The IVW results showed that four methylation sites in GRK5 to affect BLCA outcome: cg00290758 (OR = 1.2224, 95%CI = 1.0098–1.4767, P P P P 11 4 11 Fig. 11 The mechanism analysis of GRK5 in BLCA.

However, the related predictive models for clinical outcomes is still lacking [ 22 22 Accumulating evidence indicates that TEAD4 is significantly upregulated in BLCA, its high expression is closely associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. TEAD4 mediates BLCA metastasis through regulating EMT via PI3K/AKT pathway. These findings suggest that TEAD4 may serve as a critical contributor to the pathogenesis and progression of BLCA [ 23 24 25 26 27 Interestingly, we observed a high frequency of RB1 mutations in the mutational landscape of the high-risk group. As a well-established textbook example of a driver mutation, RB1 is emblematic in oncological research due to its early discovery, recessive nature, and prevalence. Notably, RB1 ranks fourth among tumor suppressor genes in terms of homozygous loss frequency, underscoring its critical role in tumorigenesis [ 28 29 30 31 In this study, the outcomes of the functional enrichment analysis revealed that PRGs were primarily associated with the progression of metabolism involved in biological processes such as muscle system process, muscle contraction, cardiac process, and myofibril organization. These findings suggest that the PRG model may be not only linked to intrinsic tumor characteristics but also involved in modulating muscle tissue function within the tumor microenvironment, thereby influencing tumor invasion and metastasis [ 32 33 34 35 In order to further explore the hub gene affecting the prognosis of BLCA, we employed two-sample MR, summary-data-based MR (SMR), and mediation analyses to investigate the causal relationship between palmitoylation-related genes and BLCA. Our findings revealed a significant link between GRK5 expression and BLCA risk, with DNA methylation acting as a mediating factor. These results offer new insights into the pathogenesis of BLCA by emphasizing the role of epigenetic regulation in neurodegenerative disorders and suggest that GRK5 may serve as a promising biomarker or therapeutic target for the early diagnosis and treatment of BLCA. Our two-sample MR and SMR analyses revealed that SNPs associated with GRK5 are negatively associated with the risk of BLCA. GRK5 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase 5) is a member of the GRK family, characterized by the presence of a conserved serine/threonine kinase domain that regulates signal transduction by phosphorylating activated G protein-coupled receptors [ 36 37 38 39 40 41 Mediation analysis revealed that DNA methylation at cg09337049 downregulates the expression of SNPs of GRK5, consequently exerting an indirect effect on BLCA risk. Notably, this methylation site has not been previously documented in BLCA methylation research. DNA methylation mainly takes place in CpG promoter regions and is widely recognized as a key epigenetic mechanism leading to gene silencing [ 42 43 44 Our study has several notable strengths. First, to our knowledge, it is the first prognostic model specifically based on PRGs for BLCA, filling an important gap in the current research landscape. Second, the model demonstrated robust predictive performance across multiple datasets, including internal validation (randomly partitioned TCGA-BLCA subset) and external validation ( GSE32894 However, several limitations were still existing. Firstly, all model construction and validation were based on public datasets, and lack prospective validation in large-scale, real-world clinical samples, which may introduce potential biases. Secondly, since the eQTL data used were derived from blood rather than bladder tissues, there may be discrepancies in tissue-specific gene regulation that limit the direct biological interpretation in bladder cancer. Although blood-derived QTLs provide valuable genetic insight, future studies should incorporate bladder tissue- or urine-specific eQTL data (e.g., from GTEx or clinical samples) for more accurate mechanistic inference. Thirdly, although this study provided bioinformatic and statistical evidence, no in vitro or in vivo experiments were conducted to directly validate the functional roles of GRK5 and other key PRGs in BLCA. Moreover, the verification of GRK5 protein expression was limited to only three pairs of BLCA samples, and further confirmation using a larger sample size is needed to draw more definitive conclusions regarding its expression pattern. Fourthly, the clinical applicability of the PRG model in guiding personalized treatment decisions remains to be further verified in prospective clinical studies. Fifthly, although the transcriptomic upregulation of immune checkpoints in high-risk patients suggests a potential T cell exhaustion phenotype, functional confirmation through flow cytometry or single-cell profiling shold be pursued in future studies to clarify the underlying immune status. Lastly, the model did not perform subgroup analyses based on molecular subtypes of BLCA, which may overlook the impact of tumor heterogeneity. Conclusion In this study, we developed and validated a prognostic model based on PRGs for BLCA, demonstrating its robust predictive power across multiple cohorts. The model effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct survival outcomes, immune landscapes, and drug sensitivities.We further identified GRK5 as a key hub gene through Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and revealed that its expression of SNPs may mediate the impact of DNA methylation on BLCA risk. Notably, the methylation site cg09337049 contributed significantly to this mediation effect. Overall, our findings highlight the prognostic value of PRGs and the potential regulatory role of GRK5 in BLCA progression, offering new insights into epigenetic mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.
