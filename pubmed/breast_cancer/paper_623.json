Despite surgical and medical treatments, they usually regrow and cause serious medical complications. The presentation of these complicated metastatic cancers might be nonspecific, such as cerebrovascular accidents. Abbreviations BP Blood Pressure CT Computed Tomography CVA Cerebrovascular Accident ECG Electrocardiogram ICU Intensive Care Unit LA Left Atrium MFS Myxofibrosarcoma PR Pulse Rate RR Respiratory Rate STS Soft Tissue Sarcoma T Temperature TTE Transthoracic Echocardiogram 1 Introduction Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) represent an uncommon category of cancerous tumors derived from mesenchymal tissue, comprising approximately 1% of adult cancers [ 1 1 2 3 4 3 4 5 Studies show that as many as half of high‐risk patients with advanced STS develop metastatic disease, leading to mortality [ 6 7 8 8 This case study presents a rare case of STS with metastases to the heart. 2 Case Presentation 2.1 History and Physical Exam Findings The patient was a 74‐year‐old man who first presented in June 2023 at Modarres Hospital of Tehran with weakness in the upper and lower extremities of the left side and global aphasia, which began 6 h before his presentation when he woke up from sleep and was drawn to the hospital. He had experienced three similar episodes recently, each showing spontaneous improvement within a few hours. He had a history of Synovial Cell Sarcoma of the left elbow and proximal forearm, diagnosed 2 years before. After the diagnosis, he underwent wide resection surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy. After 8 months, he was diagnosed with bone metastasis to the ipsilateral humerus bone. The metastasis was treated with a surgical approach (resection of the tumor and the cement and allograft replacement). The patient had undergone adjuvant radiotherapy, too, due to his metastatic sarcoma. The patient was anxious and cachectic in her general appearance. His vital signs evaluations showed within‐range blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and temperature (BP: 125/85, RR: 18, PR: 84, T: 36.4). The cardiorespiratory exam showed no abnormal findings. The neurologic examination revealed a weakness in the left upper and lower proximal (3/5) limbs. No other abnormality could be detected in the physical exam. 2.2 Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures The diagnostic approach began with an electrocardiogram (ECG), which demonstrated nonspecific abnormal findings and did not yield a conclusive diagnosis. In his Doppler sonography, the only noteworthy point was mild calcifications without significant narrowing and stricture in both carotid arteries. His initial transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a large, semimobile, round echogenic mass with no clear attachment point in the left atrium (LA) (Figure 1 2 3 4 FIGURE 1 The TTE apical four‐chamber view reveals a large, round echogenic mass in the left atrium (indicated by red arrows). FIGURE 2 (A) Mid‐esophageal TEE at 123° with a counterclockwise maneuver shows a tumor in the left pulmonary veins: The inferior pulmonary vein (red) and the superior pulmonary vein (blue). (B) Mid‐esophageal short‐axis TEE at 46° reveals an echogenic mass (red arrow) in the left atrium (LA) with hypermobile particles on its surface (yellow arrows), indicating high embolic risk. (C) 3D TEE provides multiple views of a tumor originating from the pulmonary veins, not attached to the LA. (D) Mid‐esophageal TEE at 0° with a counterclockwise maneuver highlights tumor extension into the left pulmonary vein (purple). The interventricular septum (red arrow), closed mitral valve leaflets (yellow arrows), and the tumor (blue) are indicated. FIGURE 3 (A) An axial view of a chest CT scan in the mediastinal window shows a lobulated mass lesion indicated by red arrows in the left lower lobe, which invades the left inferior pulmonary vein as shown by the blue arrow. (B) The chest CT scan in the axial view of the lung window reveals a mass lesion (red arrows) in the left lower lobe that invades the left inferior pulmonary vein, indicated by the blue arrow. FIGURE 4 Brain computed tomography showed no remarkable abnormality. The multidisciplinary team decided to proceed with a palliative surgical approach due to the characteristics of the mass and the high risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. The patient underwent open‐heart surgery 3 days after admission, after stabilizing and showing improvement in his cerebrovascular accident (CVA) symptoms. A thoracotomy was performed, during which the tumor was resected from the LA and the pulmonary vein. The extracted tumor had a loose structure and was sent to the pathology laboratory for more evaluation as it consisted of four irregular brownish‐tan elastic tissue fragments TM: 4 × 3 × 1 cm (Figure 5 6 FIGURE 5 The extracted tumor had a loose structure and was sent for more evaluation in fragments. FIGURE 6 Histological slides at (A) low and (B) high‐power fields show extensive necrotic tissue mixed with atypical cells with a high nucleus‐to‐cytoplasm ratio, irregular nuclei, and hyperchromatic chromatin. 3 Conclusion and Follow‐Up The patient was discharged a week after the surgery with a stable medical condition and no new complaints or symptoms. Two months after the surgery, the evaluation revealed the tumor's regrowth and no residual or recurrent cardiac tumor in follow‐up sessions, 4–6 and 12 months later. 4 Discussion Cardiac metastases represent a critical oncological complication, leading to critical cardiac manifestations and significantly diminishing patient prognosis within a brief diagnostic interval [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 Only a few cases of metastatic heart involvement in sarcoma have been documented in the literature. The reported incidence ranges from 0.001% to 0.03% [ 8 15 Metastatic heart disease presents significant diagnostic challenges due to its variable and nonspecific clinical features, which are influenced by tumor location and burden [ 16 9 17 9 Pericardial metastasis is the most frequently affected site, occurring in approximately 60%–69% of cases. Autopsy studies reveal that epicardial and myocardial involvement rank as the second and third most frequent sites of cardiac metastases, occurring in approximately 25%–34% of cases, whereas endocardial and intracavitary involvement is infrequent, observed in only 3%–5% [ 18 19 20 21 Common clinical manifestations of cardiac neoplasms include the onset of valvular dysfunction, heart failure, arrhythmias, conduction issues, syncope, pulmonary embolism, and, in severe cases, sudden cardiac death; however, the condition is often asymptomatic in its initial stages [ 22 23 24 25 12 Currently, there are no standardized treatment guidelines for cardiac metastases [ 9 We reported a case of a 74‐year‐old male with synovial cell sarcoma who developed cardiac involvement 8 months post‐treatment, presenting with a metastatic mass in the LA and pulmonary vein, identified via TEE and CT. In a 1986 review of 120 autopsy reports, Hallahan et al. found cardiac metastases in 25% of patients with STS, with metastases to the myocardium (50%), pericardium (33%), or both (17%). However, most cases were asymptomatic and diagnosed postmortem. Symptoms included congestive heart failure, conduction blocks, arrhythmias, chest pain, and, rarely, sudden death [ 26 A 2010 study by Takenaka et al. of 641 STS patients identified 11 cases of cardiac metastases diagnosed during life, with a median diagnostic age of 33 years and a median time to cardiac involvement of 36 months. Leiomyosarcoma was the most common primary tumor, with metastases often affecting the left side of the heart and typically accompanied by metastases in other organs. Symptoms included dyspnea, fatigue, or absence, and imaging methods like echocardiography and CT were pivotal for diagnosis. In seven reported cases of cardiac metastases, radiotherapy improved median survival to 10.5 months, significantly longer than the 3.5 months observed in untreated patients. The average survival from diagnosis was 8 months, and no patients underwent surgery [ 27 Cardiac metastases are most commonly observed in individuals with widespread metastatic disease and a significant overall tumor burden. Consequently, the primary goals of intervention should focus on symptom palliation and delaying or preventing symptom recurrence [ 13 28 29 Intracardiac obstruction due to metastases may necessitate surgical intervention. However, outcomes are often poor when the ventricular function is significantly compromised. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy can also serve as valuable therapeutic options for managing certain cardiac metastases. Given the complexity of these cases, involving a multidisciplinary team is crucial for the comprehensive evaluation and management of patients with cardiac metastasis [ 7 16 29 30 In a 2012 retrospective study, Agaimy et al. reviewed cardiac surgeries for sarcomas at Erlangen Heart Centre (1999–2011) and identified four cases of cardiac metastases from STS. Cardiac metastases typically emerge 109.5 months after the initial cancer diagnosis. Three patients succumbed within 14 months following surgery, whereas one patient remained disease‐free for 34 months after undergoing heart transplantation [ 31 Cardiac metastases should be a differential consideration in patients with STS presenting with sudden cardiac dysfunction [ 9 26 27 31 Author Contributions  Abdulhamid Bagheri: Mohammad Khani: Mehrdad Jafari Fesharaki: Fariba Bayat: Taraneh Faghihi Langroudi: Behrang Kazeminejad: Amirreza Shahmohammadi: Elham Farahani: Disclosure Consent to Participate: The patient provided written informed consent to participate in this clinical case report, ensuring that all personal information and medical data would be kept confidential and used solely for research purposes.
