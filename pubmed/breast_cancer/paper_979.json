Dietary constituents can modulate CYP3A4 expression and activity through various mechanisms, thereby altering drug pharmacokinetics and potentially leading to therapeutic failure or toxicity. This narrative review compiles current evidence on dietary modulation of CYP3A4, with a particular focus on pharmacological and clinical implications for lipid-lowering and glucose-lowering drugs. Literature was identified through a comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, including preclinical and clinical studies addressing food–drug interactions involving CYP3A4 substrates. Numerous dietary compounds, such as citrus furanocoumarins, polyphenols, herbal extracts, and vitamins, act as CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers through competitive, mechanism-based, or nuclear receptor-mediated pathways. Specific examples include simvastatin, atorvastatin, repaglinide, and saxagliptin, whose systemic exposure can be significantly altered by dietary factors. Moreover, interindividual variability in CYP3A4 activity may be shaped by genetic polymorphisms, microbiota-derived metabolites, and epigenetic regulation, further influencing drug response. Understanding these interactions is crucial, especially in polymedicated patients or those receiving drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Clinicians should remain aware of potential CYP3A4-related food–drug interactions and consider dietary habits and supplement use in therapeutic decision-making. Future research should aim to integrate pharmacogenomics, gut microbiome profiling, and personalized nutrition in order to improve the prediction and prevention of clinically significant interactions.

Introduction Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is a key enzyme in xenobiotic metabolism, implicated in the clearance of a substantial portion of approved pharmaceuticals [ 1 2 3 4 5 Among non-genetic factors, dietary intake has emerged as a relevant modulator of CYP3A4 activity. Several foods and bioactive compounds—such as grapefruit juice (GFJ)—are known to interact with this enzyme, altering drug bioavailability and therapeutic outcomes [ 6 7 8 Hypericum perforatum 9 10 11 Recent studies have expanded our understanding of dietary modulation of CYP3A4. For instance, red beetroot extract, rich in betanin, has been shown to inhibit CYP3A4 in a dose-dependent manner [ 12 13 14 15 These interactions are particularly relevant from a pharmacogenetic and toxicological perspective. Genetic variants in CYP3A4 and its regulatory pathways can modify individual susceptibility to diet–drug interactions, while exaggerated exposure or inadequate drug levels, driven by dietary modulation, particularly in the case of drugs with a narrow therapeutic index such as certain statins or glucose-lowering agents. This narrative review aims to synthesize the current evidence on how foods, nutrients, and bioactive dietary compounds modulate CYP3A4 expression and activity, and to discuss the resulting pharmacokinetic and clinical implications for commonly prescribed statins and antidiabetic medications. 2. Methods A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science to identify relevant studies published up to July 2025. The search was limited to peer-reviewed articles written in English. Keywords and their combinations included “CYP3A4,” “cytochrome P450,” “food–drug interaction,” and the names of commonly used statins and antidiabetic drugs. Both preclinical (in vitro and in vivo) and clinical studies, as well as recent narrative and systematic reviews, were considered if they addressed dietary influences on CYP3A4-mediated drug metabolism and clinical relevance. Conference abstracts, non-English publications, duplicate records, and studies not directly related to CYP3A4 modulation by dietary components were excluded. The selected literature was synthesized narratively to summarize current knowledge, pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic mechanisms, and implications for clinical practice. 3. Overview of CYP3A4 CYP3A4 is one of the most relevant drug-metabolizing enzymes in humans, belonging to the CYP3A subfamily, which participates in the metabolism of more than 30% [ 16 17 CYP3A4 belongs to the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) superfamily, a group of membrane-bound hemoproteins that function as monooxygenases and are named for their characteristic absorption peak at 450 nm when reduced and bound to carbon monoxide [ 18 2 18 The enzyme is mainly expressed in hepatocytes and enterocytes of the proximal small intestine, contributing to first-pass metabolism in both tissues [ 8 18 8 CYP3A4 exhibits remarkable substrate promiscuity due to its large and flexible active site, allowing it to metabolize a diverse range of compounds [ 19 2 Importantly, CYP3A4 activity exhibits marked interindividual variability, with differences of up to 20–40-fold observed between patients [ 20 22 21 The dual expression sites, broad substrate range, and high variability in activity have critical clinical implications. CYP3A4-mediated metabolism can decrease the oral bioavailability of drugs through first-pass clearance, while inhibition of the enzyme may result in elevated systemic drug concentrations and potential toxicity. In contrast, enzyme induction may accelerate drug clearance, potentially leading to therapeutic failure [ 8 20 22 4. Diet-CYP3A4 Interactions: Molecular Mechanisms As discussed in previous sections, CYP3A4 plays a central role in the metabolism of xenobiotics and is primarily expressed in hepatic and intestinal tissues, where it exerts a major influence on drug disposition. This enzyme activity is modulated via induction and inhibition, both of which can significantly alter the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of co-administered medications, macro and micronutrients. 4.1. Inhibition Mechanisms Inhibition of CYP3A4 can occur through competitive, non-competitive, or mechanism-based inhibition [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 Among dietary inhibitors, GFJ remains a paradigmatic example due to its mechanism-based inactivation of intestinal CYP3A4 [ 29 30 30 31 32 33 34 35 7 35 Upon ingestion, these compounds are metabolized by CYP3A4 into reactive intermediates that bind irreversibly to the enzyme’s active site, reducing its capacity to metabolize orally administered drugs with high first-pass metabolism. Studies using Caco-2 intestinal cell models have shown that DHB and related dimers cause a dose-dependent decrease in both catalytic activity and immunoreactive CYP3A4 protein levels [ 18 This inhibition occurs rapidly, reaching peak effect between 30 min and 3 h after ingestion, while recovery requires 24–72 h depending on enzyme turnover, exposure level, and individual variability [ 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 Overall, GFJ remains a high-risk dietary factor for CYP3A4-mediated interactions due to its potent, irreversible inhibitory effects, extended duration of action, and impact on numerous drug substrates. Polyphenols, including flavonoids, are ubiquitous secondary metabolites found in tea, wine, fruits, vegetables, and chocolate [ 50 Beyond citrus-derived furanocoumarins, polyphenols and flavonoids widely present in the human diet—such as quercetin, resveratrol, curcumin, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)—have also been shown to inhibit CYP3A4 via diverse and often overlapping mechanisms [ 7 14 51 52 53 Section 4.2 54 14 51 55 56 Key polyphenolic modulators include quercetin [ 57 58 59 57 60 52 61 Unlike mechanism-based inhibitors, the binding of polyphenols is reversible, and the duration of inhibition is generally short-lived, typically a few hours after post-ingestion [ 14 62 63 64 65 66 66 Structure–activity relationship studies have confirmed that specific structural features, notably hydroxylation patterns on rings A and B of the flavonoid scaffold, are essential for potent CYP3A4 inhibition. Compounds such as baicalein, scutellarein, apigenin, and amentoflavone display strong affinity for the active site, with IC50 values in the low micromolar to nanomolar range [ 51 52 Complementary computational docking simulations have revealed that the acetylation of hydroxyl groups, such as in modified resveratrol analogs, significantly reduces inhibitory potency by disrupting key hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with the enzyme’s catalytic pocket. These findings highlight the flexibility and complexity of the CYP3A4 binding domain, which can accommodate multiple ligands or binding orientations [ 53 67 Furthermore, despite there are no direct data in humans, piperine inhibits both the drug transporter P-glycoprotein and the major drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP3A4, available data indicates that dietary piperine could affect plasma concentrations of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4 substrates in humans, in particular if these drugs are administered orally [ 68 Importantly, these inhibitory effects are modulated by a range of host-specific factors, including genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A4, individual gut microbiota profiles, and dietary context, all of which shape the extent and duration of enzyme inhibition. The co-ingestion of flavonoid-rich foods or supplements with CYP3A4 substrates may thus lead to unanticipated increases in drug plasma concentrations, posing a significant risk of toxicity, particularly for agents with narrow therapeutic windows. Consequently, understanding the molecular underpinnings of dietary CYP3A4 inhibition is crucial to anticipate and mitigate food–drug interactions in clinical practice. 4.2. Induction Mechanisms Induction of CYP3A4 typically occurs via ligand-activated nuclear receptors such as the PXR and, to a lesser extent, the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and AhR [ 69 70 71 Among the most notable is St. John’s Wort ( Hypericum perforatum 72 73 74 75 76 Cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, kale, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower, contain a diverse array of phytochemicals with the potential to modulate xenobiotic metabolism. Notably, these vegetables are rich in glucosinolates, which upon hydrolysis yield indole-3-carbinol and isothiocyanates, such as sulforaphane. Indole-3-carbinol and its acid condensation product 3,3′-diindolylmethane can activate PXR, leading to transcriptional induction of CYP3A4 [ 77 78 79 80 81 Alcohol consumption represents another relevant example of dietary CYP3A4 induction. Ethanol has been shown in both in vitro and in vivo models—including CYP3A4-expressing HepG2 cells and rat liver microsomes—to increase CYP3A4 mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. In addition to enhancing the metabolism of substrates like fentanyl, ethanol appears to stabilize the enzyme by reducing its degradation, possibly through post-translational mechanisms that modulate protein turnover [ 76 82 Beyond these classical inducers, various botanical extracts and polyphenol-rich supplements have demonstrated the ability to modulate CYP3A4 expression. In primary human hepatocytes, extracts such as kava-kava, grapeseed, and silymarin induced CYP3A4 mRNA levels, although only kava-kava activated PXR-dependent luciferase expression, indicating a direct genomic mechanism. In contrast, quercetin increased CYP3A4 transcription but failed to activate PXR in reporter systems (see Section 4.1 83 In addition to PXR, the VDR contributes significantly to CYP3A4 transcriptional regulation. Its active ligand, 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 2 3 81 83 84 Moreover, essential oils (EOs) from common culinary herbs such as oregano, rosemary, and thyme have been shown to induce CYP3A4 expression via PXR activation in both intestinal and hepatic human models. The absence of this effect in PXR-knockout cells confirms that EO-mediated CYP3A4 induction is strictly PXR-dependent, indicating that everyday food seasonings may influence drug metabolism through sustained receptor activation [ 85 Experimental data from animal models have also highlighted the role of endogenous dietary components such as bile acids and sterols. In humanized CYP3A4 transgenic mice, diets enriched in cholesterol and cholic acid upregulated hepatic CYP3A4 expression and accelerated triazolam clearance. These findings suggest a modulatory effect via PXR or FXR activation, particularly relevant in metabolic disease contexts [ 86 Among functional foods, Coleus forskohlii 87 Finally, preclinical studies using rat liver microsomes have demonstrated that extracts of hibiscus and Tradescantia zebrina 88 In summary, dietary and botanical induction of CYP3A4 involves a complex network of nuclear receptor activation, mRNA transcription, post-transcriptional stabilization, and protein protection mechanisms. Given that CYP3A4 is responsible for the metabolism of over 50% of clinically used drugs, its upregulation can lead to subtherapeutic plasma concentrations, reduced efficacy, or shortened drug half-lives. Therefore, clinical awareness of CYP3A4 inducers, especially from herbal supplements and functional foods, is essential to prevent therapeutic failure in polymedicated patients. 4.3. Epigenetic and Microbiota Modulation 4.3.1. Epigenetic Regulation of CYP3A4 As mentioned earlier, CYP3A4 is the most abundant and pharmacologically relevant cytochrome P450 enzyme in humans, regulated by genetic, epigenetic, and environmental inputs [ 84 89 14 84 89 Specifically, bioactive compounds like polyphenols, vitamins, and methyl-donor nutrients have been shown to act at these regulatory layers. Some polyphenols, such as quercetin, can modulate CYP3A4 expression through epigenetic mechanisms (see Section 4.1 3 Section 4.2 90 91 91 Importantly, such epigenetic regulation may contribute to the marked interindividual variability in drug metabolism, as DNA methylation patterns, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs dynamically modulate CYP3A4 expression in a tissue- and context-specific manner [ 92 93 94 91 Beyond DNA methylation, histone modifications also play a pivotal role. For example, butyrate—a short-chain fatty acid produced by gut microbiota during fiber fermentation—acts as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, increasing histone acetylation and thus promoting a more open chromatin structure that can enhance xenobiotic metabolism, potentially including CYP3A4 [ 95 96 97 Finally, miRNAs add yet another regulatory layer by binding to the 3′ untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of target mRNAs, leading to degradation or translational repression. Evidence indicates that dietary polyphenols, vitamins, and methyl donors can modulate miRNA transcription, processing, and maturation [ 98 99 100 101 4.3.2. Microbiota-Derived Epigenetic Modulators The gut microbiota, through its metabolic activity and structural components, exerts a significant influence on host gene expression, including the regulation of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes such as CYP3A4 [ 83 102 One key example is the short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate, produced by taxa such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii Roseburia Section 4.3.1 83 In addition to SCFAs, other microbial metabolites such as indoles (from tryptophan metabolism), phenolic acids, and secondary bile acids have also been implicated in the epigenetic modulation of host gene expression. These compounds can interact with nuclear receptors such as the PXR and the AhR. For instance, the microbial metabolite indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) has been shown to activate AhR, leading to downstream transcriptional effects that may contribute—directly or indirectly—to epigenetic remodeling and CYP3A4 expression [ 14 The gut microbiota also influences host DNA methylation through its role in methyl-donor metabolism. Bacterial production of folate, choline, and vitamin B12 contributes to the host’s one-carbon cycle, affecting intracellular levels of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor for DNA and histone methylation reactions. Perturbations in microbial composition—such as those induced by diet, antibiotics, or disease—can alter these metabolic fluxes, ultimately impacting gene-specific methylation profiles, including those of CYP genes [ 102 Additionally, microbial activity can influence host miRNA networks. Certain strains and metabolites modulate miRNA transcription or processing, including miR-27b, which targets PXR mRNA and thus indirectly regulates CYP3A4 expression [ 90 100 The interplay between microbiota and epigenetic regulation is further supported by studies demonstrating interindividual variability in CYP3A4 expression, which may be partially attributed to differences in microbial composition and metabolite profiles. These findings highlight the potential of the gut microbiota to shape drug metabolism through nutrient-sensitive, epigenetically mediated pathways, although more mechanistic studies are needed to define these interactions in humans [ 103 5. Dietary and Pharmacological Modulators of CYP3A4: Clinical Relevance for Statins and Antidiabetic Drugs 5.1. Lipid-Lowering Drugs and CYP3A4 Lipid-Lowering Drugs and CYP3A4 Lipid-lowering drugs, particularly statins, are widely prescribed to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and prevent cardiovascular diseases. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase—the rate-limiting enzyme in hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis—thereby lowering intracellular cholesterol levels and promoting LDL receptor expression [ 104 Most statins are substrates of CYP3A4, making them vulnerable to pharmacokinetic interactions with substances that inhibit or induce this enzyme. Inhibition of CYP3A4 can elevate plasma statin concentrations, heightening the risk of adverse effects such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, particularly for statins with low oral bioavailability. Conversely, enzyme induction may reduce drug efficacy. Extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver and intestine contributes to this low bioavailability. Statins are mainly eliminated via biliary excretion, with minimal renal involvement [ 20 105 5.1.1. Simvastatin Simvastatin is a lipophilic statin administered as an inactive lactone prodrug. Once absorbed, it is hydrolyzed in the liver to simvastatin acid, its active β-hydroxyacid form, which inhibits HMG-CoA reductase and enhances LDL clearance [ 106 CYP3A4 plays a predominant role in the metabolism of simvastatin, acting in both hepatic and intestinal tissues. It catalyzes oxidative conversion of the lactone ring into inactive metabolites, limiting the bioavailability of the drug to less than 5% [ 106 107 106 107 Following administration, simvastatin acid reaches peak plasma concentrations within 1.3 to 2.4 h. The compound exhibits high plasma protein binding (>95%) and is mainly eliminated in bile, with under 13% excreted in urine. Its terminal half-life is approximately 1.9 h [ 106 106 Efforts to enhance simvastatin’s bioavailability have focused on modified-release formulations that deliver the drug to distal intestinal regions with reduced CYP3A4 expression. One study demonstrated a threefold increase in systemic exposure when simvastatin was released in such areas [ 107 5.1.2. Atorvastatin Atorvastatin is a lipophilic statin administered in its active hydroxyacid form. It competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, reducing intracellular cholesterol levels and stimulating LDL receptor expression, which facilitates the clearance of LDL cholesterol from circulation [ 108 This statin undergoes extensive metabolism via cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), both in the liver and the intestinal mucosa. CYP3A4 converts atorvastatin into active ortho- and para-hydroxylated metabolites, as well as into inactive lactone derivatives. The lactone form has a higher affinity for CYP3A4. This metabolic profile makes atorvastatin vulnerable to interactions with CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as itraconazole, ritonavir, and GFJ, potentially raising systemic drug levels and the risk of adverse effects like myopathy or rhabdomyolysis [ 109 First-pass metabolism by enterocytes and hepatocytes reduces its oral bioavailability to approximately 14% [ 110 108 Atorvastatin exhibits high plasma protein binding (95–98%) [ 111 112 108 Advanced drug delivery systems, such as dry emulsions, co-amorphous formulations, and microencapsulation, have been developed to enhance oral absorption by improving solubility and reducing the impact of intestinal metabolism [ 113 5.1.3. Lovastatin Lovastatin is a lipophilic statin and a lactone prodrug. After oral administration, it is hydrolyzed in the liver to form lovastatin acid, the active β-hydroxyacid that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase and promotes LDL receptor expression, increasing LDL clearance from the plasma [ 114 CYP3A4 is primarily responsible for lovastatin’s oxidative metabolism, especially in the intestinal epithelium. This extensive first-pass effect contributes to its low systemic bioavailability, which is less than 5% [ 115 20 114 Pharmacokinetically, lovastatin is characterized by a high degree of plasma protein binding (>95%). Peak plasma concentrations of lovastatin acid are reached between 2 and 4 h after dosing. The compound is primarily excreted through the biliary route, with renal elimination accounting for less than 10% of its clearance. Its terminal half-life is approximately 3 h; however, its lipid-lowering effects endure longer due to persistent inhibition of its enzymatic target [ 114 115 Lovastatin does not significantly modulate the activity of other CYP isoforms, which limits the potential for broad pharmacokinetic interactions. To address its low oral bioavailability and improve clinical performance, novel formulation strategies such as solid lipid nanoparticles and self-emulsifying drug delivery systems have been explored. These technologies aim to enhance solubility and reduce the extent of intestinal metabolism, thereby improving systemic exposure [ 116 5.1.4. Cerivastatin Cerivastatin is a synthetic and enantiomerically pure statin administered in its active acid form. It possesses exceptionally high potency as an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, with a Ki of approximately 1.3 nM, allowing therapeutic efficacy at microgram-level doses [ 117 118 Cerivastatin is eliminated exclusively through metabolic pathways, with no excretion of the parent drug in its unchanged form. Two main oxidative biotransformation pathways are involved: (1) demethylation of the benzylic methyl ether group to form metabolite M-1, catalyzed by CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, and (2) stereoselective hydroxylation of the 6-isopropyl moiety to produce metabolite M-23, primarily catalyzed by CYP2C8 [ 118 119 117 The existence of dual metabolic routes offers some protective redundancy against CYP-mediated inhibition. If one pathway is blocked, the alternative route may partially compensate. Nevertheless, co-administration with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors such as gemfibrozil has been shown to markedly elevate cerivastatin and metabolite levels. This pharmacokinetic interaction significantly increases the risk of serious adverse outcomes, including rhabdomyolysis, which ultimately led to the drug’s withdrawal from the market in several countries [ 120 121 5.2. Antidiabetic Drugs and CYP3A4 The relevance of CYP3A4 in the pharmacokinetics of antidiabetic agents lies in its susceptibility to both inhibition and induction, processes that can dramatically alter the plasma concentrations and therapeutic efficacy of these drugs [ 122 123 124 125 Several oral antidiabetic agents are known to be substrates of CYP3A4. These include troglitazone [ 5 126 127 128 129 130 3 131 130 132 The modulation of CYP3A4 by co-administered drugs or dietary constituents may lead to clinically relevant pharmacokinetic alterations [ 14 15 133 134 135 136 137 Understanding the role of CYP3A4 in the metabolism of antidiabetic drugs is essential for preventing drug interactions and ensuring therapeutic efficacy. This is especially critical in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, elderly populations, or those with polypharmacy [ 138 139 140 5.2.1. Repaglinide Repaglinide is an oral insulin secretagogue of the meglitinide class, used primarily for the management of postprandial hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is particularly indicated in individuals with irregular meal patterns due to its rapid onset and short duration of action [ 141 Mechanistically, repaglinide stimulates insulin secretion by binding to and inhibiting ATP-sensitive potassium channels on the pancreatic β-cell membrane [ 142 143 144 Pharmacokinetically, repaglinide is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak plasma concentrations within one hour, and has a plasma half-life of approximately 1–1.5 h [ 144 145 130 146 CYP2C8 is the dominant enzyme responsible for the formation of the active metabolite M4, while CYP3A4 predominantly generates M1 and other minor metabolites [ 130 147 148 On the other hand, CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin can significantly reduce repaglinide plasma levels. In a controlled study, administration of rifampicin 24 h before repaglinide significantly reduced its AUC by approximately 80%, which may lead to a clinically relevant decrease in its glucose-lowering efficacy [ 149 150 151 Additionally, cyclosporine, a known inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and OATP1B1, markedly increased repaglinide plasma concentrations in healthy volunteers (by 2.4-fold in AUC). This pharmacokinetic interaction was significantly modulated by SLCO1B1 polymorphisms (e.g., rs4149056), with a reduced effect observed in individuals carrying the 521TC genotype, compared to those with the 521TT reference genotype [ 151 Due to its narrow therapeutic window and risk of severe hypoglycemia, especially in elderly patients or those with renal impairment, careful consideration of repaglinide’s metabolic pathways is essential in clinical practice. 5.2.2. Nateglinide Nateglinide is another member of the meglitinide class of oral antidiabetic agents, sharing structural and mechanistic similarities with repaglinide [ 152 144 153 Pharmacokinetically, nateglinide is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, reaching peak plasma concentrations within 0.5 to 1 h [ 154 154 155 In contrast to repaglinide, which is also influenced by CYP2C8 and hepatic uptake transporters such as OATP1B1, nateglinide exhibits a more limited interaction profile [ 156 4 157 158 However, in patients with reduced CYP2C9 activity, due to polymorphisms (e.g., CYP2C9 *2/*2 or *3/*3 genotypes) or pharmacologic inhibition [ 3 158 Due to its rapid onset and short duration of action, along with glucose-dependent insulinotropic properties, nateglinide is considered a suitable option for patients in the early stages of type 2 diabetes or those with irregular mealtime patterns, offering flexibility and a reduced risk of prolonged hypoglycemia [ 159 5.2.3. Saxagliptin Saxagliptin is an oral antidiabetic agent belonging to the class of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors [ 160 160 The therapeutic mechanism of saxagliptin involves the inhibition of the enzyme DPP-4, a serine protease that rapidly inactivates incretin hormones such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) [ 160 160 Pharmacokinetically, saxagliptin is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Peak plasma concentrations are reached at approximately 4 h for saxagliptin and 2 h for its active metabolite M2 [ 160 161 162 In a recent in vitro study, Liu et al. [ 163 163 163 Clinically, saxagliptin is susceptible to pharmacokinetic interactions with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers [ 164 165 165 164 Given its reliance on CYP3A4-mediated metabolism, saxagliptin may also be affected by dietary constituents known to inhibit this enzyme, such as GFJ or certain herbal supplements. Clinical pharmacology data show that moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors like GFJ can increase saxagliptin exposure, though current guidance does not mandate dose adjustments [ 166 167 5.2.4. Canagliflozin In addition to DPP-4 inhibitors, other antidiabetic classes, such as SGLT2 inhibitors, may also be subject to CYP3A4-mediated metabolic modulation, albeit to a lesser extent. Canagliflozin is a sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor that has been approved for the management of T2DM and is increasingly recognized for its pleiotropic benefits. Its mechanism of action is independent of insulin secretion and involves inhibiting glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules, thereby increasing glucosuria and improving glycemic control [ 168 169 Canagliflozin has demonstrated cardiovascular and renal protective effects, which are thought to be mediated not only by glucose-lowering but also by additional mechanisms such as reductions in systolic blood pressure (−3.93 mmHg), body weight (−1.6 kg), and albuminuria [ 170 171 Once orally administered, canagliflozin undergoes hepatic metabolism predominantly through glucuronidation (via UGT1A9 and UGT2B4) [ 172 173 This is supported by clinical findings showing that co-administration with rifampicin reduced canagliflozin plasma concentrations by approximately 51% in overall exposure and by 28% in peak concentration, potentially compromising its glucose-lowering efficacy. Therefore, dose adjustment or closer monitoring may be warranted when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A4 inducers [ 173 In terms of elimination, canagliflozin exhibits a dual excretion pathway: approximately 60% of the administered dose is excreted in feces, primarily as unchanged drug (41.5%) due to incomplete absorption and biliary secretion of glucuronidated metabolites (M7, M5), which undergo intestinal hydrolysis back to the parent compound. Renal excretion accounts for 33% of the dose, predominantly as inactive O-glucuronide metabolites (M5: 13.3%, M7: 17.2%), with less than 1% excreted as intact canagliflozin. The drug’s low renal clearance (0.049–0.13 L/h) reflects its high plasma protein binding (98–99%) and minimal active tubular secretion [ 174 5.2.5. Pioglitazone Pioglitazone is an oral antidiabetic drug belonging to the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class. It is widely used as an insulin sensitizer in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, particularly in patients with insulin resistance and features of metabolic syndrome. Its primary mechanism of action is mediated by activation of the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), which is highly expressed in adipose tissue and, to a lesser extent, in skeletal muscle, liver, and the vasculature [ 126 Upon activation, PPARγ forms a heterodimer with the RXR and binds to specific peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes. This leads to modulation of gene transcription involved in glucose and lipid metabolism, adipogenesis, insulin signaling, and anti-inflammatory pathways. As a result, pioglitazone enhances insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues by promoting glucose uptake (primarily via increased GLUT4 translocation in skeletal muscle and adipocytes), suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis, and improves lipid profiles by reducing circulating free fatty acids and triglycerides [ 126 In terms of metabolism, pioglitazone is primarily biotransformed in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Although CYP2C8 is the main isoenzyme responsible for its clearance, CYP3A4 contributes to approximately 37% of its metabolism in vitro [ 131 131 175 131 176 175 Beyond glycemic control, pioglitazone has been shown to exert pleiotropic effects such as improvement in endothelial function, reduction in inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP, TNF-α, IL-6) [ 177 For clarity and to facilitate comparison, a concise summary of the pharmacokinetic characteristics and CYP3A4-related interactions of these agents is presented in Table 1 6. Evidence from Clinical and Preclinical Studies 6.1. Citrus Compounds and Furanocoumarins As previously detailed, GFJ is a well-established dietary inhibitor of intestinal CYP3A4. The following preclinical and clinical studies illustrate the impact of this interaction on various pharmacological agents, including statins and antidiabetic drugs. In a preclinical study in hyperlipidaemic Wistar rats, the co-administration of atorvastatin (2.5 mg/kg) with bergamottin led to a notable increase in the Cmax of atorvastatin (from 48 ± 5 to 89 ± 7 ng/mL) and a threefold elevation in AUC 0–∞ 1/2 178 Human studies have confirmed these effects. A crossover trial comparing grapefruit and pomegranate juice found that GFJ significantly increased the Cmax and AUCinf of simvastatin (15.6-fold and 9.1-fold, respectively), whereas pomegranate juice had no effect, suggesting minimal CYP3A4 inhibition by the latter [ 179 The inhibitory action of bergamottin on simvastatin metabolism has also been characterized in vitro. In rat liver microsomes, the inhibition was more pronounced following pre-incubation, especially with NADPH, indicating potential mechanism-based inhibition. The Ki values ranged from 174 ± 36 μM during co-incubation to as low as 4 ± 2 μM during NADPH-dependent pre-incubation. In contrast, in human liver microsomes, bergamottin exhibited consistent inhibitory activity across conditions, with Ki values between 22 and 34 μM. These results reflect both species differences and the importance of CYP-mediated metabolite formation in determining inhibitor potency [ 180 Furthermore, flavonoids like naringenin, also present in GFJ, demonstrated comparable inhibitory effects on simvastatin metabolism. While both bergamottin and naringenin showed mixed-type inhibition in human microsomes, naringenin had a lower Ki (29 ± 11 μM) than bergamottin (34 ± 5 μM), suggesting potent inhibition from both compound classes. Interestingly, in rat liver microsomes, the inhibitory potency of naringenin surpassed that of bergamottin, again underscoring interspecies variability [ 180 In primary rat hepatocytes, the intrinsic clearance of simvastatin decreased from 26.2 μL/min/10 6 6 181 A crossover study explored the clinical impact of GFJ on statin pharmacokinetics. It demonstrated a 2.5-fold increase in the AUC 0–72 1/2 182 This differential effect across statins was further clarified in a study comparing atorvastatin and pitavastatin. GFJ increased the AUC of atorvastatin acid by 83%, while pitavastatin acid levels rose by only 13%, suggesting that pitavastatin is minimally affected by CYP3A4-mediated metabolism [ 183 184 Importantly, long-term administration of GFJ (300 mL/day for 90 days) in patients on chronic atorvastatin treatment resulted in only modest increases in serum atorvastatin concentrations (19–26%), with no significant changes in lipid profile or markers of liver or muscle toxicity. This suggests that moderate, chronic GFJ consumption does not necessarily necessitate atorvastatin dose reduction [ 185 Further studies have delineated the time course of CYP3A4 inhibition. When simvastatin was administered with high-dose GFJ, the AUC of simvastatin increased by 13.5-fold. However, this effect diminished over time; simvastatin given 24 h later showed only a 2.1-fold increase, and after 3–7 days, no significant differences were observed compared to control, indicating a reversible and transient inhibition of CYP3A4 [ 36 In the context of transporter-mediated interactions, GFJ also inhibits intestinal uptake transporters such as OATP2B1 and OATP1A2. A knockout mouse model for OATP2B1 revealed that fexofenadine absorption decreased significantly following GFJ ingestion, but not for rosuvastatin, demonstrating substrate specificity [ 186 187 Aliskiren, an antihypertensive renin inhibitor, is another example where GFJ reduced systemic exposure by 38–61%. The mechanism was traced to OATP1A2 inhibition by naringin, a major flavonoid in GFJ, rather than OATP2B1, as shown in HEK293 cell assays [ 188 189 Lastly, while lovastatin is also metabolized via CYP3A4, the interaction magnitude appears more moderate. In healthy subjects, regular-strength GFJ approximately doubled the AUC and Cmax of lovastatin, with a 1.6-fold increase in lovastatin acid. However, the increase in HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity was only around 30–40%, suggesting that GFJ’s effect on this statin may be clinically less significant than with simvastatin or atorvastatin [ 190 A comparable interaction pattern has also been observed with certain antidiabetic agents, particularly those with a high dependence on intestinal CYP3A4 for metabolic clearance. One of the clearest examples of CYP3A4-mediated interaction is found in repaglinide, a short-acting meglitinide analog used to control postprandial glycemia. Repaglinide is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, and its intestinal metabolism appears particularly susceptible to inhibition by GFJ. In a randomized, crossover clinical trial, a single dose of GFJ (300 mL) increased the AUC 0–∞ 191 A similar interaction has been observed with glibenclamide (glyburide), although its metabolism primarily involves CYP2C9 rather than CYP3A4. In a study comparing the effects of clarithromycin and GFJ, only clarithromycin—a known P-glycoprotein inhibitor—significantly increased the AUC of glibenclamide by 35%. In contrast, GFJ had no significant effect on glibenclamide plasma concentrations, supporting the conclusion that glibenclamide is not substantially metabolized by CYP3A4, and that GFJ does not interfere with its pharmacokinetics through this pathway [ 192 Interestingly, the effect of GFJ on metformin, a drug that is not metabolized by CYP enzymes but whose distribution depends on organic cation transporters, reveals indirect but clinically important interactions. In a rat model, GFJ significantly increased hepatic concentrations of metformin (397 ± 19 µg/g vs. 280 ± 15 µg/g in controls), while plasma levels remained unchanged. Although not mediated by CYP3A4, this accumulation was associated with a marked increase in blood lactic acid levels, especially when GFJ was combined with metformin (8.31 ± 3.48 mmol/L), suggesting that dietary modulation may still exacerbate adverse effects by altering drug distribution and clearance in the liver [ 193 Beyond GFJ, other citrus bioactives may also impact CYP3A4 activity. Narirutin, a flavanone found abundantly in oranges and related citrus species, has been evaluated through in silico and in vitro models for its capacity to interact with multiple diabetes-related targets. While its main actions are directed toward inhibiting α-glucosidase and α-amylase, molecular docking studies suggest that narirutin may also bind to CYP3A4, raising the possibility of a competitive inhibitory effect similar to that of other citrus flavonoids such as naringenin [ 194 Furthermore, Eriomin ® 195 A broader pharmacokinetic study including glibenclamide under microdosing conditions also demonstrated that GFJ significantly reduced systemic exposure to several orally administered substrates, particularly those dependent on intestinal absorption and CYP3A4 metabolism. While atorvastatin (a known OATP2B1 inhibitor) had no such effect, GFJ decreased glibenclamide exposure more markedly, suggesting that citrus compounds may influence multiple absorption pathways, with CYP3A4 inhibition playing a central role [ 187 Taken together, the current evidence strongly supports that dietary modulation of CYP3A4 by citrus constituents can significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of certain antidiabetic drugs, especially those with high intestinal metabolism such as repaglinide. While other drugs like glibenclamide and metformin are less directly affected, their pharmacological profiles may still be modulated indirectly by citrus-induced changes in hepatic or transporter-mediated disposition. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating dietary habits, particularly citrus product consumption, when prescribing CYP3A4-metabolized antidiabetic agents, to avoid undesired elevations in drug exposure or compromised glycemic control. 6.2. Polyphenols and Flavonoids As previously described in Section 4 196 In vitro studies have demonstrated that specific flavonoids, such as chrysin, quercetin, kaempferol, and leachianone A, can act as CYP3A4 inhibitors, reducing enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner [ 197 198 In addition to structural considerations, flavonoid-mediated inhibition may differ depending on the experimental model. While previous sections have highlighted the inhibitory role of grapefruit flavonoids such as bergamottin and naringenin in human and rat microsomes (see Section 6.1 181 Beyond inhibition, polyphenols may also influence CYP3A4 gene expression. Preclinical animal models have demonstrated that polyphenol-rich diets can alter CYP3A4 activity in hepatic and intestinal tissues, leading to changes in drug metabolism [ 196 199 200 Clinical studies, although more limited, have begun to explore the relevance of these findings in humans. The most notable example is the GFJ effect, where flavonoids such as naringenin and bergamottin inhibit intestinal CYP3A4, leading to increased plasma concentrations of drugs like simvastatin and felodipine [ 201 202 Overall, both preclinical and clinical evidence support the notion that polyphenolic flavonoids can modulate CYP3A4 activity, with implications for drug metabolism, efficacy, and safety. These findings underscore the importance of considering dietary habits and supplement use in pharmacokinetic assessments and personalized medicine strategies. 6.3. Herbal Supplements 6.3.1. St. John’s Wort Among the most well-characterized herbal modulators of CYP450 enzymes, Hypericum perforatum 73 73 72 203 Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that administration of standardized SJW extracts for 10–14 days significantly reduces the systemic exposure of several CYP3A4 substrates, including midazolam, simvastatin, and cyclosporine, with AUC decreases often exceeding 50% [ 204 205 206 207 The induction of CYP3A4 and other drug-metabolizing enzymes or transporters by SJW is both dose- and time-dependent. In vitro studies show that higher concentrations and longer exposure to H. perforatum 208 208 209 208 210 209 The clinical implications are particularly relevant for commonly prescribed drugs such as statins and pioglitazone. A 14-day regimen of SJW reduced simvastatin AUC by over 50%, potentially compromising its lipid-lowering effect [ 10 205 10 211 212 72 205 The extent of CYP3A4 induction by H. perforatum 213 214 215 72 214 215 216 217 H. perforatum 218 In summary, there is robust evidence that SJW, through hyperforin-mediated PXR activation, is a strong and sustained inducer of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. Its widespread use, frequent non-disclosure by patients, and capacity to lower systemic drug concentrations necessitate vigilance by healthcare professionals. Standardized preparations at therapeutic doses are sufficient to trigger relevant interactions, especially with narrow-therapeutic-window medications. For these reasons, SJW is contraindicated in numerous clinical guidelines for patients receiving essential pharmacotherapies [ 206 219 220 6.3.2. Schisandra chinensis Schisandra chinensis 221 Some lignans in S. chinensis 221 In contrast, several lignans demonstrate potent direct inhibition of CYP3A4 catalytic activity. For instance, gomisin C and gomisin G significantly inhibited midazolam 1′-hydroxylation, nifedipine oxidation, and testosterone 6β-hydroxylation in recombinant human enzyme systems, with estimated increases in drug exposure (AUC) ranging from 8% to over 3000% in predictive models [ 222 Further supporting this inhibitory profile, gomisin A was shown to cause time-dependent inactivation of CYP3A4, attributed to the formation of reactive carbene metabolites that covalently bind to the enzyme’s active site. This mechanism-based inhibition was demonstrated in microsomal systems using glutathione as a trapping agent, confirming irreversible enzyme modification [ 223 50 224 In vivo studies in rats have further illustrated this duality. Both unprocessed and vinegar-processed S. chinensis 225 Altogether, Schisandra chinensis 6.3.3. Ginkgo biloba Ginkgo biloba 226 Some clinical studies have demonstrated that GBE can exert inductive effects on CYP3A4. In a randomized open-label trial, Robertson et al. [ 227 In contrast, other studies have reported opposing effects, raising doubts about the consistency of CYP3A4 induction by GBE. In a 28-day study using a higher daily dose of GBE (360 mg/day), Uchida et al. [ 228 These conflicting results underscore the complex pharmacokinetic behavior of GBE, which appears to exhibit bidirectional effects on CYP3A4, possibly through the simultaneous presence of flavonoids and terpene lactones that have opposite activities in vitro. This mechanistic explanation is supported by Wang et al. [ 136 Supporting this view, Unger [ 226 More recently, Zadoyan et al. [ 229 In conclusion, while Ginkgo biloba extract has the potential to modulate CYP3A4 activity, the clinical significance of such interactions appears limited when using standardized preparations at recommended doses. However, caution may still be warranted in certain scenarios: for instance, in patients receiving drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, or when GBE is used at high doses or in non-standardized formulations. Moreover, given the inconsistent results across studies, further research is needed to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying GBE’s dual action on CYP3A4 and to determine whether genetic polymorphisms or specific patient populations may be more susceptible to its effects. 6.3.4. Ginseng Among the wide array of herbal products commonly used in traditional medicine and dietary supplements, Panax ginseng In the case of Panax ginseng 230 231 However, this apparent inductive potential does not consistently translate to in vivo or clinical settings. Contradictory evidence from animal studies suggests that Panax ginseng P. ginseng 232 Clinical studies further complicate the picture. Anderson et al. [ 233 Panax ginseng Moreover, the direction and magnitude of CYP3A4 modulation by ginseng may be influenced by multiple variables, including the specific type and concentration of extract, duration of administration, interindividual genetic differences in PXR or CAR expression, and the presence of co-administered substances. For instance, some studies suggest that the CAR, which shares overlapping regulatory functions with PXR, can antagonize PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction in the presence of ginsenosides, further modulating the final enzymatic response [ 234 Taken together, while mechanistic and preclinical evidence indicates that Panax ginseng Panax ginseng For clarity and ease of comparison, Table 2 7. Clinical Implications and Practical Recommendations Derived from CYP3A4 Genetic Variability Genetic polymorphisms in the CYP3A4 enzyme substantially contribute to interindividual variability in the metabolism of numerous drugs, particularly statins and oral antidiabetic agents. Given its role as one of the most active isoforms within the cytochrome P450 family, CYP3A4 is central to the biotransformation of a wide range of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. Its activity is modulated not only by environmental factors, such as dietary inhibitors (e.g., GFJ, myricetin) or inducers (e.g., rifampicin), but also by specific genetic variants that alter expression levels or enzymatic function [ 235 236 Moreover, from a clinical perspective, identifying and understanding these polymorphisms is critical. Among the most clinically relevant alleles, CYP3A4 1B 1G 4 CYP3A4 237 CYP3A4 238 CYP3A4 CYP3A5 These findings support the recommendation that clinicians consider pharmacogenetic testing, particularly of the CYP3A4 238 239 In East Asian populations, the CYP3A4 240 241 242 Dietary habits may further modulate these genetic effects. In individuals with reduced-function CYP3A4 alleles, ingestion of inhibitors such as GFJ can amplify the risk of drug toxicity by further reducing metabolic capacity [ 243 244 93 245 Beyond individual-level variability, population-level differences in allele frequency must also be considered in practice. Elalem et al. and Gao et al. [ 238 240 246 246 In Latin American populations, Alvarado et al. [ 247 CYP3A4 SLCO1B1 248 249 In the context of type 2 diabetes, Sivadas et al. [ 250 CYP3A4 CYP3A5 251 While these findings are promising, however, it is important to note that not all studies report strong associations between CYP3A4 genotypes and clinical outcomes. Some investigations have shown minimal or inconsistent effects, likely due to the influence of other genes (e.g., SLCO1B1 CYP3A5 252 253 252 253 In line with the genetic variability discussed in Section 4.3.1 Section 4.3.2 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 In conclusion, there is substantial evidence supporting the clinical utility of CYP3A4 genotyping, particularly for alleles 22 1B 1G 4 8. Conclusions The evidence reviewed highlights that dietary modulation of CYP3A4 is a complex, multifactorial process with important clinical implications for the safety and efficacy of commonly prescribed statins and antidiabetic drugs. A wide range of dietary constituents, including citrus furanocoumarins, polyphenols, vitamins, and herbal extracts, can inhibit or induce CYP3A4 activity through mechanisms involving direct enzyme interaction, nuclear receptor activation, and epigenetic regulation. These effects are further modulated by genetic polymorphisms, interindividual microbiota profiles, and the nutritional context in which these compounds are consumed. Such variability contributes to unpredictable changes in drug bioavailability, especially for drugs with a narrow therapeutic window or high first-pass metabolism. Importantly, while some food–drug interactions are well recognized (e.g., GFJ), others remain underappreciated in clinical practice despite growing mechanistic and experimental evidence. Given the increasing use of polypharmacy and dietary supplements, a more proactive approach is warranted to identify patients at risk and to implement preventive strategies. This may include patient education, careful drug selection, and closer monitoring when initiating or discontinuing CYP3A4-modulating dietary components. Future studies should prioritize integrated models that account for genetics, diet, microbiome, and lifestyle factors to support personalized drug therapy and minimize adverse interactions. Ultimately, bridging pharmacokinetics with nutrition science may offer new opportunities for precision medicine in chronic disease management.
