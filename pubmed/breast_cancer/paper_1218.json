Introduction KMT2D 1 2 Kmt2d 3 4 5 6 7 Rare mono-allelic KMT2D 8 9 KDM6A 10 11 12 Animal and cellular models for KS1 have provided valuable insights into the disease mechanisms [ 7 13 14 Kmt2d 6 Kmt2d +/βGeo 7 KMT2D 15 KMT2D 16 17 KMT2D Here, we track the epigenomic and transcriptional panorama across three stages of neuronal differentiation using patient-derived iPSCs to gain insights into disease mechanism of KS1. We show that in iPSCs, KS1 causing variants result in loss of KMT2D function and alter the H3K4me1 and transcriptional landscapes in a correlated manner. We show that epigenomic differences between KS1 and control cells increase with differentiation progression, but the transcriptional changes become less abundant. Our analysis also reveals a set of potential transcriptional regulators and their cis Results KS1 causing variants result in loss of KMT2D IPSCs were generated either from fibroblasts in the HipSci program ( www.hipsci.org/#/cells NM_003482.4 KMT2D Fig 1A S1 Table 10.1371/journal.pgen.1011608.g001 Fig 1 Analysis of KMT2D expression in KS1 iPSCs. A) Schematic representation of KMT2D KMT2D KMT2D n n n Firstly, to investigate the effect of KS1 variants at the pluripotent stem cell stage, we accessed iPSC RNAseq datasets of 53 control lines and 7 KS1 lines (4 replicates with the missense variant, 2 with the nonsense variant and one with the frameshift variant) generated by the HipSci consortium and our lab ( S1 Fig S1 S2 Tables KMT2D 8 KMT2D KMT2D KMT2D Figs 1B S2A KMT2D KMT2D Figs 1B S2B – S2C KMT2D Fig 1B Fig 1B Fig 1B Next, we performed Western blotting on nuclear protein extracts from iPSCs, which revealed a significant decrease in KMT2D protein level in nuclei of all KS1 iPSCs, including the ones with the missense variant, compared to control iPSCs ( Figs 1C S3A Figs 1D S3B – S3D https://depmap.org/portal/ KMT2D KMT2D S4 Fig KMT2D KMT2D Next, we evaluated if loss of KMT2D function led to any changes in the molecular pluripotency state of KS1 iPSCs. In the merged RNAseq dataset, we did not find significant differences in the expression of key genes related to pluripotency in KS1 iPSCs compared to control iPSCs ( Fig 1E S5 Fig Overall, these data show that KS1-causing heterozygous KMT2D KMT2D H3K4me1 landscape is dysregulated in KS1 iPSCs KMT2D is a major H3K4 mono-methyltransferase essential for enhancer activation during cell differentiation [ 1 3 Fig 1D 2 Fig 2A 2C -16 Figs 2C S6 A S7 10.1371/journal.pgen.1011608.g002 Fig 2 Loss of H3K4me1 in KS1 iPSCs. A) B) C) D) To identify transcription factor binding sites predicted to be affected by changes in H3K4me1 levels, we performed motif analysis on significantly differentially methylated peak sites. This showed these sites to be associated with motifs predicted to be binding sites for Zinc Finger (ZNF) transcription factors family members, as well as the transcription factor WT1 ( Fig 2D S6 B S6C Fig Fig 2D Overall, these data show significant dysregulation of the H3K4me1 landscape in KS1 iPSCs, especially in the enhancer regions. The transcriptome is altered in KS1 iPSCs and is correlated with the H3K4me1 landscape Altered H3K4me1 landscape is predicted to result in changes in the transcriptome. We, therefore, performed RNAseq on control iPSCs and KS1 iPSC harbouring missense mutation in KMT2D S8A Fig Fig 3A Fig 3B TBX2, TWIST1, GBX2, MEF2C ANGPT2, GREM1 AJAP1, GDF7 POU3F2, NTRK2 TNNC2 ACTA1 TULP1 AIPL1 CRYBB1 Fig 3A TSHZ1 BMP5 GDF7 CNTN6 DIO3 NTRK2 PAX5 KDR SNAI2 PITX2 Fig 3B 10.1371/journal.pgen.1011608.g003 Fig 3 Correlation between changes in transcripts and H3K4me1 in KS1 iPSCs. A) B) C) D) Next, we performed transcription regulator enrichment analysis on DEGs. This revealed the upregulated DEGs (adjusted p-value < 0.05) being over-represented by regions of DNA associated with SUZ12 recruitment, a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) ( S3 Table Downregulation of several genes within a 110 Kb region on chromosome 19 was previously reported in KS1 iPSCs suggesting locus-specific targeting of KMT2D [ 16 Figs 3C S8C 16 Next, we asked if there was correlation between the altered H3K4me1 signals and gene expression in our cell model. For this, we analysed expression of genes within ±100kb of differentially lost H3K4me1 regions. We found several regions of the genome with clusters of reduced H3K4me1 peaks and downregulated genes with significant enrichment of downregulated DEGs on chromosome 1, 16, 17 (hypergeometric test, FDR < 0.0001) ( Figs 3C S8C Fig 3D S4 Table S8D Fig Overall, these data show that at the stem cell stage there are significant changes in expression of genes related to the KS1 phenotype, with SUZ12 as top regulatory factor among the upregulated genes. The neuronal progenitor and neural epigenomes are altered in KS1 Having shown the epigenomic changes at the stem cells stage, we asked if similar changes could also be present in differentiating cells. Learning difficulties are seen in 95% individuals and epilepsy is present in 25% individuals affected by KS [ 9 18 19 KMT2D 20 S9A Fig Figs 4A S10A - + + - - + Fig 4A PAX6 FOXG1, SOX2, NES OTX2 TBR1, MAP2 GRIA2 Fig 4B 10.1371/journal.pgen.1011608.g004 Fig 4 Loss of H3K4me1 in KS1 neural progenitors and neurons. A) B) C-D) E-F) E F G-H) I) We performed H3K4me1 ChIPseq on sorted neural progenitors and neuronal cells. In neural progenitors, we detected 22,975 differentially methylated sites (FDR < 0.05; -1 > Log2FC>1). Of these, 15,452 (67.2%) sites showed loss and 7,523 showed gain in H3K4me1 in KS1 cells ( Figs 4C 4E S10 Figs 4D 4F S11 Figs 4E 4F S9B – S9 C S10B – S10C Motif analysis on neural progenitors revealed that the sites where H3K4me1 was lost in KS1 cells were predicted to be targets for ZNF family transcription factors as well as OTX, RARG and RFX5 while sites where H3K4me1 was gained were predicted to be targets for IKZF1, KLF4, FOXO6 and TFAP2C ( Fig 4G S9D Fig Fig 4H S10 D S10E Fig Next, we compared the significantly differentially methylated peaks across the three stages of neuronal differentiation. We identified 88 H3K4me1 regions (74 losses and 14 gains) that were affected across all stages in the KS1 lines ( Fig 4I Fig 4I Overall, in our KS1 model we witness increasing dysregulation of the H3K4me1 landscape with advancing differentiation from iPSCs to neurons. The transcriptome is altered in KS1 neural progenitors and neurons Finally, we investigated the transcriptome of KS1 neural progenitors and neurons by RNAseq ( S8B Fig Fig 5A Fig 5C FEZ1 VANGL2 CDK10 DNALI1 AJAP1, IRX2 TBX1, EN2 PAX8 AMH INPP5F SOX8 SLC7A11 NTNG2 Fig 5B Fig 5B TBX1 NGFR, EMX1 HOXB2 HOXB3 BARX1 SOX10 TBX1 Fig 5D 10.1371/journal.pgen.1011608.g005 Fig 5 Changes in the transcriptome in KS1 neural progenitors and neurons and comparison of transcriptomic and epigenomic changes during neuronal differentiation. A-B) C-D) E) F) Transcription factor enrichment analysis revealed SUZ12 as top regulatory factor for upregulated DEGs in neural progenitors (adjusted p-value < 0.05) ( S3 Table S11 S12 Figs Furthermore, we assessed positional correlation between altered H3K4me1 peaks and DEGs. In neural progenitors and neurons, we found statistically significant association between upregulated DEGs and H3K4me1 gain at distances 5kb to 100kb between the H3K4me1 peak and gene TSS (hypergeometric test; p-value < 0.05) ( S4 Table S4 Table S13A Fig S13B Fig Next, to analyse which changes in the transcriptome were in common at all three stages of neuronal differentiation, we compared DEGs between the three differentiation stages. Interestingly, we observed 50 significant DEGs (13 down- and 37 upregulated) in common across all three stages ( Fig 5E To identify possible direct associations between H3K4me1 loss and downregulated genes across multiple stages of iPSC/differentiation in our model, we extracted genes, which are downregulated and have transcription start sites within ±100kb of H3K4me1 loss. We identified 30 such genes in common between iPSC and neural progenitor stages, of which 4 ( CNTN4 NOVA2 GAS8 TRIM46 Fig 5F Overall, in our KS1 model we witness a decrease in the number of DEGs with advancing neuronal differentiation. The altered KS1 transcriptome is consistent Most of our neuronal differentiation work was based on a single missense mutant and we observed the biggest differences in the Day 0 (iPSC) and Day 18 (Progenitor) transcriptomes ( Fig 5E Fig 6A 6C 6E Figs 3A 5A 5B S1 Table Fig 6A 6C 6E Fig 6B S5 Table S3 Table 10.1371/journal.pgen.1011608.g006 Fig 6 Validation of the transcriptome in KS1 neural progenitors and neurons. Comparison of Log2FC of DEGs from the original dataset and validation dataset (KS1 iPSC 1, iPSC 2, iPSC 3 compared to Ctrl 1, Ctrl 2, Ctrl 3) at iPSC (Day 0) ( A C E B D F Overall, these results confirm our findings in additional cell lines harbouring distinct KMT2D Discussion Although the underlying disease mechanism of KS1 has been examined previously [ 7 15 16 Firstly, haploinsufficiency has been the proposed mechanism for nonsense or frameshift variants in KS1, but it has not been previously proven. We observed ALT:REF read ratios for KMT2D Fig 1B 21 Fig 1C 22 7 1 3 Fig 1D 14 Our experiments also show dysregulation of H3K4me1 and transcriptome landscapes in KS1 iPSCs, neural progenitors and neurons harbouring pathogenic missense variant (p.(Arg5340Gln)) ( Figs 2 5 1 2 trans The analysis of transcription factor binding sites in our ChIPseq dataset revealed several transcription factors that may be important in KS1 pathology ( Figs 2 4 23 24 WT1 25 26 RFX5 27 28 29 30 -/- 28 31 32 33 In our RNAseq datasets, we detected several DEGs important in lineage commitment and neuronal differentiation ( Figs 3 5 PAX8, 34 PAX5, 35 S9E Fig Our data also suggested SUZ12 to be a master regulator of many of the upregulated DEGs in our datasets ( S3 Table 36 In conclusion, these results establish missense KMT2D KMT2D Fig 6 Materials and methods Ethics statement Control iPSC (wigw2 - Ctrl 1) and KS1 iPSCs (ierp4 - iPSC 3, aask4 - iPSC 1, oadp4 - iPSC 2) were generated by HipSci ( https://www.hipsci.org/#/cohorts/kabuki-syndrome Control iPSCs (JF191b [ 37 38 Formal verbal and written consents were obtained from adults and from the parents of children.

Cells were blocked in PBS-5%FBS for 30 minutes and incubated with cell surface antibodies, CD44-PE (561858), CD24-FITC (560992) and CD184-APC (560936) for 30 minutes at 4°C. After staining, cells were washed in PBS-5%FBS and filtered through a 0.22 µm filter before sorting and acquisition. All antibodies used for staining were purchased from BD Bioscience. Cells used for RNAseq and ChIPseq were sorted for CD44 - + + - + - Immunofluorescence staining Cells grown in 12-well plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature. Samples were permeabilised with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature. Then blocking solution (1% BSA in PBS) was applied for 10 minutes at room temperature. Blocking solution was removed and an antibody recognising one of NANOG, OCT4, or SOX2 (4903S, 2890S, 3579S, Life Technologies) was applied overnight at 4°C. After washing three times with PBS, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (A11008, Invitrogen) for 45 minutes at room temperature in the dark. After washing three times with PBS, samples were stained with DAPI (4083S, Cell signalling technology) for 5 minutes. Finally, samples were washed with PBS. Pictures were taken using an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus U-LH100HG) and cellSens software. Images are representative of three independent experiments. Western blot Nuclear protein samples were isolated from iPSCs using NE-NERT Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat#: XJ355181). Then protein samples were quantified using BCA protein assay kit- reducing agent compatible (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat#: 23250). Electrophoresis was carried out using 10% Bis-Tris Gels and NuPAGE MES SDS Running Buffers (Invitrogen) or 3 ~ 8% Tris-Acetate Gels (Invitrogen) and Tris-Acetate SDS Running Buffer (Life Technologies) for KMT2D. Twenty to forty µg of nuclear protein extracts were loaded into the polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed for 45–60 minutes at 120V. Gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes using Mini iBlot Gel Transfer Stacks Nitrocellulose (Invitrogen) for H3K4me1, me2 and me3, or wet transferred at 200mA over night at 4°C using transfer buffer (pH 8.3) contained glycine, tris base, sodium dodecyl sulfate, methanol and water. After blocking non-specific binding, the membranes were incubated with specific anti-H3K4me1 (ab8895, Abcam), anti-H3K4me2 (C15410035, Diagenode), anti-H3K4me3 (ab8580, Abcam), anti-KMT2D (ab213721, Abcam), and anti-HSP90 (4874S, Cell Signalling) overnight at 4°C. Then, the membrane was incubated with a secondary fluorescent labelled goat anti-rabbit antibody (IRDye 800CW LiCor) and the signal was developed using an Odyssey M imaging machine. Images were analysed using ImageJ by measuring the integrated density of the bands. Three or four experimental replicates were performed. Gene expression analysis Cells were collected by centrifugation and total RNAs were extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific). One μg of RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamers primer (Promega) to generate cDNA using the M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase kit (Promega), according to manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) reactions were performed in triplicate on a Bio-Rad CFX394 Real Time system (Bio-Rad) using Power SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems). For each sample, 2 µl cDNA (2 ng/µl) was incubated in a final volume of 10 µl with 5 µl of Power SYBR Green PCR Master mix (Applied Biosystems) and 0.5 µl of both the forward and reverse target-specific primer (10 µM, Sigma). The expression of each target gene was evaluated using a relative quantification approach (2 -ΔCT RNA sequencing and analysis RNAs were extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Library preparation was performed by the Genomic Technologies Core facility at the University of Manchester. Samples were sequenced using NextSeq500 (Dataset 1 – DS1 - UoM, Dataset 3 – DS3 - Validation) or Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer (Dataset 2 from HipSci consortium – DS2). Unmapped paired reads were output in BCL format and converted to FASTQ format using bcl2fastq v2.17.1.14. Prior to the alignment, RNAseq reads were trimmed to remove any adapter or poor-quality reads using Trimmomatic v0.36 with options: “ILLUMINACLIP:Truseq3-PE-2_Nextera-PE.fa:2:30:10 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:20 MINLEN:35” [ 39 40 41 42 Fig 1E 43 44 45 For validation heatmap generation and gene-based Z-score transformation of RNASeq count data pheatmap package within R v4.3.1 was used. Separate DGE analysis was performed for validation dataset 3 (-1 < Log2 FC > 1, adjusted p-value <0.05). Then DEGs from Dataset 1 were intersected with DEGs from validation Dataset 2 or 3 and plot them in a heatmap representation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and analysis ChIPseq has been performed using the True MicroChIP kit from Diagenode following the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cells were collected and DNA-protein was cross-linked using 36.5% formaldehyde. Then cells were lysed and chromatin was sheared by sonication (Bioruptor NextGen). Sheared chromatin was incubated with H3K4me1 Antibody (5326, Cell signalling) overnight at 4°C.

Reviewers' comments: Reviewer's Responses to Questions Reviewer #1: Cuvertino et al., perform a comprehensive mechanistic assessment of changes in gene expression and histone methylation across iPSC, neuronal progenitor and neuronal cell types. They address how changes in histone methylation may underlie the traits associated with the neurodevelopment Kabuki Syndrome. Overall, this study is very interesting and bridges an important gap in the knowledge as to the underlying molecular mechanisms of Kabuki syndrome. I suggest the following changes to the test to improve this paper: (i) The authors state that the number of differential H3K4me1 peaks between KS1 and control samples is reduced through differentiation and conclude that this reflects a difference in the requirement of KS1 during the differentiation process. An alternative interpretation is that chromatin compaction increases with differentiation, as cells become more specialised and only express genes required for their lineage, as opposed to the more open and permissive chromatin state in iPSCs and stem cells. As such, the number of regions able to be methylated on H3K4 will be reduced as cells differentiate, and this may underly the reduced number of H3K4me1 peaks in the progenitors and neurons in this study, relative to the iPSCs. (ii) Do the KS1 and control iPSCs differentiate into neurons with different efficiencies? The images in Supp Figure 8 show that they have markedly different morphologies at day 18. A comment on the efficiency of neuronal differentiation across KS1 lines relative to controls should be added to the results or discussion. (iii) Supplemental Table 1 shows that the iPSC control lines are from 2 male donors and 1 female, while the KS1 samples are from 2 females and 1 male. The potential for sex-associated differences across datasets should be discussed. To this point, iPSC line 1 and 3 show much higher levels of Oct4 and Nanog expression by RTqPCR, compared to iPSC line 2. iPSC lines 1 and 3 are female, while iPSC line 2 is male, such that sex-specific differences may underlie this result. Although, this could also be explained by iPSC line 2 carrying a nonsense mutation rather than a missense or frameshift as in the other two lines. Regardless, a discussion on potential sex differences should be added to the discussion and I suggest that the authors reword their comment about pluripotency gene expression not being different in these cells as it is markedly increased at Oct4 and Nanog in 2 of their 3 cell lines. (iv) I would suggest replacing Figure 1 B with Supplemental Figure 2A. Supplemental Figure 2A is a bit easier to interpret. (v) Which control iPSC line(s) were used in ChIP-seq experiments? The authors do not specify and whether this was a male or female line would be relevant to add to the discussion. (vi) Were the regions with gained H3K4me1 in the ChIP-seq datasets notable in any way? A comment should be added to the results section. (vii) Supplemental files with the differentially expressed genes and regions of differential H3K4me1 abundance across datasets should be provided. Also, it is not clear if these datasets will be uploaded to public platforms. Reviewer #2: This manuscript explores the transcriptomic and epigenomic mechanisms underlying Kabuki syndrome 1 (KS1) in three KS1 patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) lines. This would be a tremendous resource for the neurodevelopmental disorder field and further our understanding into disease mechanisms of KS1. The authors have addressed questions relevant to KS1 and conducted appropriate experiments to validate their iPSC models in relation to current knowledge of KMT2D function. It’s evident that the overarching goal of this study was to compare and contrast the transcriptome and epigenome of different KS1 mutations across pluripotent stem cells and more disorder-relevant cell types including neural progenitors and mature neurons. In it’s current state, this manuscript falls short of these aims and lacks sufficient detail and clarity regarding the datasets used between experiments and rationale for focusing primarily on the missense variants in neural cell types (detailed below). This reviewer recommends the following major corrections: Clarity around datasets, controls, replicates and lines • Why were different datasets used for experiments and why do some iPSC line appear across multiple datasets but others do not. • Additional details regarding the control lines used is required (are they isogenic corrected or from healthy individuals). • There are 6 controls listed in supp. Table 1 across three datasets, are these all from different individuals or are some of these matching? This needs to be stated. • What denotes an iPSC line vs a replicate? It appears multiple lines/replicates have been generated from a single individual. In it’s current state, this is confusing and lacks sufficient detail to interpret the results sufficiently. Are lines generated via an independent induction experiment or are they different clones from the same experiment? Are replicates internal replicates or experimental replicates? • If the author is merging independent biological replicates and experimental replicates for analysis, how are they accounting for these variables statistically? Discordance in experiments across the study The authors initially explored the impact of three Kabuki Syndrome 1, KMT2D patient variants – a missense, a nonsense and frameshift variant – on H3K4 methylation and KMT2D expression in pluripotent stem cells. The remainder of the experiments in this study were less powered and only focused on the missense mutation. It is unclear why the authors did not pursue a comparison of different KS1 mutations across the experiments in this manuscript and why the missense mutation was chosen for further analysis, especially in light of the differing mRNA results in Fig 1B which may allude to a differing mechanism and impact on transcription and H3K4 methylation in comparison to other mutations. The authors partially address this in the last section by conducting an additional validation RNAseq experiment with two control lines and the frameshift variant in neural progenitors. DEG comparison with the missense variant experiment had a moderate positive correlation, suggestive of a similar trend in gene expression changes between the missense and frameshift mutations. The nonsense mutation is however absent from this analysis and is only included within the first RNAseq experiment in iPSC’s. The authors should consider changing the focus of this study to primarily reflect their experiments which are concentrated on assessing transcriptomic and epigenetic differences in the missense mutation in different cell types in comparison to healthy control lines to improve the clarity and comprehension of the manuscript. Minor corrections: Figure 1 • Western blot quantification graphs in panel C and D need units for the Y-axis. • In panel B, the graphical representation comparing ALT KMT2D transcripts between missense, nonsense and frameshift mutations and the associated significant bar is confusing and separating these into their genotypes would be helpful to better interpret the results. • In the figure legend, you need to state the statistical analysis conducted and the n for each group. • Panel E: It’s unclear how these pluripotency markers were chosen. A geneset enrichment analysis with a pluripotency geneset would be more appropriate. Supp. Table 1. • Having a combined column for # Samples/Sample name for Controls is confusing and should be separated. It is unclear whether controls from dataset 1 and 2 come from Ctrl 1, 2 or 3 individuals or different individuals. This would be more clear if the columns were separated and this information provided • Number of samples should be in the sex column of DS2 controls. • Line 186: SUZ12 was identified only in DEGs from the RNAseq dataset which were upregulated, but not in downregulated peaks. Additionally you did not identify SUZ12 in your motif analysis at H3K4me1 peaks. This should be more accurately reflected in your summary of the data from these experiments. Figure 3. • It is unclear why the authors have chosen to perform a DEG analysis on just the missense variant iPSC lines and not the other variants, especially considering they have these datasets based on the Fig 1. results. It would be interesting to conduct a DEG analysis across mutants in comparison to the control lines to determine if common or different genes and genesets are dysregulated. • Line 191: A better rationale for assessing neural progenitors is needed beyond stating KS1 clinical phenotypes. • Line 224: these numbers should accurately reflect the numbers in Fig. 4I. Figure 4. • In the figure legend an independent description of what cell types panel E and F represent should be provided. • The total loss peaks and gain peaks for each cell type in panel I do not match the numbers in panel E and F. For example, in panel I the total loss peaks for neurons is 21,584 (20321+402+74+787), but in panel F the total loss peaks is 21,586. • Abbreviations such as Neur and Prog should be defined in the figure legend. Figure 5. • To be more comparable with the iPSC datasets, similar representation of analyses should be displayed. Therefore A karyoplot like in Fig 3C should be included for neural progenitors and neurons. • Abbreviations such as Neur and Prog should be defined in the figure legend. • Line 266: ‘into’ should be ‘in’ • Supp Table 1 refers to 3 datasets – DS1, DS2 and DS3, yet in the text you also refer to a validated dataset (line 280 and 604 for example) which is confusing. This need to be clarified and added to the Supp Table 1. • Line 313: The authors need to clarify that this was only demonstrated for the missense mutation. • Line 356: This is limited to the missense mutation based on the results from this study. Discussion around how the results of the missense mutation across cell types may inform on the mechanisms of the frameshift and nonsense variants in neural tissue and genomic H3K4me1 would be more accurate. Reviewer #3: This is an interesting study evaluating transcriptomic and epigenetic changes in iPSC-derived cell models from Kabuki syndrome type 1 (KS1) patients. The authors track the epigenome and transcriptome across three neuronal differentiation stages, identifying significant disruptions in KMT2D expression, H3K4 methylation, and enhancer-associated histone marks. They report that epigenomic alterations accumulate during differentiation, while the number of differentially expressed genes decreases. The study highlights the role of Polycomb-mediated repression and transcription factor binding changes in KS1 pathogenesis. However, some issues regarding the generalizability of the data across different iPSC lines need to be addressed to enhance the study’s impact and clarity before publication. Specific Comments 1. In this study, the authors performed transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling of iPSC-derived cell models (iPSCs, neuronal progenitors, and neurons) to investigate molecular changes in KS1. They utilized three different iPSC lines from KS1 patients. However, the core analyses were conducted using only one KS1 iPSC line with a missense mutation (c.16019G>A, p.(Arg5340Gln)), making it difficult to generalize the proposed mechanism (Polycomb-mediated repression and transcription factor binding changes). This issue is compounded by the lack of quality control data for the iPSC lines. a. Figures 2–5: It is unclear what control was used in the comparison with the c.16019G>A (p.(Arg5340Gln)) line—was it a single control line or all controls? b. iPSC Quality Control: There is no data on the quality control (e.g., karyotyping) of the KS1 iPSCs, which is essential for ensuring the reliability of the findings. c. Figure 5G: The overlap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the three KS1 iPSC lines is only briefly explored, and only between iPSCs and neuronal progenitors. The observed overlap between all three lines is of high interest, as these likely represent the most robust KMT2D-dependent changes. However, the presented data are sparse and feel incomplete, with no corresponding methylation data. 2. Although several mechanisms are being proposed and discussed there no single validation presented. 3. Figure 1D: The authors should use H3 as a loading control to provide a more accurate estimation of H3 methylation changes. The number of technical and biological replicates for the western blot is unclear—does \"N=3\" refer to three independent iPSC lines, or does it mean the western blot was performed once for each line? a. HSP90 Blot (H3K4me3): The blot appears problematic, as the protein seems to have been retained in the wells instead of migrating through the gel. b. There is considerable variation in the western blots that is not reflected in the quantification. How do the authors explain this? They should provide full western blot images for clarity. Minor Comments Figure 1B: The description in the text is unclear. Please rephrase for better comprehension. Figure 1C: Why would a missense mutation lead to decreased KMT2D levels? Do the authors have any explanation? Figure Presentation: The manuscript, including figures, appears somewhat sloppy. Figures are not always clear, and their presentation could be improved. Figures 5 & 6: These figures are not referenced in the text and should likely be converted into tables for clarity. **********  Have all data underlying the figures and results presented in the manuscript been provided?

Reviewer #1: All of my comments have been thoroughly addressed. The authors have done a clear and thorough job of addressing all points. Reviewer #3: Unfortunately, several of the most critical comments remain inadequately addressed in the rebuttal, leaving key concerns unresolved and diminishing confidence in the rigor and interpretability of the study. While the authors provided responses, many of them either sidestepped the core issues or deferred them to future work without proper justification. 1a. In this study, the authors performed transcriptomic and epigenetic profiling of iPSC-derived cell models (iPSCs, neuronal progenitors, and neurons) to investigate molecular changes in KS1. They utilized three different iPSC lines from KS1 patients. However, the core analyses were conducted using only one KS1 iPSC line with a missense mutation (c.16019G>A, p.(Arg5340Gln)), making it difficult to generalize the proposed mechanism (Polycombmediated repression and transcription factor binding changes). The decision to use only one non-isogenic control remains highly problematic and random, especially in a context where genetic background is a known confounder. The authors have not added any substantial clarification or justification for this design choice. The authors should at least incorporate a dedicated paragraph in the Discussion to highlight the significant limitations imposed by their case-control design. As it stands, the study lacks the statistical power and experimental design required to support any strong or definitive conclusions. 1b. iPSC characterisation informations Details regarding the control setup should be clearly specified in the Materials and Methods section. 1c. Figure 5G: The overlap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the three KS1 iPSC lines is only briefly explored, and only between iPSCs and neuronal progenitors. The observed overlap between all three lines is of high interest, as these likely represent the most robust KMT2D-dependent changes. However, the presented data are sparse and feel incomplete, with no corresponding methylation data. The authors' response that further analysis will be part of future work is not acceptable in this context. They already have the data available, and given the limitations of their case-control setup, it is crucial to robustly identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within the current study. This is not a matter for future investigation but a requirement for the current manuscript to meet basic standards of scientific rigor. 2. No Orthogonal Validation Performed There is still no orthogonal validation (e.g., immunocytochemistry) of the key findings. The authors suggest this could be explored in future work. Validating altered pathways through straightforward immunocytochemical approaches should be part of the present analysis, not deferred. 3. fig 1D Unclear Representation of Western Blot Data Regarding Figure 1d, the authors assert that three controls were used and Western blots were performed in triplicate. Yet only three data points are shown, raising doubts about whether all replicates are properly represented. The explanation provided fails to clarify this issue, especially given the substantial variation evident on the blots. To address this properly, the authors should display the individual replicates for each line and report statistics per line rather than presenting pooled averages. This is a basic expectation for transparent and interpretable data reporting. **********  Have all data underlying the figures and results presented in the manuscript been provided?
