Introduction Nucleic acid delivery is one of the most important applications of lipid-based therapeutic formulation. The field of lipid-based nucleic acid formulations, particularly lipid nanoparticles has been well documented and discussed in many excellent review articles, such as the recent extensive reviews by Wei et al. [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2. Historical Evolution of Lipid-Based Nucleic Acid Formulations The main historical challenge for formulations of nucleic acid therapeutics has always been meeting the requirement for protection and stability of the cargo versus providing the mechanism for a pathway into the interior of the target cell where the active therapeutic must act. A delivery particle that is relatively inert and stable between the point of administration and its target must then become dynamic enough to breach the cellular barriers, such as the cytoplasmic or endosomal membrane. It is clear that this challenge requires delivery vehicles composed of multiple components and with specific adaptable physical characteristics. Two categories of approaches to find optimal formulations are to try to design these based on a relatively complete predictive understanding of the interaction of delivery vehicles with their biological milieu and targets (bottom–up approach) and/or to develop methods to rapidly and completely search and test the vast parameter space available for the design (top–down approach), recognizing that combinations of these approaches can be used (see graphical abstract). Among the many parameters that can be varied in formulation design are particle size, overall charge and charge density, lipid fluidity and packing characteristics, expected lipid phase behavior, lipid-to-cargo ratio, and the use of any combination of thousands of natural lipids or an increasing palette of synthetic lipids. There is also the possibility of accessory non-lipidic surface components to protect or target the particle. Taken together, the formulation parameter space is enormous ( Figure 1 9 10 Nucleic acids, particularly RNA, are susceptible to degradation or immune surveillance when administered to humans [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 Figure 2 The biological rationale for the delivery of nucleic acids encapsulated in the aqueous space of a unilamellar liposome was the expectation that a membrane fusion event could deliver an uncomplexed nucleic acid into the cytoplasm where it would be available to reach its target. However, the design of appropriately fusogenic liposomal systems that also maintained stability and protection of the cargo before reaching the intended target cell proved to be especially challenging. Moreover, loading large nucleic acids efficiently within the aqueous interior of liposomal structures without the benefit of mechanisms of locally concentrating the nucleic acids to associate with the nascent liposome made this approach even more challenging. Therefore, methods in which nucleic acids spontaneously associate with the lipids, forming a self-assembling delivery system, ultimately became the dominating paradigm, culminating in today’s lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). LNP have the following formulation advantages: High (nearly 100%) complexation efficiency (w/cationic or ionizable cationic lipids); Rapid formulation methods (including microfluidics); Combinatorial synthesis of alternative (less toxic) lipids; Better DNA/RNA synthesis methods for stabilization; Easier multiplexing of formulation and testing. Cationic lipids, such as the prototypical 1,2-Dioleoyloxy-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTAP) or the earlier 1,2-Dioleyloxy-3-trimethylammonium propane (DOTMA), were shown to form lipid particles when complexed with DNA [ 14 15 16 17 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 A second concern for cationic lipid–nucleic acid complexes was whether there would be a mechanism of dissociation from the complex and whether it would occur in the right place and time, i.e., when the complex has reached its target. Only in recent years has an understanding of the mechanism of de-complexation within cells begun to clarify the situation. Initial studies indicated that uptake of lipid nanoparticles, followed by interaction with the endosomal membrane, appears to provide a sufficient mechanism for release of nucleic acids and transfer into the cytosol if the particle is formulated appropriately [ 25 25 Lastly, because cationic lipids are not generally found in nature, there had been concern about toxicity [ 26 27 28 29 30 The eventual success of this largely bottom–up approach for LNP design provided a starting point for further formulation exploration. While much has been learned about the requirements for successful nucleic acid formulations in this process, it is very likely that other parts of the formulation parameter space will need to be addressed for other future potential therapeutic targets. Faster and more comprehensive ways of searching for optimal formulations are needed, as well as a better knowledge of first principles that govern delivery in any particular biological context. In the following discussion, a few selected areas of emerging technology are addressed as some of the more important ones for advancing formulation discovery. 3. Emerging Technologies for Formulation Design Several emerging technologies appear to now be aiding the search for appropriate nucleic acid formulations and deserve highlighting. These new approaches are allowing for progress from the top down using improved formulation screening methods, as well as a better understanding from the bottom up of the biological parameters that can be used to predict successful formulation design (see graphical abstract). Many of these general principles apply to small and large RNAs alike but details will vary. The key to better screening for the best nucleic acid formulations (and other lipidic formulations as well) has essentially come down to addressing three major bottlenecks. One has been the rapid, reproducible production of well-characterized small-scale particle formulations for testing, i.e., ideally the creation of delivery particle libraries. The second issue has been the assessment of activity in relevant in vivo systems for such libraries. Lastly, an understanding of the biology of delivery, including what molecules adsorb to the surface of delivery particles and how delivery of nucleic acids into cells actually occurs, is needed to feed back into formulation design. 3.1. Top-Down Approach—Screening Formulations Ideally formulation and testing technologies would allow for the creation of diverse particle libraries accompanied by methods to test these libraries in vivo. Some recent technological advances that are allowing for greater exploration of the parameter space around lipidic nucleic acid formulations include combinatorial particle formulation, e.g., [ 31 32 3.1.1. Multiplexed Formulation Inherent in the ability to discover optimized lipid-based particles has been the development of methods to rapidly and reproducibly assemble particles. The invention of mixing methods that incorporate appropriate turbulent flow with high enough Reynolds number to achieve complete mixing before initiation of particle assembly has been crucial to the advancement of the field. An early developer of this kind of technology was the Prudhomme laboratory with the invention of the flash nanoprecipitation method [ 33 34 35 36 37 38 Extending from this pioneering work, methods of creating multiple formulations simultaneously or in a short time have been assisted by microfluidic technology. Formulation discovery requires the ability to create hundreds to thousands of combinations of components that can sufficiently cover the vast parameter space engendered in complex multicomponent systems ( Figure 1 39 40 41 31 42 41 43 44 Table 1 Approaches are now being designed with appropriate microfluidic devices [ 62 63 63 64 3.1.2. Multiplexed In Vivo Testing The ability to produce libraries of particles necessitates the ability to test the performance of multiple formulations in systems as close as possible to the intended clinical situation. Traditionally, in vitro testing has been a standard first step in formulation selection. Though this approach has some value, it really does not appropriately test the actual properties needed for successful therapeutic delivery. Only in vivo delivery or a validated substitute can be expected to predict efficacy. Therefore, methods to rapidly test multiple formulations in vivo are being developed. Most promising among those are the newly developed barcoding methods. In these methods, the various nucleic acid lipid nanoparticle formulations contain a barcode identifier in the form of a DNA or RNA barcode or an mRNA that codes for an identifier protein or peptide ( Figure 3 65 66 67 68 To avoid spurious barcode readouts from nanoparticles that had only adsorbed to the surface of cells, another approach has been to formulate mRNA to produce barcode peptides for particle identification. These could then be directly detected by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to both identify and establish functional delivery in the same event [ 69 70 71 3.2. Bottom-Up: Understanding Biologically Dictated Design Principles Rational design approaches to LNPs have been undeniably successful but in an incremental way. Understanding the basic physical, chemical and biological principles that govern the efficacy of delivery can allow for an approach that builds on this knowledge. In particular, a basis of knowledge of how cationic/ionizable lipids organize into particulate structures has fueled this method of design [ 72 73 3.2.1. The Importance of the Protein Corona It has been known for many years that liposomes and lipid nanoparticles (and, in fact, all delivery particles) invariably collect some sampling of proteins from their physiological environment before they reach their intended therapeutic target. Opsonization of liposomes was described as early as the 1980s [ 74 75 Figure 4 76 77 Figure 4 Advances in technology to simultaneously identify large cohorts of polypeptides have allowed scientists to begin to better understand the corona and how it affects delivery. In particular, proteomic liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LCMS) is an advance that has allowed for the identification of large groups of proteins based on a comparison of the mass-to-charge ratio of thousands of tryptic peptides to the predicted molecular weights from genomic sequences. As discussed in excellent reviews by Mahmoudi et al. [ 78 79 78 80 81 82 76 83 84 85 86 80 87 Discoveries such as these have led to the prospect of using the corona proteome to actually promote delivery. Manipulating the protein corona, such as through the elimination of opsonins, can dramatically change the behavior of nanoparticles [ 88 85 86 89 90 91 92 91 93 3.2.2. Imaging, Spectroscopic and Computational Methods to Understand LNP/Liposome Interactions with Cells One other key area of technological development that has allowed for a better understanding of the principles that govern delivery has been the recent ability to observe the disposition of individual nanoscale particles in biological samples. Although there have long existed methods of monitoring lipid-based formulations using radioactive or fluorescent labeling, it has only recently become possible to go below the Abbe diffraction limit to observe the mechanisms by which lipid-based particles interact with their target (or non-target) cells in non-fixed tissue. Liposomes and lipid nanoparticles are typically smaller than 200 nm and can be as small as tens of nanometers. When observed with visible light, the diffraction limit typically does not allow particles smaller than hundreds of nanometers to be separately distinguished [ 94 Transmission electron microscopy has been used to reach subnanometer resolution but generally requires harsh sample preparation conditions in which lipid particles do not survive well or that distort the relevant images. The advent and development of cryo-electron microscopy has allowed scientists to obtain high-resolution images of flash-frozen samples with minimal use of harsh contrast agents. An example of the importance of cryo-electron microscopy comes from the imaging of LNP formulations as isolated particles. In particular, there is substantial evidence from cryo-EM and molecular dynamics simulations that siRNA and oligonucleotide formulations often have an internal structure comprising RNA-containing compartments with similarity to inverted HII-phase lipid organization [ 95 96 97 Figure 3 98 99 It is not clear whether the much longer strands of protein-coding mRNA would actually show such an organization in the LNPs. In fact, the properties and delivery mechanisms of mRNA LNP could be considerably different from formulations with short polynucleotides with the possibility of heterogeneity in the lipid distribution in the interior of the mRNA-bearing particles [ 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 45 Additionally, computational methods for coarse-grained simulated structure and pKa prediction have been developed for lipid nanoparticles [ 108 109 110 111 Although isolated LNP particle parameters can be predictive, even more useful principles may emerge from observing or modeling the actual interactions between LNPs and the target membrane. LNPs typically undergo a process of internalization into target cells by one of several possible pathways, most commonly leading to several different compartments, including one called the endosome. The particle must escape the endosome to bring cargo into the cytosol of the cell before it is delivered to later compartments, such as the endolysosome, where degradation occurs ( Figure 5 112 113 114 115 Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, which allows for observation of non-frozen samples to resolutions down to approximately 20 nm, has been applied to observe the behavior of individual mRNA LNP in their transit through the endosomal uptake pathway [ 116 117 118 119 120 3.2.3. Machine-Learning-Based LNP Design Machine learning design of small-molecule drugs and novel proteins has seen an explosion of activity. Applications such as protein folding have succeeded with robust and well-defined datasets, i.e., the use of protein structures from X-ray, NMR and EM studies to correlate to sequences where there is little ambiguity about comparisons of data. Large language model approaches to lipid nanoparticle design are now also being developed, as reviewed by Dorsey et al. [ 121 122 Nonetheless, within the framework of the now relatively standard four-component lipid nanoparticles, it has been possible to adapt machine learning algorithms to assess the applicability of structural variants of individual lipid components, particularly the ionizable lipid [ 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 126 131 127 132 Target cell phenotypic features have also been exploited as training sets to understand and identify relevant targets for LNP delivery optimization. Cell biological features were used by Hunter et al. [ 133 Particle structure is another developing area in which datasets can be used to train computational algorithms to predict delivery efficacy. As outlined above, a number of studies have already explored these correlations. In fact, commercial cryo-EM image analysis products are now being offered to assess LNP properties for quality control and to predict efficacy. These approaches may allow high-throughput analysis of LNP formulation attributes to establish predictive structural features. Ultimately, delivery particle libraries to generate large training datasets along with large language model machine learning approaches may be the most productive path to predicting and exploring the unknown in lipidic particle design. As more data is accumulated and standards are established, it may be possible to extend into unexplored formulation types. Another area of application for predictive algorithms can be based on the role of the protein corona. There has now been enough proteomic data compiled on corona proteins to begin to develop training sets to try to predict corona compositions using large language models [ 134 135 136 79 78 4. Conclusions The discovery of lipid particle formulations for nucleic acids has now gained a number of useful new tools that can potentially aid design. Exploring more of the design parameter space and a better understanding of the basic principles underlying the delivery mechanism will be the needed drivers of better performance. The ability to produce large libraries of nanoparticles and barcoding methods to evaluate them, especially in vivo, will allow for exploration of a substantially greater range of potential formulations. New information on the mechanisms of nanoparticle delivery at the molecular level, including super-resolution microscopy and methods like SAXS, may allow the basic governing principles to be better understood, while defining and understanding the effects of the array of proteins which adhere to the particles will help to inform directions in design. It will be interesting to see in the coming years how far beyond the currently standardized LNP formulations these new methods will lead us. With the extremely complex biological attributes of various potential therapeutic targets, it is likely that the new territory explored by these evolving methods will lead to newly accessible therapeutic targets.

Nanoparticle variables generate a factorially increasing set of combinations of possible particles because of multiple dimensions (shown as each of 8 steps), represented on the left. Each type of particles’ delivery characteristics will depend on the route of administration and hence the protein coating obtained by the particle, represented by red arrows in the middle. The particle must then reach the target tissue, the particular target cell type, and the interior of the cell for delivery of the nucleic acid with decreasing success rates at each step, represented by green arrows on the right. As discussed in the text, endosomal escape following uptake is a particularly challenging step in this process. Nanoparticle figures adapted from and target tissue and cell icons directly from BioRender ( https://biorender.com Figure 2 Representation of some of the lipid-based formulations used for nucleic acid delivery. Graphic representations do not capture all aspects of particle structure but offer a summary. A liposome is represented on the left in 3 dimensions. Short nucleic acids are depicted. Encapsulation occurs within the aqueous interior of the liposome without specific interaction or complexation with components of the liposome. Small RNA and messenger RNA lipid nanoparticles are represented on the right in 2 dimensions, showing the key feature of lipid–nucleic acid interactions and reduced aqueous space. Nanoparticle figures adapted from BioRender ( https://biorender.com Figure 3 Barcoding for simultaneous evaluation/screening of multiple LNP formulations. As represented by the graphic on the left, each formulation type is associated with a specific DNA or peptide encoding mRNA barcode for identification after bioassay. Functionality of the nanoparticle formulation is assessed by expression of mRNA for a peptide or to generate a marker protein, such as the gree fluorescent protein. A group of different nanoparticles can be assessed together in vivo, comparing the performance that assessed the entire delivery process, as represented on the right. Tissue and cell icons from BioRender ( https://biorender.com Figure 4 Protein coronas on lipid nanoparticles. A generic nanoparticle is represented. Multiple proteins (depicted as multiple colors) adsorb directly and relatively tightly to the surface of the nanoparticles forming the hard corona. Other less avidly bound proteins form the soft corona. Nanoparticle surface coatings, such as PEG (pegylated), depicted in the lower scheme, tend to lessen but not eliminate the adsorbed proteins. Targeting moieties, such as ligands or antibodies, can help target the nanoparticle but are sometimes inactivated by the protein corona. Cell icon from BioRender ( https://biorender.com Figure 5 Generalized cellular uptake pathway for lipid nanoparticles. The cell uptake graphic on the right illustrates possible fates of a nanoparticle taken up by cells. Release or escape must occur before the particle is degraded in a later endolysosomal compartment.
