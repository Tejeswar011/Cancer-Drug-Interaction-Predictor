Secondary objectives were to describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and outcome of these tumors. Methods This was a retrospective multicenter study of all patients with a thoracic, abdominal or pelvic tumor diagnosed prenatally or within the first 3 months after birth in the Île‐de‐France area between January 2010 and May 2021. The gestational age at which a mass was detected on prenatal imaging, or the postnatal age at which the first tumor‐related sign or symptom was noted, in addition to the timing of postnatal diagnostic confirmation (clinicoradiological or pathological), were extracted from patient medical files. Results Overall, 153 tumors were identified. An associated congenital malformation was identified in 14 (9%) infants and four (3%) had a known germline pathogenic variant. The main tumor locations were adrenal gland (43%), extra‐adrenal and extrarenal retroperitoneum (12%) and kidney (12%). The most common diagnoses were neuroblastoma (93/153 (61%)) (including 65 adrenal, 20 extra‐adrenal retroperitoneal and eight thoracic/mediastinal), hepatoblastoma (10/153 (7%)), teratoma (10/153 (7%)), nephroblastoma (8/153 (5%)) and congenital mesoblastic nephroma (7/153 (5%)). In 35% (53/153) of cases, a mass was detected prenatally (mainly during the third trimester (62%)) and the diagnosis was confirmed at a median of 9 (interquartile range (IQR), 2–20) days after birth. Tumor detection was postnatal in 65% (100/153) of cases, mainly on the basis of tumor mass syndrome (39%) or tumor palpation by parents or during a routine medical visit (36%), and occurred at a median of 73 (IQR, 39–104) days after birth. Distant metastasis was noted in 4% (2/53) of cases with a prenatal mass and in 36% (36/100) of cases detected postnatally. Five medical terminations of pregnancy for a compressive tumor were reported, in addition to one in‐utero Conclusions Only 35% of perinatal thoracic, abdominal and pelvic tumors were detected before birth. Although mainly malignant, their prognosis was largely favorable. Improving early detection may assist postnatal multidisciplinary management and parental guidance. © 2025 The Author(s).

Secondary objectives were to describe the epidemiology, clinical characteristics and outcome of these tumors. METHODS This was a retrospective review of medical files for all infants with a perinatal tumor diagnosed between January 2010 and May 2021 in the pediatric surgery, oncology, pathology and obstetrics departments of the main tertiary care centers in the Île‐de‐France area. These expert centers recruit patients regionally but also nationally. They follow the same protocol of prenatal imaging, with the indication for prenatal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) determined on a case‐by‐case basis according to second‐line ultrasound examination performed by an expert sonographer. In France, all women systematically undergo three ultrasound scans during pregnancy: the first at 11–14 weeks' gestation, the second at 20–24 weeks' gestation and the third at 30–34 weeks' gestation. These scans are performed in primary care centers by certified sonographers, unless a referral to an expert center is required. Inclusion criteria were: (1) diagnosis of a solid tumor located in the thoracic, abdominal or pelvic region; (2) detection of a mass on prenatal imaging, or manifestation of the first tumor‐related sign or symptom during pregnancy or within the first 3 months after birth; and (3) confirmation of the tumor diagnosis after birth by histological analysis (biopsy or surgical specimen) or strong suspicion based on clinical, biological and radiological features. Perinatal solid tumors were defined histologically according to the World Health Organization classification and included all malignant, intermediate‐malignant and benign tumors  12  13 Table 1 Characteristics of 153 cases of perinatal tumor, in which either a mass was detected on prenatal imaging or the first tumor‐related sign or symptom appeared within 3 months after birth Timing of first sign/symptom ( n * Tumor type Cases ( n M:F Mass detected prenatally ( n 0–28 days after birth 29 days to 3 months after birth Unknown Neuroblastoma 93 (60.8) 1:0.86 36 21 36 0 Adrenal 65 (42.5) 31 11 23 0 Extra‐adrenal † 28 (18.3) 5 10 13 0 Renal tumor 18 (11.8) 1:0.8 5 3 10 0 Nephroblastoma 8 (5.2) 1 1 6 0 Congenital mesoblastic nephroma 7 (4.6) 4 2 1 0 Rhabdoid tumor 2 (1.3) 0 0 2 0 Clear cell sarcoma of kidney 1 (0.7) 0 0 1 0 Hepatic tumor 13 (8.5) 1:1.2 3 2 7 1 Hepatoblastoma 10 (6.5) 2 2 5 1 Hamartoma 1 (0.7) 0 0 1 0 Hemangioma 2 (1.3) 1 0 1 0 Soft‐tissue tumor 12 (7.8) 1:1 3 6 3 0 Congenital fibrosarcoma 5 (3.3) 3 2 0 0 Rhabdomyosarcoma 2 (1.3) 0 1 1 0 Extrarenal rhabdoid tumor 4 (2.6) 0 2 2 0 Extrahepatic hamartoma 1 (0.7) 0 1 0 0 Non‐gonadal germ cell tumor ‡ 8 (5.2) 1:3 5 0 3 0 Mixed teratoma 6 (3.9) 5 0 1 0 Yolk sac tumor 1 (0.7) 0 0 1 0 Choriocarcinoma 1 (0.7) 0 0 1 0 Gonadal tumor 6 (3.9) 1:0.2 1 1 4 0 Juvenile granulosa cell tumor 2 (1.3) 0 0 2 0 Teratoma 4 (2.6) 1 1 2 0 Lung tumor 3 (2.0) 0:1 0 2 1 0 Pleuropulmonary blastoma 3 (2.0) 0 2 1 0 * Cases for which mass was not detected on prenatal imaging. † Retroperitoneum and thorax/mediastinum. ‡ Excluding sacrococcygeal teratoma. M:F, male‐to‐female sex ratio. Clinical and therapeutic data were retrieved directly from patient medical files. A computer database query based on final tumor diagnosis was performed in each participating center's pathology and oncology departments to identify eligible patients. In cases for which a mass was not detected prenatally, we extracted the timing of the first tumor‐related sign or symptom, including: tumor mass syndrome (abdominal distension, functional discomfort, internal compression); tumor palpation by parents or during a routine medical visit (abdominal mass, hepatomegaly, subcutaneous nodules); indirect sign (pyelonephritis or inguinal hernia); or isolated change in general condition. If these data were not available, we used the date of the first postnatal imaging examination. The tumor diagnosis was established on the basis of the infant's postnatal clinicoradiological data. If the correct diagnosis was made on postnatal imaging, the date retained for diagnostic confirmation corresponded to the date of the first imaging assessment. If not, we used the date of pathological examination. All tumors except for neuroblastoma were confirmed histologically. In line with current recommendations, for selected cases of neuroblastoma, neither biopsy nor surgical resection is necessary for diagnosis and management  6 This study was conducted in accordance with the MR‐004 reference methodology of the Commission Nationale de l'Information et des Libertés (CNIL), and obtained ethical approval from the appropriate institutional review board (Comité d'Ethique de la Recherche APHP, Centre Université Paris Cité; reference: ORG0010044). The legal guardian(s) of all living underage patients reviewed in this study received an information letter and no opposition to the study was submitted. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT06365268 RESULTS Overall, 153 infants with a tumor located in the thorax, abdomen or pelvis were identified from the participating centers. Between seven and 17 cases were identified per year at these centers. No change in incidence was observed over the 11‐year study period. Tumors were located mainly in the retroperitoneum, with 43% of cases in the adrenal gland, 12% in the extrarenal and extra‐adrenal retroperitoneum and 12% in the kidney. Other locations were the thorax (11%), liver (10%), pelvis (9%) and digestive system (2%) (primary site was undefined in 1%). The most common tumors in the cohort were neuroblastoma (93/153 (61%); including 65 adrenal, 20 extra‐adrenal retroperitoneal and eight thoracic/mediastinal), hepatoblastoma (10/153 (7%)), teratoma (10/153 (7%)), nephroblastoma (8/153 (5%)) and congenital mesoblastic nephroma (7/153 (5%)) (Table 1 Considering all tumors, there was a homogeneous sex distribution, with an overall male:female ratio of 1:0.96. Median maternal and paternal age at delivery were 31 (range, 17–46) years and 34 (range, 22–50) years, respectively. No specific familial tumor history was identified. In three cases, the mother had been treated for cancer before pregnancy: one case each of melanoma, breast cancer and Hodgkin's disease. For the whole cohort, the final diagnosis was confirmed at a median of 51 (range, 8–96) days after birth. Four germline pathogenic variants were identified: one pathogenic variant of DICER1 SMARCB1 CTNNB1 2 S1 Table 2 Associated congenital malformations diagnosed in 14 cases of perinatal thoracoabdominopelvic tumors Tumor type/associated congenital malformation Cases ( n Teratoma 3 Gingival cleft 1 Cryptorchidism 1 Brachycephaly + abnormal ears 1 Neuroblastoma 7 Hypospadias 2 Two‐ to three‐toe syndactyly 1 Facial dysmorphism 1 Facial dysmorphism + ASD 1 Hypothyroidism 1 Subaortic VSD 1 Congenital mesoblastic nephroma 1 Thymic agenesis 1 Nephroblastoma 2 Currarino syndrome 1 Hand malformation 1 Hamartoma 1 Auricular dysplasia + pretragal nodule 1 ASD, atrial septal defect; VSD, ventricular septal defect. Mass detected on prenatal imaging A mass was identified in 35% (53/153) of cases on prenatal imaging. Teratoma and neuroblastoma had the highest rates of prenatal detection (60% and 39%, respectively). For cases detected prenatally, definitive tumor diagnosis was confirmed at a median of 9 (interquartile range (IQR), 2–20) days after birth. The fetal mass was most commonly detected during the third trimester (33/53 (62%)). Of those, the mass was visualized at ≥ 35 weeks' gestation in 24% (8/33) of cases, despite a previous normal routine third‐trimester ultrasound examination at 30–34 weeks' gestation. Between 2010 and 2016, a mass was visualized on prenatal ultrasound in 24/84 (29%) cases; between 2017 and 2021, this figure was 29/69 (42%). The median gestational age at mass detection was 32 weeks for both time periods. Fetal MRI was performed in 21% (11/53) of cases with a prenatal mass. This examination confirmed tumor suspicion in 7/11 cases and incorrectly ruled out tumor diagnosis in 3/11 (tumor was suspected on ultrasound in one case and in the two other cases the ultrasound examination was inconclusive). Data were insufficient in the final case. The possibility of a tumor was reported clearly in the medical file in 32% (17/53) of cases with a prenatal mass and incorrectly ruled out in 32% (17/53) (Figure 1 2 3, T S2 Figure 1 Flowchart summarizing timing and accuracy of thoracoabdominopelvic tumor diagnosis in study cohort.

(b) Fetal T2‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging in coronal view in same patient at 36 weeks' gestation (arrow indicates tumor). Following these examinations, initial suspected diagnoses were cystic lymphangioma or digestive duplication. Notably, all (12/12) neuroblastomas presenting as a cystic lesion were detected prenatally. Neuroblastomas presenting as solid and mixed lesions were identified prenatally in only 33% (24/72) of cases. For 14 neuroblastoma cases, repeat ultrasound examinations ≥ 2 weeks apart were available to assess tumor evolution (Figure 4 Figure 4 (a,b) Abdominal ultrasonographic images in axial view of congenital adrenal neuroblastoma (arrow; tumor diameter, 11 mm) in fetus at 31 weeks' gestation (a) and at 33 weeks' gestation (arrow; tumor diameter, 17 mm) (b). (c) Postnatal abdominal ultrasonographic image in same patient, confirming tumor progression (arrow; tumor diameter, 38 mm). Postnatal ‘wait‐and‐see’ surveillance strategy was chosen. Tumor size remained stable during follow‐up. As no regression was observed after 1 year of monitoring, surgical tumor resection was performed without adjuvant therapy. Patient remained in complete remission 7 years later. Tumors caused severe fetal compression syndrome in six cases: two thymic teratomas, of which one case presented with pleural effusion and ascites, while the other presented with pleural and pericardial effusion, ascites and subcutaneous edema; two pericardial teratomas, both of which presented with pericardial effusion and ascites; one pelvic teratoma, which presented with bilateral hydronephrosis; and one thoracic congenital fibrosarcoma, which caused local cervical compression. Finally, one patient, who was diagnosed after birth with metastatic neuroblastoma, exhibited prenatal hepatomegaly with ascites, without a primary mass identified. A total of six deaths occurred in the prenatal period. Termination of pregnancy was performed in five cases for a compressive tumor with major fetal repercussions (four teratomas and one congenital fibrosarcoma). In addition, intrauterine death occurred in a case of large severe compressive endopelvic teratoma. Mass not detected on prenatal imaging When an abnormality was not suspected on prenatal imaging (100/153 (65%) cases), the final diagnosis was made at a median of 73 (IQR, 39–104) days after birth. The first tumor‐related clinical sign/symptom occurred between delivery and 28 days after birth in 35% (35/100) of cases and between 29 days and 3 months after birth in 64% (64/100); one case was unspecified. The most common clinical signs reported after birth were tumor mass syndrome (39%) or direct palpation by parents or during a routine medical visit (36%). Indirect signs or an isolated change in general condition were reported in 16% and 6% of cases, respectively. In one (1%) case, the tumor was identified incidentally on imaging performed for a different indication, and data were missing in the remaining 2% of cases.

Figure 5 Ultrasound images (a,b) and T2‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging (c,d) in sagittal (a,c) and axial (b,d) views, showing paravertebral neuroblastoma ( Immediate neonatal and long‐term outcomes In the immediate neonatal period, five (3%) infants required immediate intensive care: one case of mesoblastic nephroma with severe arterial hypertension, one case of thoracic fibrosarcoma with respiratory distress, one case of pleuropulmonary blastoma with respiratory distress, one case of intestinal fibrosarcoma with an obstruction mimicking small bowel atresia, and one case of intestinal fibrosarcoma presenting with intestinal perforation that required emergency surgical management. Of these, a tumor was suspected prenatally only in the case of mesoblastic nephroma. Among the 93 infants with neuroblastoma, 45 (48%) cases received active first‐line treatment (surgery, chemotherapy or both). Second‐line treatment (surgery, chemotherapy or both) was required in 12/45 (27%) cases due to a tumor recurrence, progression, or insufficient response to first‐line therapy. According to the current European neuroblastoma protocol, a ‘wait‐and‐see’ strategy was proposed in the remaining 48/93 (52%) cases  6 Among the eight patients with nephroblastoma, four were treated with first‐line surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, three received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before tumor removal, and the patient with partially differentiated cystic nephroblastoma underwent surgery alone. Four cases required second‐line treatment after tumor recurrence. The seven cases of mesoblastic nephroma were treated by surgery alone, without recurrence. The 10 patients with hepatoblastoma were treated using a combination of surgery and chemotherapy, and one required second‐line treatment after relapse. The six patients with renal or extrarenal rhabdoid tumor received palliative treatment, either immediately, if the tumor was disseminated at diagnosis, or after recurrence. The three patients with pleuropulmonary blastoma were treated using surgery and chemotherapy. In addition to the six prenatal deaths, 11 infants died postnatally: 10 because of tumor progression (6/6 cases of rhabdoid tumor, 3/93 cases of neuroblastoma and 1/8 case of nephroblastoma), and one due to transformation of a hepatic hemangioma into an angiosarcoma. At a median follow‐up of 5 (range, 0–14) years, 136 (89%) patients remained alive. Among the 106 survivors with at least 2 years of follow‐up, the medical reports did not mention any severe sequelae in 104 (98%). Two children with paravertebral neuroblastoma with intraspinal extension had impaired sphincter function and motor disorders of the lower limbs. DISCUSSION This study reports the distribution, timing of diagnosis and management in 153 cases of thoracic, abdominal and pelvic tumor identified in fetuses and infants up to 3 months of age at expert centers in the Paris region between January 2010 and May 2021. Excluding sacrococcygeal teratoma, the distribution of tumors was concordant with that reported in the literature, with a large predominance of retroperitoneal tumors (neuroblastoma, 61%; renal tumor, 12%), followed by soft‐tissue tumors, teratoma and hepatoblastoma  1 et al  1 During the fetal/neonatal period, most tumors are of embryonic origin and are frequently due to germline genetic anomalies  14  15  16  17 SMARCB1 DICER1  18  19  15  20  21  22  23 In this series, 35% of tumors were detected prenatally, mainly during the third trimester (62% of all prenatal cases) and sometimes not until the last few weeks of pregnancy. The possibility of diagnosing a fetal tumor is linked to the nature of the lesion: large, cystic tumors are better visualized than solid ones, whose echogenicity may be very close to that of adjacent anatomical structures. This is well‐illustrated with neuroblastoma, where prenatal diagnosis was achieved in 100% of cystic tumors and 33% of solid/mixed tumors. It can also be assumed that the growth of some tumors started only after the last ultrasound examination (generally performed at around 30 weeks' gestation) or postnatally (before 3 months after birth in the present study). Ultrasound remains the reference standard for the screening of fetal anomalies and a very good modality for the detection of tumors, surveillance of tumor growth/evolution and assessment of the local and general consequences for the fetus. In comparison, MRI is useful to better define the composition of the tumor and its relationship with adjacent organs. Fetal MRI has been shown to perform better compared with ultrasound in detecting liver metastasis in neuroblastoma  24  25  26 et al  27 In our study, patients with a mass detected prenatally had their diagnosis confirmed earlier than did patients diagnosed postnatally, with less initial distant extension. However, the aggressiveness of the tumor may relate mainly to the biology of the tumor rather than to diagnostic delay  28 Several risks should be anticipated when deciding on the timing and type of delivery, considering a potential need for rapid access to neonatal care. The first is intra‐abdominal tumor rupture, especially for large hepatoblastoma, renal tumor, teratoma or any large tumor, although no predefined size threshold exists for deciding on Cesarean delivery  29  30  30  31 This study focuses on tumors of the thoracoabdominopelvic region, a major diagnostic challenge in prenatal imaging given the breadth of possible differential diagnoses. Owing to the multicenter nature of this study, we were able to generate a large series, with great variability in tumor nature and location. However, perinatal tumor pathology is not limited to the trunk, and other possible tumor sites should be examined carefully (brain, head, neck, eyes, limbs and sacrococcygeal region)  21 In conclusion, the detection of a tumor in the perinatal period requires a multidisciplinary approach involving obstetricians, geneticists, pediatric oncologists, pediatric surgeons, neonatologists and radiologists. Most of these tumors are amenable to curative treatment  4 Collaborators  S. Moalla  H. Boutroux  S. Irtan  S. Boudjemaa  P. Philippe‐Chomette  D. Luton  J. Rosenblatt  T. Quibel  F. Guimiot  N. Roux  J. Martinovic Supporting information  Table S1  Table S2 DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT The data that support the findings of this study are available on request from the corresponding author.
