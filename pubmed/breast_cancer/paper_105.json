Objective This work aimed to find a new prognostic cell senescence gene to predict the prognosis of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Methods The data of the patients with PTC were collected from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The gene set of cellular senescence was collected from the website of CellAge. The function of hub genes was analyzed by various bioinformatics methods including expression analysis, survival analysis, and nomogram analyses. Real-time quantitative PCR, cell transfection, colony formation assay, Western blot, wound healing assay, transwell assay, cell counting Kit-8, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry staining were performed to verify the function of hub gene. Results E2F1 was finally screened as the key senescence gene, and its expression was higher in PTC tumors than in normal. KM curve indicated that PTC patients with higher expression of the E2F1 had longer survival times. The GSEA showed that the high expression group of E2F1 was enriched in DNA replication and so on. Cell experiments showed that overexpression of E2F1 significantly increased relative protein expression of senescence related markers, including p21, p53, γ-H2AX, and p16INK4a. Cell experiments also showed that overexpression of E2F1 inhibited the invasion, proliferation, and migration of tumor cells. While knockdown of E2F1 reversed these results. Conclusion E2F1 was found to be upregulated in PTC, with its high expression significantly correlated to a favorable patient prognosis. E2F1 suppresses malignant tumor phenotypes by modulating cellular senescence. A predictive model integrating E2F1 and clinical features accurately forecasts poor prognosis, indicating E2F1’s potential as a therapeutic target for PTC. cell senescence thyroid cancer E2F1 prognosis immunotherapy The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Cancer Genetics and Oncogenomics 1 Introduction Thyroid cancer (THCA) is a common cancer with high prevalence in human endocrine diseases around the world. It was already the seventh most common cancer, with more than 821 thousand, new cases of THCA based on the Global Cancer Statistics 2022 ( Bray et al., 2024 Gudmundsson et al., 2017 Ambrosi et al., 2017 Cell senescence arrests the cell cycle stably, which inhibits the proliferative life span stably ( Calcinotto et al., 2019 Fridman and Tainsky, 2008 Feng et al., 2025 Wang et al., 2020 Vizioli et al., 2011 Vizioli et al., 2014 Kim et al., 2017 Mazzoni et al., 2019 Minna et al., 2020 Wen and Guo, 2023 Hong et al., 2023 However, there is still a lack of systematic research on the dual integration of cellular senescence and clinical outcome. This study aims to systematically identify and verify the key genes and characteristics associated with PTC prognosis and cell senescence, utilizing large cohort bioinformatics analysis and in vitro 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Data source Transcription data and corresponding clinical data of the patients with PTC were collected from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga https://genomics.senescence.info/cells/ Avelar et al., 2020 Supplementary Table S1 2.2 Screening of prognostic genes associated with cellular senescence First, we compared the expression levels of 279 cellular senescence genes between normal individuals and patients with PTC. Genes with p < 0.05 and |log2 (fold change) | > 1 were considered differentially expressed cellular senescence genes (DECSG). Then, univariate analysis was used to explore the relationship between the 279 senescence genes and the prognosis of PTC patients. Genes with p < 0.05 were considered the prognostic cellular senescence genes (PCSG). Subsequently, the overlapped genes between the DECSG gene set and PCSG gene set were obtained by package “Venn” of the “R” software. Last, the multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed based on the overlapped genes. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, a gene with p < 0.05 was considered as a key prognostic cellular senescence gene. 2.3 The expression of key prognostic cellular senescence gene The key prognostic cellular senescence gene expression was compared between normal individuals and patients with PTC using T-test. The paired t-test was used to analyze the expression between the PTC tissue and paracancerous tissue of patients with PTC. Moreover, the protein expression detected by immunohistochemistry in tumor and normal tissue was explored from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) ( https://www.proteinatlas.org/ GSE3467 GSE33630 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ 2.4 Survival analysis Kaplan–Meier (KM) curves were plotted based on overall survival (OS) and the gene expression. The optimal cut-off point of KM survival curves was generated through the “res. cut” function in the “survminer” package and the log-rank test was used to analyze the differences between survival curves. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to assess the prediction in differentiating patients with PTC from normal individuals. Additionally, the univariate and multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to explore the association between clinical features and the patient’s OS for determining the effect of the expression of hub genes in patients with PTC. Last, the R package “rms” was utilized to build the nomogram. Decision analysis curve (DCA), ROC, and calibration curves were conducted to evaluate the predictive performance of the nomogram model. 2.5 Gene set enrichment analysis Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was initially performed to rank the ordered list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in this study. GSEA was conducted to assess the significant survival differences observed between the high-expression and low-expression patient groups in PTC. The c2. cp.kegg.v7.4. symbols.gmt dataset was downloaded from the Molecular Signatures Database and used to evaluate relevant pathways and molecular mechanisms. Set permutations were performed 1,000 times for each analysis. P value of <0.05 and an FDR of <0.25 were considered statistically significant. 2.6 Immune microenvironment correlation analysis To research the relationship between the expression of the hub gene and six kinds of immune cells, we conducted the analysis of immune cell infiltration levels by the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) methods based on the TIMER2.0 database ( http://timer.cistrome.org/ Li et al., 2020 2.7 Cell culture Normal thyroid cell lines (Nthy-ori-3-1) and thyroid cancer cell lines (TPC-1 and K1) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 2.8 Real-time quantitative PCR The mRNA levels of the target genes were assessed following the manufacturer’s protocols. In summary, total RNA was extracted from cell samples using TRIzol reagent (Sigma, United States), and its concentration was measured using the Nanodrop 100 spectrophotometer (Thermo, United States). Complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the Hiscript QRT SuperMix (Vazyme, China). The qPCR reaction (10 µL) was conducted with the SYBR Green Master Mix Kit (Vazyme, China) and analyzed using the Biosystems 7,500 Sequence Detection system. The RT-qPCR cycling conditions were set as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and finishing with 1 cycle of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 95 °C for 15 s. Each assay was carried out in triplicate. The gene expression was normalized to GAPDH, and the relative expression of the genes was calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCT 2.9 Cell transfection We used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to silence the E2F1 gene in K1 cells. The specific steps were as follows: 1) siRNA was briefly centrifuged and prepared into a 20 µM stock solution using RNase-free H 2 5 2 ® 2.10 Colony formation assay The colony formation assay was used to assess the survival ability of cells in vitro 2.11 Protein extraction and Western blot Proteins were extracted from tumor cells using RIPA lysis and extraction buffer (KeyGen Biotechnology, Nanjing, China). The protein concentration was determined using the BCA method. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (EMD Millipore, Burlington, MA). The membrane was then blocked with 5% (v/v) Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) for 1 h. The membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with an appropriately diluted primary antibody (E2F1 antibody, 1:800; Biorbyt, England). Afterward, the membrane was incubated with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Protein bands were detected using the ECL chemiluminescence kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Finally, the protein bands were analyzed semi-quantitatively using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States). The results are presented as the ratio of the optical density (OD) of the target protein to the internal control. 2.12 Wound healing assay The scratch assay is used to study cell migration and repair behavior in vitro 2.13 Transwell assay Cells were digested with trypsin and resuspended in cell suspension (80,000 cells per well), then seeded into the upper chamber of a Transwell insert (24-well, 8 µm pore size) (Corning) with 100 µL of cell suspension. In the lower chamber, 500 µL of DMEM supplemented with 30% FBS was added. After 24 h of incubation at 37 °C, migrating cells on the underside of the polycarbonate membrane were fixed with 4% pre-cooled paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The cells were then stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, five random fields were selected under a fluorescence microscope (200 × magnification, Olympus), and the migration rate was calculated based on the number of migrating cells. 2.14 Cell counting Kit-8 First, cells were cultured in standard cell culture flasks and monitored for growth under a microscope. When the cell density reached 80%–90%, cells were digested with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA. Fresh DMEM medium was added, and the cell suspension was thoroughly mixed. Then, 100 µL of the cell suspension was seeded into each well of a 96-well plate. The plate was cultured in a 37 °C incubator for 12, 24, 36, and 72 h. Next, the cell proliferation and toxicity assay were performed. Specifically, 10 µL of CCK-8 reagent was added to each well, and the plate was incubated for an additional 4 h in the incubator. Finally, the 96-well plate was removed, and the absorbance at 490 nm (OD490) was measured using a microplate reader. The cell proliferation curve was then plotted based on the OD490 values. 2.15 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining Formalin-fixed PTC and paired normal tissues were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in ethanol solutions. To block endogenous peroxidase activity and nonspecific binding sites, the tissues were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Next, the tissues were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody (anti-E2F1, diluted 1:2,500), followed by a 1-hour incubation at room temperature with the secondary antibody, HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The tissue was then stained with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution for 3 min. The cell nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin. Tissue sections were examined with a Nikon Eclipse model N i-U microscope. 2.16 Flow cytometry Single cell suspensions of tumors were analyzed by flow cytometry. Treated cell suspensions were collected and centrifuged (300 × g, 5 min, 4 °C). After discarding the supernatant, cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Subsequently, cells were resuspended in β-galactosidase staining buffer (pH 6.0) containing 20 μM C12FDG and incubated at 37 °C in a CO 2 2.17 Statistical analysis The qualitative data between groups were compared with a rank-sum test using IBM SPSS 21.0 software (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, United States) as the data did not conform to a normal distribution. In addition, data visualization was performed using SangerBox 3.0 ( http://vip.sangerbox.com/home.html Shen et al., 2022 3 Results 3.1 Identification of prognostic genes associated with cellular senescence Twenty-three DECSG between normal individuals and patients with PTC were found via the “limma” R package (p value <0.05 and |log2FC| > 1) ( Supplementary Table S2 Figure 1A Figure 1B Supplementary Table S3 Figure 1C Figure 1D FIGURE 1 Screening of key prognostic-related cellular senescence genes.

The expression of E2F1 in the pan-cancer analysis indicated that it had a higher expression in tumors than in normal tissue ( Figure 2A Figure 2B Figure 2D Figures 2C,E Figures 3A,B Figures 3C,D FIGURE 2 Exploration of E2F1 gene expression.

Panel C and D are circular sections at a higher magnification; C shows tumor tissue with dense, varied structures, while D illustrates normal tissue with large, open cell spaces. Each section is labeled with its designation and size scale. 3.4 Clinical value of E2F1 in patients with PTC The relationship between the expression of E2F1 and the OS was analyzed based on TCGA database. The KM curve indicated that the expression of E2F1 impacted the survival of patients with PTC. The PTC patients with higher expression of the E2F1 had longer survival times ( Figure 4A Figure 4B FIGURE 4 Prognostic value of E2F1 in PTC patient. Kaplan–Meier survival curve (A) (B) Panel A shows a Kaplan-Meier survival curve with groups labeled L and H, displaying survival probabilities over time in days. A significant difference is indicated by the p-value of 0.0002, with a hazard ratio of 0.15 and a confidence interval of 0.05 to 0.48. Panel B presents a ROC curve, illustrating high diagnostic performance with an AUC of 0.92, confidence interval 0.97 to 0.88. 3.5 The effect of E2F1 on PTC tumor cell senescence To elucidate the role of E2F1 in regulating cellular senescence in PTC, TPC-1 cells were subjected to different treatments. Senescence-associated markers were examined by Western blot analysis, while flow cytometry was employed to evaluate cell viability, thereby delineating the impact of E2F1 on tumor cell senescence. Five different treatment groups (knocked down E2F1 (E2F1-KD), upregulated E2F1 (E2F1-OE), NC-OE, NC-KD, positive control) were initially established, and Western blot analysis was performed to assess E2F1 protein expression across the groups. The results demonstrated that E2F1 protein levels were markedly elevated in the E2F1-OE group compared with the other groups. The E2F1 protein level in the E2F1-KD group was significantly lower than that in the other groups, indicating that the E2F1 overexpression or knockout treatment was successful. Western blot analysis further revealed that, compared with the NC-OE group, the E2F1-OE group exhibited significantly increased relative protein expression of p21, p53, γ-H2AX, and p16INK4a, while PPP1A and phosphorylated pRB (p-pRB) levels were markedly reduced. In contrast, compared with the NC-KD group, the knockdown of E2F1 resulted in significantly decreased expression of p21 and p16INK4a, accompanied by increased expression of PPP1A and p-pRB ( Figures 5A,B FIGURE 5 E2F1 affects tumor cell senescence and apoptosis. Western blot examination of cell senescence markers in each group (A) (B) Western blot and bar graph analysis of protein expression. Panel A shows the expression of p16INK4a, p-pRB, p21, p53, PPP1A, γ-H2AX, E2F1, and GAPDH in different conditions: OE-NC, KD-NC, OE-E2F1, KD-E2F1, and a positive control. Panel B presents bar graphs of relative expression normalized to GAPDH for E2F1, P21, p53, p16INK4a, γ-H2AX, PPP1A, and p-pRB across the same conditions, with statistical significance indicated by asterisks and symbols. We further validated these findings using flow cytometry. The results showed that, compared with the NC-OE group, the proportion of EdU-positive cells was significantly reduced in the E2F1-OE group, whereas the E2F1-KD group exhibited a significantly higher proportion of EdU-positive cells relative to the NC-KD group ( Figure 6A Figure 6B FIGURE 6 Flow cytometry analysis of senescent cells in different groups. The scatter plot displays the relative intensity of the EDU PH-E fluorescence signal on the ordinate against the side scatter (SSC) on the abscissa, with each point representing an individual cell. The percentage indicates the ratio of EDU-positive cells to the total population (A) (B) Flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle and EDU incorporation. In section A, five scatter plots display EDU PE-H versus SSC-A for conditions: NC-OE, NC-KD, E2F1-OE, E2F1-KD, and a positive control, with highlighted EDU-positive percentages. A bar graph shows EDU positive rates for each condition. In section B, five histograms present DNA content versus cell number for similar conditions, indicating phases G0/G1, S, and G2/M. A bar graph compares the percentage of cells in each phase across conditions. Statistical significance is marked with asterisks and symbols. 3.6 The effect of E2F1 on normal thyroid cells in vitro The above findings indicate that E2F1 suppresses tumor cell progression by promoting cellular senescence. Based on this, we hypothesized that reduced E2F1 expression in normal cells might facilitate their malignant transformation. To test this hypothesis, we downregulated E2F1 in normal human thyroid follicular epithelial cells (Nthy-ori 3-1) and assessed the resulting phenotypic changes. PCR analysis confirmed effective knockdown, showing a significant reduction in E2F1 mRNA levels in the E2F1-KD group compared with the NC-KD group ( Figure 7A Figure 7B Figure 7C Figure 7D Figure 7E FIGURE 7 E2F1 knockdown promoted proliferation, invasion, and migration of normal thyroid cells in vitro (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) A series of panels depicting experimental results. A: Bar chart showing reduced E2F1 mRNA expression in E2F1-KD compared to NC-KD, with p=0.002.

E: Western blot and bar charts of CyclinD1 and P21 levels, higher in E2F1-KD, both with p<0.001. 3.7 The effect of E2F1 on PTC cells in vitro The above results indicated that E2F1 was highly expressed in tumors, which was associated with improved prognosis for patients. To further investigate the impact of E2F1 on tumor progression, we conducted cell experiments. We compared the expression levels of E2F1 between normal thyroid cells (Nthy-ori-3-1) and thyroid cancer cells (TPC-1 and K1) via PCR. The PCR results revealed that E2F1 expression was higher in tumor cells compared to normal cells, with the expression level in K1 cells being higher than that in TPC-1 cells ( Figure 8A Figure 8B FIGURE 8 E2F1 knockdown promoted proliferation, invasion and migration of PTC in vitro (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) (F) Six-panel scientific figure presenting data on E2F1 expression and cell behavior. Panel A shows bar graphs comparing E2F1/GAPDH ratios in different conditions, indicating significant differences with p-values. Panel B displays Western blots for E2F1 and GAPDH under NC-KD, E2F1-KD, NC-OE, and E2F1-OE conditions. Panel C includes images and bar graphs showing cell migration differences with statistical significance. Panel D presents colony formation images and corresponding bar graphs highlighting colony count variations. Panel E features images and graphs showing migration rates over 24 hours. Panel F contains line graphs showing changes in relative viable cells over time with significant p-values. The results of the Transwell assay showed that the number of invasive cells in the E2F1-OE group was significantly lower than that in the vector-control group, while the number of invasive cells in the E2F1-KD group was significantly higher than that in the NC-KD group ( Figure 8C Figure 8E Figure 8D Figure 8F in vitro 3.8 GSEA Patients with PTC were divided into two groups based on the cutoff values of the expression of E2F1. Then, the GSEA analysis was carried out to explore the related pathways associated with E2F1. The results showed that the high expression group of E2F1 was enriched in DNA replication, cell cycle, base excision repair, homologous recombination, and P53 signaling pathway ( Figure 9 FIGURE 9 Exploration of E2F1 expression-related pathways. GSEA functional analysis in E2F1 low and high expression groups. Graph showing enrichment scores for various pathways over a ranked dataset. The DNA replication pathway has the highest normalized enrichment score (NES) of 2.4092, followed by the cell cycle and base excision repair. Homologous recombination and p53 signaling pathway scores are also displayed. The bottom graph shows a ranked list metric ranging from high to low. 3.9 Immune microenvironment and immune checkpoints correlation analysis The immune microenvironment plays an important role in the development of tumors. The results showed that there was a positive correlation between the expression of E2F1 and the infiltrating levels of three immune cells, including B cells, CD8+T cells, and dendritic cells ( Figures 10A–F Figures 10G–I Figures 10J,K FIGURE 10 The relationship between E2F1 expression and immunity.

Each plot shows data points with a trend line. Partial correlation coefficients and p-values are noted in each, indicating statistical significance. Plots A-F focus on cell types, while G-K highlight gene expression. 3.10 Construction of nomogram To offer a precise model for predicting the personal prognosis of patients with PTC. The nomogram was constructed based on the results of univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis. Finally, age, M, and neoplasm length were independent factors that affect survival ( Table 2 Figure 11A Figure 11B Figure 11C Figure 11D TABLE 2 Cox regression analysis of E2F1 expression and clinical features in overall survival in patients.

Panel C is a calibration plot showing observed versus predicted probabilities at different time points. Panel D is a decision curve analysis illustrating net benefit across various high-risk thresholds with four models. 4 Discussion PTC with high occurrence seriously affects the health and life of people and increases the medical burden. Therefore, screening new prognosis biomarkers from the different research hotspots. Cell senescence was important for different tumor development. However, the relationship between the PTC prognosis and cell senescence was unclear. This paper screened the related prognosis cell senescence based on the different expression levels of genes between the normal and the patient with PTC. Then, we obtained that the cell senescence gene E2F1 was the key prognosis gene. However, the reported papers that related the correction between E2F1 and PTC were rare. E2F1 is a main member of the E2F family. The E2F family plays an important role in cell cycle signal pathway and apoptosis ( Buccitelli et al., 2017 Martinez-Balbas et al., 2000 Ou et al., 2023 E2F1 has important functions including DNA replication, checkpoint response and DNA repair in the cell cycle process in tumor cells, which has been widely reported in many studies ( Manickavinayaham et al., 2020 Fouad et al., 2020 Deng et al., 2023 Wang et al., 2023 Lin et al., 2001 Zannini et al., 2014 Dimri et al., 2000 Wang et al., 2000 Chen et al., 2011 Orhan et al., 2021 McFadden et al., 2014 E2F1-driven senescence also reshapes the tumor microenvironment via the SASP to limit metastatic potential. On the one hand, senescence rewires cytoskeletal, adhesion, and motility programs, intrinsically reducing migratory and invasive capacities; on the other, SASP factors (e.g., IL-6/IL-8 and chemokines) enhance immune surveillance and phagocytic clearance, creating—when appropriately timed and sufficiently deep—a tumor-suppressive ecosystem that scales single-cell arrest into population-level constraints on dissemination ( Chibaya et al., 2022 + Chibaya et al., 2022 Chen et al., 2023 5 Strengths and limitations This study has several strengths: (1) It is the first to identify the tumor-suppressive role of the senescence-associated E2F1 gene in PTC. This finding contradicts the majority of previously reported studies ( Rocca et al., 2019 Gonzalez-Romero et al., 2021 Li et al., 2023 in vitro in vivo 6 Conclusion In the present work, we found that the cell senescence-related gene E2F1 was upregulated in PTC and its high expression was significantly associated with the favorable prognosis of patients. E2F1 can inhibit the development of malignant tumor phenotypes by regulating cellular senescence, thereby reducing the risk of poor prognosis. The model based on E2F1 and clinical features can accurately predict poor prognosis in patients, and E2F1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for PTC.
