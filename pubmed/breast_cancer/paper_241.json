In the field of oncology, anticipating test results, particularly pathology, can be distressing. This case discusses the personal experience of an oncology clinician who became an oncology patient and navigated the anxiety of awaiting pathology results during her melanoma diagnosis. By sharing these personal insights, this case can hopefully help patients manage the psychological stress of waiting for test results and help to inspire clinicians to make small practice changes, which may help decrease this stressful burden for patients. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf yes pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes When one has a diagnosis (or potential diagnosis) of cancer, anticipating results from scans, laboratory work, and/or a biopsy can be daunting. The American Cancer Society (2023) Lang et al., 2009 Mannion et al., 2023 THE CASE My annual dermatology appointment fell on a rainy, cold day. A resident performed a thorough examination and marked an area on my right shoulder that she felt should be discussed with her attending physician. The attending physician agreed that the area showed some “central color change” and conducted a biopsy. Over the following days, I seldom thought about the biopsy, which had seemed routine. On the tenth day, I received an unexpected call from my dermatologist. Her tone was professional, kind, and compassionate. She explained, “I am glad that we did a biopsy because the pathology shows melanoma.” She immediately offered helpful reassurance: “Don't freak out. Let's talk about it. I already have a plan.” As an oncology nurse practitioner, I was familiar with the topics covered during our subsequent discussion, such as Breslow thickness, Clark's level, and staging. My dermatologist clarified the melanoma removal guidelines and scheduled a surgery date. The surgery went well. A week later, I was notified that it had been successful, as the site showed “clear margins.” I had regular follow-up appointments and some subsequent biopsies over the next year; each time, my pathology results were provided within 7 to 10 days, consistent with national standards and expectations. At the 1-year follow-up of my melanoma diagnosis, my dermatologist noticed a mole that had changed color and recommended a biopsy. We discussed plans, pending the findings. This time, however, the days of waiting felt much different. Despite my professional role, as a patient I experienced significant anxiety, stress, insomnia, nausea, and fear that grew worse with each passing day. I frequently found myself focusing on negative “What ifs.” My anxiety level continued to rise when I received a notification that the clinic note had been posted. I read the differential diagnoses, which included melanoma, although this had been discussed with me at the visit. On day 13, my dermatologist called and informed me that the mole was concerning and should be removed immediately. However, despite this “bad news,” I felt a settling of my anxiety as soon as I heard her voice on the phone and knew that she had a plan. DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Numerous publications have discussed distress associated with waiting for medical test results, including pathology. For cancer survivors, uncertainty pertaining both to the disease and to potential new sites of malignancy can lead to chronic anxiety ( Zhang, 2017 Conley & Lenton, 2012 Patients To my fellow patients: Please do not sit alone at home, reading obsessively about potential diagnoses and pathology. Avoid ruminating and indulging intrusive thoughts. Instead, try the following coping strategies, which I have found helpful. Find your support: Share your concerns with trusted people who will validate your feelings and remind you that you are not alone on this journey. Find and accept distractions: Enjoy pleasant activities with friends. If you are a parent, play with your kids. Go out for ice cream or your favorite treats. Seek ways to have fun. Focus on positive thoughts and anticipate the success of your plan: Trust that your health-care team will implement an effective plan for an optimal outcome. Advocate for yourself: If your test results are taking longer than expected, contact your provider. They may be able to provide insight about the delay as well as reassurance. Clinicians To my fellow oncology clinicians: The experience of being diagnosed with cancer has offered me the following perspectives about my practice and provision of care, which I share: Writing the note: Pay careful attention to how a note is written and when it is signed, as it will likely post to most electronic medical records immediately. Consider signing notes during business hours so that if patients read them and have questions, they can message a request for clarification without having to wait overnight, or worse yet, over a weekend. Delivering the news: I encourage health-care providers to consider contacting patients with results immediately, even at the end of the day. Some clinicians may feel reticent to give bad news before a weekend; however, research suggests that patients prefer hearing bad news with a plan over waiting for imminent results ( Conley & Lenton, 2012 Sweeny & Falkenstein, 2015 Gustafsson et al., 1995 Lang et al., 2009 Baile et al., 2000 Harris & Gilligan, 2022 Communicating a plan: When delivering news, remind the patient that you, their health-care provider, have a plan. Whether that plan entails discussing possible treatments or involves surgery or chemotherapy, hearing that a plan is in place supports confidence and positivity and provides reassurance to patients. As a clinician, it is important to recognize the need for further conversations. Portnoy (2010) Oncology advanced practitioners are on the front line of patient care. We frequently deliver imaging and pathology results involving “bad news.” As an oncology provider who has experienced the unexpectedly intense distress of awaiting test results, I encourage providers to be aware of the strong psychological impact of anticipating test (laboratory, imaging, pathology) results. Even minor changes in practice, such as how and when we communicate results, can help patients cope more comfortably and confidently as they embark on a cancer journey.
