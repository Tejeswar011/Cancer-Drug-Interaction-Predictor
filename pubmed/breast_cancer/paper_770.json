Evidence demonstrates that screening identifies patients with earlier disease to improve survival. It is imperative that diagnostic biomarkers are efficiently translated to clinical practice. Aim We aimed to assess the state of biomarker translation by comparing the number of diagnostic colorectal cancer biomarkers in clinical use (successful) with the total number of discovered diagnostic colorectal cancer biomarkers not yet clinically useful (stalled). Method A literature search identified all published diagnostic colorectal cancer biomarkers. Data was extracted from eligible papers including biomarker name, authors, journal and impact factor, and publication date. Guidelines from national and international authorities/groups were searched and a clinical expert consulted to identify successful diagnostic colorectal cancer biomarkers. Outcomes included number of stalled and successful diagnostic colorectal cancer biomarkers discovered in the literature, number of publications for each biomarker and their highest journal impact factor. Results After screening >32,000 papers, 2,910 diagnostic colorectal cancer biomarkers were identified. Of these, four were approved for use in patient care at the time of review, representing a translation rate of just 0.14%. Successful biomarkers were found to have a higher publication frequency, and higher journal impact factor when compared to stalled biomarkers. Conclusion This study demonstrates a profoundly low rate of translation of diagnostic colorectal cancer biomarkers and identifies the huge translation gap within this field. 84% of biomarkers have only one published paper, suggesting a lack of progression toward approval and commercialisation. There is great scope for improved biomarker translation. translational science colorectal cancer biomarker clinical utility clinical implementation The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

In the United Kingdom (UK), the stool faecal immunochemical test (FIT) is the primary tool used in the National Bowel Cancer Screening programme. It is also deployed as a triage test for symptomatic patients ( 4 Despite being used in both the UK and USA bowel cancer screening programmes, FIT suffers from low sensitivity and specificity (especially as a diagnostic tool for pre-cancerous polyps), as well as poor acceptance from patients ( 5 6 7 8 9 This novel study addresses this gap by quantifying the current state of translation of diagnostic CRC biomarkers, by tracking the progress of these biomarkers toward clinical adoption in the literature. By identifying the true scale of the failure of biomarker translation, we hope to galvanise efforts to improve the current translation process and reduce academic wastage. We hypothesis that there will be a large translation gap in the number of discovered versus clinically useful CRC biomarkers and our objective is to assess if the number of publications, publication frequency and impact factor of the journal used have any bearing on the translation status. This involves performing a literature search to identify all the diagnostic CRC biomarkers discovered and then compare them with known translated diagnostic CRC biomarkers. Materials and methods Search strategy and selection criteria A systematic literature search was conducted in Ovid Medline and Embase databases in August 2023 to identify all publications exploring diagnostic CRC biomarkers. No date limit was set, and keywords such as “colorectal cancer,” “biomarker,” and “diagnosis,” were included (full list of search terms available in Appendix A Articles identified in the literature search were uploaded to the Covidence platform (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia). Duplicates were removed automatically by Covidence, and any that were not detected by the software were manually removed by the reviewers (AEB & JK). Papers were screened by abstract for eligibility by two reviewers (AEB & JK), with conflicts resolved by a third reviewer (KVS). Data extraction Eligible papers were exported to Microsoft Excel for full text review, and relevant papers had their data extracted and manually tabulated. The data extracted from each publication included author, journal, publication date, biomarker/s identified, and journal impact factor. Data from 10% of papers was extracted by three reviewers independently (JK, AEB, and PG) to assess inter-reviewer disparity. For papers that presented multiple biomarkers, these were extracted as individual biomarkers, unless they were tested as a panel, in which case they were considered one biomarker. Biomarkers were checked for multiple spellings or abbreviations so that recurring biomarkers were counted together. The impact factor of each publication journal, at the time of publication, was retrieved from online databases ( 10 Approved diagnostic CRC biomarkers Successful biomarkers were defined as those approved for use by clinical authorities and guidelines, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) ( 4 11 12 Statistical analysis Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism v8.0.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, California USA). Data analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS Statistics v28.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, N.Y., USA). Normality of data for successful and stalled biomarkers was assessed using a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Differences between impact factor and average publication frequency of the two groups were assessed for significance using a Mann Whitney U test. Differences between the number of publications for successful biomarkers before and after clinical translation were also evaluated using a Mann Whitney U test. Binary logistic regression was used to assess the probability of a biomarker’s translation status with respect to the variables of publication history and journal impact factor. A p Results Literature search Following the literature search, 40,409 papers were imported, with 7,764 removed as duplicates, providing 32,645 to screen. Abstract and title screening produced 2,232 articles to be included in the full text screen. Following the exclusion of papers that did not fulfil the inclusion criteria, 1,977 papers were included in the final analysis ( Figure 1 Figure 1 PRISMA flowchart showing the studies included in the title and abstract screening, full text screening and qualitative analysis. Flowchart illustrating the article selection process for a qualitative analysis. Initially, 40,409 records were identified. After removing 7,764 duplicates, 32,645 records underwent title and abstract screening. Of these, 30,413 articles were excluded for various reasons, such as not exploring diagnostic biomarkers or being reviews. Thereafter, 2,232 articles were screened in full text, with 255 further excluded. Ultimately, 1,977 articles were included in the qualitative analysis. Translation rate for diagnostic colorectal cancer biomarkers A total of 2,910 diagnostic CRC biomarkers (both individual markers and panels) were extracted from the literature. Guidelines from healthcare authorities and organisations were screened, and a CRC expert consulted to identify successful biomarkers, as detailed in methods and Table 1 n Table 1 Diagnostic CRC biomarkers recommended for use as per national guidelines and approval bodies.

Publication pattern The publication frequency for each biomarker is demonstrated in Figure 2a Figure 2 Publications and biomarkers identified from 1972–2023. (a) n (b) n n (c) n n p Three charts depict biomarker publication data. Chart (a) shows biomarker frequency against publication range, comparing successful and stalled biomarkers. Chart (b) illustrates publication frequency over time, from 1970 to 2020, for both biomarker types. Chart (c) displays a comparison of journal impact factors, highlighting a significant difference between stalled and successful biomarkers, with successful ones associated with higher impact factors. There was a larger number of publications within the stalled group of biomarkers (1881 vs. 210) compared to the successful group ( Figure 2b Since many publications included more than one biomarker, the number of biomarkers is higher than the total number of publications. A Mann-Whitney U test was performed to compare the publication frequency in both groups and was significant ( p Figure 2b To further investigate publication history, bar charts demonstrating the publication frequency of the four successful biomarkers (FIT, gFOBT, mSEPT9, and Cologuard) were plotted ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Bar charts demonstrating publication frequency for each successful diagnostic CRC biomarker. (a) (b) (c) (d) Bar graphs displaying the frequency of publications from 1995 to 2020 for four tests: FIT (a), gFOBT (b), Cologuard (c), and mSEPT9 (d). FIT shows a peak around 2020, gFOBT peaks in 2005, Cologuard starts around 2015, with increased publications thereafter, and mSEPT9 shows rising publications from 2015, peaking by 2020. The year successful biomarkers were approved for use by healthcare authorities ( Table 1 p Average publication history for the successful group of biomarkers was calculated to be 19 years (FIT = 27, gFOBT = 23, mSEPT9 = 16, Cologuard = 11). Due to the large disparity in size of the successful and stalled group of biomarkers (successful biomarker group: 4 vs. stalled biomarker group: 2906), the average biomarker publication history was measured for a random selection of five biomarkers within each publication frequency range (2–5, 6–10, 11–20, >20). Successful biomarkers had a higher average publication history than biomarkers within the 2–5 range (8 years; ZN346, glutamine, mir-210, mir-101 and transferrin), and the 6–10 frequency range (15.8 years; VEGF, AFP, CRP, MMP7 and mir-29a). However, the randomly selected stalled biomarkers within the 11–20 frequency range (p53 antibodies, calprotectin, SDC2, CA125, and MMP9) had a higher average publication history (23.4 years), as did stalled biomarkers within the >20 publications category (31.8 years; CEA, CA19-9, CEA/CA19-9 panel, M2PK and mir-21). The publication history for one random biomarker from each frequency range is displayed in Figure 4 Figure 4 p Figure 4 Bar charts demonstrating publication frequency for one stalled biomarker from each publication frequency range. (a) (b) (c) (d) Bar charts showing frequency of publications for four biomarkers: a) ZNF346 from 1995 to 2020 with sporadic publications, b) VEGF also from 1995 to 2020 with few publications, c) MMP9 from 2000 to 2020 showing slight increase, and d) CEA from 1970 to 2020 with significant growth, especially after 2000. Each chart includes dashed lines for intervals and the number of published papers on the y-axis. Journal impact factor The maximum impact factor for publications for the successful and stalled biomarkers were recorded and compared ( Figure 2c p p Discussion The key outcomes from this study are (i) the quantification of the scale of the translation gap for diagnostic CRC biomarkers, with only 0.14% of those found in the literature being used by patients, and (ii) that successful biomarkers are associated with a significantly higher frequency of publications and published in higher impact journals. This strikingly low rate of translation speaks to the complex issues and barriers along the biomarker translational pipeline ( 13 8 The strength of this study lies in its unbiased approach to reviewing all discovered diagnostic CRC biomarkers in the literature. It is the first time that the actual number of biomarkers within this research field has been elucidated and offers a stark demonstration of the inefficiency of the current translation process. It is a simple study that proves our hypothesis and provides a compelling argument for improving biomarker translation efficiency. Previous studies have looked more broadly into discovered candidate proteins as cancer biomarkers, but not specifically within the field of diagnostic CRC biomarkers ( 14 15 In terms of limitations, is likely that this study is an underrepresentation of the total number of papers and biomarkers involved in this field, as later work involving individual biomarker systematic searches (data not shown) resulted in higher numbers of eligible papers. By widening the net to include all possible diagnostic CRC biomarkers, the ability to identify every paper for each biomarker was diminished. The large discrepancy in size between the two groups also made statistical analysis more limited. To confirm the robustness of our findings despite imbalanced group sizes, permutation tests were done to compare groups using Python 3.11. There was a statistically significant difference in publication frequency between successful and stalled biomarkers, with a difference of 55.43 publications (95% CI: −0.64 to 2.61; p p Although our analysis did not directly assess the sensitivity or specificity of individual biomarkers, these diagnostic performance metrics are known to play a critical role in clinical adoption. The absence or inconsistency of such data across studies represents a significant translational barrier and should be prioritised in future evaluations. Given the volume of included studies, it was beyond the scope of this review to examine additional factors, such as diagnostic performance, assay platform, or biomarker type, for successful versus stalled biomarkers. However, our group has previously demonstrated no significant differences in performance metrics (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, AUROC, positive predictive value) between successful and stalled prognostic biomarkers in breast and colorectal cancer ( 16 17 Future work should explore how diagnostic performance metrics interact with practical assay features, such as cost-effectiveness, automation potential, and time-to-result—to influence translational success. A more comprehensive understanding of these interactions could support more effective biomarker development and prioritisation, as exemplified by recent efforts to build structured decision-support tools like the Biomarker Toolkit ( 16 Despite the exponential increase in diagnostic CRC biomarkers published papers, only four are currently approved for routine use. Most of the stalled biomarkers in this study (84.3%) have only ever featured in one published paper. Only five stalled biomarkers are associated with >20 publications. Two of those biomarkers (CEA, CA19-9) are biomarkers that are in routine use for other indications (CRC recurrence, pancreatic cancer monitoring), but not approved for use in diagnosing CRC. However, due to the dearth of approved diagnostic CRC biomarkers, these were often used in papers as the reference standard, which may go some way to explain their high publication frequency in this study, despite their stalled status. Three of the successful biomarkers had >20 papers associated with them, and the other one was within the 11–20 publication range. Overall, the average publication history for the successful group was higher than the randomly selected stalled biomarkers within the lower publication frequency ranges ( 2–10 18 The high rate of biomarkers associated with only one paper highlights a potential flaw in academia, where it remains easier to publish discovery studies, which may help maintain scientists’ grants and career progression, whilst well-powered validation studies and cost-effectiveness studies are less likely to be performed ( 15 9 This review covered more than 30 years, providing representative information for translation, as more recent studies have corroborated the limited translation of CRC biomarkers ( 19 20 21 22 Each stalled biomarker in the literature represents academic wastage ( 23 16 We would like to show our gratitude to HealthTech Research Centre In Vitro Data availability statement The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/ Supplementary material Author contributions AB: Writing – review & editing, Funding acquisition, Validation, Supervision, Formal analysis, Writing – original draft, Methodology, Software, Data curation, Investigation, Visualization.
