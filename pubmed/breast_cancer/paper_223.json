To meet these demands, cells initially rely on a relative shift towards glycolysis, rather than oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), to generate bioenergetics and biosynthetic macromolecules 1 3 4 5 1a 2 6 7 8 9 Fig. 1 APC/C transiently inactivates during the G0/G1 transition. a b n c n d e f n g h g i g h j a Source data APC/C transiently inactivates at the G0/G1 transition The current model of cell cycle entry includes three key components: (1) glycolysis is necessary for cell cycle entry 10 11 2 6 9 12 1a 1a 13 1b 10 1b 1c,d 1e,f 1g–i FZR1 1c 2 6 8 14 2a 1d–f 2b 1 9 2c–e 2f,g 2h–l To further characterize this transient APC/C inactivation, we carefully measured the APC/C activity during cell cycle entry after the addition of full growth medium (hereafter, mitogen stimulation) when the geminin-based APC/C-activity biosensor had accumulated above background levels. We also measured the APC/C activity after treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, which represents complete inhibition of the APC/C. We then determined the relative percentage of APC/C inhibition during the G0/G1 transition compared with complete inhibition after MG132 treatment. As the APC/C biosensor is under the control of a constitutive promoter, the slope of the increase in biosensor fluorescence is indicative of the relative APC/C activity in the cells 8 1g–i 2m,n 8 1j mTORC1 inactivates APC/C via phosphorylation We investigated the mechanism underlying transient APC/C inactivation by first testing the involvement of known negative regulators of the APC/C (Extended Data Fig. 3a β-TrCP cyclin F 15 16 17 18 21 3b–g 2a RPTOR RICTOR 2b,c 3h–m Fig. 2 mTORC1 phosphorylates APC/C during cell cycle entry. a b c b n c n P d n e n f n g n P h n i h P j n k NTD n l NTD k n P m 5m n n P Source data Immunoprecipitation of whole-cell lysates collected from MCF-10A cells entering the cell cycle (4 h after mitogen stimulation) using either a CDH1, an mTOR or an unrelated protein antibody confirmed specific binding of CDH1 to the mTORC1 complex (Fig. 2d 4a–c 4d 2e 2f 4e–i 4j 4j Phosphoproteomic analysis of CDH1 using mass spectrometry (MS) identified threonine 129 (Thr129) or tyrosine 130 (Tyr130) as a potential site of mTOR-mediated phosphorylation (Extended Data Fig. 5a 5b,c 5d 5e,f 2g 5g 2h,i 2j We assessed the effect of mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of CDH1 and observed that CDH1(T129D) bound less effectively to the core APC/C (Extended Data Fig. 5h,i 2k,l 5j,k 2k,l 22 5l 22 To determine the effect of mTOR-mediated CDH1 phosphorylation on APC/C activity during cell cycle entry, we introduced exogenous CDH1(T129A) and CDH1(T129D) mutants into MCF-10A cells that were entering the cell cycle and then measured transient APC/C inactivation. Expression of the T129A mutant reduced transient APC/C inactivation to similar levels as rapamycin treatment, acting in a dominant-negative manner (Fig. 2m 5m 2m 5m 2 CDH1 5n,o APC/C regulation by an incoherent feedforward loop Having established that mTOR-mediated phosphorylation of CDH1 is responsible for transient APC/C inactivation, we next sought to understand how and why the APC/C gets reactivated to generate the transient APC/C inactivation that we observed in our live-cell imaging experiments. We considered two main hypotheses: either mTOR itself is activated transiently or a protein phosphatase removes the mTOR-mediated phosphorylation from CDH1 (Fig. 3a 6a,b 23 25 3b 6c 3 6d 3c 3d Fig. 3 An incoherent feedforward loop controls APC/C activity during cell cycle entry. a b 3 4 c n d n e n f g h Source data We next investigated the timing and interplay between mTOR-mediated APC/C inactivation and protein-phosphatase-mediated APC/C reactivation. Inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin within 1 h of mitogen stimulation blocked the transient APC/C inactivation but, when rapamycin was added two or more hours after mitogen stimulation, the APC/C transiently inactivated to similar levels to the control (Fig. 3e 6a 4j 3e 3f 6e,f 26 27 3g 3h Transient APC/C inactivation boosts glycolysis Given that APC/C transiently inactivates during cell cycle entry and that APC/C inhibits glycolysis, we hypothesized that cells may transiently shift to glycolysis during the 1–6 h when the APC/C is partially inactivated. One of the APC/C substrates linked to glycolysis is PFKFB3, a key enzyme regulating glycolytic flux 1 2 28 29 2 6 7a–c 7d 6 7e 4a 7f 4b 8a–g 8h,i PFKFB3 8j 4c 4d 8k,l 4e Fig. 4 PFKFB3 transiently accumulates during cell cycle entry to promote a metabolic switch. a b a b n a n b P c d CDH1 c d n e n f g f g n P h f n i −1 −1 n j n P k n P l n Source data To determine whether the PFKBF3 accumulation by transient APC/C inactivation leads to a pulse of bioenergetics 29 4f,g 1 28 29 9a 4h 9b,c 30 4i 9d,e 9f 31 PFKFB3 4j 9g–i 4k 4l 32 33 KEN-mut 9j 4j,k 34 9k,l Transient APC/C inactivation aids cell cycle entry Having established that transient APC/C inactivation is needed for the proper management of bioenergetics and biosynthetic macromolecules during cell cycle entry, we hypothesized that transient APC/C inactivation is necessary for cell cycle entry. To test this hypothesis, we exogenously expressed the CDH1(T129A) and CDH1(T129D) mutants in MCF-10A cells entering the cell cycle and monitored cell cycle entry using the CDK2 biosensor. We observed that expression of the CDH1(T129A) mutant significantly reduced the number of cells that activate CDK2, enter the cell cycle and proliferate (Fig. 5a–d 10a 5a–d 10b 10c–f Fig. 5 Transient APC/C inactivation promotes cell cycle entry. a n b a n P c n d c n P e Source data Discussion Here we show how cells coordinate the dual but mutually exclusive requirement for APC/C activity and glycolysis during cell cycle entry. Typically, the APC/C functions as a molecular switch by turning on or off to control progression through critical cell cycle phase transitions using signalling motifs involving positive and negative feedback loops 9 15 16 35 7 9 5e 36 Our findings demonstrate that transient inactivation of APC/C during cell cycle entry triggers a metabolic switch favouring glycolysis dependent on PFKFB3 in normal cells. Notably, cancer cells exhibit a distinct metabolic phenotype, often relying on glycolysis for their sustenance and rapid proliferation. As our data indicate this APC/C-mediated metabolic shift promotes cell cycle entry, it may be deregulated in diseases such as cancer, which often display perturbed cell cycle entry mechanisms 37 Methods Cell culture Human MCF-10A, human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE-1), human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) and transformed human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells were obtained from ATCC. MEFs were gift from J. Vidigal. Cell lines not obtained from ATCC were not authenticated. MEFs, HLFs and HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagles medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Life Technologies) containing 10% FBS (Gibco). MCF-10A cells were cultured in the following full-growth medium: phenol-red-free DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% horse serum, 20 ng ml −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 l −1 2 on Constructs and stable cell lines CSII-pEF1α-H2B-mTurquoise, CSII-pEF1α-mCherry-Geminin(amino acids 1–110) and CSII-pEF1α-DHB(amino acids 994–1087)-mVenus were described previously 8 13 30 KEN-mut 2 Treatment of cells Cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO, Sigma-Aldrich, D2650), 100 nM of rapamycin (Tocris Biosciences, 1292/1), 10 nM of RMC6272 (Medchem Express, HY-134904), 100 nM of PD0325901 (MEKi) (Selleckchem, S1036), 10 µM of RO3306 (Calbiochem, SIG217714), 1 µM of palbociclib (Selleckchem, S1116), 2.5 µM PFK15 (Selleck Chem, S7289), 5 mM 2-deoxy glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, D8375), d 13 6 −1 −1 −1 Antibodies The following antibodies were used in this study; CDH1 (FZR1) antibody (Abcam, Ab217038 siRNA transfection The indicated cells were transfected using Dharmafect 1 (Horizon) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The following siRNAs were used: On-Target plus control siRNA (nontargeting, Dharmacon), On-Target plus pooled set of four siRNAs for CCNA2 FZR1 EMI1 CCNF BTRC PFKFB3 TSC1 NPRL2 CDH1 Time-lapse microscopy Before imaging, cells were plated in a 96-well plate (Ibidi, 89626) and allowed to grow in full growth medium for 24 h. Time-lapse imaging was conducted in 200 μl full growth medium, with images captured in CFP, YFP and RFP channels every 12 min using a Nikon Ti2-E inverted microscope (Nikon) with NIS elements (V5.11.00) equipped with ×10/0.45 NA and ×20/0.75 NA Plan Apo objectives. To minimize phototoxicity, the total light exposure time was kept under 300 ms (30 ms for CFP, 200 ms for YFP and 300 ms for mCherry) for each timepoint. The cells were imaged in a humidified chamber at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 Cell lysate preparation and immunoblotting The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and collected. Whole-cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na 3 4 g Immunoprecipitation The cells were lysed as described above (see the ‘Cell lysate preparation and immunoblotting’ section). A total of 300–500 μg of whole-cell lysate was co-immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of antibody and IgG control in 500 µl of modified IP lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH7.4, 200 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM Na 3 4 For co-IP of purified protein, 200 ng of His–CDH1 was allowed to bind to the beads overnight followed by washing and addition of purified mTOR. The whole complex was kept at 4 °C with rotation for 1 h followed by washing and elution using 1× SDS-Laemmli buffer. For untagged purified protein co-IPs, magnetic Flag beads (A36797, Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used and DDK–mTOR (Sigma-Aldrich, SRP0364)/DDK–DYRK4 (Carna Biosciences, 04-434) was allowed to bind to the beads overnight at 4 °C followed by washing and addition of purified WT or mutant CDH1 or His–SUMO–CDH1 (Mybiosource, MBS1437931). The whole complex was kept at 4 °C with rotation for 1 h followed by washing and elution using 1× SDS-Laemmli buffer. In vitro kinase assay A total of 200 ng of untagged human CDH1 or His–SUMO–CDH1 purified protein was incubated with 200 ng of DDK-tagged human mTOR protein (Carna Biosciences or Sigma-Aldrich), GST–CDK1–cyclin B (Carna Biosciences, 04-102), GST–ERK (Reaction Biology, 0883-0000-1) or Flag–DYRK4 (Carna Biosciences, 04-434) in 1× kinase buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, 9802). The assay was performed with 100 µM of ATP (Cell Signaling Technology, 9804) at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by addition of 4×-reducing SDS sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 10 min. The reaction was resolved by SDS–PAGE and immunoblotting was performed as stated above. Ubiquitination assay Before collection, cells were treated with 10 μM of MG132 for 3–4 h (except where otherwise mentioned). After collection, whole-cell lysates were prepared and 300–500 μg of lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation using the indicated antibodies. The immunoprecipitate obtained was separated using SDS–PAGE and probed with anti-ubiquitin antibodies to determine the levels of ubiquitylation. In vitro phosphorylation of CDH1 for ubiquitination assay CDH1 purified from baculoviral infected insect cells was subjected to phosphorylation by recombinant Flag–mTOR + mLST8 (Carna Biosciences, 11-431). Then, 1 µM CDH1 WT, T129A or T129D was mixed with buffer or 10 ng µl −1 2 4 g In vitro ubiquitination assays Ubiquitination assays were performed with recombinant APC/C, UBE2C, UBA1, substrates, ubiquitin and CDH1 as previously described 38 39 NTD 2 Image analysis Custom MATLAB scripts were used for all image analyses, according to previously described methods 8 13 OPP assay Cells were seeded and starved for 48 h. After 24 h of the starvation, empty vector, CDH1(T129A) or CDH1(T129D) mutant was ectopically expressed in the cells and after 6 h of transfection medium was replaced with starvation medium. Cells were released as described above and incubated with 20 µM of O C10458 Glycolysis and ATP rate measurements by extracellular flux assays To measure glycolytic function of cells, the Glycolysis Stress Test Kit (Agilent technologies, 103020-100) was used. To measure the glycolytic bioenergetics of cells, the Glycolytic Rate Assay Kit (Agilent technologies, 103344-100) was used. To distinguish between the fraction of ATP produced from mitochondrial OXPHOS and glycolysis, the ATP Rate Assay Kit (Agilent technologies, 103591-100) was used. For all of the assays, cells were initially seeded at a density of 10,000 cells per well in an XF96-well plate precoated with poly-lysine. For ectopic overexpression or silencing, Lipofectamine 3000 or Dharmafect 1 (Horizon) were used to transfect cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 h of transfection, cells were released with complete medium with or without drugs for another 3 h. After release, for the glycolysis stress test, cells were washed and incubated with Seahorse XF DMEM medium, pH 7.4 (Agilent Technologies, 103575-100) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine. Glucose, oligomycin and 2-DG were added to cells sequentially at the specific timepoint with final concentrations of 10 mM, 1 μM and 50 mM, respectively. For the glycolytic rate assay, cells were washed and incubated with Seahorse XF DMEM medium, pH 7.4 (Agilent Technologies, 103575-100) supplemented with 10 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate and 2 mM glutamine. Antimycin/rotenone and 2-DG were added to cells sequentially at the specific timepoint with final concentrations of 0.5 μM and 50 mM, respectively. For the ATP rate test, cells were washed and incubated with Seahorse XF DMEM medium, pH 7.4 (Agilent Technologies, 103575-100) supplemented with 10 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate and 2 mM glutamine. Oligomycin and antimycin/rotenone were applied with final concentrations of 1.0 μM and 0.5 μM, respectively. The oxygen-consumption rate and ECAR was collected using the Agilent Seahorse Wave 2.6.1 desktop software. Data were normalized to the cell number determined using the crystal violet assay and analysed using the Wave software. ATP measurements Cells were seeded at a density of 5,000 cells per well in a 96-well plate and incubated with complete growth medium for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with starvation medium and incubated for another 24 h. The cells were then transfected with either siControl or siPFKFB3 (using Dharmafect, Horizon) or CDH1(T129A) and CDH1(T129D) (using Lipofectamine 3000, Invitrogen). Then, 6 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with starvation medium. After another 24 h, the cells were mitogen-stimulated to promote cell cycle entry. Then, 4 h after stimulation, the medium was replaced with chilled PBS and the sample was kept on an iron slab on ice to stop or slow down the metabolic turnover 40 41 qPCR with reverse transcription Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using the RLT RNeasy 96 Qiacube HT Kit (Qiagen, 74171) and on-column DNA digestion was performed using the Qiagen DNA digestion kit (79254). The cDNA was synthesized using the Bio-Rad cDNA preparation kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, starting with 1 µg of total RNA. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed using the Bio-Rad SYBR green qPCR Mix.

The digested peptide samples were acidified by formic acid to a final concentration of 1% and desalted using Pierce peptide desalting columns according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were eluted from the columns using 50% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid, vacuum centrifuged to dry and stored at −80 °C until analysed by MS. MS acquisition and data analysis Dried peptide fractions were reconstituted in 0.1% TFA and subjected to nanoflow liquid chromatography (Thermo Ultimate 3000 RSLC nano LC system, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Eclipse mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The precursor ion tolerance was set at 10 ppm and the fragment ions tolerance was set at 0.02 Da along with methionine oxidation and phosphorylation of serine, threonine and tyrosine included as dynamic modification. Arg-C was specified as the proteolytic enzyme, with up to two missed cleavage sites allowed. The HCD fragmentation pattern of the peptide [KGLFT*YSLSTKR] is shown. The red colour peaks shown in Extended Data Fig. 5 Sample preparation for metabolomics Cells were serum-starved for 48 h to induce quiescence. After starvation, cells were transfected with either empty vector or CDH1(T129A). The medium was replaced with fresh starvation medium at 6 h after transfection. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS 24 h after transfection and the medium was replaced with glucose-free starvation medium for 1 h. Cells were then incubated with either standard starvation medium or mitogen-rich medium containing dialysed horse serum supplemented with labelled glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, CLM-1396-2). Cells were washed with 1× PBS, placed on ice, and collected by scraping followed by quick freezing in liquid nitrogen for subsequent analysis. Reversed-phase ion-pairing LC–MS/MS analysis for cell 13 6 The unlabelled glycolytic metabolite reference compounds were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. OmniSolv LC–MS grade acetonitrile and methanol were obtained from EMD Millipore. Tributylamine (TBA), LC–MS grade acetic acid and formic acid were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. All chemicals and solvents used in this study were HPLC or reagent grade unless otherwise noted. Metabolite extraction was performed by adding 200 µl chilled 80% methanol–water solution to the cell pellet as previously described 43 g −1 13 6 44 45 Statistical analysis and reproducibility Statistical analyses were performed in MATLAB (MathWorks, vR2020b) and Prism (GraphPad 9, v.9.2.0). Specific statistical tests used are noted in the figure legends. No statistical method was used to determine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized, but unbiased, automated analysis was used to ensure that observer bias did not influence the experimental results.
