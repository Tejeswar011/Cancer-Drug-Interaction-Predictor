Introduction Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive skin tumor originating from melanocytes, pigment-producing cells of the epidermis. Despite representing only about 1% of all skin cancers, it is responsible for the majority of skin cancer-related deaths, reflecting its highly invasive nature. Over the past decades, the incidence of melanoma has been steadily increasing worldwide. In 2020, approximately 325,000 new cases and 57,000 deaths were reported globally, with the highest age-standardized incidence observed in Australia and New Zealand, followed by North America and Northern Europe. In contrast, substantially lower rates are reported in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, a disparity largely explained by differences in skin phototype and in patterns of ultraviolet (UV) exposure [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Melanoma encompasses several subtypes, each associated with distinct etiological and molecular features. Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common form, especially in fair-skinned populations, and typically arises in intermittently sun-exposed areas, often harboring BRAF V600E mutations. Nodular melanoma, by contrast, is characterized by rapid vertical growth. This subtype is associated with an unfavorable prognosis because it tends to present at greater thickness. Acral lentiginous melanoma, which is more prevalent among individuals with darker skin types, typically occurs on glabrous sites such as the palms, soles, and nail beds. Unlike other melanoma subtypes, it is not strongly associated with UV exposure. Other less common variants, including mucosal and uveal melanomas, pose particular clinical challenges due to their aggressiveness and frequent progression to advanced stages [ 10 11 12 13 Cutaneous melanoma is currently staged using the 8th edition of the AJCC staging system [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 14 Staging defines prognosis and guides treatment, particularly decisions regarding sentinel lymph node biopsy, adjuvant systemic therapy, and clinical trial eligibility. In fact, the management of regional lymph nodes in patients with cutaneous melanoma has undergone a profound transformation over the past several decades. This evolution reflects significant advances in surgical techniques, diagnostic modalities and a growing understanding of melanoma biology and its metastatic behavior. A critical aspect of melanoma progression is its propensity to spread via the lymphatic system. For this reason, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has become a cornerstone of melanoma staging. Introduced in the 1990s, the procedure involves peritumoral injection of radiotracers and/or vital dyes to map lymphatic drainage and identify the sentinel lymph node (SLN) intraoperatively [ 22 23 24 25 26 4 27 28 29 30 29 30 As a result, the current standard of care has shifted away from mandatory CLND for patients with positive SLNB. Careful nodal observation, coupled with adjuvant systemic therapies, has become the preferred strategy in many guidelines for patients with Stage III of disease [ 4 27 28 This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive examination of the evolving role of lymphadenectomy in cutaneous melanoma, highlighting the shift from routine CLND to more selective strategies. By synthesizing the latest clinical trial evidence and current surgical principles, this review seeks to clarify ongoing controversies and to underscore the need for an updated appraisal of current literature to better define the contemporary management in melanoma patients with Stage III disease. 2. Materials and Methods A comprehensive literature search was performed using three major biomedical databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. No temporal limits were applied in the literature search in order to capture both historical and contemporary evidence on the management of regional lymph nodes in cutaneous melanoma. A narrative review methodology was chosen for this work in order to provide a comprehensive and contextualized overview: in fact, by synthesizing diverse strands of evidence and clinical reasoning, this approach provides a broad yet critical appraisal of the literature. The strategy incorporated a targeted set of keywords, including “cutaneous melanoma AND elective lymph node dissection OR elective lymphadenectomy AND completion lymph node dissection OR completion lymphadenectomy AND therapeutic lymph node dissection AND sentinel lymph node biopsy”. The initial search across PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science yielded a total of 1246 records. After removing duplicates, articles were screened based on titles and abstracts independently by two different authors (M.M. and R.C.). Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials, prospective or retrospective cohort studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical practice guidelines regarding patients with only cutaneous melanoma, that constitute the highest tiers of evidence-based medicine, providing a robust framework for evaluating the safety, efficacy and optimal indications of SLNB and lymph node dissection. Exclusion criteria were non-English language publications, case reports, editorials, or narrative commentaries without original data and studies focusing exclusively on non-cutaneous melanoma subtypes (e.g., uveal or mucosal). 98 studies were ultimately used to prepare this narrative review. The searching strategy is reported in Figure 1 No statistical analysis was performed. 3. From Handley to Morton: The Development of Lymphatic Surgery in Melanoma A clear understanding of the developments in regional lymph node management requires familiarity with the specific terminology and definitions of the surgical techniques currently employed. The term “elective lymph node dissection” (ELND) refers to surgical removal of all lymph nodes in a regional basin without prior radiological or pathological evidence of nodal metastases. The term “therapeutic lymph node dissection” (TLND) is defined as surgical removal of all lymph nodes in a regional basin for clinically or macroscopic radiologically nodal metastases. Instead, by the term “Completion lymph node dissection” (CLND) we mean the surgical lymph node dissection after microscopic metastasis are identified, typically following a positive SLNB. The origins of lymph node dissection in the treatment of cutaneous melanoma can be traced back to the early 20th century, rooted in the prevailing concept of regional disease control. Among the earliest and most influential figures in this domain was William Heneage Ogilvie Handley, a British surgeon and pathologist. In 1905, Handley published a landmark monograph in which he proposed a hypothesis on the lymphogenous spread of melanoma [ 31 Throughout the early and mid-20th century, Handley’s principles were widely embraced by surgical oncologists [ 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 Yet despite its widespread adoption, the clinical utility of ELND remained a subject of ongoing debate [ 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 The absence of randomized controlled data and the inability to reliably identify patients harboring occult nodal metastases raised concerns about overtreatment. Pathologic examination of dissected nodal basins revealed that a significant proportion of patients undergoing ELND had no histologic evidence of nodal involvement, suggesting that many were exposed to unnecessary surgical risk. By the 1970s and 1980s, the landscape began to shift. Advances in histopathologic techniques and a more nuanced understanding of melanoma biology prompted clinicians and researchers to seek less invasive methods for staging the regional nodal basin, methods that could spare patients from the morbidity associated with extensive dissections. This search culminated in the development of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) technique, which would prove to be a transformative milestone in melanoma surgery. Pioneered by Donald L. Morton [ 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 The timeline of the history of lymph node dissection and SLNB is illustrated in Figure 2 4. Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Completion Lymph Node Dissection: Evidence from Clinical Trials While the data have reinforced the clinical benefit of performing SLNB for its prognostic value, its role in guiding CLND has been more controversial and it has been rigorously evaluated through several studies. Historically, the sentinel lymph node was considered representative of the entire regional nodal basin. Consequently, a positive sentinel node was thought to indicate the need for completion lymph node dissection, with the aim of eradicating metastatic disease throughout the corresponding nodal basin. In the largest cohort of patients with a positive sentinel lymph node who underwent completion lymph node dissection, encompassing over 1500 individuals, non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) status emerged as an independent prognostic factor for melanoma-specific survival [ 64 65 One of the earliest and most influential investigations was the Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial I (MSLT-I) [ 66 Building on these findings, the MSLT-II trial [ 29 8 These results were further supported by the DeCOG-SLT trial [ 30 30 Together, these trials have contributed to a more nuanced understanding of nodal management in melanoma, shifting the emphasis from routine completion dissection to selective, evidence-based strategies that prioritize both oncologic outcomes and patient quality of life. 5. Complications Associated with Lymphadenectomy Completion lymph node dissection (CLND), while historically considered a standard approach for managing nodal metastases in melanoma, carries a significant burden of postoperative morbidity. These complications not only affect short-term recovery but also have lasting impacts on patient quality of life. Among the most frequent and debilitating complications is lymphedema, which can persist chronically and severely impair limb function. Reported incidence ranges from 20% to 50%, influenced by factors such as the anatomical site of dissection, extent of nodal clearance, patient obesity, and the use of adjuvant radiation therapy [ 67 68 69 Wound complications, including infection, necrosis, and delayed healing, affect approximately 10–30% of patients undergoing CLND [ 7 70 71 Seroma formation is another common early postoperative issue, occurring in 20–40% of cases. While often benign, seromas may require repeated aspirations and can increase the risk of secondary infection [ 70 Nerve injury is a particularly concerning complication, especially in anatomically complex regions. In inguinal dissections, the femoral, obturator, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves are vulnerable, while axillary dissections may affect the long thoracic and thoracodorsal nerves. These injuries can result in sensory deficits, neuropathic pain, and motor weakness, with long-term sequelae documented in up to 15% of patients [ 72 The cumulative morbidity associated with CLND was a driving force behind the design of pivotal trials such as MSLT-II [ 29 30 29 30 Complications associated with CLND and SLNB are resumed in Table 1 6. Current Guidelines on Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Lymphadenectomy in Melanoma: AIOM, ESMO, and NCCN Perspectives Contemporary clinical guidelines from leading oncology societies, including the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) [ 4 27 28 All three organizations endorse sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as the standard of care for staging clinically node-negative patients with intermediate or high-risk primary cutaneous melanoma. Specifically, SLNB is recommended for tumors with a Breslow thickness ≥ 0.8 mm, or for thinner lesions exhibiting adverse features such as ulceration or high mitotic rate. In contrast, elective lymph node dissection (ELND) is no longer routinely advised following a positive SLNB. This recommendation is grounded in robust evidence from randomized trials (e.g., MSLT-II [ 29 30 4 27 28 Collectively, these guidelines reflect a paradigm shift: lymph node surgery is no longer a default intervention but a selective tool, guided by tumor biology, imaging and systemic treatment strategies. A flowchart summarizing these recommendations is presented in Figure 3 7. The Evolving Role of Lymph Node Dissection in the Era of Systemic Therapy for Melanoma The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies has dramatically transformed the therapeutic landscape of Stage III cutaneous melanoma, reshaping the role of lymph node dissection within a broader, multidisciplinary framework [ 73 74 75 76 77 78 Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that adjuvant systemic therapies significantly improve both relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with resected Stage III melanoma. The KEYNOTE-054 trial [ 79 p 80 p 81 These findings underscore the critical importance of accurate nodal staging, primarily achieved through sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), in identifying candidates for adjuvant systemic therapy. As a result, CLND is no longer routinely performed in SLN-positive patients, given the lack of survival benefit and the increased risk of surgical morbidity. Emerging evidence from neoadjuvant trials further challenges the traditional indications for lymphadenectomy. The OpACIN-neo [ 82 83 In light of these developments, the role of lymph node dissection has become increasingly selective and context-dependent. While CLND remains appropriate in cases of gross nodal disease, progression during systemic therapy, or symptomatic lymphadenopathy, it is no longer indicated as a default intervention following a positive SLNB. Instead, surgical management is now tailored to complement systemic approaches, reflecting a paradigm shift toward precision oncology in melanoma care [ 84 8. The Limits of Sentinel Node Prognostic Value and Imaging-Based Surveillance in Melanoma Care Despite significant advances in the management of cutaneous melanoma, substantial controversy persists regarding the optimal treatment of patients with nodal disease. Notably, the pivotal adjuvant immunotherapy trials that established immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies as standards of care were conducted in the CLND era, when all patients with a positive sentinel node typically underwent nodal dissection. As a result, trial populations had more complete pathological staging and potentially different disease biology compared to current patients, many of whom retain their nodal basins under observation after a positive SLNB. This discrepancy raises important questions regarding the applicability of existing survival and recurrence data to present-day practice, where adjuvant therapies are increasingly administered without full pathological nodal clearance. Emerging evidence indicates that the prognostic significance of sentinel lymph node (SLN) status in cutaneous melanoma varies significantly depending on the primary tumor’s anatomical site. For melanomas located in the head and neck (HN) region, SLN positivity is strongly associated with worse survival outcomes: one study involving 331 patients reported a 5-year overall survival of 91.2% in SLN-negative cases versus only 48.7% in SLN-positive cases, with SLN status being the most powerful predictor of recurrence (hazard ratio ≈ 20.6, p 85 p p 86 87 High-resolution ultrasonography significantly outperforms computed tomography (CT) in the surveillance of regional lymph nodes for melanoma patients. Meta-analytic data indicate that ultrasound achieves a markedly higher sensitivity (96%; 95% CrI: 85–99%) and specificity (99%; 95% CrI: 95–100%), compared to CT’s more modest sensitivity of 61% (95% CrI: 15–93%) and specificity of 97% (95% CrI: 70–100%) [ 88 89 90 91 29 89 29 9. From Completion Lymphadenectomy to Index Node Resection: Evolving Surgical Strategies and the MSLT-3 Trial In recent years, the concept of index lymph node dissection (ILND), also referred to as “index node” management, has gained traction as a potentially less invasive alternative to completion lymph node dissection (CLND). This approach involves targeted removal of the single lymph node first identified by neoadjuvant immunotherapy, rather than performing extensive nodal dissection across all draining basins. In a multi-center analysis of patients treated with neoadjuvant ipilimumab–nivolumab, ILN response was highly representative of the entire basin: concordance with the TLND specimen was 99% at the patient level and 96% when compared against every individual node, supporting the ILN as a reliable surrogate for basin-wide response assessment. Building on this, the phase II PRADO extension (n = 99) operationalized ILN-guided personalization: patients achieving a major pathologic response (MPR; ≤10% viable tumor) in the ILN omitted TLND (59/60 did so) and adjuvant therapy, with markedly lower surgical morbidity and excellent 24-month outcomes (relapse-free survival 93%; distant metastasis-free survival 98%); partial responders had TLND only, and non-responders received TLND plus adjuvant therapy ± radiotherapy. Overall pathologic response was 72%, including 61% MPR, with grade 3–4 toxicity in 22% during the first 12 weeks [ 83 92 This evolving approach has been further reinforced by recent phase III trials. In the S1801 trial [ 93 94 These data reinforce that earlier systemic therapy combined with response-adapted surgical strategies (like ILND or omitting extensive dissection in patients with strong pathologic response) may achieve comparable oncologic safety while reducing morbidity. 10. Melanin Pigmentation in Cutaneous Melanoma: Implications for Disease Progression, Lymph Node Involvement and Therapeutic Decision-Making In cutaneous melanoma, melanin pigmentation is not merely a phenotypic trait but a biologically active factor that can modulate tumor behavior, therapeutic responsiveness, and the risk of lymphatic dissemination. Melanin’s dual role as a protectant against ultraviolet (UV) damage and as a modulator of tumor behavior necessitates rigorous assessment of pigmentation in clinical evaluations [ 7 95 96 97 Some analyses suggest that amelanotic melanomas, despite often being diagnosed at later stages due to their subtle clinical presentation, show a disproportionately higher rate of positive sentinel nodes relative to thickness-matched pigmented melanomas, warranting more aggressive nodal evaluation [ 96 97 Pigmentation also affects treatment planning and expected responsiveness. Melanin has been shown to interfere with the efficacy of radiotherapy by scavenging reactive oxygen species, thus protecting tumor cells from radiation-induced damage [ 98 7 These findings support the integration of pigmentation assessment into routine melanoma staging and treatment planning. Parameters such as tumor pigmentation degree, presence of amelanotic features, MC1R genotype and phototype should be documented, as they can modify the urgency and scope of nodal staging procedures, the choice of adjuvant therapy and even the prognostic expectations in terms of metastatic risk and treatment response. 11. Conclusions The management of regional lymph nodes in cutaneous melanoma has shifted dramatically over recent decades. Completion lymph node dissection (CLND), once routinely performed following sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), is now reserved for selected high-risk cases, reflecting robust evidence from randomized trials, real-world studies, and the impact of systemic therapies on regional disease control.

DeCOG-SLT (2016, 2019 final) [ 30 Patients with positive SLNB CLND vs. observation No survival advantage for CLND; reinforced shift towards active surveillance after SLNB positivity. COMBI-AD (2017) [ 81 BRAF V600-mutant resected Stage III melanoma Adjuvant dabrafenib + Trametinib Vs. Placebo 3-year RFS 58% Vs. 39% with placebo; established targeted therapy as standard adjuvant option in BRAF + patients. OpACIN-neo (2019, 2023 update) [ 82 Stage III melanoma Neoadjuvant ipilimumab nivolumab (different dosing arms) High pathologic response rates; responders had markedly improved RFS, supporting neoadjuvant immunotherapy as feasible and effective. PRADO (2022) [ 83 Stage III melanoma (extension of OpACIN-neo) Neoadjuvant ipilimumab + nivolumab; response-directed surgery 61% major pathologic response; in responders, TLND was safely omitted without increased recurrence, supporting response-adapted surgery. AIOM, ESMO, NCCN Guidelines [ 4 27 28 Clinical practice recommendations SLNB, CLND, surveillance, adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy All endorse SLNB for staging. ",
