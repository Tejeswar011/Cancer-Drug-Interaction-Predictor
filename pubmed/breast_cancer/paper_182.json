Perilipin 2 expression is related to poor prognosis of patients with various malignant tumors. It exists on the surface of lipid droplets (LDs), which store lipids that can be used as an energy source during cancer progression. However, the underlying mechanism of lipid metabolism involving LDs in the progression of lung adenocarcinoma is unclear. This study investigated the role of perilipin 2 in the regulation of lipid metabolism in lung adenocarcinoma, as well as patient prognosis. In clinicopathologic analyses, high perilipin 2 expression in adenocarcinomas was significantly associated with poor differentiation, blood vessel and pleural invasion, advanced cancer stage, and large tumor size relative to perilipin 2–negative cases. Furthermore, patients with high perilipin 2 expression had significantly shorter recurrence-free survival times. LD accumulation was significantly reduced in A549 and PC-9 lung adenocarcinoma cells with clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) genome editing–mediated knockout of PLIN 2 PLIN 2 PLIN 2 Graphical abstract pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers and has high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. 1 EGFR ALK ROS-1 BRAF MET KRAS 2 Cancer cells use lipids as an energy source to drive proliferation and invasion. 3 4 5 6 7 , 8 8 , 9 10 , 11 8 12 5 , 12 , 13 Several studies recently showed that perilipin 2 expression is associated with prognosis of patients with different types of malignant tumors, such as lung cancer, 14 15 16 17 18 19 , 20 21 22 23 EGFR 24 25 For lung adenocarcinoma prognosis and progression, the role of perilipin 2 remains largely unclear. The present study investigated the role of perilipin 2 in the regulation of lipid metabolism in progression of lung adenocarcinoma and its relationship with patient prognosis. Materials and Methods Histologic Samples of Lung Adenocarcinoma A total of 214 histologic samples were selected from patients with lung adenocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between 2010 and 2016 at the Teikyo University Hospital (Tokyo, Japan). Histologic samples from patients who: i) underwent chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy before surgery; ii) had recurrent tumor or distant tumor metastasis; or iii) were diagnosed as carcinoma with an undifferentiated or sarcomatoid component were excluded. Clinical data for patients with lung cancer, including age, sex, smoking history, treatment, and follow-up data, were collected from electronic medical records. The use of histologic samples and clinical data was approved by the ethics committee of Teikyo University (number 21-028). Histologic Analysis Preparation and analysis of histologic samples were performed as previously described. 26 1 Supplemental Figure S1 IHC Staining The methods for immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for perilipin 2, Ki-67, E-cadherin, and p53 are shown in Table 1 Supplemental Figure S2 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Supplemental Figure S2 27 , 28 Table 1 Appropriate Method for Each Primary Antibody Used in Immunohistochemical Staining Variable Antigen retrieval Primary antibody Solution Method Company Clone Dilution rate Perilipin 2 pH 9 40 Minutes in 95°C water bath PROGEN (Heidelberg, Germany) AP 125 200 Ki-67 pH 6 10 Minutes in 120°C autoclave treatment Dako (Glostrup, Denmark) MIB-1 600 E-cadherin pH 9 10 Minutes in 120°C autoclave treatment Novocastra (Newcastle, UK) 36B5 200 p53 pH 9 10 Minutes in 120°C autoclave treatment Dako DO-7 200 Figure 1 Pathologic features and survival of patients with perilipin 2 + – A: + – Top panels: + Bottom panels: – B: + arrowheads C: + + arrowheads D: + – + – E: + – A C Cell Culture The human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines A549 and PC-9 were obtained from the RIKEN BRC CELL BANK (Ibaraki, Japan) and cultured at 37°C in 5% CO 2 Establishment of Stable PLIN 2 Single-guide RNAs targeting PLIN2 Table 2 http://crispr.dbcls.jp https://chopchop.cbu.uib.no 29 EGFP PLIN2- EGFP 30 , 31 Table 2 Single-Guide RNAs Targeting PLIN 2 Variable Single-guide RNAs A549 Sense: 5′-CACCGGTGGCAGCCGGAGTCGTCTT-3′ PC-9 Sense: 5′-CACCGCGGTTGTGGATCAACTGCAA-3′ EGFP Sense: 5′-CACCGGAGCTGGACGGCGACGTAAA-3′ Immunofluorescence Staining of Cultured Cells Cells were seeded on culture slides (A549: Matsunami Glass, Osaka, Japan; PC-9: Corning, Corning, NY) at a density of 4 × 10 4 4 Western Blot Analysis Total protein was extracted using RIPA buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) and heated in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) at 95°C for 5 minutes. The protein was loaded onto NuPage 4% to 12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using i-Blot gel transfer stacks (Invitrogen) and treated with blocking buffer (3% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 hour at room temperature before an overnight incubation with perilipin 2 (E6G6M; 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology) in Can Get Signal Solution 1 (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) at 4°C. The membrane was treated with anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) in Can Get Signal Solution 2 (TOYOBO) at room temperature for 2 hours. The horseradish peroxidase signal was detected with Immunostar LD reagent (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical), and visualized using a C-DiGit blot scanner (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Cell Proliferation Assay A549 and PC-9 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (Greiner bio-one, Frickenhausen, Germany) at a density of 0.375 × 10 3 3 Cell Migration and Invasion Assay For the cell migration assay, cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10 4 4 Wound Healing Assay A549 and PC-9 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 3 × 10 4 4 Treatment of Accumulated LDs To investigate whether uptake of extracellular fatty acids affects formation of LDs and expression of perilipin 2, the present study performed immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry analysis. Cancer cells were treated with 100 μmol/L oleic acid (OA; Sigma-Aldrich), the major free fatty acid, and dissolved in a solution containing albumin without fatty acids (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical). A549 and PC-9 cells were seeded on culture slides at a density of 3 × 10 4 Flow Cytometry Analysis A549 and PC-9 cells were seeded at a density of 4 × 10 5 Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was performed using JMP software version JMP PRO 17 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
