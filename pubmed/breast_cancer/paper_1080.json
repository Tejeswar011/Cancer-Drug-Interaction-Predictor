Growing interest in the modulation of DNA repair mechanisms, including the homologous recombination (HR) repair pathway, has opened new avenues for therapeutic development. BARD1 (BRCA1-Associated RING Domain 1) plays a complex role in tumor biology, functioning either as a tumor suppressor or as an oncogenic driver, depending on isoform expression, cellular context, and regulatory environment. In this review, we examine the dual roles of BARD1, focusing on its regulation and paradoxical activities in PDAC. We summarize evidence that BARD1 and BARD1 isoforms differentially affect DNA repair, apoptosis, and drug resistance and evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting BARD1 and other DNA damage response (DDR) proteins. We also review ongoing clinical trials and investigational agents designed to exploit DDR vulnerabilities in PDAC. Together, these insights highlight BARD1’s context-dependent roles in PDAC and support continued efforts to profile BARD1 isoforms, clarify their functions, and leverage DDR pathways through precision oncology approaches.

Introduction Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common malignant tumor of the pancreas, accounting for over 90% of pancreatic cancer cases. PDAC is predominantly driven by inactivating mutations in genes that have historically posed significant challenges as drug targets, including KRAS CDKN2A TP53 SMAD4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 PDAC is characterized by extensive genomic instability, frequently driven by defects in key DNA damage response (DDR) pathways critical for preserving genomic integrity [ 3 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 17 20 Therapeutically, BARD1 deficiencies may represent an exploitable vulnerability. Tumors with HR repair defects are hypersensitive to agents that induce DNA damage, such as platinum-based chemotherapies and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPis) through synthetic lethal interactions. PARP inhibition impairs the repair of single-stranded breaks; when unresolved, these lesions cause replication fork collapse, generating double-stranded breaks that are lethal in cells lacking functional HR repair [ 21 22 BRCA1/2 p 23 24 BRCA1/2 In this review, we examine the multifaceted role of the DDR protein BARD1 in PDAC, with a focus on its complex regulatory mechanisms and the dual tumor-suppressive and oncogenic functions. We further discuss the potential of BARD1 as a promising therapeutic target in DNA repair-based strategies for the treatment of PDAC and highlight ongoing clinical efforts targeting DDR mechanisms. 2. Overview of BARD1 The human BARD1 25 Figure 1 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 3. Tumor Suppressor Effects of BARD1 The E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer is essential to its tumor suppressor function, enabling the complex to polyubiquitinate various substrates and regulate diverse cellular processes. Mechanistically, BRCA1-BARD1 interacts with UbcH5 E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes and catalyzes the formation of K6-, K48-, or K63-linked ubiquitin chains of the target protein [ 12 34 34 35 36 37 38 39 Independent of BRCA1 complex formation, BARD1 alone is essential for maintaining genomic stability. Complete loss of BARD1 leads to chromosomal abnormalities and embryonic lethality between embryonic days E7.5 and E8.5 in mouse models [ 40 41 42 43 44 In addition to established roles in HR and apoptosis, BARD1 also contributes to genomic stability by regulating mitotic spindle assembly. BARD1 has been identified as a spindle assembly factor activated by RanGTP, a small GTPase critical for proper mitotic spindle formation. Studies in Xenopus egg extracts and mammalian cells demonstrate that BARD1 localizes to spindle poles in a manner dependent on RanGTP gradients and regulated by importin β. This interaction reflects a Ran-dependent pathway in which the release of BARD1 from importin complexes enables participation in microtubule nucleation and stabilization during mitosis [ 45 Both germline and somatic BARD1 mutations have been described in pancreatic cancer, supporting BARD1’s role in tumor suppression; as such, BARD1 is currently included in germline mutation testing panels, along with other DNA repair genes [ 9 46 47 4. Mechanisms Affecting Tumor-Suppressive Activity of BARD1 4.1. Genomic Alterations Several germline variants in BARD1, associated with elevated risk for breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and other cancers, are mappable to highly conserved domains [ 39 48 49 50 42 43 51 52 53 54 53 R99E 55 56 Mutations outside BARD1’s canonical functional domains may also impact tumor suppressor activity. For example, the Gln564His variant, located between the ANK and BRCT domains, reduces BARD1’s interaction with Cleavage Stimulating Factor 50, a protein involved in RNA processing and p53-mediated apoptosis [ 48 57 43 51 Mechanistically, many pathogenic BARD1 variants impair HR, underscoring a critical role in the impairment of BARD1’s tumor suppressor functions. In a pan-cancer analysis of over 10,000 tumors, Adamovich et al. identified 76 potentially pathogenic BARD1 missense variants, of which 16 were functionally deficient in HR. These HR-deficient variants sensitized cells to cisplatin and ionizing radiation, consistent with compromised DNA repair. Notably, several variants within the ANK and BRCT domains disrupted HR activity beyond their known roles in protein interaction, suggesting additional, unrecognized functions in DNA repair. Conversely, other variants associated with high loss of heterozygosity, such as Ser339Thr, Thr343Ile, and Val523Ala, retained HR function, suggesting that loss of heterozygosity is not a reliable proxy for predicting functional inactivation of BARD1 [ 54 Beyond rare pathogenic mutations, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BARD1 58 59 BARD1 60 BARD1 61 In pancreatic cancer specifically, several rare BARD1 46 47 62 63 64 BARD1 46 47 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 BARD1 Table 1 4.2. Post-Translational Modulation of BARD1 The cellular levels of BARD1 and its interaction with BRCA1 are critical for the heterodimeric function of the BRCA1-BARD1 complex in HR repair and tumor suppression. BARD1 protein levels are tightly regulated through multiple mechanisms and signaling pathways and are maintained at a steady state throughout the cell cycle, primarily through association with BRCA1 [ 74 75 76 77 78 Several E3 ligases have been identified as regulators of BARD1 and may play complementary roles in BRCA1-BARD1 complex modulation. Wu et al. demonstrated that HERC2, an E3 ligase implicated in DNA damage repair, ubiquitinates BRCA1 in a BARD1-independent manner. In this model, unbound BRCA1 is degraded during the S phase via the HECT domain of HERC2. Knockdown of HERC2 stabilizes BRCA1 levels and indirectly increases BARD1 levels, likely due to reciprocal stabilization of the complex. Therefore, targeted inhibition of HERC2 may enhance BARD1 stability and thereby promote tumor suppression [ 79 80 81 Other E3 ligases, termed Cullin–RING ligases (CRLs), require DDB1- and CUL4-associated factors (DCAFs) for substrate recognition; several DCAFs have been implicated in the regulation of BARD1 stability. DCAF8L2, as described by Deng et al., acts as a negative regulator of BARD1 stability through direct binding of the BARD1 RING domain, thereby disrupting BRCA1-BARD1 complex stability [ 82 83 The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, an evolutionarily conserved E3 ligase regulating cell cycle progression, also promotes ubiquitin-mediated degradation of BARD1. Given the previously identified role of BARD1 in regulating Ran-dependent mitotic spindle assembly, anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome-mediated degradation of BARD1 may represent a mechanism by which the cell ensures genomic integrity and faithful chromosome segregation [ 84 Apart from E3 ligases, other proteins, including Sirtuins, have also been implicated in BARD1 regulation. SIRT2, in particular, has been shown to deacetylase BARD1 at conserved lysine residues within the RING domain, promoting stability of the BRCA1-BARD1 complex and enabling tumor-suppressive function [ 85 86 87 88 4.3. Promoter Methylation While promoter methylation of BRCA1 is frequently observed across cancers, BARD1 promoter methylation is comparatively rare, suggesting that preservation of BARD1 expression may contribute to its tumor suppressor function [ 89 90 91 92 93 In a separate study by Lubecka et al., BARD1 expression was found to be upregulated in hepatitis B virus-negative patients at risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma. This increase was associated with significant hypomethylation of the BARD1 BARD1 94 Beyond DNA methylation, other modifications could also influence BARD1’s tumor-suppressive role. Studies in pluripotent stem cells have identified H3K36me3, an activating histone mark, as a determinant of BARD1 alternative splicing, suggesting that chromatin state may govern isoform-specific transcription of the BARD1 95 5. Oncogenic Effects of BARD1 The oncogenic potential of BARD1 is largely attributed to the truncated or alternatively spliced transcript variants, which may act in a dominant-negative manner or acquire novel functions. To date, at least 19 isoforms of the BARD1 protein have been identified, including BARD1α, BARD1β, BARD1γ, BARD1δ, BARD1ε, BARD1η, BARD1κ, BARD1π, BARD1ϕ, and BARD1ω [ 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 Figure 1 5.1. Isoform-Specific Oncogenic Effects 5.1.1. BARD1β and BARD1δ Isoforms Several groups have investigated the BARD1β isoform, a 680-amino acid (75 kDa) protein, which is overexpressed in colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and high-risk neuroblastoma [ 98 100 103 106 106 BARD1δ, a structurally distinct, 307-amino acid (35 kDa) isoform lacking exons 2–6, is likewise overexpressed across various tumor types, including breast and ovarian cancer, particularly in aggressive subtypes, such as clear cell carcinoma [ 89 102 104 106 107 108 Additionally, BARD1β and BARD1δ may promote oncogenesis by acting as dominant-negative disruptors of both BRCA1-BARD1 E3 ligase activity and nuclear localization of BRCA1, as both isoforms lack the N-terminal RING domain required for interaction with BRCA1. In ER + 99 98 Figure 2 5.1.2. Additional Isoforms and Paradoxical Roles Beyond BARD1β and BARD1δ, other isoforms have also been implicated in cancer. The φ isoform has been associated with poor prognosis in ovarian and breast cancer patients [ 104 109 105 103 Paradoxically, some findings challenge the consistently oncogenic role of BARD1 isoforms. In colon cancer, BARD1δ and ϕ were reported to exert tumor-suppressive functions in at least one context [ 107 110 101 6. Mechanisms Affecting Oncogenic Activity of BARD1 6.1. MicroRNA-Mediated Post-Transcriptional Upregulation of BARD1 Isoforms Emerging evidence highlights the role of post-transcriptional regulation in driving oncogenic BARD1 isoform expression across cancer types. Pilyugin and Irminger-Finger et al. identified long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs as key regulators of BARD1 isoform expression, proposing a model of post-transcriptional control that contributes to isoform dysregulation in cancer [ 111 111 111 BARD1 BARD1 105 6.2. RNA-Binding Protein (RBP) Mediated Stabilization of BARD1 Isoforms A recently described mechanism of BARD1 regulation is via Human Antigen R (HuR/ELAVL-1), an RNA-binding protein that modulates the stability of mRNAs encoding pro-survival and pro-resistance genes. Our group previously published that HuR regulates BARD1 expression in pancreatic cancer cells through a non-canonical mechanism involving both pre-mRNA and mature mRNA transcript levels [ 112 113 114 115 113 6.3. BARD1-Mediated Oncogenic Transcriptional Networks Although BARD1 isoforms have been implicated in oncogenesis, often without mechanistic insight, our recent findings reveal that BARD1 supports malignant transcriptional programs in PDAC by sustaining MYC-mediated transcriptional activity. This, in turn, promotes the expression of genes critical for tumor cell growth and survival [ 116 117 117 117 7. Role of BARD1 in Therapeutic Resistance Chemotherapy resistance is a major driver of disease relapse and poor clinical outcomes across malignancies, including PDAC. One well-characterized mechanism of resistance involves the upregulation of DNA repair genes, which enables tumor cells to evade the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents. This phenomenon has been widely documented in cisplatin-resistant tumors, in which elevated expression of multiple DNA repair genes correlates with poor therapeutic response and reduced patient survival [ 118 119 120 121 In this context, dysregulation of BARD1 may contribute to chemoresistance across malignancies. In PDAC, analysis of patient-derived, Gemcitabine-treated organoids revealed that elevated BARD1 expression was significantly associated with progressive disease [ 122 123 124 Isoform-specific regulation of BARD1 also appears to influence cellular responses to chemotherapy. In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, which retain functional BRCA1, Marzec et al. demonstrated that overexpression of BARD1ω significantly reduced apoptosis following treatment with cisplatin when compared to cells expressing wild-type FL-BARD1. While FL-BARD1 and most variants enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis, BARD1ω consistently conferred resistance, suggesting an anti-apoptotic function [ 109 109 Our research has previously found that treatment of PDAC cells with either Olaparib or a platinum-based chemotherapy (oxaliplatin) leads to increased BARD1 expression, while transient silencing of BARD1 increases cellular sensitivity to these therapies. Further analysis revealed that this upregulation occurs via a post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by the pro-survival RNA-binding protein HuR [ 113 In addition to a role in chemotherapy resistance, overexpression of DNA repair proteins has also been associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor resistance. Inhibiting DNA repair proteins, such as RAD51, PARP1, and mismatch repair components, has been shown to enhance anti-tumor immunity and improve response to immune checkpoint blockade [ 125 126 127 8. Clinical Trials with DNA Damage Response (DDR) Agents Several experimental and approved agents targeting DNA repair pathways are currently under investigation for the treatment of PDAC ( Table 2 BRCA1/2 BRCA1/2 128 21 22 Table 2 129 130 131 132 133 Beyond Olaparib, three additional PARPis—Talazoparib, Niraparib, and Rucaparib—have received approval in a range of cancer types and are currently being evaluated for the treatment of PDAC. Talazoparib, initially approved as a monotherapy in BRCA1/2 134 135 Niraparib, approved for BRCA1/2 136 137 138 139 140 While PARPis have shown clinical benefit in certain PDAC patients, resistance—both intrinsic and acquired—remains a significant limitation. As a complementary approach, targeting poly (ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), the enzyme responsible for degrading poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains, may offer a strategy to overcome PARPi resistance. We have previously published that PARG is an exploitable therapeutic target for PDAC with HR repair gene mutations [ 141 142 143 Other investigational approaches target key DNA damage kinases, including ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) and its downstream effector checkpoint kinase 1, well-characterized regulators of replication stress responses and cell cycle checkpoints. Several clinical trials assessing ATR inhibitors in PDAC, regardless of DDR mutation status, are currently active [ 130 144 145 133 146 LP-184, a DNA-alkylating prodrug activated by prostaglandin reductase 1, is also under investigation for solid tumors harboring DDR gene mutations, including PDAC [ 147 148 BARD1 Preclinical evidence also supports a role for direct inhibition of HR in PDAC via interference with the BRCA1-BARD1 complex. BBIT20, a first-in-class disruptor of BRCA1-BARD1 dimerization, was recently shown in vitro to reduce PDAC cell proliferation regardless of BRCA 149 9. Conclusions and Perspectives on Research Strategies BARD1 plays a complex role in cancer biology, functioning as both a tumor suppressor and an oncogene, depending on the expression of isoforms, structural integrity, and regulatory environment. As a binding partner of BRCA1, FL-BARD1 supports homologous recombination repair and genomic stability, while also contributing to apoptotic signaling through both BRCA1-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Disruption of this function, whether through germline or somatic mutations, enhanced degradation, promoter methylation, or loss of key structural domains, has been implicated in tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance across multiple cancer types, including PDAC. Conversely, numerous alternatively spliced BARD1 isoforms, notably BARD1β and BARD1δ, exhibit oncogenic potential through diverse mechanisms, including disruption of BRCA1 nuclear localization. The expression of these isoforms appears to be regulated by both genetic and epigenetic factors, although these regulatory layers remain incompletely understood in many tumor contexts. In PDAC, the clinical relevance of both FL-BARD1 and BARD1 isoforms remains insufficiently characterized. Emerging evidence suggests that FL-BARD1 participates in PAR binding and PARP-mediated DNA damage repair [ 150 151 152 Future work should also investigate how BARD1 interacts with the tumor immune microenvironment, influences response to targeted immunotherapies, and evolves during tumor progression, including post-translational or post-transcriptional modifications that alter FL- and isoform expression, or interactions with other DNA damage response proteins that may impact tumor behavior and treatment resistance. In conclusion, elucidating the full spectrum of BARD1’s functions, as a tumor suppressor (“friend”) and a pro-cancer agent (“foe”), will be essential for understanding its dualistic role in cancer and harnessing its biology for therapeutic gain.
