Western and Chinese medicinal ointments are the usual treatment for eczema. Conventional Western medicinal ointments are topical corticosteroids and non-steroidal agents. Eczema skin products include “Aveeno Parabens Lotion”, “Cerave Moisturizing Cream”, and “Cetaphil Lotion”. However, these are not a long-term solution for managing significant erythema. Chinese medicinal ointments are based on adjusting the formula, including the ingredients and amount, to address an individual’s skin condition and other factors that may be worsening symptoms. This approach aims to regulate the immune system and make it less reactive to environmental and food allergies. This approach is mainly for local topical use.

Introduction Eczema is a chronic skin disease that has risen proportionally among Hong Kong’s adults and children, affecting nearly 30% of the total population [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Generally, patient history and clinical or physical examinations are used in the diagnosis of eczema. It is quite common during infancy, and babies and children who are prone to it usually outgrow it as they age, but it is more likely to persist during the teenage years. Adult eczema is associated with allergies starting at 3 months of age. It may be further treated with the help of medicines [ 8 9 10 Based on the American Academy of Dermatology guidelines, the diagnostic features of eczema have four stages, which are summarized below ( Table 1 The possible treatment of eczema includes moisturizing the skin to repair and maintain the skin barrier, as well as to prevent the dehydration of the skin layer. Sometimes, it is also necessary to reduce itching and inflammation by managing the skin and decreasing. Western and Chinese ointments are the external treatments used for eczema. Conventional Western medicinal ointments are topical corticosteroids, including hydrocortisone, desonide, clobetasol propionate, fluocinolone, mometasone, fluticasone, aclometasone, prednicarbate, and non-steroidal agents such as prednisone, prednisolone, triamcinolone acetonide, and crisaborole. Chinese medicinal ointments are usually organic and natural, originating from herbal plants, for example, Coptis chinensis Phellodendron chinense Angelica sinensis Rehmannia glutinosa Curcuma longa 12 This review article aims to explore the active ingredients, mechanisms, advantages, and disadvantages of commonly used Western or Chinese medicinal ointments, as well as discuss some clinical examples of Western and Chinese medicinal ointments used in the treatment of eczema. The most important thing is knowing “how” to apply Western and Chinese ointments correctly to fight against eczema. 2. Western Medicines and Chinese Medicinal Ointments 2.1. Western Medicinal Ointments Western medicinal ointments usually consist of topical corticosteroids or non-steroidal components, which have different chemical structures with specific pharmacological functions and mechanisms of action, as well as specific clinical outcomes ( Table 2 Table 3 2.2. Chinese Medicinal Ointments Chinese ointments are usually organic and natural, originating from herbal plants, for example, Coptis chinensis Phellodendron chinense Angelica sinensis Rehmannia glutinosa Curcuma longa Table 4 Table 5 3. Limitations 3.1. Western Medicinal Ointments There are some drawbacks to using topical corticosteroids or non-steroidal components in Western medicinal ointments for treating eczema. Typically, less than 2% of topical corticosteroids (e.g., hydrocortisone) are absorbed into systemic circulation after a single application for more than 1 day [ 77 78 79 80 25 81 82 83 84 85 Some common side effects of non-steroidals include pruritus, morbilliform rashes, urticaria, and photosensitivity [ 86 87 88 89 90 3.2. Chinese Medicinal Ointments Several active ingredients for Chinese medicinal ointments, for example, “Berberine”, increase the number of melanocytes in the subepidermal layer and enhance the number of melanin-containing dendrites in melanocytes, causing the skin to darken [ 91 92 93 94 65 Table 6 95 4. Discussion 4.1. Basic Pathogenesis of Eczema Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing inflammatory skin disease with a complex pathogenesis that includes (a) genetic factors, (b) epidermal barrier, (c) immune mechanism dysfunction, and (d) environmental triggers [ 96 (a) Eczema has been characterized by reference to loci on chromosomes 1q21, 3q21, 16q, 17q25, and 3p26, most notably 1q21, which contains a family of epithelial-related genes called the epidermal differentiation complex (EDC). Genes in the EDC showed significant changes in expression on the patients’ skin [ 97 (b) Concerning the epidermal barrier, genes were associated with increased IgE production, with increased IgE production, or both, such as IL-4 and high-affinity IgE receptors. Skin barrier function may have been impaired due to genetic susceptibility, resulting in elevated chymotrypsin levels in the stratum corneum, leading to premature rupture of corneodesmosomes and epidermal skin barrier dysfunction [ 98 (c) The immunological system of eczema focused on T helper type 2 (Th2) cell-derived cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, and keratinocyte-derived cytokines, as well as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and IL-33, which contribute to Th2-mediated skin inflammation in AD [ 99 (d) One environmental trigger of eczema is microbial exposure ( Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis Streptococcus Propionibacterium Corynebacterium 100 101 4.2. Pharmacological Effects on Eczema Western and Chinese medicines were suitable for managing eczema symptoms, especially during flare-up periods. Since Western medicines can act as corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and moisturizers, these may reduce inflammation, modify and suppress immune response, and hydrate the skin and repair the skin barrier. However, the most common side effects are skin thinning, adrenal suppression, skin irritation, increased risk of infections, skin irritation, and allergic reactions [ 102 The usage of Chinese medicines to treat eczema symptoms may focus on “Qi”, and the main pharmacologic factors include “wind”, “dampness”, and “heat”, according to Chinese medicine theory [ 103 4.3. Pharmacological Functions for Eczema Western medicines have (a) anti-inflammatory, (b) antipruritic, (c) vasoconstrictive, (d) immunosuppressive, (e) antimitotic, and (f) antiproliferative properties for eczema: (a) This factor is bound to the glucocorticoid receptor, leading to downstream effects such as the inhibition of phospholipase A2, NF-kappa B, etc., to prevent inflammation [ 104 (b) This factor targets the H1 receptor, neuropeptides (e.g., substance P, nerve growth factor), or cytokines (e.g., IL-31) for some types of itching [ 105 (c) This factor mediates vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin-II, arginine-vasopressin, endothelin-1, and noradrenaline, to regulate the blood flow [ 106 (d) This factor suppresses the transcription of T-cell cytokine genes, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, TNF-α, and IFN-γ expression [ 107 (e) This factor inhibits cell division and proliferation to eliminate excessive or abnormal skin cell growth [ 108 (f) This factor inhibits fibroblast proliferation, reducing mast cell numbers through the glucocorticoid on the skin [ 109 Chinese medicines mainly have their anti-inflammatory properties, as discussed above with regard to the pharmacologic factors. Generally, these mitigate the effects of AD by restoring the skin barrier through balancing Th1/Th2 cell levels, regulating the expression of cytokines and chemokines [ 110 4.4. Pharmacological Mechanism of Western Medicines Topical corticosteroids modify and regulate the functions of epidermal and dermal cells and lead leukocytes to participate in proliferative and inflammatory skin diseases. After crossing the cell membrane, they react with receptor proteins in the cytoplasm to form a steroid receptor complex. The steroid receptor complex further enters the nucleus and binds to DNA, altering the transcription of messenger RNA (mRNA) for protein synthesis. Topical corticosteroids play an important role in both the stimulation and inhibition of specific glycoproteins. Lipocortin is a glycoprotein that inhibits phospholipase A2 and releases arachidonic acid from phospholipids as a precursor of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. The main purpose of using topical corticosteroids is to inhibit mRNA for the formation of interleukin-1, causing eczema [ 111 Non-steroidals are usually PDE4 inhibitors, which increase the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) level. This is a negative regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which causes a decrease in the inflammatory mediator’s response, such as IL-4 and IL-13, to prevent eczema [ 112 4.5. Pharmacological Mechanism of Chinese Medicines Eczema is mainly associated with cytokine–cytokine receptor interactions, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), toll-like receptors, T-cell receptors, and type 1 T helper cell (Th1) and type 2 T helper cell (Th2) differentiation pathways. Chinese medicines such as Coptis chinensis Phellodendron chinense Angelica sinensis Rehmannia glutinosa Curcuma longa 113 4.6. Pharmacological Mechanisms that Differ between Western and Chinese Medicines Basically, the mechanisms of Western and Chinese medicines are similar, as both focus on the immune system to treat eczema. They involve the binding of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) to its receptor to activate two intracellular signaling pathways, namely mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). These pathways are usually downregulated at the level of interleukins to mRNA expression for modulating and correcting the immune system to prevent and fight against eczema. Chinese medicines focus on the root cause versus symptoms with a detailed diagnosis system for the whole body, mind, and spirit. However, Western medicines are topical corticosteroids and non-steroidals applied to reduce or modulate the symptoms of eczema. These cannot be used in the long term, because they may cause local and systemic adverse effects on the infected skin area. Local adverse reactions include atrophy, striae, rosacea, perioral dermatitis, acne, and purpura, and less frequent adverse reactions include hirsutism, pigmentation changes, delayed wound healing, and exacerbated skin infections. Systemic adverse effects consist of hyperglycemia, glaucoma, and adrenal insufficiency [ 89 4.7. Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine Therapy A systematic review and meta-analysis on integrated Chinese and Western medicine interventions for atopic dermatitis reported that CM is widely used for the management of AD in China and is used in combination with conventional therapy, such as ICWM. It also identified ICWN processing as leading to a better improvement in the severity of AD than applying WN alone [ 114 107 114 Growing evidence has shown that ICWMs have good curative effects on eczema. Chinese medicines are concerned with regulating the immune function and boosting mental health. Functions and indications include clearing away heat and dampness, relieving itching, strengthening the spleen, and activating blood circulation. Compared to Western medicine, the medical properties of Chinese medicines tend to be milder and cannot achieve immediate action. However, Western medicines reduce the risk of eczema symptoms quickly, which complements Chinese medicine in combined therapy. These are the best approaches for ICWM treatments against eczema, as used in recent research studies. 4.8. Chinese and Western Medicinal Ointment Usage The usage of Chinese and Western medicinal ointments is essential to fight against eczema. Usually, Chinese and Western medicinal ointments are applied topically 1 to 3 times per day to the infected area. No matter whether it is a Chinese or Western medicinal ointment, it should be used at the right time after diagnosis, thinking about “safety”, “quality”, “effectiveness”, “dosage”, “frequency” and “function”, because Chinese medicinal ointments are always a mixture of herbs. Different ratios of herbs may affect the therapeutic effects. Western medicine has unique ointments, and their purity is comparatively high. The effectiveness of Western medicinal ointments is greater than that of Chinese medicinal ointments, especially when using topical corticosteroids and non-steroidal agents, due to their purity and potency, though side effects, as mentioned above, are inevitable. 4.9. Chinese and Western Medicinal Ointment Bases The base of the ointment is a vital factor in assessing the effectiveness of medications, particularly in dermatological applications, as it influences the rate of drug release, skin penetration and absorption, hydration and occlusion, therapeutic effectiveness, and tolerability. In Western medicine, petrolatum-based (lipophilic) ointments are utilized, which contain occlusive agents that create a barrier to minimize trans-epidermal water loss and safeguard skin hydration. Moisturizing creams incorporate humectants, such as glycerin or urea, which draw water into the stratum corneum. This action enhances the thickness of the epidermis, alleviating inflammation and improving barrier proteins like filaggrin and loricrin. Absorbents are water-based formulations designed to manage skin moisture, thereby sustaining a balanced hydration environment. Conversely, Chinese medicines often employ natural, plant-derived carriers, following TCM’s holistic approach, such as sesame oil. This oil is abundant in antioxidants, is readily absorbed, promotes herb penetration, and nourishes the skin. The selection of the base is made according to its physical characteristics and energetic and therapeutic harmony with the herbal components it conveys. 5. Conclusions Chinese medicinal ointments commonly contain Coptis chinensis Phellodendron chinense Angelica sinensis Rehmannia glutinosa Curcuma longa 6. Future Aspects Proper use of Chinese and Western medicinal ointments is another important criterion. Much more work needs to be carried out, particularly on the Chinese medicinal ointments with different formulations that need to undergo safety assessments for the treatment of eczema. However, these assessments should follow Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) that blend diagnostic and therapeutic approaches from both systems.

Name Chemical Structure Function(s) Mechanism(s) Topical corticosteroids are essential treatments for inflammatory skin conditions and are available in formulations such as ointments, creams, lotions, gels, foams, oils, solutions, and shampoos [ 13 Hydrocortisone 17-alpha-hydroxy-C21-steroid [ 14 Anti-inflammatory Reduces and attenuates interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8, and IL-6 levels in response to tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced inflammatory responses, suppressing the production of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [ 15 Desonide 11-beta-hydroxy-C21-steroid [ 16 Anti-inflammatory, Interacts with glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm of skin cells, which bind to specific DNA sequences and suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to a decrease in the skin’s inflammatory response [ 17 18 Clobetasol propionate 17-O-propionate ester steroid [ 19 Anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and antimitotic properties Interacts with glucocorticoid receptors in the cytoplasm and penetrate the cell membrane to form a clobetasol receptor complex, as well as downregulate the expression of inflammatory factors and regulate the transcription of various genes through cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), leading to increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as lipocortin-1) and decreasing the rates of pro-inflammatory prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis in skin inflammation [ 20 21 Fluocinolone 6-alpha-hydroxy-C21- 22 Anti-inflammatory Inhibits inflammatory cytokine secretion for the cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), macrophage inflammatory protein 3α (MIP-3α), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) [ 23 Mometasone 11-beta-hydroxy-C21- 24 Anti-inflammatory and Downregulates the inflammatory gene expression level and inhibits the transcription of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and enzymes, including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) [ 25 Fluticasone 11-beta-hydroxy-C21- 26 Anti-inflammatory Inhibits the proliferation of anti-CD3-induced human T-lymphocytes, attenuates tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)-induced endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression, and suppresses interleukin-5 (IL-5)-induced blood eosinophilia and IL-5- or platelet-activating factor-stimulated eosinophil accumulation on the skin [ 27 Aclometasone 17-O-dipropionate ester steroid [ 28 Anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and Induces the phospholipase A 2 29 Prednicarbate 11-beta-hydroxy-C21-ester steroid [ 30 Anti-inflammatory Inhibits the interleukin 1-alpha cytokine within keratinocytes and suppresses the proliferation of IL-1a in fibroblasts, as well as collagenase induction and IL-6 synthesis, to moderate skin thickness [ 31 Non-steroidals are a group of medications commonly used to treat pain and reduce inflammation for muscle and joint pain or swelling, such as gels, creams, or patches [ 32 Prednisone 17-alpha-hydroxy-C21-steroid [ 33 Anti-inflammatory Inhibits the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reverses increasing capillary permeability to decrease the inflammation that enters the nucleus and binds to, as well as activates, specific nuclear receptors, resulting in altered gene expression and inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines [ 34 Prednisolone 11-beta-hydroxy-C21-steroid [ 35 Anti-inflammatory Same as prednisone. Triamcinolone acetonide 11-beta-hydroxy-C21-steroid [ 36 Anti-inflammatory Inhibits the phospholipase A2 enzyme on the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, which hinders the decomposition of leukocyte lysosomal membranes and prevents the formation of arachidonic acid to cause the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) [ 37 38 39 Crisaborole 5-hydroxy-1,3-dihydro-2,1- 40 Anti-inflammatory Facilitates skin penetration and binds to the bimetal center of the phosphodiesterase-4 enzyme, which regulates cyclic adenosine monophosphate in cells and produces cytokines [ 41 pharmaceuticals-18-01248-t003_Table 3 Table 3 Clinical studies of topical corticosteroids and non-steroidal ointments.  Name Dosage (%) Side Effects Efficiency and Effectiveness Topical corticosteroids Hydrocortisone 0.1 Burning or stinging, One hundred ninety-four adults with clinically diagnosed atopic dermatitis were randomized for treatment with 0.1% hydrocortisone buteprate cream or placebo. There was a significant improvement from 0.1% hydrocortisone buteprate cream in atopic dermatitis patients, and most adverse effects were mild to moderate, including a burning sensation, with 4% of patients using a placebo and only 2% of patients using hydrocortisone buteprate [ 42 Desonide 0.05 Dryness or peeling, One hundred thirteen children were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, investigator-masked, parallel-group study. Patients with a mean age of 4.8 years and mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis were treated with a desonide ointment. This had greater efficacy and led to rapid improvement, as well as being safer than the 1% hydrocortisone ointment and suitable for up to 6 months of use [ 43 Clobetasol 0.05 Burning or stinging, One hundred thirteen adults with eczema were evaluated for the clinical response severity of specific signs and symptoms. Overall, 4% of patients treated with clobetasol experienced drug-related reactions, and 6% of patients treated with clobetasol experienced drug-related reactions, which were resolved within 1 week after the end of treatment [ 44 Fluocinolone 0.01 Burning, stinging, or itching, dryness or peeling, redness Sixty-six otic eczema patients were treated with fluocinolone acetonide twice daily for 7 days and 8 days of follow-up to study the changes in otoscopic signs, such as erythema, oedema, and scaling. Fluocinolone led to significant improvement in patients. It was an effective and safe treatment for otic eczema [ 45 Mometasone 0.1 Burning or stinging, dryness One hundred and twenty patients with chronic hand eczema were treated with mometasone furoate fatty cream daily until the dermatitis subsided or for a maximum of 9 weeks, indicating that intermittent use of mometasone furoate fatty cream for the treatment of chronic hand eczema was safe and effective [ 46 Fluticasone 0.05 Burning or stinging, dryness or irritation, redness or itching, skin rash or hives, and changes in skin pigmentation. Thirty-two children aged 3 months to 6 years old, with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, were treated with 0.05% fluticasone propionate cream twice daily for 3 to 4 weeks. It can safely treat severe eczema in children aged 3 months and older for up to 4 weeks [ 47 Aclometasone 0.05 Itching, burning, or stinging, dryness or irritation, redness Thirty-nine children with eczema were treated with 0.05% alclometasone dipropionate cream during a three-week open study. There was a good overall response, with 28 children (72%) experiencing complete resolution of monitored signs and symptoms, as well as seven children (18%) experiencing marked or moderate improvement in monitored signs and symptoms [ 48 Prednicarbate 0.05 Burning, itching, or stinging; dryness, scaling, or cracking; redness or irritation; Twenty-four healthy volunteers applied 0.25% prednicarbate cream or the corresponding vehicle to one forearm and 0.1% betamethasone-17-valerate cream or 0.05% clobetasol-17-propionate cream to the other forearm twice daily in a double-blind controlled trial. Normally, 0.1% betamethasone-17-valerate and 0.25% prednicarbate cream were reported to be about equipotent in the treatment of atopic eczema, and the latter preparation had an increased ratio between its desired anti-inflammatory effect and its unwanted anthropogenic effect [ 49  Non-steroidals  Name  Dosage (%)  Side effects  Efficiency and effectiveness Prednisone 0.01 Rashes, thinning of the skin (atrophy), increased One hundred and twenty skin lesion patients received prednisone for six months to ten years. Warts and herpes zoster cases increased with treatment duration, but the total number of skin manifestations did not increase significantly [ 50 Prednisolone 0.05 Skin thinning (atrophy), stretch marks (striae), acne or acne-like eruptions, delayed wound healing, increased facial Thirty-eight patients with severe eczema were randomly assigned to receive either prednisolone for 2 weeks, followed by a placebo for 4 weeks, or cyclosporine for 6 weeks, followed by 12 weeks of treatment. The results showed that cyclosporine was significantly more effective than prednisolone in treating severe eczema in adults [ 51 Triamcinolone acetonide 0.1 Itching, burning, or stinging, dryness or irritation, redness Eighteen eczema patients were treated with triamcinolone acetonide (TA) cream of 0.1% and a cream containing 0.1% TA plus 0.025% retinoic acid (RA) for one to three weeks. The results indicated that the addition of 0.025% RA to medium-potency topical steroids did not abolish the anti-inflammatory properties of the latter and that inflamed skin could tolerate this combination [ 52 Crisaborole 2 Application site burning or stinging, redness or irritation, and itching (pruritus). Two identically designed, vehicle-controlled, double-blind studies enrolled and randomized (2:1, crisaborole: vehicle) patients aged 2 years or older with an Investigator’s Static Global Assessment (ISGA) score of mild or moderate for twice-daily use for 28 days. The results of crisaborole with a favorable safety profile demonstrated improvements in all efficacy measures, including overall disease severity, pruritus, and other symptoms of atopic dermatitis [ 53 pharmaceuticals-18-01248-t004_Table 4 Table 4 Selected Chinese medicinal plants used against eczema.  Name Major Active Ingredients and Function(s) Mechanism(s)  Chinese Medicinal plants Coptis chinensis (a) berberine 54 Anti- (a) Inhibiting eotaxin and pro-cytokine inflammation, as well as the improvement of atopic dermatitis (AD) by downregulating eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit F (EIF3F) and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation 1 (MALT1) [ 55 56 57 58 Phellodendron chinense (a) berberine (same as above) 59 Anti- (b) Downregulating the expression level of p65 mRNA to reduce the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), to relieve lumbar disc pain [ 60 Angelica sinensis ligustilide [ 61 Anti- Exhibits anti-inflammatory activities by blocking the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)/IκB kinase (IKK), transcription factor activator protein-1 (AP-1), and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), as well as decreasing the intracellular reactive oxygen species (iROS) [ 62 Rehmannia glutinosa Iridoid glycosides 63 Anti- (a) Alleviates skin lesions and mast cell infiltration via the regulation of pro-Th2 and Th2 cytokines in vivo, which also reduces the level of immunoglobulin E (IgE) in atopic disease [ 64 65 66 Curcuma longa Curcumin [ 67 Anti- Alleviates ovalbumin-induced atopic dermatitis and associated asthma symptoms in mice by restoring skin pathology, inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration and cytokine expression, and restoring redox and NF-κB signaling balance [ 68 Sesame oil Sesamin [ 69 Anti- Suppresses the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) that induce cancer cell apoptosis and autophagy through multiple signaling pathways, such as NF-κB, JNK, p38 MAPK, PI3K/AKT, caspase-3, and p53 [ 70 pharmaceuticals-18-01248-t005_Table 5 Table 5 Clinical studies of selected Chinese medicinal ointments.  Name Dosage (%) Side Effects Efficiency and Effectiveness  Chinese Medicinal plants Coptis chinensis 5–15 Allergic reactions, skin irritation, and photosensitivity. Eight-week-old guinea pigs were randomly divided into six groups, with ten in each group. Biostir-AD ® 71 Phellodendron chinense 5–15 Mild irritation, Atopic dermatitis patients were selected from the diagnostic clinic of Dongzhimen Hospital according to the severity index (EASI) guidelines, and 6 to 8-week-old BALB/c female mice were used as the 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB)-induced atopic dermatitis model, receiving Huang Bai ointment on local skin lesions 3 to 4 times per day. The results demonstrated that Huang Bai ointment was a suitable treatment since it mitigated skin inflammation in atopic dermatitis patients and the 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNCB)-induced atopic dermatitis mouse model by reinvigorating the T-cell immune balance to decrease the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-17, IL-4, and IL-13 [ 72 Angelica sinensis 5–10 Contact dermatitis, photosensitivity, and skin irritation. Angelica sinensis Angelica sinensis 73 Rehmannia glutinosa 5–10 Contact irritation, Atopic dermatitis was induced by spreading an atopic-inducing reagent, biostir atopic dermatitis (Biostir Inc., Japan), which is a natural chemical found in mites, on the mice’s skin for 3 weeks. Then, 100 mg of Di huang ointment was applied to the shaved back skin twice a week for 3 weeks. The results indicated that it inhibited the expression of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules and subsequently blocked the accumulation of leukocytes, which may be responsible for its inhibitory effect on atopic dermatitis-like skin lesions [ 74 Curcuma longa 1–5 Allergic contact One hundred and fifty eczema patients were treated with Curcuma longa 75 Sesame oil 5–20 Allergic reactions, comedogenic risk, and photosensitivity. Forty women with breast cancer who were undergoing five weeks of radiation therapy were randomly divided into two groups: twenty with sesame oil and twenty with a placebo. According to this research, sesame oil may treat acute dermatitis caused by radiation therapy [ 76 pharmaceuticals-18-01248-t006_Table 6 Table 6 Types of Western and Chinese medicines, their treatment durations, and their side effects.
