Methods The programme was designed and delivered as part of a real-world, supportive care intervention and adapted for digital delivery in response to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. FCR, quality of life (QoL), psychological flexibility, and psychological distress measures were routinely collected pre-participation, post-participation, and 12 weeks following completion. Results Ninety-seven in-person and 61 digital participants completed the group programme. Uptake was 30% and retention 89% for in-person. Uptake was 23% and retention 64% for online referrals. Between group statistical analyses revealed non-significant differences between delivery modality on overall scores of FCR ( p p p p p p Conclusion In-person and online delivery of a real-world FCR group programme offered to breast-cancer survivors was found to be beneficial and comparable. These results support the potential benefits of a flexible approach to delivery modality of supportive care interventions. Further investigation is required to determine if these results are replicable within diverse populations.

Low levels can be beneficial and provide an adaptive function in ensuring ongoing engagement with healthcare follow-up, making positive lifestyle changes and attending to symptoms [ 1 2 Psychological interventions can be effective in treating FCR, and contemporary cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) interventions such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) are found to be more beneficial than traditional CBT [ 3 4 Increasing psychological flexibility is the core aim of an ACT-based model and is defined as the ability to embrace the present moment, including challenging thoughts, feelings, and emotions. An ACT-based approach emphasises the need to understand what is truly important to an individual to enable them to live a values-based life alongside internal and external experiences [ 5 ConquerFear, a partially ACT-based psychological intervention, provides insight into the efficacy and delivery adaptability of psychological intervention for FCR. ConquerFear was initially developed as a five-session, one-to-one in-person intervention in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluation of 222 breast, colorectal, and melanoma cancer survivors. It demonstrated significant improvements in outcome measures of FCR, quality of life (QoL), distress, and anxiety [ 6 7 8 8 The intervention described within this service evaluation encompasses an ACT-based, psychological group programme for breast cancer survivors seeking support for FCR, the foundations of which were inspired by the ConquerFear intervention. This was initially developed by healthcare professionals as an in-person intervention, launched in 2017. Published service evaluation of this real-world, in-person group intervention shows statistically significant reductions in FCR and psychological distress alongside increased QoL and psychological flexibility, persisting at 12-week follow-up [ 9 The COVID-19 pandemic caused a widespread negative psychological impact across society [ 10 11 To ensure ongoing support of people with FCR, the group programme was rapidly adapted for online delivery as a pragmatic response to pandemic-driven service adaptation. Here, we provide a real-world, descriptive evaluation of the effectiveness and acceptability of in-person and online delivery of an ACT-based group programme for FCR. Scores on measures of FCR, QoL, psychological distress, and psychological flexibility were compared between groups. Specific hypotheses are not defined due to the naturalistic and descriptive attributes of this evaluation. Materials and methods Group participants The eligibility criteria for this group programme are as follows: Completion of curative, active treatment for a primary breast cancer No clinical evidence of disease Age 18 and over English fluency Prescription of maintenance treatments such as endocrine therapy, Herceptin, and adjuvant bisphosphonates was not an exclusion to group participation. Referrals to the group programme were received from NHS clinicians, charity organisations, and self-referral routes. Referrals were deemed ineligible if they were in the process of receiving any form of primary treatment for cancer, had metastatic disease, or demonstrated evidence within their medical notes of complex psychological conditions, suicidal intent, or current alcohol/drug misuse. Service development and delivery The group programme was originally developed by two clinical psychologists (CH, NR) and a specialist radiation therapist (FS) to be delivered as an NHS service provision [ 9 . 5 9 . In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the programme materials were modified by the group facilitators for online delivery. The materials were amended by the specialist radiation therapist who originally co-developed the intervention (FS) as well as a clinical psychologist (CB). The facilitators aimed to keep the programme as similar as possible to in-person delivery, with focus on the practicalities of achieving this, including utilising breakout rooms for smaller, non-facilitator group discussion, digital slideshows instead of flipcharts, and modification to experiential activities to accommodate a virtual format while maintaining fidelity to ACT principles. The first digital group was delivered in May 2020. The group programme was exclusively offered digitally via ‘Zoom’ between May 2020 and August 2022, and outcome measures were collected from all groups running during this period. Three psychologists were involved in group facilitation separately during this specified time (CB, LM, MC) as well as a specialist radiation therapist (FS) who co-facilitated all sessions. For both delivery modalities, groups encompassed a maximum of 15 participants, taking place over 6 consecutive weeks, 2 h per week. All participants were invited to a follow-up session, which took place 12 weeks after completion.

Written explanation was provided alongside the outcome measures to explain their importance in monitoring the effectiveness of the group programme. Return of outcome measures was not enforced, and participants’ ability to attend the intervention was not dependent on their return. Primary outcomes Reduction in FCR was the primary aim of this intervention and was measured using the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory-Short Form (FCSRI-SF) [ 12 . Secondary outcomes Secondary outcome measures included QoL measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for breast cancer (FACT-B) [ 13 14 15 16 17 QoL (FACT-B) was assessed as a key outcome in supportive care in cancer [ 18 14 12 Uptake and retention data was evaluated to determine if there was any difference between in-person and digital participation. Dropout rate was determined as those who failed to attend a minimum of four of the six group sessions. Statistical analysis Demographic statistics were used to summarise participant demographics and study uptake/retention rates. Chi-square tests of independence were applied to compare demographics and acceptability measures of uptake and retention between group delivery modalities. To assess outcome measure data (FCR, QoL, psychological flexibility, and psychological distress), we used a 2 × 3 mixed design ANOVA, with delivery modality as the between-subjects factor and time as the within-subjects factor. Continuous outcome data were assessed for statistical assumptions prior to analysis. Normality was visualised and tested using Shapiro–Wilk tests. Assumption of sphericity for repeated-measures ANOVA was assessed using Mauchly’s test, and where this was violated, Greenhouse–Geisser correction was applied. Homogeneity of variance was tested using Levene’s Test. A p Mean scores and standard deviations with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for pairwise comparison across timepoints. Where significant effects of time were found, pairwise comparisons were conducted with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Partial eta squared values were reported to indicate effect size (small 0.01–0.05; medium 0.06–0.13; large ≥ 0.14). Analysis was carried out using v29 IBM SPSS Statistics . Ethical considerations Ethical approval was not required as this intervention was routinely offered as an NHS provision of care and all data were recorded as standard. For purposes of this service evaluation, anonymised, routine data were analysed. Approval to access and analyse this anonymised data under ownership of the NHS health board was obtained from the Caldicott Guardian. Funding The funding for the group programmes running between January 2017 and August 2022, and encompassing the data analysed within this service evaluation, was provided by Breast Cancer 2000 (SC030630), the Beatson Cancer Charity (SC044442), and the National Lottery Community Fund (Charity Number 1010518). Results Descriptive statistics A total of 772 breast cancer survivors were referred to the 6-week FCR group programme between January 2017 and July 2022. This encompassed 361 referrals (13.9 per month) for the in-person programme between January 2017 and December 2019 and 411 referrals (13.7 per month) for the online programme between January 2020 and July 2022. Group participants were all female and had completed curative treatment for breast cancer; mean age was 52 years (in-person delivery) and 49 years (digital delivery). The mean age of those who dropped out was 51 years (in-person) and 59 years (digital). The majority of participants who completed a group had completed treatment within 6 months: 68/97 (70%) in-person participants and 36/61 (59%) online participants. Descriptive statistics are detailed within Table 2 . Table 2 Baseline routinely collected demographic information comparing in-person and online participants.

The intervention was found to benefit participants across all outcomes of both delivery modalities, reducing FCR and psychological distress, while increasing QoL and psychological flexibility . We recognise the importance of interpreting if these findings translate to minimal clinically important difference (MCID). While no universally accepted MCID exists for the FCRI-SF, studies have suggested that reductions of 4–5 points are considered clinically meaningful [ 6 19 13 We found the relatively rapid adaptation to online delivery to be well received, with similar numbers of referrals per month across the evaluated period. Clinician referrals reduced for the online group programme and self-referrals increased, as may be expected following pandemic restriction onset. However, the in-person retention rate was significantly higher (89%) and comparable to other published work on FCR intervention, finding a retention rate of 94% [ 19 20 21 Impact of COVID-19 pandemic Evidence emerging following the end of pandemic restrictions revealed that psychological support continued to be important for many affected by cancer [ 22 23 . 24 25 . Following the gradual return to in-person healthcare service provisions, many services have continued to offer hybrid or online-only support, presenting the opportunity for comparison of delivery modality on patient outcomes. A recent cancer support service audit compared patient and therapist experience of in-person versus online delivery. Qualitative data revealed patients felt understood, respected, and confident in their ability to engage effectively with online support. Patient feedback highlighted the benefits of accessibility and reduced risk of infection. However, quantitative data revealed 87% of patients and 100% of therapists preferred in-person support [ 26 The results presented within our service evaluation contribute to the pool of data emerging following the end of pandemic restrictions. This has allowed for the comparison of real-world, supportive care interventions delivered in-person and online. As such, we have demonstrated the possibility of an acceptable FCR group intervention deliverable via in-person and online methods, with positive outcomes for breast-cancer survivors. However, uptake and retention were both significantly lower in the online group programme compared to in-person delivery. It remains unclear whether this reduced engagement is attributable to the acute effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or reflects a more persistent challenge associated with digital intervention delivery. A recent scoping review identified 28 web-based interventions for FCR and reported mixed evidence of effectiveness, with common limitations including insufficient long-term follow-up and poor reporting of participant adherence and completion rates [ 27 . Strengths Our service evaluation demonstrates that a real-world supportive care intervention for breast cancer survivors improved FCR, QoL, psychological flexibility, and psychological distress outcomes following completion of a 6-week group programme. Furthermore, the intervention was able to be quickly adapted for online delivery and ensured continued supportive care during the pandemic when many supportive interventions for people affected by cancer were reduced or withdrawn [ 28 Limitations The results from our service evaluation are limited by the population, which consisted of breast cancer survivors. Furthermore, results are not generalisable outside the geographical region where this intervention was offered as part of routine healthcare intervention. The in-person and online delivery of groups were not delivered in parallel, limiting any conclusions drawn regarding comparability, and group participants did not have a choice of modality. Participants were not randomised to delivery format and did not have a choice in modality, which may have affected motivation, expectations, or accessibility. Finally, while outcome measures demonstrated statistically significant improvements across both formats, clinically meaningful change thresholds and qualitative participant experiences were not assessed, limiting our understanding of the personal relevance and sustainability of observed effects. Future directions There are currently no UK clinical guidelines for cancer survivors living with FCR, despite recognition that this is an unmet need [ 29 30 31 32 Rigorous research methodology would be of benefit to inform clinical guidelines, including the evaluation of optimal delivery modality as well as feasibility and effectiveness for other cancer types. It would be of interest to assess whether patients having the choice of delivery modality would be beneficial. Future evaluations should consider integrating routine assessment of digital readiness, comorbidities, and health literacy, alongside mixed-methods data collection, to explore barriers and facilitators of engagement more fully. Further research is needed to evaluate the health economics of online versus in-person delivery. Conclusion The results presented add to the limited but growing evidence of the efficacy of ACT for the treatment of FCR in a real-world, healthcare setting, over an extended period. Furthermore, we demonstrate the possibility of amending an in-person ACT intervention for online delivery, with encouraging results. This service evaluation demonstrates that a 6-week, ACT-based psychological intervention for FCR shows promise in improving a range of outcomes for breast cancer survivors, whether delivered in-person or online. This small-scale evaluation was based on mixed data collected routinely as part of a real-world supportive care service evaluation. Due to the nature of this service evaluation, the results are not generalisable to other settings or patient populations but provide justification for further investigation using rigorous research methodology. Overall, this evaluation adds to the growing body of evidence indicating the ability and need to effectively address FCR in breast cancer survivors through structured, psychological, group-based intervention.
