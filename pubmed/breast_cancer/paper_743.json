We describe a case of a 49-year-old woman admitted for acute abdominal pain due to an ileal stenosis that proved to be metastatic invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast. Mammography and ultrasonography were negative, while breast MRI showed only subtle lesions. Histology combined with immunohistochemistry confirmed the diagnosis, consistent with an occult primary tumor. The patient underwent segmental ileal resection, followed by hormonal therapy combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, with an uncomplicated early postoperative course.

The pain had been increasing for two weeks, peaking on the day of presentation. She reported multiple episodes of abdominal pain and diarrhea over the past two months, and on one occasion, this was accompanied by vomiting. It had led to two prior visits to the emergency department. During one of these visits, one month earlier, a computed tomography abdominal scan showed an ileal lesion suggestive of ileitis, compatible with an IBD. A gastroenterological follow-up was planned. On this third visit, the patient's vital signs were normal, and she was afebrile. Her medical history included a hiatal hernia, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and a hearing loss managed with a hearing aid. She reported no smoking history and moderate alcohol consumption. Abdominal palpation revealed tenderness in both iliac fossae and the hypogastrium. Laboratory tests were unremarkable, besides an elevated white blood count, and showed no significant inflammatory syndrome (Table 1 Table 1 Laboratory results.

Sagittal (A) and coronal (B) views of the abdominal CT after intravenous contrast administration showing a circumferential stenotic ileal wall lesion (arrows) with upstream small bowel dilation and a feces sign, indicating delayed transit. The patient was hospitalized, and conservative treatment with nasogastric decompression was started. A colonoscopy was performed. The procedure revealed small pseudopolypoid lesions measuring approximately 5-6 mm, predominantly in the caecum and right colon (Figure 2 Figure 2 Colonoscopy. Pseudopolypoid lesions (arrows) in the right colon (A-C), and normal ileum (D). The patient’s condition worsened during her hospitalization, with vomiting and cessation of bowel movements, consistent with SBO. She subsequently underwent a segmental small bowel resection with a side-to-side anastomosis. Histopathological analysis of the bowel resection confirmed florid peritoneal carcinomatosis due to a lobular breast carcinoma, with involvement of one metastatic lymph node. Immunohistochemistry showed strong cytokeratin 7 and GATA3 expression (Figure 3 4 Figure 3 Immunohistochemistry showed strong cytokeratin 7 (A) and GATA3 expression (B). Figure 4 Immunohistochemistry showed strong positivity for estrogen receptors (A) and progesterone receptors (B), and low positivity for Her2 (C) and Ki-67 (D). Histological examination of the colonic polypoid lesions also demonstrated submucosal infiltration by a poorly differentiated carcinoma. The immunohistochemical profile was similar to that identified in the small-bowel resection specimen, compatible with a mammary origin (Figure 5 Figure 5 Histology and immunochemistry of the colonic polypoid lesions. Hematoxylin and eosin coloration (A), strong positivity for cytokeratin 7 (B), estrogen receptors (C), and progesterone receptors (D). A complementary imaging workup was performed following the histopathological results. Mammography yielded negative findings, revealing heterogeneously dense breast tissue (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) C) with a regular, oval-shaped 7 mm opacity in the outer quadrant of the right breast, while the left breast displayed a few scattered punctate microcalcifications, without any suspicious lesion (Figure 6 7 8 Figure 6 Digital mammography.

Multiple foci of moderate focal uptake in axial and appendicular joints, without evidence of metastatic involvement. Breast MRI confirmed the absence of concerning findings on the right (BI-RADS 2), but revealed on the left a faintly enhancing microlobulated 20 mm lesion in the mid outer quadrant, and a 5 mm intramammary lymph node (Figure 9 Figure 9 Axial diffusion-weighted breast MRI. Areas of focal enhancement in the left breast (A, B). The postoperative course was uncomplicated. Systemic therapy was initiated shortly after surgery with endocrine-targeted treatment, namely, letrozole (aromatase inhibitor) plus ribociclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor), and has been well tolerated. At one-year follow-up, the patient remains on therapy under routine surveillance. Discussion We report the case of an occult lobular breast carcinoma with negative mammography findings, revealed by an obstructive ileal metastasis. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) accounts for 10-15% of breast cancers and is characterized by diffuse spread to unusual metastatic sites such as the gastrointestinal tract, ovaries, and peritoneum [ 3 4 4 5 GI metastases of breast cancer are more frequent in ILC than in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), with an incidence ranging from 4% to 18% according to studies [ 5 7 3 4 The diagnosis of GI metastases from ILC is often challenging due to the insidious progression of the disease. Immunohistochemical markers play a crucial role in distinguishing primary gastrointestinal tumors from metastatic breast cancer. CK7 positivity, as observed in our patient, is typical of breast cancer metastases [ 4 6 5 6 Management of GI metastases in breast cancer requires a multidisciplinary approach. Surgery is often necessary in cases of symptomatic obstruction, like in this case, although its impact on overall survival remains limited [ 5 6 4 5 Conclusions This case emphasizes the importance of considering metastatic breast cancer in the differential diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction in emergency settings. Physicians, especially in the emergency department, should remain vigilant in patients presenting with atypical gastrointestinal symptoms in the presence of suggestive but inconclusive imaging findings, even in the absence of clear clinical signs of breast cancer. When mammography and ultrasound are inconclusive in suspected occult breast cancer, breast MRI plays a pivotal role in detection and staging.
