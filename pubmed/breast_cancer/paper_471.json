Materials and methods This study enrolled 65 female patients who underwent both CE-CBBCT and MRI after NAT and were classified as having either pCR or MRD. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent visual and quantitative features from CE-CBBCT and MRI associated with pCR. Model performance was assessed and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), DeLong’s test, and McNemar’s test. The bootstrap method was employed to assess the stability of each model. Results Multivariate analysis identified fine and branched calcification morphology on CE-CBBCT (visual model: odds ratio [OR] = 4.500; combined model: OR = 4.527), enhanced degree (ΔHU, quantitative model: OR = 1.036; combined model: OR = 1.035), radiographic complete response (rCR; visual model: OR = 0.103; combined model: OR = 0.097), and delayed-phase MRI enhancement ratio (ER dpMRI p p p Conclusion The combination of calcification morphology and ΔHU on CE-CBBCT improved accuracy in discriminating pCR from MRD, achieving performance comparable to MRI. Notably, the CE-CBBCT combined model showed superior specificity to MRI within the HER2-enriched subgroup, suggesting its potential utility in reducing overtreatment in this patient population.

Materials and methods Study cohort This retrospective study was conducted under a funded research program on CBBCT and was approved by the institutional review board. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to CBBCT examinations. A total of 177 patients who completed NAT and underwent both preoperative CBBCT and MRI between July 2020 and July 2024 were initially reviewed. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) patients who underwent only non-contrast-enhanced CBBCT (NCE-CBBCT) ( n n n n 1 Fig. 1 Flow chart of study. Note: NAT, neoadjuvant therapy; CE-CBBCT, contrast-enhanced cone beam breast CT; NCE-CBBCT, non-contrast enhanced cone-beam breast CT; MRD, minimal residual disease; pCR, pathological complete response CE-CBBCT protocol All CBBCT examinations were performed using a dedicated breast imaging system (KBCT-1000, Koning Corporation, China), which is certified by both the FDA and the China FDA. During the procedure, patients were placed in the prone position with the affected breast suspended freely within the gantry. NCE-CBBCT was performed first, followed by contrast-enhanced imaging using a power injector (ANT200200, Antmed) administered at a flow rate of 2–2.5 mL/s. A weight-adjusted dose (2 mL/kg) of non-ionic iodinated contrast medium (Iodixanol, Omnipaque® 270, GE Healthcare) was injected, with image acquisition initiated after a 120-second delay. The scanning protocol employed a fixed tube voltage of 49 kVp, while the tube current automatically adjusted between 50 and 64 mA based on breast density and volume. The estimated radiation dose per scan ranged from 5.8 to 6.4 mGy. Image reconstruction was performed using a standard soft-tissue algorithm with an isotropic voxel size of (0.273 mm) 3 MRI protocol All MRI examinations were performed using 1.5T or 3.0T scanners (General Electric Healthcare, USA) with dedicated 4- or 8-channel phased-array breast coils. Patients were placed in the prone position with both breasts gently suspended within the coil. The imaging protocol included non-contrast and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences, specifically: (a) axial T1-weighted fast spin-echo (TR/TE = 622/10 ms), (b) axial fat-saturated T2-weighted (TR/TE = 6330/68 ms; slice thickness = 5 mm; slice gap = 0.5 mm; matrix = 384 × 224), and (c) volume imaging for breast assessment (VIBRANT) (TR/TE = 6.1/2.9 ms; matrix = 256 × 128; slice thickness = 2 mm). After acquiring baseline images, gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.2 mL/kg body weight at a rate of 2.0 mL/s using an MRI-compatible power injector, followed by a 20 mL saline flush. Five sequential sagittal DCE-MRI acquisitions were obtained at 90–100 second intervals, with the early phase captured at 90 seconds and the delayed phase at approximately 450 seconds. The interval between CE-CBBCT and MRI examinations was maintained between 4 hours and 2 weeks to avoid overlapping contrast exposure and minimize the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. Image analysis Two radiologists with 5 and 9 years of experience in breast imaging, respectively, independently reviewed all CE-CBBCT and MRI examinations and performed measurements using a PACS workstation. Initially, one radiologist evaluated all CE-CBBCT images while the other assessed all MRI studies. After a two-week washout period, the datasets were exchanged and re-evaluated. One month later, the less experienced radiologist reanalyzed all images using the same criteria to assess consistency. Qualitative features were determined by consensus, whereas quantitative parameters were averaged across three independent measurements for statistical analysis. On CE-CBBCT, radiographic complete response (rCR) was defined as the absence of both enhancement and calcifications. On MRI, rCR was defined as no enhancement in either early or delayed phases, although minor architectural distortion were permitted. Lesions on CE-CBBCT were classified as rCR, calcifications only, or enhancing lesions. Calcification distribution and morphology on NCE-CBBCT images were assessed according to the BI-RADS mammography guidelines (5th edition) [ 24 Quantitative parameters evaluated on CE-CBBCT included the enhancement degree (ΔHU), enhancement ratio (ER), density enhancement deviation (DED), and density enhancement ratio (DER). The coronal slice with strongest enhancement at 2.7-mm thickness was selected for measurement. Three circular regions of interest (ROIs; median diameter: 2 mm; range: 1–3 mm) were manually placed to sample the highest enhancement within the lesion, the lowest enhancement in adjacent normal parenchyma, and a reference area in nearby fat, avoiding calcifications and vessels. For MRI, parameters including delta signal intensity (ΔSI), ER, signal enhancement deviation (SED), and SER were derived from both early and delayed phases using two equal-sized ROIs placed in the region of strongest enhancement and normal parenchyma. In cases of rCR, ROIs were positioned within the tumor bed based on asymmetry or structural distortion. A schematic diagram and formulas for all parameters are provided in Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Schematic diagram and calculation formulars for quantitative parameter measurement based on CE-CBBCT and DCE-MRI. ( a b-c d-f g Clinicopathological characteristics’ collection Clinical data, including age, menopausal status, initial clinical stage, NAT regimen, and surgical details, were retrospectively collected from questionnaires and electronic medical records. Surgical histopathology parameters, such as therapeutic response, T stage, N stage, and histologic type, were evaluated by two experienced pathologists. pCR was defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer or DCIS in both the breast and lymph nodes (pT 0 0 25 26 Molecular subtypes were determined from pre-NAT core biopsy specimens using immunohistochemical staining for hormone receptors and HER2. Subtypes were defined as follows [ 27 Statistical analysis Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify variables derived from CE-CBBCT and MRI that were associated with pCR. Variables with a p p The diagnostic performance of each model was assessed using the area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Sensitivity and PPV were used to assess the models’ ability to identify MRD, while specificity and NPV reflected their performance in predicting pCR. The DeLong test was employed to compare AUC values, and the McNemar test was used to compare other diagnostic metrics. To evaluate the stability and generalizability of each model, bootstrap validation with 1000 iterations was performed, and the mean AUC with 95% confidence interval (CI) was reported. Inter- and intra-observer agreement were evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for continuous variables and weighted Kappa statistics for categorical variables. ICC values were interpreted as follows [ 28 All analysis using SPSS (version 25.0, IBM Corp), MedCalc (version 20.022) and python in jupyter notebook (version 3.0).

Our results demonstrate that a combined model integrating calcification morphology and ΔHU on CE-CBBCT outperformed visual assessment alone and achieved diagnostic accuracy comparable to MRI. Notably, the CE-CBBCT combined model exhibited higher specificity than MRI in identifying pCR, particularly in HER2-enriched BC. The substantial consistency in calcification evaluation between CBBCT and digital mammography reported by Liu et al. [ 29 The interval between CE-CBBCT and MRI examinations reflected a balance between scientific rigor and clinical feasibility. Although same-day imaging was precluded by logistical constraints, the median interval of 3 days aligns with accepted practices in multimodal imaging research. Moreover, the absence of correlation between inter-scan and measurement discrepancies indicates that our comparative results are robust against this potential confounding factor. Our analysis revealed that while lesion type and the absence of calcifications on CE-CBBCT were insufficient to discriminate between pCR and MRD, specific calcification morphology emerged as an independent predictor of pCR. According to BI-RADS guidelines, fine linear or branched calcifications often suggest DCIS. However, distinguishing post-NAT necrotic calcifications from residual DCIS based solely on morphology remains challenging and may compromise diagnostic specificity [ 19 30 31 The reduced enhancement of lesions on early-phase MRI after NAT underscores the importance of multiphase acquisition for treatment response evaluation. Although rCR showed some predictive value for pCR, visual assessment specificity remains limited due to confounding factors such as fibrosis and inflammatory edema that can cause delayed enhancement [ 32 33 16 dpMRI Comparative analysis revealed that the MRI visual model exhibited higher sensitivity and NPV than CE-CBBCT, likely attributable to MRIs multiphase scanning capability and superior soft tissue resolution. Conversely, the CE-CBBCT quantitative model demonstrated slightly higher specificity, potientially influenced by earlier enhancement phase, thinner slices, and difference in contrast agent properties between the two modalities. Although the MRI combined model showed marginally higher sensitivity, specificity, and AUC than CE-CBBCT, the lack of statistical significance indicates comparable performance in discriminating pCR from MRD, positioning CE-CBBCT as a viable alternative for patients contraindicated or intolerant to MRI. Given the high diagnostic performance of both combined models, we further assessed their efficacy across molecular subtypes. The variable performance observed reflects biological differences among subtypes. Luminal BC often present as non-mass enhancement [ 34 35 36 37 Several limitations warrant consideration. First, the retrospective, single-center design necessitates validation through prospective, multicenter studies despite substantial inter-observer agreement. Second, although understandable given the dual-modality requirement, the limited cohort size precluded optimal cut-off value analysis for quantitative parameters. Third, the unbalanced distribution of molecular subtypes, particularly the small TNBC cohort, may have compromised statistical power in subgroup analyses. Finally, subgroup analyses were restricted to molecular subtypes; future investigations should incorporate additional factors such as NAT regimens and MRI field strength, particularly in larger cohorts. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that combining calcification morphology and ΔHU on preoperative CE-CBBCT improves accuracy in distinguishing pCR from MRD, with performance comparable to MRI. These findings suggest CE-CBBCT represents an effective alternative for treatment response after NAT. The superior specificity of CE-CBBCT in HER2-enriched BC suggests its potential utility in reducing unnecessary overtreatment.
