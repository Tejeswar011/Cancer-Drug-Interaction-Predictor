Goobie Editor We would like to thank Professors Walker and Nott for their insightful and constructive correspondence regarding our post hoc 1 We fully agree that vascular access is a critical component of cancer care, and that practices inevitably vary across countries, healthcare systems, and even between public and private sectors within the same country. The Australian perspective they provide is a valuable contribution to this ongoing discussion. An initiative currently led by Associate Professor Peter J. Carr and PhD scholar Caitríona Duggan at the University of Galway in Ireland has conducted a pan-European survey aimed at characterising vascular access device (VAD) practices for systemic anticancer therapy across Europe. This effort addresses key gaps in clinician decision-making, training, and complication management. The results of this initiative are expected to be published in the near future. To date, no randomised controlled trials addressing vascular access in cancer care have been conducted on an international scale. While the CAVA trial remains the largest of its type, it was limited to the UK, 2 As Walker and Nott rightly point out, current practice is shaped by a range of factors—including healthcare financing models, availability of trained personnel, and the limitations of existing guidelines. The absence of clear, device-specific recommendations in current guidelines has contributed to variability in practice. Initiatives such as The Michigan Appropriateness Guide for Intravenous Catheters (MAGIC) project, led by Professor Vineet Chopra’s group in the USA, are commendable efforts to address this gap and provide more structured guidance. 3 We also appreciate the emphasis placed on patient experience, particularly regarding pain during insertion. This is a crucial issue, especially for vulnerable patients undergoing cancer treatment. There is certainly room for further innovation and standardisation in this area to improve patient satisfaction and reduce procedural discomfort. Our group is currently addressing these challenges, and results from a full-scale randomised trial evaluating the effectiveness of patient-controlled sedation during PORT implantation (PACSPI trial) are expected to be published soon. Both the CAVA and PICCPORT trials addressed the health economic dimensions of VAD selection in cancer care. Although both were conducted in European contexts, their findings are aligned. 4 5 6 Declarations of interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest. References 1 Utas A.
