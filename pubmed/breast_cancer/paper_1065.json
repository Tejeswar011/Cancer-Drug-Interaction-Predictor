This dermatosis is known for hyperproliferation, parakeratosis, dysregulated differentiation of keratinocytes, lack of granular layer of the skin and impaired apoptosis of keratinocytes. Methods Fifty patients with psoriasis and twenty-eight healthy individuals were enrolled in the study. Serum samples were collected both from the psoriatic patients and patients with an inguinal hernia, who served as the control group. Visfatin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Various proteins have been well described as key contributors to the complex pathogenesis of psoriasis. Results: In our study, we found that serum visfatin levels were significantly higher in the psoriatic group compared to the control group. Interestingly, we observed a positive and statistically significant correlation between serum visfatin levels and HDL-C concentrations in patients with psoriasis. Discussion: An elevated HDL-C level in psoriatic serum might be a sign of a compensatory response to systemic inflammation, or a marker of metabolic dysfunction, or an early prognostic signal in disease progression. However, no significant correlations were found between visfatin levels and the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. Conclusions: In summary, our findings indicate that visfatin levels are significantly altered in the serum of patients with psoriasis compared to the control group and it could be a pivotal point of understanding the pathogenesis of psoriasis and a new way of implementing therapeutic procedures. psoriasis skin diseases protein visfatin NAMPT HDL-C Medical University of Bialystok B.SUB.24.230 The research was funded by the Medical University of Bialystok.

Introduction Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory and autoimmune skin disease characterised by alternating periods of exacerbation and remission [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 13 Psoriasis may appear in various clinical forms including plaque, guttate, flexural, pustular, and erythrodermic psoriasis. The most common type is plaque psoriasis, characterised by well-demarcated pink to red plaques covered with fine or thick white-silvery scale. Additionally, this dermatosis typically exhibits a fairly symmetrical distribution and most commonly affects the scalp, trunk, and extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees [ 14 15 16 17 Recent studies revealed several proteins that could be key players in the pathogenesis and progression of psoriasis, such as visfatin/nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) [ 18 19 20 Multiple cell types manufacture visfatin, including adipocytes [ 20 21 22 23 24 Visfatin plays a key role in regulating different tumour-related processes, like apoptosis, proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and invasion [ 25 26 Moreover, visfatin is a proinflammatory protein, which enhances the production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as the following: interleukin-6, TNF-α, and interleukin-1 beta in human monocytes and endothelial cells [ 27 28 29 30 Visfatin also augments the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), which are essential key players in angiogenesis [ 31 Despite the advancements above, visfatin has been identified as a potential player in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. However, its precise role and the link between its serum levels and disease severity still remain elusive. This article aims to deepen our understanding of the role of visfatin in the development and progression of psoriasis. We assessed the concentration of visfatin in patients with psoriasis compared to a healthy control group and evaluated its association with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores (indicating disease severity), as well as with various biochemical and clinical parameters. 2. Materials and Methods A total of 50 patients (20 females and 30 males) with active plaque-type psoriasis, at a median age of 51.0, who were hospitalised in the clinic of Dermatology and Venereology of the Medical University of Bialystok, and 28 controls, suffering from inguinal hernia (24 females and 4 males) at a median age of 42.0, who were hospitalised in the I Clinic of General and Endocrine Surgery, Medical University of Bialystok, were enrolled in this study. The severity of psoriasis was estimated using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) [ 32 33 2.1. Visfatin Analysis The concentration of visfatin (ng/mL) in the serum was assessed by the commercially available kit Human Visfatin (NAMPT) ELISE, BioVendor group enzyme immunoassay kit (Brno, Czech Republic) on Biotek Synergy 2 Plate Reader Multi-Mode using Gen5™ 2.0 Data Analysis Software (version 2.01.14). The quantitative determination of the tested protein was performed according to the manufacturer’s procedure in the Department of Neurodegeneration Diagnostics. The serum samples were undiluted. Standards and samples were run in duplicates with a coefficient of variance (CV) < 20%. Absorbance was read at 450 nm. 2.2. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was conducted using Julia ver. 1.10.8 ( https://julialang.org/ Table 1 Table 1 t U p Table 2 p 3. Results 3.1. Study Population In this study, 50 patients (20 females and 30 males) with active plaque-type psoriasis and 28 healthy patients (24 females and 4 males) were analysed. The median age in the control group was 42, ranging from 37.5 to 47.2 years; the median age in the psoriatic group was 51, ranging from 34.2 to 66.0 years. The average duration of psoriasis was 16 years. In the control group, the median body mass was 69.5 kg (63.8–79.2) kg, the mean height was 165.0 (161.5–170.2) cm, and the median BMI was 25.1 (23.5–27.9) kg/m 2 In the control group, we included patients who were planned to undergo surgery due to inguinal hernia. The patients did not suffer from any metabolic and skin diseases. In the study group, we included adult patients dealing with plaque psoriasis with at least a 4-week gap without systemic treatment (methotrexate, acitretin, or cyclosporine). Based on that, we excluded psoriatic patients who were on systemic anti-psoriatic treatment. Data on systemic diseases were collected from patients’ hospital records: hypertension, liver diseases (e.g., non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)), heart diseases, and diabetes mellitus. None of the patients in the study or control group were subject to dietary restrictions, did not use protein-rich products during the study, and did not take any medications that could affect protein metabolism. Table 1 3.2. Visfatin Parameter The median concentration of visfatin found in the serum of psoriatic individuals (1.2 ng/mL) was found to be significantly higher ( p Figure 1 4. Discussion The Role of Visfatin In this study, we investigated serum visfatin levels in patients with psoriasis and compared them to the levels in healthy individuals. Moreover, we also assessed the relationship between visfatin levels and various clinical and laboratory parameters within the psoriatic patient group. Our findings showed that the level of visfatin was significantly higher in the serum of patients suffering from psoriasis compared with serum samples of the control group.

[ 39 39 The Link Between Visfatin and HDL-C In our study, we observed a statistically significant, positive correlation between visfatin levels and HDL-C levels in the serum of the psoriatic group (r = 0.41, p Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 2 Correlation matrix (heatmap) in the psoriatic group. Pearson correlation coefficients are depicted as the shades of blue (positive correlation) or red (negative correlation). BMI—body mass index, CRP—C-reactive protein, TG—triacylglycerol, AST—Aspartate transaminase, ALT—Alanine transaminase, PASI—Psoriasis Area Severity Index. Figure 3 The scatterplot shows a correlation between visfatin and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) in the serum of patients with psoriasis. Above and on the right of the scatter plot, density plots are overlaid, depicting the distribution of the variables on the X- and Y-axis, respectively. Dagdelen et al. [ 40 40 41 42 43 41 42 43 In our study, visfatin levels were positively correlated with HDL-C concentrations. While this finding may initially appear counterintuitive—given visfatin’s well-established proinflammatory role and HDL-C’s traditionally protective, anti-inflammatory profile—several explanations may account for this association. In chronic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, HDL particles can undergo structural and functional modifications, leading to the formation of dysfunctional HDL that retains quantitative presence (measured as HDL-C) but loses its protective properties [ 44 Moreover, in our study, ALT levels were positively correlated with HDL-C weight of psoriatic patients ( Figure 4 Patients with psoriasis are at a significantly higher risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and obesity compared to the general population [ 45 46 47 p p p 46 However, several limitations of our study should be acknowledged. Although patients with diagnosed and/or treated metabolic diseases were excluded, it remains possible that some individuals had undiagnosed or subclinical metabolic conditions that could have influenced both visfatin and HDL-C levels. Therefore, the observed correlation might reflect an early or pre-diagnostic metabolic state, potentially serving as a prognostic indicator rather than a direct mechanistic link. In addition, we cannot fully exclude the influence of important clinical and demographic confounders such as age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, or lifestyle factors, which may affect both adipokine and lipid profiles. The relatively small study cohort (50 psoriatic patients and 28 controls) further limits the statistical power and generalisability of the findings. Finally, all blood samples were collected prior to the initiation of psoriasis-specific treatment, and it remains unclear how systemic therapy might subsequently affect the visfatin–HDL-C relationship. Larger, longitudinal studies with multivariable adjustment are warranted to validate these findings and to better elucidate the underlying mechanisms. 5. Conclusions Our findings suggest that elevated visfatin levels in the serum of psoriatic patients, compared to healthy controls, may reflect a broader role of this adipokine in the systemic pathogenesis of psoriasis. Beyond skin manifestations, these results support the notion that psoriasis is associated with underlying metabolic and inflammatory disturbances, implicating circulating proteins such as visfatin in the broader metabolic profile of affected individuals. This observation highlights visfatin’s potential not only as a biomarker of systemic involvement but also as a mediator linking psoriasis to metabolic comorbidities. Moreover, we identified a statistically significant positive correlation between visfatin and HDL-C levels in psoriatic patients. Although HDL-C is typically considered cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory, its functional quality may be impaired in chronic inflammatory states. The unexpected correlation with HDL-C underscores the need for further research into the functional state of lipoproteins in chronic inflammation and their interaction with adipokines. Importantly, as correlation reflects association rather than causation and may be influenced by multiple confounding factors, this finding should be interpreted with caution and validated in larger, controlled studies.
