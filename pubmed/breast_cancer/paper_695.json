An ideal nanoparticle for such applications must be biologically compatible as well as readily internalized by cells to ensure adequate and stable cell loading. Surface coatings have been used to make nanoparticle trackers suitable for these purposes, but those currently employed tend to have cytotoxic effects. Zwitterionic ligands are known to be biocompatible and antifouling, however the head-to-head evaluation of specific zwitterionic ligands for cell loading has not yet been explored. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) detects superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) using time varying magnetic fields. Because MPI can produce high contrast, real-time images with no tissue depth limitation, it is an ideal candidate for in vivo in vivo Graphical Abstract  magnetic nanoparticle imaging (MPI) zwitterionic ligands cell tracking surface chemistry nanoparticle functionalization nanoparticle uptake pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript yes pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
