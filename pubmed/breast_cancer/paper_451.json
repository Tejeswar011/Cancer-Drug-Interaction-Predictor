However, research on Elicit's performance is limited. Objectives To determine whether Elicit AI is a viable tool for systematic literature searches and title/abstract screening stages. Methods We compared the included studies in four evidence syntheses to those identified using the subscription‐based version of Elicit Pro in Review mode. We calculated sensitivity, precision and observed patterns in the performance of Elicit. Results The sensitivity of Elicit was poor, averaging 39.5% (25.5–69.2%) compared to 94.5% (91.1–98.0%) in the original reviews. However, Elicit identified some included studies not identified by the original searches and had an average of 41.8% precision (35.6–46.2%) which was higher than the 7.55% average of the original reviews (0.65–14.7%). Discussion At the time of this evaluation, Elicit did not search with high enough sensitivity to replace traditional literature searching. However, the high precision of searching in Elicit could prove useful for preliminary searches, and the unique studies identified mean that Elicit can be used by researchers as a useful adjunct. Conclusion Whilst Elicit searches are currently not sensitive enough to replace traditional searching, Elicit is continually improving, and further evaluations should be undertaken as new developments take place. Summary  AI tools, such as Elicit, have been developed to improve the efficiency of evidence synthesis processes, including the identification of studies. Using four case study evidence syntheses Elicit searches had a sensitivity between 25.5% and 69.2% (39.5% average) and precision between 35.6% and 46.2% (41.8% average). Elicit identified some unique studies that met the inclusion criteria for each of the case study evidence syntheses. Based on our results, Elicit is recommended as a supplementary search tool, but not sufficient to replace traditional search methods Elicit is constantly improving and developing its systems, thus independent researchers should continue to evaluate its performance. artificial Intelligence (AI) evidence synthesis literature searching research methodology systematic review The authors received no specific funding for this work. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date November 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:27.09.2025  O. Lau S. Golder Comparison of Elicit AI and Traditional Literature Searching in Evidence Syntheses Using Four Case Studies Cochrane Evidence Synthesis and Methods 3 2025 1 12 10.1002/cesm.70050 1 Background Systematic reviews aim to answer a clear question by collating and synthesizing existing research on a specific topic [ 1 2 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 AI is projected to contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 [ 12 13 Artificial Intelligence 14 15 16 17 After compiling an answerable question, the next part of the systematic review process is to create comprehensive searches of multiple databases and other sources. This step is key to the quality of any systematic review. It is this stage of the review process that the present study evaluates by assessing the value of Elicit's literature search facility. Our objective is to compare the use of Elicit in identifying the included studies in evidence syntheses reviews compared to traditional search methods in evidence syntheses. 2 Methods We selected four different evidence syntheses (two systematic reviews, one umbrella review and one scoping review) in three different areas: public health (two reviews), pharmacology, and surgical procedure. This allows a comparison of Elicit across a range of subject areas to see how Elicit performs in each, thus improving the generalizability of our results. Two of the evidence syntheses (one umbrella review and one scoping review) were conducted in 2024 by one of the authors with the searches undertaken by an experienced information specialist. The other two were recent systematic reviews and were selected from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews as Cochrane Reviews tend to be of higher quality than those published in peer review journals [ 18 19 20 21 22 23 Elicit uses GPT‐3 as its underlying large language model (LLM) and searches the Semantic Scholar database to find publications [ 6 For this evaluation, we used the Review feature in the subscription‐based version Elicit Pro. Elicit is available in three tiers: Basic (free), Plus, and Pro. The Basic version is intended for students and casual exploration and includes access to core Elicit functions such as literature search and basic extraction. Both Plus and Pro are subscription‐based, with the Plus tier offering increased usage limits. However, the Review feature is only available in Elicit Pro, which provides the highest usage limits and is the most comprehensive subscription‐based tier of Elicit. Elicit also offers three different modes tailored to various research tasks: Find Papers mode for literature searching, Research Report mode for generating summaries from selected papers, and Review mode, which we chose because it is the dedicated workflow specifically designed to support systematic reviews. We translated the original research question from each evidence synthesis based on its PICO elements into an Elicit query. Next, Elicit finds the 500 most relevant studies based on the query, and the title and abstract. After this, Elicit generates automated screening criteria for these 500 studies. Some of the initial criteria did not align with those in the review, so Elicit makes it easy for us to adapt and specify the screening criteria ‐ this does not change the 500 potentially eligible studies. We manually adjusted the screening criteria where necessary to match the PICO elements and inclusion criteria of the original comparative reviews. This ensured that the criteria were aligned before Elicit carrying out the screening step. Once Elicit identified the eligible studies, we exported all 500 studies into Microsoft Excel and compared the studies found in Elicit to those included in the review. Elicit makes the screening process very transparent as it provides a spreadsheet with individual columns for every inclusion criterion and if each of the studies meets it. Finally, Elicit generates a score based on the number of criteria met by the study, factoring in the importance of each one. This score is then used to determine the overall outcome of the study, with the threshold score for inclusion set automatically by Elicit. Elicit stresses the fact that although it can fully automate the search, at any point in time, the user is able to ‘manually override any disagreements.’ [ 24 25 2.1 Case Study 1: Vaping Harms This was an umbrella review on the acute and long‐term harms of vaping in young people under the age of 25 [ 26 For Elicit, the question asked was “What systematic reviews exist that comprehensively document the short‐term and long‐term health risks associated with vaping in populations aged 10‐24 years?” We asked Elicit the question on the 24th February 2025. 2.2 Case Study 2: Physical Activity This was a scoping review mapping the evidence from economic analyses on the cost‐effectiveness of population‐based interventions that could be funded or provided by local authorities in the UK to increase physical activity and to inform decision making at local and national level [ 27 For Elicit, the question asked was “What is the cost‐effectiveness of population‐based interventions that could be funded or provided by local authorities in the UK to increase physical activity, based on economic analyses published since 2015.” We asked Elicit the question on the 11th March 2025. 2.3 Case Study 3: Fertility Treatment This was a systematic review published in the Cochrane Library evaluating the effectiveness and safety of vasodilators in women undergoing fertility treatment [ 28 For Elicit, the question asked was “Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of vasodilators in women undergoing fertility treatment. Outcomes including (endometrial thickness, adverse drug reactions, live births, multiple pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, and miscarriage.” We asked Elicit the question on the 7th March 2025. 2.4 Case Study 4: Breast Reconstruction This was a systematic review published in the Cochrane Library assessing ‘the effects of implants vs autologous tissue flaps for postmastectomy breast reconstruction on women's quality of life, satisfaction, and short‐ and long‐term surgical complications’ [ 29 For Elicit, the question asked was “Assess the effects of implants vs. 3 Results 3.1 Case Study 1: Vaping Harms Elicit identified 38 reviews that met the screening criteria according to Elicit. Of the 38, 14 were already included in the original umbrella review. 22 studies identified by Elicit did not meet the inclusion criteria for the umbrella review. One was a scoping review [ 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 Whilst Elicit included 14 of the originally included reviews, 42 of the reviews included by Golder were not included. 31 were not identified, and a further 11 were excluded based on multiple reasons such as ‘failure to meet health outcomes requirement’ [ 55 56 57 58 59 60 1 2 3 4 5 6 Figure 1 Included Studies in Case Study 1.

Figure 5 Sensitivity Comparison of Elicit and Traditional Review for Each Case Study. Figure 6 Precision Comparison of Elicit and Traditional Review for Each Case Study. The search in Elicit had a sensitivity of 27.6% (16/58) and a precision of 42.1% (16/38). 3.2 Case Study 2: Physical Activity Elicit identified 30 reviews that met the screening criteria according to Elicit. Of the 30, 12 were also included in the original scoping review [ 26 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 Elicit did not include 38 of the reviews included by Golder – 27 were not identified and a further 11 were excluded based on multiple reasons such as ‘limited by the individual level approach’ [ 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 The search in Elicit had a sensitivity of 25.5% (13/51) and a precision of 43.3% (13/30). 3.3 Case Study 3: Fertility Treatment Elicit identified 78 studies that met the screening criteria according to Elicit. Of the 78, 32 were included in the original Cochrane Review. Similarly, to case study 1 and 2, Elicit identified four additional studies that would have been included had they been identified at the time of searching [ 81 82 83 84 85 86 Elicit did not include 16 of the RCTs included in the original Cochrane Review– 12 were not identified and a further four were excluded for multiple reasons such as ‘significant uncertainty exists regarding specific outcomes reported and the precise study design’ [ 87 88 89 90 The search in Elicit had a sensitivity of 69.2% (36/52) and a precision of 46.2% (36/78). 3.4 Case Study 4: Breast Reconstruction Elicit identified 45 studies that met the screening criteria according to Elicit. Of the 45, 12 were also included in the original Cochrane review. Additionally, Elicit identified a further four studies that weren't included in the original review, but met the inclusion criteria and in hindsight, would've been included. The following four are [ 91 92 93 94 Elicit did not include 29 of the studies included in the Cochrane review – 21 were not identified and a further eight were excluded for multiple reasons such as ‘absence of patient‐centred outcomes’ [ 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 The search in Elicit had a sensitivity of 35.6% (16/45) and a precision of 35.6% (16/45). Across all case studies, we observed that the stage of selecting the 500 most relevant studies via AI is neither as transparent or reproducible as using a traditional database search strategy such as in OVID Medline (Table 1 Table 1 Studies identified by Elicit and review with traditional searching methods for each case study.

We hypothesized that Elicit may be able to assist in the literature search and screening of studies as part of the evidence synthesis process, and with improvements even replace traditional searching methods. We also sought to determine whether Elicit is comparable to traditional searching in terms of recall and precision. Across all four case studies, Elicit was able to find and include additional studies that the original authors didn't. This may be due to Elicit's ability to search on a wider set of records [ 11 15 Little independent research on the performance of Elicit has been conducted to date. Fenske and Otts [ 103 However, in our study we noticed some key flaws in Elicit. For case study 2, Elicit deemed nine studies‐which were published before 2015‐ eligible even though we explicitly added to the screening criteria to only include articles published since 2015. This shows that even through manually adjusting screening criteria, Elicit is not perfect and studies can slip through the cracks in the screening stage. This potentially contradicts the benefit of being able to change the criteria by hand. Raising the question of the value of being able to make adjustments if Elicit doesn't always apply the criteria. The sensitivity for systematic review searches should reach at least 90% [ 104 28 Interestingly, in case study 2, Elicit retrieved a pair of true duplicate studies [ 105 Furthermore, in case study 4, the Elicit score threshold (as mentioned previously) was set at greater than 4.8, with [ 102 106 107 108 A recently published study by Bernard et al. [ 109 Building on from both our study and Bernard et al., Tomczyk et al. [ 110 Responsible AI in Evidence Synthesis (RAISE) is a framework that provides tailored recommendations to ‘ensure the responsible, transparent and ethical use of AI’ [ 111 1 112 113 114 111 114 There are a number of limitations of our study. The nature of our study was retrospective as we were analysing Elicit after the evidence syntheses had been carried out. Although we did aim to take into account the difference in timing of the searches using Elicit and the traditional searches, this was not always possible. Also, due to Elicit's lack of history of the pre‐edited criteria, we could not quantify the exact change in the number of eligible studies caused by the minor adjustments we made to the inclusion criteria. Additionally, Elicit is being constantly updated as “if you asked once before the update and once after, you might get two different answers from two different version of Elicit.” [ 115 Strengths of our study include the use of four reviews in different areas of health research which enhanced the generalizability and robustness of our findings. We were also able to identify Elicit's strengths and limitations, and spot patterns with how Elicit works for different topics. Furthermore, there is a lack of prior research on Elicit for systematic searches. So, this study is important in quantifying the sensitivity and precision of Elicit which can help in deciding if Elicit currently is a viable research tool. Further research could include: (1) conducting sensitivity analyses using additional studies identified by Elicit, and (2) exploring whether there is any bias in the types of studies Elicit includes compared with those included by human reviewers. 5 Conclusions This study highlights the high precision of the current version of Elicit AI, making it useful for writing grant proposals, and conducting scoping and preliminary searches. The unique studies identified in Elicit demonstrate that it can be a useful adjunct to traditional searching, but it is not equipped to replace standard systematic searching due to its low sensitivity across the four reviews. Further independent evaluations of Elicit are needed as Elicit is updated and newer versions are released.
