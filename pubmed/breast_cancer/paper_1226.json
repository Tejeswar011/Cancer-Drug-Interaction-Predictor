In light of growing resistance to conventional chemotherapies and the demand for safer, multi-targeted agents, this review revisits curcumin with a contemporary lens. We critically evaluate the literature published since 2020, focusing on newly elucidated molecular mechanisms by which curcumin regulates tumor progression, including modulation of oncogenic signaling pathways (Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, JAK/STAT, and MAPK), induction of ferroptosis, and epigenetic reprogramming. A particular emphasis is placed on recent advances in nanoformulation strategies that enhance curcumin’s pharmacokinetic profile and target-specific delivery. Furthermore, the emerging paradigm of combination therapy is explored, where curcumin acts synergistically with chemotherapeutics and phytochemicals to overcome drug resistance and potentiate anticancer efficacy. This review identifies key knowledge gaps, such as inconsistent clinical translation and the underexplored interplay between nanocurcumin systems and immune modulation, outlining directions for future translational research. chemotherapy curcumin cell cycle arrest nano-encapsulation nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems combination therapies This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction 1.1. Overview of Curcumin: Sources and Structure Curcumin, scientifically designated as diferuloylmethane, represents a hydrophobic polyphenolic compound isolated from the rhizomes of the Curcuma genus, classified within the Zingiberaceae family. This particular genus encompasses species such as Curcuma longa Curcuma amada Curcuma zedoaria Curcuma aromatica Curcuma raktakanta. Curcuma longa 1 2 Southeast Asian, Middle Eastern, and Indian cuisines frequently use this bright yellow-orange spice. Apart from turmeric, other Curcuma species, like Curcuma aromatica 21 20 6 3 Figure 1 4 Curcumin has two phenyl rings containing hydroxyl (-OH) and methoxy (-OCH 3 3 5 6 3 7 1.2. Historical Use in Medicine and Pharmacology The Curcuma species has a rich historical background rooted in Far Eastern medicine, with its use in Ayurveda spanning approximately 5000 years and in Atharveda for around 2000 years [ 8 9 10 11 Curcuma longa 12 13 14 15 In both TCM and Ayurveda, turmeric is recognized as a bitter digestive and carminative. Acting as a cholagogue, turmeric stimulates bile secretion, thus aiding in the digestion of fats. Traditionally, Chinese practitioners have used turmeric to address gallbladder issues, relieve lung congestion, improve blood circulation, facilitate digestion and absorption of nutrients, and normalize menstrual flow [ 16 17 18 19 20 12 21 22 23 24 25 26 This review explores curcumin’s remedial effects in cancer interventions by analyzing the underlying pathways, clinical evidence, and recent advancements. It highlights strategies to enhance curcumin’s bioavailability, including developing drug transport utilizing nanoparticles and nanoformulations. Additionally, it sheds light on curcumin’s interactions with other bioactive compounds and its role in enhancing chemotherapy effectiveness. 2. Curcumin’s Biological Mechanisms Curcumin has attracted considerable interest for its anticancer potential, primarily because it has influenced diverse biological processes implicated in oncogenesis. These pathways regulate fundamental dynamics like cell growth, programmed cell death, angiogenesis, and metastasis—key factors in cancer. By targeting multiple molecular pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, JAK/STAT3, MAPK, NF-κB, and Notch, curcumin suppresses cancer growth and induces apoptosis. Its multifaceted action underscores its broad-spectrum effects, offering a deeper understanding of its capability to combat cancer at a molecular level. As illustrated in Figure 2 2.1. The Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway: A Key Driver in Cancer Progression Wnt/β-catenin signaling, an evolutionarily conserved pathway, plays a critical role in cancer development, particularly in cell proliferation, survival, and stemness [ 27 28 29 30 21 22 31 32 33 33 Figure 2 Curcumin plays a pivotal role in cancer by modulating numerous signaling pathways and molecular targets, as indicated by dark teal arrows for upregulation and brown arrows for downregulation. It influences essential mechanisms such as inflammation, ROS production, cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, senescence, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, and EMT, thereby shaping cancer progression and therapeutic outcomes [ 34 35 36 https://www.biorender.com/ Natural compounds, including curcumin, can modulate Wnt/β-catenin signaling, inhibiting tumor growth and stemness [ 37 38 Figure 3 39 40 41 42 43 In ovarian cancer cells, combination treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (DAC) and curcumin significantly reduced nuclear β-catenin levels, disrupting canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling [ 44 44 45 46 Figure 3 The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is regulated through phosphorylation and degradation processes. When curcumin is introduced, cytoplasmic β-catenin is phosphorylated by a destruction complex composed of APC, AXIN, GSK3β, CK1α, and β-TrCP, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This phosphorylation by GSK3β and CK1α triggers β-catenin’s ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Conversely, when Wnt binds to the FZD receptor, the receptor recruits DVL to the membrane. DVL interacts with AXIN, forming a receptor-bound complex that inhibits the destruction complex’s activity. This inhibition permits β-catenin accumulation in the cytoplasm, followed by nuclear translocation, where it binds to TCF/LEF transcription factors and coactivators to promote the expression of Wnt target genes [ 45 47 2.2. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR Pathway The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway plays a central role in regulating cell proliferation, growth, and survival, and its dysregulation is a hallmark of many cancers [ 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 51 52 Additionally, curcumin upregulates PTEN expression, restoring its negative regulatory effect on the PI3K/Akt pathway. This results in inhibition of Akt-mediated pro-survival signaling, decreased Bcl-2 activity, and activation of BAX/BAK-mediated apoptosis in gastric cancer and other malignancies [ 52 57 58 53 54 56 55 51 52 53 54 55 56 59 2.3. The JAK/STAT Signaling Pathway Numerous physiological functions, including immunological responses, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cancer development, are regulated by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. This intricate pathway is heavily involved in the advancement of diverse pathological conditions, including inflammatory diseases, blood cancers, and solid tumors [ 60 61 Curcumin directly targets key components of this pathway, including JAK1, JAK2, and STAT3, inhibiting their phosphorylation and activity. In multiple myeloma cells, curcumin suppresses STAT3 phosphorylation, blocking its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. Similarly, in retinoblastoma cells, curcumin downregulates JAK1 and STAT1/STAT3 phosphorylation while modulating miR-99a, which mechanistically leads to apoptotic cell death [ 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 The JAK/STAT signaling pathway serves as a critical mechanism for relaying extracellular signals from cytokines and growth factors, ultimately regulating gene expression and cellular functions such as activation, proliferation, and differentiation [ 69 69 69 64 65 66 67 64 However, most of these studies were conducted in vitro, and effective concentrations varied considerably across experimental models. Limited in vivo and clinical data are currently available, highlighting a significant gap in translating these findings to humans. While curcumin shows promising mechanistic effects in preclinical models, its therapeutic potential in cancer and other JAK/STAT-related diseases remains unconfirmed due to the lack of robust clinical trials. Therefore, further well-designed clinical studies are essential to validate curcumin’s efficacy and safety in targeting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway [ 70 71 2.4. The MAPK Signaling Pathway MAPK consists of three major signaling cascades: ERK, JNK, and p38 [ 72 73 74 75 75 76 77 77 78 Although curcumin has been shown to modulate ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK cascades and inhibit cancer cell proliferation and migration in vitro [ 75 77 78 2.5. The p53 Signaling Pathway The tumor suppressor p53 is a pivotal transcription factor that regulates numerous cellular processes [ 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 Curcumin’s activation and stabilization of p53 have been demonstrated in multiple cancer cell lines [ 84 88 2.6. Intrinsic and Extrinsic Pathways Two important processes that control apoptosis, or programmed cell death, are the intrinsic and extrinsic routes. Both are important in cancer. These pathways help determine whether a cell responds to different biological signals, including oxygen depletion, DNA damage, or oncogenic signaling, by either undergoing apoptosis or surviving. When these pathways are dysregulated in cancer, tumor development, susceptibility to cell death, and unregulated cell survival might result. These signals result in the expulsion of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO, as well as changes to the mitochondrial membrane. The activity of Smac/DIABLO can be inhibited by inhibitors of apoptosis [ 89 90 Curcumin promotes autophagy in SKOV 3 91 92 59 59 93 10 94 Figure 4 Figure 4 Curcumin induces apoptosis through both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways in diverse cancer models [ 91 92 93 2.7. Curcumin Inhibits Cancer Cell Proliferation and Induces Cell Cycle Arrest Cell proliferation is the process through which the number of cells increases. In the case of tumors, abnormal proliferation is essential for their growth. A faster multiplication of cancer cells suggests a more aggressive and rapidly spreading disease. Extensive research has shown that curcumin effectively inhibits cancer cell growth and halts cell cycle progression. Studies suggest that curcumin influences numerous pathways and factors linked to tumor cell development in vitro, selectively triggering cell death in cancer cells despite its broad range of targets [ 98 99 100 101 102 103 3 104 78 Several in vivo studies found that curcumin can suppress tumor growth. In H22 subcutaneous liver tumor models, curcumin effectively reduces tumor size and weight through the suppression of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [ 105 106 3 107 Curcumin suppresses tumor cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest in multiple cancer types [ 105 106 107 2.8. Apoptosis Induction by Curcumin Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death marked by distinct morphological and biochemical changes, such as nuclear fragmentation, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, cell shrinkage, and the formation of apoptotic bodies [ 108 108 109 110 3 111 Mitochondria and ROS are key players in triggering cell death during both healthy and diseased conditions. Enhancing ROS levels can initiate cell death through pathways like necrosis, apoptosis, autophagy, and ferroptosis, which makes increasing ROS a central approach in cancer therapy [ 112 113 114 115 103 116 117 2.9. Ferroptosis Induction by Curcumin Ferroptosis is a type of non-apoptotic cellular death that is oxidative and dependent on iron. Ferroptosis can be brought on by the depletion of the amino acid cysteine or the suppression of GPX4, in contrast to apoptosis and autophagy, which are the outcomes of certain molecular processes that the cell initiates for its own advantage. This process is connected to the consumption of ATP or the generation of lipid hydroperoxides, which cause catastrophic damage and cell death [ 118 119 120 121 122 120 2+ 123 124 125 126 2.10. Curcumin Inhibits Angiogenesis, Invasion, and Metastasis in Cancer Cells Tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis are all significantly impacted by angiogenesis, the complicated and dynamic process of generating new blood vessels that are regulated by a variety of pro- and anti-angiogenic chemicals [ 127 127 128 129 130 cimb-47-00716-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Molecular pathways in cancer targeted by curcumin.

Preclinical and Clinical Evidence of Curcumin in Cancer Therapy Curcumin has demonstrated anticancer effects across multiple experimental systems, acting on diverse signaling pathways including STAT3, NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, Wnt/β-catenin, and MAPK, which regulate proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis [ 159 160 161 162 163 47 164 165 Curcumin has been evaluated in preclinical and clinical studies to determine its safety, bioavailability, and therapeutic potential. It has been evaluated both as a monotherapy and in combination with other drugs in clinical trials. In a phase II trial of 21 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, daily oral administration of 8 g curcumin for 8 weeks showed clinical activity in two patients, with one achieving stable disease for over 18 months and the other experiencing a temporary 73% tumor regression [ 166 167 168 High doses or prolonged exposure may cause hepatobiliary adverse effects by interfering with cholecystokinin signaling. In a dose-escalation study, liposomal curcumin at 120 mg/m 2 169 170 171 172 164 173 A major limitation in translating curcumin into clinical practice is its poor bioavailability due to rapid metabolism and systemic elimination. To overcome this, novel formulations such as liposomal curcumin, curcumin nanoparticles, and curcumin–phospholipid complexes have been developed, showing improved pharmacokinetics and enhanced anticancer efficacy in both in vitro and preclinical evaluations. Future large-scale, randomized clinical trials incorporating these optimized formulations will be critical to establishing curcumin as a viable adjunct in cancer therapy. Anti-Inflammatory and Immunomodulatory Effects of Curcumin Curcumin’s anti-inflammatory activity plays a crucial role in modulating the tumor microenvironment, which is typically characterized by chronic inflammation and immunosuppression that hinder effective cancer immunotherapy [ 174 175 176 By targeting multiple inflammatory pathways, curcumin effectively reduces pro-inflammatory mediators while enhancing anti-inflammatory signaling. For instance, curcumin inhibits NF-κB and COX-2 activation, decreases secretion of IL-6 and TNF-α, and downregulates inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), thereby suppressing the pro-tumor inflammatory cascade [ 64 177 178 179 180 Emerging evidence also supports curcumin’s role in immunogenic cell death (ICD). A unitized ICD nanoinducer combining curcumin, disulfide-bonded organosilica nanoparticles, and iron oxide effectively induced cancer-cell-specific ICD by depleting glutathione, generating hydroxyl radicals, and disrupting Ca 2+ 181 182 183 Clinical studies confirm these findings. In a randomized, double-blind trial involving 80 patients with solid tumors, curcuminoid supplementation (180 mg/day for 8 weeks) significantly lowered circulating inflammatory mediators such as interleukins, TNF-α, and MCP-1 compared with placebo [ 184 185 4. The Significance of Curcumin in Cancer Prevention Free radicals and toxic byproducts generated from oxidative stress are significant contributors to cancer progression. Consequently, antioxidants can be crucial in cancer prevention. Curcumin effectively neutralizes free radicals, thereby helping to inhibit cancer initiation [ 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 Recent progress in detecting cancer and increasing treatment alternatives has resulted in lower cancer death rates. The increase in drug-resistant cancers emphasizes the pressing demand to investigate and design new and more effective treatments [ 193 Table 1 5. Combination Therapy: Synergistic Effects of Curcumin with Chemotherapy and Nanoparticle-Based Drug Delivery Systems Although curcumin exhibits promising anticancer activity in studies, its therapeutic use is constrained due to low solubility, stability, and absorption, which can be improved using methods such as advanced analogs, nanoparticle systems, or combination treatments ( Figure 5 194 195 Additionally, the co-administration of curcumin and DTX demonstrated enhanced cancer-fighting effects by boosting the immune response in head and neck cancer [ 196 197 198 199 104 It is also worth noting that natural compounds like resveratrol, when used alongside chemotherapeutic drugs, help decrease drug resistance and mitigate the adverse outcomes associated with chemotherapy [ 200 201 202 203 148 204 Furthermore, nanodrug carriers that co-deliver curcumin and chemotherapeutic agents to targeted sites further enhance the effectiveness of treatment. DTX is a commonly utilized chemotherapy drug for the treatment of multiple types of cancer. Nanocarriers, which can encapsulate lipophilic drugs, provide an effective strategy to enhance solubility, minimizing drug interaction with the gut lining. Mixed micelles loaded with DTX and curcumin enhanced drug absorption. They greatly improved bioavailability and cytotoxicity in the treatment of cancer [ 205 206 Table 2 Growing evidence indicates that certain synthesized curcumin analogs have improved solubility and bioavailability, offering greater efficacy against cancers compared to curcumin itself. For instance, CP41, a new curcumin analog, triggers cell death in endometrial cancer through increasing cellular stress [ 207 207 208 208 209 210 211 6. Curcumin with Combined Treatments in Clinical Trials in Cancer Ongoing and completed clinical trials have explored curcumin’s potential both as a monotherapy and in combination treatment strategies. Despite its low bioavailability and inconsistent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, curcumin has undergone evaluation in initial clinical studies for colorectal, breast, pancreatic, and hematological malignancies. One clinical trial focused on assessing the safety and tolerability of combining immunotherapy with bevacizumab (the active ingredient in Avastin) and chemotherapy with FOLFIRI (folinic acid, 5-FU, and irinotecan) alongside curcumin. Patients in this study received a daily oral curcumin supplement in the form of a ginsenoside-modified nanostructured lipid carrier (G-NLC), which was designed to enhance solubility and oral bioavailability [ 212 213 214 215 Figure 5 The use of curcumin in cancer treatment is limited by its poor bioavailability. However, this challenge can be addressed through various strategies, including the development of curcumin analogs with improved bioavailability, nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems, combination therapies with other agents, and similar innovative approaches [ 198 216 217 The pharmacokinetics of irinotecan with higher doses of curcumin were assessed using parameters such as AUC (area under the curve), Cmax (maximum concentration), and Tmax (time to maximum concentration). The findings indicated that curcumin did not affect irinotecan’s pharmacokinetics ( NCT01859858 218 219 NCT01490996 164 173 220 221 222 Bioavailability and Delivery Challenges Bioavailability refers to the proportion (percentage) of an administered drug dose that successfully enters the circulatory system and becomes available in systemic circulation [ 223 224 224 225 Several promising strategies are being explored to enhance curcumin’s bioavailability, with one key approach involving its integration into nano-sized delivery systems. This method is under investigation in early stage studies, as nanoparticle encapsulation may improve curcumin absorption, stability, and sustained release, ultimately increasing its therapeutic efficacy [ 226 227 228 229 230 231 230 232 Additionally, scaling up from laboratory synthesis to large-scale production presents challenges in reproducibility, cost-effectiveness, and consistent therapeutic outcomes, given patient-specific factors such as metabolism, disease stage, and genetic variability [ 233 234 235 236 7. Enhancing Curcumin’s Efficacy Through Formulation and Nanotechnology in Cancer Curcumin has demonstrated promising efficacy in preclinical studies by modulating multiple signaling pathways involved in proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis [ 159 160 166 167 168 237 238 239 240 241 242 Given these challenges, nanoformulations have been developed not as independent therapies but as strategies to overcome curcumin’s pharmacokinetic limitations, enhance efficacy, and minimize toxicity. Nanoparticle-based delivery systems are particularly effective in improving solubility, stability, and targeted delivery. The small size of nanoparticles (10–1000 nm) provides a larger surface area, boosting the interaction with solvents and improving dissolution rates, as described by the Noyes–Whitney equation. This higher surface area allows for faster dissolution of nano-sized particles. Additionally, the Ostwald–Freundlich equation explains that reducing particle size to the nanoscale can increase the drug’s saturation solubility, further enhancing its bioavailability [ 243 244 245 246 247 248 Figure 6 249 250 251 cimb-47-00716-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Summary of the several curcumin nanotechnologies and their associated drug delivery systems.

Solid Lipid-Based Curcumin Nanoparticles In the pharmaceutical sector, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are now recognized as efficient delivery systems for a range of medicinal medicines. In the pharmaceutical industry, SLNs have become widely recognized for being effective carriers of a range of medicinal compounds. Their distinct structure improves the stability, bioavailability, and solubility of drugs, which makes them especially useful for hydrophobic substances like curcumin [ 276 277 278 279 Curcumin loaded into solid lipid nanoparticles has exhibited encouraging outcomes in lung cancer therapy, with the obtained results demonstrating a 12-fold reduction in tumor volume in experimental mice [ 260 261 7.2. Polymeric-Based Nanoparticles Polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs) are extremely small particles ranging from 1 to 1000 nm in size that can encapsulate drugs or be structured from a polymeric base. These nanoparticles are employed to enhance drug delivery, minimize side effects, ensure prolonged release of medications, and facilitate the administration of a wide array of therapeutic agents [ 280 281 281 282 283 Polydopamine (PDA)-Based Nanoparticles Polydopamine (PDA) is a mussel-inspired polymer with abundant catechol and quinone groups that facilitate high drug loading via π–π stacking and hydrogen bonding, simple one-pot coating, and conjugation of targeting ligands [ 284 285 286 287 Polydopamine–curcumin nanoparticles (PDA-Cur NPs) further improved curcumin’s photostability and controlled release, reducing photodegradation by nearly 50% under light exposure. Compared with free curcumin, PDA-Cur NPs demonstrated enhanced antitumor efficacy by inducing apoptosis and significantly inhibiting tumor growth in MCF-7 tumor-bearing mice, with no observed systemic toxicity [ 288 289 290 Despite these promising results, challenges such as batch-to-batch variability and uncertainties regarding the long-term in vivo safety of PDA carriers remain to be addressed. Overall, PDA-based nanoformulations represent a pleiotropic approach that not only advances the pharmaceutical development of curcumin nanomedicines but also offers a generalized delivery strategy applicable to a wide range of hydrophobic drugs. 7.3. Liposome-Based Nanoparticles Liposomes have been widely studied over the years as drug carriers and have shown significant potential for delivering curcumin in vivo [ 253 254 256 291 291 291 Curcumin has been loaded into targeted chitosan-coated liposomes to accelerate the cellular breakdown of liver cancer by triggering autophagy. The results demonstrated a marked decrease in HepG2 cell proliferation following 48 h of exposure to 100 µg/mL, with a reduction of 51% ± 1.5% [ 255 256 7.4. Metalloid Nanoparticles Sustainable chemistry has become a modern, eco-friendly alternative to traditional chemical processes. A key strategy in the realm of nanomedicines is the incorporation of different natural substances [ 292 293 294 2 295 Manganese (Mn)-Based Nanoparticles Moreover, the immunomodulatory effects of Cur have indeed been extensively explored in combination with immunostimulatory factors. Recent studies have demonstrated that Cur, when combined with immunostimulatory factors such as photothermal agents and manganese (Mn) ions, can synergistically enhance antitumor immune responses. For example, a MnO 2 290 296 3 2 297 Figure 6 Overview of nanotechnology-based methods for delivering curcumin. Advanced systems, including liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, albumin nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, metal-based nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles, and dendrimers, have proven effective in improving curcumin’s bioactivity [ 298 299 300 7.5. Protein-Based Nanoparticles In the field of drug delivery, protein-based nanoparticles, which are made from synthetic peptides and natural protein cages, have garnered a lot of interest. These nanoparticles are composed of subunits from either a single type of protein or a combination of different proteins, providing various functional groups that can be chemically modified for drug binding, imaging, or targeted delivery [ 301 302 303 7.6. Polymeric Nanomicelle-Based Nanoparticles Polymeric micelles have garnered significant attention as nanocarriers for therapeutic applications in cancer treatment among the wide variety of available options. Block copolymers, which are composed of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomer units, are used to form polymeric micelles. Hydrophobic medications can be effectively incorporated into polymeric micelles, which have a core–shell structure. The shell, made of hydrophilic polymers, provides steric protection to the micelles, preventing protein adsorption and the attachment of other adhesive cells. It is worth noting that polymeric micelles offer vast opportunities and advantages for improving the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer medications that are encapsulated. Curcumin is a potent inhibitor of the synthesis of angiogenic growth factors, which are essential for the development of new blood vessels. Therefore, curcumin-encapsulated nanomicelles (CUR-NMs) enhance cellular uptake and cytotoxicity in cisplatin-resistant human oral cancer cells. These nanoparticles demonstrated a high entrapment efficiency (82.2%), entrapment content (147.96 µg/mL), and a mean zeta potential of −17.5τ, indicating moderate stability. Cellular uptake and cytotoxicity studies showed that CUR-NMs exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity and uptake in both cisplatin-resistant and parental oral cancer cells and confirmed a higher percentage of apoptotic cells with CUR-NMs (31.14%). 8. Conclusions and Future Perspectives Curcumin, a natural phenolic compound derived from the dietary spice turmeric, is recognized for its protective, immune-modulating, and antimicrobial effects. Notably, it also exhibits strong anticancer effects against various human cancers [ 304 Table 2 The future research on curcumin’s anticancer activities should focus on leveraging modern scientific developments to overcome existing boundaries and unlock its full therapeutic potential, specifically accomplishing the following: (1) study its ability to modulate the tumor microenvironment, including immunity; (2) identify biomarkers to predict curcumin-based therapies; (3) develop next-generation nanocarriers (lipid-based nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, or exosomes) for the improved bioavailability, solubility, and tumor-targeting efficiency of curcumin; (4) explore co-delivery systems with other anticancer agents for a synergistic effect; (5) develop personalized curcumin formulations; (6) investigate its role in modulating epigenetic mechanisms; (7) use artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to predict curcumin’s interactions with molecular targets and optimize its structure for enhanced anticancer activity; (8) investigate synergy between curcumin and other plant-derived compounds for higher anticancer effects; and (9) conduct well-designed, large-scale clinical trials for various cancers and patients to uncover their anticancer potential and safety.

Anal. 2025 101322 10.1016/j.jpha.2025.101322 Figure 1 Chemical structure of curcumin and its derivatives. The structure consists of two aromatic rings connected by a chain of carbon atoms with various functional groups. These can be modified to create derivatives with elevated biological and pharmacokinetic properties. The derivatives indicate potential modifications to the curcumin structure, suggesting the versatility of this compound. Figure 4 This overview highlights how curcumin modulates intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways in colorectal cancer cells (CRCs). Curcumin induces apoptosis by activating (blue arrows) or inhibiting (red dashed lines) various molecular targets and signaling pathways. It downregulates antiapoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family and apoptosis inhibitors like Survivin and XIAP. Simultaneously, it promotes the production of ROS (ROS) and pro-apoptotic proteins, facilitating mitochondrial cytochrome c (C) release. Additionally, curcumin upregulates Fas and death receptor 5 (DR5), triggering the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. Curcumin also induces ferroptosis, reducing CRC proliferation [ 95 96 97 ",
