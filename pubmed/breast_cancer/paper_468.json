It is proposed that tau aggregates faithfully propagate throughout the brain by self-templating their disease-associated conformation onto natively-folded tau monomers, thereby inducing their aggregation and incorporation into growing fibrils. As such, the inhibition or modulation of tau seeding and aggregation represents a viable therapeutic strategy for AD and other tauopathies. Methods We have recently developed seed amplification assays (SAA) for the detection and amplification of small quantities of misfolded protein aggregates in various neurodegenerative diseases. In this article, we adapted the SAA technology to amplify the process of tau aggregation and seeding in AD brain samples. Using the Tau-SAA we screened two chemical libraries: one comprising over 20 suspected aggregation inhibitors and the other comprising over 200 FDA-approved, blood-brain barrier-permeable compounds from a commercial chemical library. We also performed secondary in vitro assays to confirm the activity of selected hits as well as determining the IC50 of the most active compounds. Results Our Tau-SAA detects the presence of tau seeds even after a 100-million-fold dilution of the initial inoculum. Examination of 26 postmortem brain samples from AD and control cases confirmed that our assay is specific for AD brain tau seeds. Screening of 220 compounds showed that approximately 57% of suspected aggregation inhibitors and ~ 3% of CNS-penetrant compounds inhibited over 75% of AD brain-templated tau aggregation. Conclusions In conclusion, our data suggests that Tau-SAA readily detects the presence of tau seeds in AD brains but not in controls, and that by amplifying AD brain tau seeds, the assay may serve as a valuable primary drug screening platform.

However, the efficacy of these Aβ-directed approaches remains debatable and has been the subject of considerable controversy [ 5 6 7 8 9 10 5 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 A key event in AD and other tauopathies is the progressive spreading of the pathology to different brain regions, which is likely the cause of the progressive and chronic degeneration observed in these diseases. The propagation of tau pathology in AD and other tauopathies is thought to occur via a “prion-like” seeding-nucleation mechanism, in which pathological tau triggers the misfolding and aggregation of natively folded tau monomers into the disease-associated form [ 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 29 Various tau-directed strategies have been considered for possible therapeutic intervention including the reduction of tau expression, targeting post-translational modifications, stabilizing microtubules, immunotherapy, and tau aggregation inhibitors [ 30 31 31 30 NCT01383161 32 33 34 Fluorescence-based aggregation assays have been readily utilized to identify tau inhibitors [ 35 36 36 37 38 39 Here, we present the design and application of a tau seed amplification assay (SAA) as an improved tau inhibitor screening platform. The SAA (also known as protein misfolding cyclic amplification or PMCA and real-time quaking induced conversion or RT-QuIC) technology reproduces the prion-like seeding mechanism responsible for the spreading of protein aggregates in a cell-free system [ 21 40 41 40 42 43 44 While several groups have established Tau-SAA for the detection of AD and tauopathy brain-derived tau seeds [ 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 In the present study, we first determined the tau isoform most suitable for Tau-SAA, and then validated our assay by examining the seeding activity of 26 postmortem brain samples from AD and control cases (HC). To begin to characterize the structural properties of the amplified fibrils, we evaluated their proteolytic resistance and analyzed the amino acid composition of the protease-resistant core. Finally, we utilized Tau-SAA as a drug screening platform by testing the inhibitory potential of over two hundred compounds from two different chemical libraries. Our findings support the use of Tau-SAA not only as a sensitive detection assay but also its potential as a valuable tool for identifying and developing tau aggregation inhibitors against disease-relevant AD-brain templated fibrils. Methods Expression and purification of Tau isoforms All six human CNS tau isoform constructs were designed, expressed and purified in a similar manner. Briefly, sequences for full-length tau isoforms were downloaded from the Uniprot database ( P10636 Plasmids for all constructs were transformed into BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli x g For the purification of tau protein, bacterial pellets were first resuspended in 20 mM PIPES pH 6.5 with 500 mM NaCl. Resuspended bacteria were lysed with 3–4 rounds of probe sonication on ice (Misonix 3000), where each round consisted of 5 min, 10 s on, 10 s off at a power of 6.5. Lysates were then boiled for 20 min at 95 °C, cooled on ice for 30 min, and centrifuged (15,000 x g x g Tau proteins were purified using cation exchange chromatography on an ÄKTA pure chromatography system (Cytiva). The aforementioned pellet was resuspended in 20 mM PIPES pH 7.4 until the conductivity fell below that of Buffer A (20 mM PIPES pH 6.5 50 mM NaCl), typically ~ 9 mS. The resultant solution was passed through 0.2 μm filter and loaded onto two 5 ml HP SP columns (Cytiva) connected in series. After sample application, the column was washed with Buffer A for 5 column volumes or until UV absorbance reached baseline. Tau was eluted using a linear gradient (0-100%) of Buffer B (20 mM PIPES pH 6.5 with 1 M NaCl) over 20 column volumes and fractionated into 2 ml aliquots. Fractions were selected based on UV absorbance, resolved by SDS-PAGE and protein content was analyzed by InstantBlue Coomasie blue protein stain (Abcam). Those containing tau were collected, pooled and dialyzed (1:100) against Tau -SAA Buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 7.4 with 100 mM NaCl) in 10 K MWCO SnakeSkin Dialysis Tubing (Thermo Scientific) with constant stirring at 4 °C for four hours. A second round of dialysis was performed overnight. Following dialysis, the protein was centrifuged 15,000 x g x g Brain tissue samples and compliance with ethical standards De-identified brain samples were obtained from the NIH Neurobiobank and its constituent repositories. Additional samples were obtained from Bispebjerg Hjernebank, Center for Neuroscience and Sterology, Bispebjerg Hospital as well as the UTHealth Brain Biorepository. Clinical diagnoses were confirmed by neuropathological examination. All samples were acquired from deceased, de-identified individuals with written informed consent for brain autopsy and use of materials for research purposes, and no additional ethical approval was required. Tissue homogenization Frozen brain tissue was removed from − 80 °C and placed directly onto dry ice. Samplse to be homogenized were dissected with a blade from a larger portion with a surgical feather blade with care to avoid white matter. After recording the sample mass (typically 100 mg were processed at a time) the tissue was minced with a blade and placed in a 5 ml dounce homogenizer on ice. The tissue was homogenized in 500 µl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Cytiva) with complete protease inhibitor (PI, Roche). Typically, ~ 10 strokes with the loose pestle, followed by ~ 10 strokes with the tight pestle were sufficient. The sample was transferred to a 1.5 or 2 ml micro tube and the volume was adjusted with PBS-PI to 10% (w/v). The sample was then intermittently probe sonicated using a vibra cell ultrasonic processor (Sonics) for 0.5–1 min at a power of ~ 2 W. The homogenates were aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored in -80 °C. Extraction of Tau filaments from AD brain Sarkosyl-insoluble tau filaments were extracted as described by Fitzpatrick and colleagues [ 55 g g g g Tau seed amplification assay (Tau-SAA) Tau substrate was removed from − 80 °C and allowed to thaw on ice. After thawing, the protein was pooled and filtered once again using Amicon Ultra 0.5 ml centrifugal filters (Millipore Sigma). The protein concentration was re-measured using a Nanodrop One (Thermo Scientific) microvolume spectrophotometer. The tau protein was then added to a master mix consisting of Hepes 10 mM pH 7.4, 10 µM Thioflavin T (ThT), 150 mM NaCl, 120 µM Heparin (final concentration). The final concentration of tau, regardless of isoform utilized was 20 µM. To prepare the SAA reaction, 90 µl of the master mix was dispensed into wells of a black, clear-bottom 96-plate (Corning). Human brain homogenates used as seeds were allowed to thaw on ice, and were then sonicated for 2 rounds of 30 s (1 s on, 1 s off, amplitude:30) in an ice bath connected to an ultrasonic liquid processor (Misonix). Homogenates were then diluted in Tau Buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 7.4 with 100 mM NaCl) and 10 µl were spiked into designated wells of the SAA plate, giving a final volume of 100 µl in each well. After mixing, plates were sealed with Masterclear real-time PCR film (Eppendorf) and secured upon a Thermomixer (Eppendorf) for successive cycles of shaking and incubation. The thermomixer was placed inside a 37 °C incubator and set to 1 min of shaking at 800 rpm every 29 min. Fluorescence readings were taken using a SpectraMAX Gemini EM (Molecular Devices) spectrofluorometer at the start of each reaction (time: 0 h) and periodically throughout the length of the reaction (~ 200–300 h). Plates were read from the bottom using an excitation wavelength of 435 nm, emission at 485 nm and a gain of 350 V. Pronase E digestion of Tau filaments For the digestion of Tau-SAA amplified fibrils, reaction end products were harvested upon SAA completion. The contents of each well were agitated and collected into individual centrifuge tubes. Each sample was centrifuged at 20,000 x g − 1 2 Liquid Chromatography-Tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of Tau-SAA-amplified fibrils Pronase-digested Tau-SAA amplified fibrils were separated by SDS-PAGE and protein bands were excised for in-gel digestion following standard protocols [ 56 Data processing and peptide mapping Raw MS data files were processed using Thermo Scientific™ Proteome Discoverer™ (v1.4) and searched against the Uniprot-Human database using Sequest. Search parameters included a precursor mass tolerance of 10 ppm and a fragment mass tolerance of 0.6 Da. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues was set as a fixed modification, while oxidation of methionine, N-terminal acetylation, and phosphorylation of serine and threonine were included as variable modifications. No enzyme specificity was applied for peptide mapping. False discovery rates (FDR) were set to 1% for strict identification and 5% for relaxed identification using Percolator. Identified peptides were mapped to the 2N4R tau isoform (Uniprot P10639-8), and the start and end positions of each peptide were determined. Peptide-spectrum matches (PSM) were filtered at a q-value threshold of ≤ 0.01 to retain high-confidence identifications. To quantify residue-level abundance, PSM values were normalized within each sample by dividing by the total PSM detected in that sample. Normalized PSM values were then summed across residues to determine residue-level abundance. The mean abundance per residue was calculated by averaging normalized PSM values across three independent AD brain-derived SAA fibril samples. Tau-SAA for drug screening Suspected aggregation inhibitors were acquired from several sources, including Sigma Aldrich, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, ApexBio, GFS Chemicals, Chem-Impex, and the Cayman Chemical Company. For a detailed list of chemical, sources please refer to supplementary Table ( 1 2 50 50 Sedimentation assay Tau SAA products were harvested at the completion of the SAA reaction. Three replicates were pooled and 100 µl were subject to centrifugation at 100,000 x Transmission electron microscopy Samples were briefly sonicated in a water bath sonicator (Misonix Model S-4000) at an amplitude of 20 for 20 s. Formvar/Carbon 200 Mesh Copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) were briefly rinsed with a drop of ddH2O and then incubated with the sample for 60 s. The grids were then rinsed with another drop of ddH2O and stained with three sequential drops of 4% uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for a total of 60 s. Following staining, grids were rinsed twice with drops of ddH2O and then allowed to air-dry under a cover disk for 10 min. All drops were 5 µL and blotted with Whatman filter paper. Grids were imaged using a JEOL JEM-1400 transmission electron microscope at 120 kV. Immunoblotting Western blotting was carried out using a standard protocol as previously described [ 57 Results Designing an ultrasensitive and specific Tau-SAA In the human central nervous system (CNS), tau manifests as six isoforms resulting from the alternative mRNA splicing of the MAPT 58 E. coli S1 S1 S1 S1 To assess the suitability of each construct as a substrate for SAA, we conducted ten-fold serial dilutions of AD or healthy control (HC) brain homogenate (BH) from 10 − 4 − 9 1 1 top panel 1 top panel − 8 − 9  Fig. 1 Tau isoform composition influences Tau-SAA efficiency. The six human CNS tau isoforms were independently assessed as substrates for Tau-SAA. Brain homogenate (BH) from one AD and one control case were serially diluted (from 10 − 4 − 9 As our initial experiment utilized only a single AD and HC sample, we next sought to evaluate a larger cohort of AD and control patients. We acquired brain samples from the prefrontal cortex (BA46) of 11 AD patients (Braak III-VI) and 15 controls (Braak 0-III) (Table S1 1 − 5 − 9 − 5 2 − 8 − 9 2 − 5 2 1  Fig. 2 High sensitivity of Tau-SAA and high specificity for AD over controls. Postmortem brain samples (prefrontal cortex; BA46) from 26 different patients were tested with Tau-SAA using serial dilutions from 10 − 5 − 9 To further assess assay specificity and explore the possibility of cross-seeding, we challenged the Tau-SAA with recombinant α-synuclein preformed fibrils (αSyn PFFs). While recombinant tau PFFs readily seeded Tau-SAA reactions at all tested concentrations (200-0.2ng), αSyn PFFs failed to induce tau seeding in our assay, even when supplied at high concentrations (200ng) and resembled unseeded buffer-alone reactions (Figure S2 − 5 Tau-SAA fibrils exhibit a similar core composition to AD-derived Tau filaments Proteolytic resistance is a widely used biochemical approach for characterizing conformational strains. When exposed to proteases, different aggregate conformations yield distinct fragmentation patterns, which can be visualized through immunoblotting [ 57 59 60 61 To examine the proteolytic profile of Tau-SAA fibrils, we used three distinct AD brain samples to seed Tau-SAA and collected the resulting fibrils at the end of the reaction. For comparison, we extracted tau filaments from the corresponding brain samples. Both brain-derived and SAA-amplified fibrils were digested with Pronase E, denatured, and immunoblotted using an anti-Tau RD3 antibody. As expected, both brain-derived and amplified tau fibrils were resistant to proteolysis, producing similar protease-resistant fragments, with the smallest one migrating between 6 and 14 kDa (Fig. 3 3 55 3  Fig. 3 Protease resistance and mass spectrometry of AD brain-amplified tau fibrils. ( A B P10636 C B 55 Cryo-EM studies of AD brain-derived tau have mapped the protofilament core to the R3 and R4 repeat domains (residues 306–378) [ 55 55 − 1 S3 S3 55 3 S3 To more precisely characterize the amino acid composition of the SAA-amplified filament core, we performed complementary mass spectrometry analysis of pronase-treated SAA fibrils amplified from three distinct AD brains (Fig. 3 S3 3 260 406 55 406 3 S3 55 S3 Application of Tau-SAA to screen for aggregation inhibitors The spread of pathological tau species through neuroanatomically interconnected and communicating neurons is thought to follow a prion-like seeding mechanism wherein misfolded tau species induce the misfolding of natively folded proteins [ 21 27 To investigate this potential, we conducted a literature-based selection of 21 compounds previously reported as inhibitors of amyloid and/or tau aggregation (Table S2 63 64 65 2 To screen these libraries for tau seeding inhibitors, we conducted Tau-SAA in the presence of each compound at a final concentration of 100µM. As before, ThT fluorescence served as a readout for tau aggregation and was monitored over the course of 300 h (Fig. 4 − 4 − 8 − 6 − 8  Fig. 4 AD Brain Templated Tau-SAA efficiently identifies tau aggregation inhibitors. ( A B − 5 C D Given that limited differences were observed across distinct dilutions of AD brain homogenate, we selected to assess the remainder of both the SAI and CNS-p libraries at a single dilution of seed (10 − 5 4 S2 2 4 To further interpret the results, we calculated the percent inhibition for each compound by subtracting the percent AUC for each compound from the AUC of the Vehicle (100%), and binned the compounds into four groups, those with percent inhibition less than 0 (i.e. promoters of tau aggregation), (AUC > 100% of vehicle), those with 0–50% inhibition, 50–75%, and 75–100% inhibition (Fig. 4 4 4 Expectedly, SAI compounds were more effective at inhibiting AD brain-derived seeding activity, with more than half (12/21, 57%) of examined compounds inhibiting over 75% of seeding activity (AUC ≤ 25% of vehicle) (Fig. 4 Validation of Tau-SAA drug screening As a secondary validation, we selected three drugs based on a combination of their inhibitory activity in our assay and literature support for their anti-aggregation potential. Indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was selected as a negative control due to its limited inhibition of tau aggregation in our study (17.3 ± 9.3%) and lack of literature support. Rifampin (99.9 ± 5.1%), an antimicrobial agent, served as a positive control, with prior reports supporting its anti- tau aggregation effects [ 66 67 Tau-SAA products from these reactions, as well as the untreated vehicle (Fig. 5 x 5 5 5 5 5  Fig. 5 Validation of Tau-SAA drug screening. ( A B x C To further confirm the presence of aggregates, Tau-SAA products were also examined by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 5 5 top 5 5 bottom Tau-SAA can be used to estimate half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 Our initial screening of both SAI and CNS-p libraries identified 19 compounds that inhibited over 75% of seeding activity from AD brain-derived tau seeds when added to Tau-SAA at 100µM concentration (Fig. 4 To explore the potency of these compounds, we selected two compounds from the SAI library (Methylene Blue, and Exifone), as well as two from the CNS-p library (Rifampin and Epirubicin) for a comprehensive dose-response analysis. Dilutions spanning from the initial 100µM concentration down to 0.1µM final were prepared and introduced at the onset of the SAA reaction. The inhibitory effects on tau seeding activity were monitored over time using ThT fluorescence as a readout and plotted as a percentage of vehicle ThT Max (Fig. 6 top 50 6 bottom 50 6  Fig. 6 Dose-response analysis of tau aggregation inhibitors. Top: Tau-SAA fluorescence traces of several compounds, each tested at various concentrations (between 100 − 0.1 µM final) are displayed as a percentage of the maximum ThT fluorescence intensity reached by the Vehicle-treated condition (mean ± SEM). The line of best fit was determined using a Boltzmann-Sigmoidal non-linear regression. Each condition was tested in triplicate. Bottom: Half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 50 Discussion The prion-like propagation of misfolded tau species is believed to drive the stereotypical progression of tau pathology throughout the brain and is a key pathognomonic feature of AD and other tauopathies [ 29 58 68 69 70 71 47 72 73 74 75 76 In the present study, we developed a Tau-SAA and evaluated its performance using 26 postmortem brain samples from neuropathologically diagnosed AD and control subjects. Given recent reports suggesting that tau aggregation can be influenced by alpha-synuclein cross-seeding [ 77 78 79 S2 During the development of our Tau-SAA, we prioritized the use of physiologically relevant tau isoforms as substrates. Early iterations of Tau-SAA relied largely on artificial tau constructs or fragments as substrates [ 45 46 47 48 50 50 52 While the tau isoform appears to play a critical role in amplification efficiency, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the choice of tau isoform may not be a critical determinant of whether fibrils can adopt disease-relevant conformations [ 55 80 81 82 A major objective of this study was to evaluate whether Tau-SAA-amplified fibrils resemble AD brain-derived filaments. While several groups have demonstrated that SAA can propagate tau seeds from AD brain, the biochemical composition of these amplified fibrils has not yet been thoroughly characterized. To begin characterizing the biochemical properties of SAA-amplified fibrils, we examined their proteolytic resistance to gain insights about the identity of the fibrillar core. Pronase digestion revealed that SAA-amplified fibrils share a protease-resistant core similar in size to AD brain-derived aggregates. Complementary epitope mapping and mass spectrometry analysis further confirmed that the resistant core of SAA-amplified filaments exactly mirrors that of AD-derived tau filaments, supporting their structural relevance. Our studies report the first mass spectrometry-based characterization of SAA-amplified fibril protease-resistant cores, revealing that their amino acid composition is identical to that of brain-derived tau. Despite this clear biochemical similarity, we acknowledge that sharing the same fibrillar core does not necessarily imply identical structure. Additional high-resolution structural methods, such as cryo-EM, will be necessary to determine whether Tau-SAA amplified fibrils truly faithfully replicate the structural features of AD-derived tau filaments. Nonetheless, our findings provide strong preliminary evidence that Tau-SAA propagates a disease-relevant tau core, reinforcing its potential as a model for studying pathological tau seeding and aggregation. Consequently, the application of Tau-SAA as a drug screening platform is highly relevant towards the discovery of compounds that prevent tau fibril formation or propagation. Leveraging the ability to amplify brain-derived tau aggregates, we employed the Tau-SAA as a platform for screening small-molecules for inhibition of tau seeding. In total, we screened 222 compounds from FDA-approved, blood-brain barrier permeable libraries, as well as hand-selected small molecules previously described as tau or amyloid inhibitors. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first application of SAA as a platform for the screening of tau aggregation inhibitors. Importantly, we utilized AD brain-derived tau aggregates as seeds for drug-screening Tau-SAA, diverging from the common practice of using spontaneously formed recombinant tau fibrils, which have been shown to adopt a different structure than brain aggregates [ 37 To identify compounds capable of inhibiting AD brain-templated tau seeding, we screened two compound libraries: (i) 21 suspected aggregation inhibitors (SAI) identified through a literature review [ 63 64 65 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 2 87 31 88 90 95 94 Compared to SAI compounds, Tau-SAA screening of compounds from the CNS-p library yielded significantly fewer inhibitory compounds. Among the few compounds that inhibited more than 75% of tau seeding activity, many had supporting evidence in the literature. Honokiol, a polyphenol used in traditional Chinese herbal medicine [ 96 96 97 98 99 66 67 100 101 Sunitinib also displayed a seemingly high level of inhibition in Tau-SAA, yet secondary validation demonstrated the presence of insoluble tau species as well as tau filaments. We anticipated two potential scenarios in which Tau-SAA could mistakenly indicate a lack of tau aggregation, resulting in a false positive result: (1) drug interference with ThT binding, (2) interference with ThT excitation or emission. This false positive result underscores the need for secondary validation of ‘hits’ from Tau-SAA or any drug screening platform. Our findings suggest that Tau-SAA can serve as a robust screening method for identifying small molecules that inhibit or entirely prevent the aggregation of tau when exposed to a biologically relevant source of tau seeds. Through thoughtful modifications, the assay can be converted into a high-throughput screening tool, enabling the rapid screening of exceedingly large compound libraries. Furthermore, through screening of FDA-approved compounds, Tau SAA offers a valuable strategy for drug repurposing, potentially accelerating the discovery of clinically viable tau-targeting therapies. Limitations The use of Tau-SAA for drug screening has the potential limitation that the structure of the tau aggregates produced in the assay might be different from the aggregates present in AD brain. Our data with epitope mapping and mass spectrometry of the core filaments generated by Tau-SAA suggest that the main biochemical properties are kept during amplification. However, we acknowledge that these biochemical studies do not necessarily imply an identical structure of tau aggregates. Additional high-resolution structural studies, such as cryo-EM, will be necessary to determine whether Tau-SAA amplified fibrils truly replicate the structure of AD-derived tau filaments. Another limitation is the relatively small sample size of AD and control cases used in this study, which limits our ability to conclude that Tau-SAA can detect tau aggregates in all AD cases. Furthermore, it would be necessary to study other tauopathies to determine whether the Tau-SAA is specific for AD or can detect tau aggregates in other tau-related diseases. Conclusions Our findings indicate that Tau-SAA can effectively detect tau aggregates from AD up to a dilution of 100 million-fold of the brain homogenate. Moreover, the assay can be adapted to screen compounds capable of inhibiting the seeding and aggregation of tau. Since tau spreading by seeding is one of the hallmark events in AD pathogenesis, these compounds might be useful as candidates for therapeutic intervention.
