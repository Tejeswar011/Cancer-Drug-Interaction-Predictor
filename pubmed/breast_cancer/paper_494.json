It is currently a hotly pursued therapeutic target in those disease areas. Several carbohydrate-based galectin-3 inhibitors have recently demonstrated encouraging results in early phase clinical trials. This study reports the discovery of two synthetic, non-carbohydrate, small molecule compounds (named K2 an L2) as potent galectin-3 inhibitors. K2 and L2 share the same molecular composition with difference of one -NH2 group located at para (K2) or meta (L2) position at one of its aromatic rings. These novel compound inhibitors were shown to bind to galectin-3 on the canonical S-face of galectin-3 carbohydrate-recognition domain. Their binding was shown to alter galectin-3 conformation and significantly inhibit galectin-3-mediated activities in cancer cell adhesion, invasion, angiogenesis and macrophage secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines min vitro, and markedly reduce galectin-3-mediated tumour growth and metastasis in vivo in mice as well as in chick embryos. Moreover, these novel galectin-3 inhibitors showed no detectable cytotoxicity and no genotoxicity. K2 and L2 therefore represent a unique class of novel galectin-3 inhibitors that can effectively inhibit galectin-3-mediated activities in vitro and in vivo. The discovery of these non-carbohydrate galectin-3 inhibitors offers significant promises to the development of galectin-3-targeted therapeutic drugs for the treatment of cancer and other galectin-3-mediated pathologies such as inflammation and fibrosis-associated diseases.

It is expressed by many types of human cells, particularly epithelial and immune cells, and plays multifaceted roles in cell–cell and cell-environment communications (Newlaczyl and Yu 2011 2020 Overexpression of galectin-3 is a common feature in cancers of all major types such as breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancers (Newlaczyl and Yu 2011 2011 2020 2011a 2023 2005 2017 2009 2010 2015 2010 2023 2020 Due to its broad involvement in promotion of almost all cancer hallmarks (Girotti et al. 2020 2005 2023 2018 2023 2023 2021 2023 2023 2023 We report in this study the discovery of two non-carbohydrate small molecule compounds as potent galectin-3 inhibitors. These purely synthetic galectin-3 compound inhibitors are shown to effectively inhibit galectin-3 binding to its ligands, galectin-3-mediated cancer cell activities in vitro and significantly reduce tumour growth and metastasis in vivo in chick embryos and in mice.

Difference was considered significance when p Results Identification of two non-carbohydrate compounds as potent galectin-3 inhibitors Screening a few compound libraries including that from Redx Oncology Ltd UK (with a total > 1000 compounds) by competitive galectin-3 ELISA (with asialo fetuin as the binding ligand) identified two small molecule compounds from the Redx Oncology library, named K2 and L2, as potent galectin-3 binding inhibitors. K2 and L2 have the same molecular composition (M W 2 1 50 1 2019 1 Fig. 1 K2 and L2 inhibit galectin-3 binding to its ligand. The chemical structures of the compounds are shown in A B C D E F Molecular docking predicts binding of K2 and L2 to the canonical galectin-3 CRD Both K2 and L2 were docked onto galectin-3 using three programmes -DynamicBind (Lu et al. 2024 2025 2021 2 Fig. 2 Molecular docking analysis predicts binding sites of K2 and L2 to the S-face of galectin-3 CRD. The predicted binding sites of K2 ( A C D F A D B E C F C F In both the K2-galectin-3 and L2-galectin-3 complexes, the piperazine moiety does not appear to make contacts with the protein (Fig. 2 2 2 2023 2022 K2 makes hydrophobic contacts with Arg144, Ala146, Asn 174 and Trp 181, and hydrogen bonds with Arg162, Ser 237. L2 makes hydrophobic interactions with Arg144, Val172, Asn 174 and Trp181, and hydrogen bonds with Ile14, His 158 and Arg162. Most of the hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonds are with conserved residues in galectins. The only difference between K2 and L2 is the position of the amino group on the anilino side chain (Fig. 1 K2 and L2 inhibit galectin-3-mediated cancer cell adhesion to basement proteins Galectin-3 is known to promote tumour cell adhesion to and invasion through basement matrix in tumour cell breakout at the primary tumour site by interaction with a number of basement matrix glycoproteins such as laminin (Nangia-Makker et al. 2008 The presence of both K2 and L2 was shown to cause significant inhibition of adhesion to basement matrix of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 Fig. 3 K2 and L2 inhibit galectin-3-mediated cancer cell adhesion to matrix proteins. Adhesion of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 ( A B C D A C B D E F G I H J G H I J K L M M p p p K2 and L2 inhibit galectin-3-mediated cancer cell adhesion to and invasion through vascular endothelium and angiogenesis Adhesion to and invasion through the blood vascular endothelium are two critical steps in tumour cell spreading in metastasis. Extracellular/circulating galectin-3 is known to be critically involved in these processes (Zhao et al. 2009 2001 2010 2014 K2 inhibits galectin-3-mediated secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages Excess secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, IL-1β, TGFα) by immune cells is critically involved in tumour cell avoidance of immune surveillance in the tumour microenvironment as well as in inflammation (Lan et al. 2021 2014 2009 2015 2011b 4 Fig. 4 K2 inhibits galectin-3-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from macrophages. THP-1-differentiated macrophages were treated with galectin-3 in the absence or presence of different concentrations of K2 for 24 h. The levels of IL-6 ( A B C p p P K2 and L2 have low cytotoxicity and genotoxicity The cytotoxicity of K2 and L2 were investigated in both normal human vascular endothelial HUVEC cells and human colon cancer SW620 cells. K2 and L2 showed almost no detectable effect on LDH release from both SW620 (Fig. 5 5 Fig. 5 K2 and K2 show no detectable cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. K2 and L2 cytotoxicity in human colon cancer SW620 ( A B Salmonella typhimurium C D p p p When mutagenesis potential was assessed for K2 in two Salmonella typhimurium 5 5 Binding of K2 and L2 to galectin-3 induces galectin-3 conformation changes To gain further insight into the interaction of K2 and L2 with galectin-3 and its influence on galectin-3 actions, interaction of the compounds with galectin-3 in solution was analysed by Circular Dichroism spectroscopy. CD spectroscopy conducted in the far-UV region is a highly sensitive way to detect changes of protein secondary structure in solution (Duckworth et al. 2015 6 2006 1 3 Fig. 6 Binding of the compounds induces galectin-3 conformation changes. Interaction of K2/L2 with galectin-3 was analysed by CD spectroscopy. All samples were matched with corresponding DMSO concentrations to ensure consistent baselines. Binding of K2 and L2 to galectin-3 induces galectin-3 conformation changes K2 inhibits tumour growth and metastasis in chick embryo model Having revealed significant effects of the compounds on galectin-3-mediated cancer cell activities in vitro, K2 was selected and investigated on its effect on tumour growth and metastasis in chick embryos. When SW620 cells, without or with galectin-3 shRNA knockdown, were applied to the chick embryo model, 70% (7/10) and 67% (6/9), respectively, embryos formed tumours when applied with SW620 and galectin-3-knockdown SW620 cells (Fig. 7 7 Fig. 7 K2 inhibits tumour growth and metastasis in chicken embryos. Effect of K2 on tumour formation, growth and metastasis of SW620 and SW620Gal3KD was assessed in chick embryos. Tumour cells were engrafted to the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) on embryonic day 7. K2 (24 µM) was injected into the allantoic cavity on the following day. Tumour formation and growth was analysed on embryonic day 14. Representative fluorescence ( A B C D K2 inhibit tumour growth and metastasis in mice Having shown a potent effect of K2 on inhibition of galectin-3-mediated tumour growth and metastasis in the chick embryos, its effect on tumour growth and metastasis was further investigated in mice. For assessment on tumour growth, nude mice were inoculated subcutaneously with SW620 and then administrated K2 or PBS (control) intraperitoneally three-times a week for four weeks. All mice formed measurable tumours after one week. Tumour growth in the K2-treated group showed slower in comparison to the control group. At end of the fourth week, tumours in the K2 groups were significantly (51%) smaller than that in the control group (Fig. 8 Fig. 8 K2 inhibits tumour growth and metastasis in mice. In the tumour growth experiment ( A B 6 B C F 6 i.v C C D p P P To assess the effect of K2 on metastasis, SW620 and galectin-3 knockdown SW620Gal3KD cells were intravenously injected to the animal tail veins. The mice were then administrated by intravenous injection of K2 or PBS daily for five days then once a week for eight weeks. At end of the eight weeks, the animals were sacrificed and the number of metastasis nodules on the surface of the lungs were quantified. Significantly fewer metastasis nodules were observed in the group injected with SW620Gal3KD than with SW620 cells (Fig. 8 8 Discussion This study reveals two non-carbohydrate small molecule compounds as potent galectin-3 inhibitors These closely related compound inhibitors, which share the same molecular compositions with difference of only the position of an NH2 group on an aromatic ring, bind to galectin-3 at low micromolar level. Molecular docking analysis suggests binding of the compounds on the canonical S-face of the galectin-3 CRD. These compound inhibitors were shown to inhibit galectin-3 binding to its ligands and inhibit galectin-3-mediated cancer cell adhesion, invasion, angiogenesis, as well as inhibit macrophage secretion of pre-inflammatory cytokines. Administration of K2 significantly reduced galectin-3 mediated tumour growth and metastasis in vivo in chick embryo and in mice. Neither of these compounds showed detectable cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. These non-carbohydrate compounds, therefore, represent a novel class of galectin-3 inhibitors and offer great potential to be developed as galectin-3-targeted therapeutic drugs for cancer treatment. Galectin-3 is synthesized in the cytoplasm but is expressed both inside and outside cells. Newly synthesized galectin-3 can be transported into the cell nucleus, through interaction with either nuclear localization sequence (NLS)-containing proteins or nuclear import proteins such as importin-α or importin-β (Funasaka et al. 2014b 2011 With increased realization of galectin-3 multi-mode actions in promotion of cancer development, progression and metastasis, there has been an exponential level of recent interest in the development of galectin-3-targeted therapeutics. This interest was also strongly encouraged by the discovery that mice with galectin-3 knockout displayed no overt developmental or physiological abnormalities under standard laboratory conditions (Colnot et al. 1998 2023 2015 2015 2014 2013 2023 2023 2021 2023 2020 2024 As the sole chimera-type galectin, galectin-3 contains an ~ 130 amino acids carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) at its C-terminal which is Linked to a proline-rich, flexible N-terminal domain by a 10–15 amino acid linker region. The CRD domain is the main galectin-3 action site that interacts with galactose-terminated glycans. Its N-terminal domain facilitates galectin-3 formation of higher-order structures such as dimers and pentamers that contribute to extracellular galectin-3 actions (Johannes et al. 2022 2020 The observation of conformation changes in Circular Dichroism analysis of galectin-3 β-sheet, the key secondary structure of galectin-3 CRD, in response to the compound binding is in keeping with interaction of the compounds on galectin-3 CRD. Both compounds are driven by the same protein–ligand interactions; this is to be expected as the position of the amino group in the aniline makes little difference to the important interactions that mediate the binding between the compounds and galectin-3. As a multi-functional molecule, galectin-3 promotes a range of steps in cancer development, progression, and metastasis (Marino et al. 2023 2020 2011a 2010 2015 2022 2015 The chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model has been used as a less expensive and complementary in vivo model to murine models in studying tumour development, angiogenesis and metastasis (Deryugina and Quigley 2008 2015 The effectiveness of these galectin-3 inhibitors on tumour growth and metastasis were further demonstrated in mice. When K2 was administrated three times a week for four weeks, the size of tumour inoculated with SW620 cells was reduced by ~ 50% in comparison to that in the control mice. Lung metastasis inoculated with SW620 cells further showed to be reduced by more than 80% when K2 was administrated, while no obvious effect of K2 was observed in the mice inoculated with galectin-3 knockdown SW620Gal3KD cells. These results indicate that these compounds inhibitors can effectively prevent galectin-3-mediated promotion of tumour growth and metastasis in vivo. This, together with the observation of their lack of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, suggests that these non-carbohydrate small molecule galectin-3 inhibitors represent a novel class of galectin-3 inhibitors and can offer significant potential to be developed as galectin-3-targeted novel therapeutic drugs for cancer treatment. It should be emphasised that galectin-3 is not only involved in cancer pathogenesis but also in the pathogenesis of several other diseases such as fibrosis (Bouffette et al. 2023 2020 2009 2023 2014 2024 2014 2023 2021 2020 2016 It should be mentioned that although galectin-3 is involved in the maintenance of homeostasis, it has been reported previously that mice with knockout galectin-3 displayed no overt developmental or physiological abnormalities under standard laboratory conditions (Colnot et al., 1998 Thus, non-carbohydrate small molecule compounds K2 and L2 are potent galectin-3 inhibitors that can effectively inhibit galectin-3-mediated actions in cancer progression and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. These novel, non-carbohydrate galectin-3 inhibitor compounds offer great promise and potential to be developed as galectin-3 targeted therapeutic drugs for cancer treatment. As galectin-3 is known to also promote the pathogenesis of inflammation and fibrosis-associated diseases (Ahmed et al. 2023) and is being pursued as a therapeutic target in those diseases (Bouffette et al. 2023 Supplementary Information  Supplementary Material 1 Abbreviations ASF Asialo-fetuin CAM Chick chorioallantoic membrane CD Circular Dichroism DMEM Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium CRD Carbohydrate-recognition domain Gal3 Galectin-3 Gal3KD Galectin-3 knockdown Gal3KO Galectin-3 Knockout HUVECs Human umbilical vein endothelial cells LAR Luciferase Assay Reagent LDH Lactate dehydrogenase PLB Passive Lysis Buffer TEER Trans-endothelial electric resistance TFS Tryptophan Fluorescence Spectroscopy Publisher’s Note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.
