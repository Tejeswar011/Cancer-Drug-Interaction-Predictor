Introduction The nervous system is a highly intricate network responsible for regulating sensory processing and cognitive function. Damage or dysfunction in the central and peripheral nervous systems (CNS and PNS) can lead to significant neurological impairments [ 1 2 3 4 Traumatic brain injury and spinal cord damage—both affecting the CNS—pose persistent therapeutic challenges [ 5 To address these limitations, strategies that accurately reproduce the neural microenvironment are essential. The demand for physiologically relevant in vitro models continues to increase. Neural tissue engineering (NTE)—a multidisciplinary field that integrates biomaterials, cell therapy, and advanced manufacturing technologies—has emerged as a promising approach to meet these challenges. In particular, three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology has recently emerged, enabling precise control of cell distribution, spatial regulation of tissue structure, and biochemical signaling pathways. This opens new avenues for creating complex, bioinspired neural tissue structures [ 6 2. Neural Tissue 2.1. Neural Tissue Engineering The nervous system consists of specialized cells called neurons, which form an intricate network for transmitting electrical impulses and information. Through this network, the nervous system regulates various physiological functions. The nervous system is anatomically divided into the CNS and PNS. The CNS, comprising the brain, cerebellum, and spinal cord [ 7 8 Injury to the nervous system can disrupt neuronal signal transmission and compromise the integrity of the blood–nerve barrier (BNB), leading to significant functional impairment [ 9 10 Compared to other tissues such as skin, cartilage, and bone, nerve tissue exhibits significantly lower regenerative capacity and greater functional complexity [ 11 12 NTE has recently expanded into multiple applications ( Figure 1 13 14 15 16 Figure 1 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 2.2. Limitations of Conventional Fabrication Methods in Neural Tissue Engineering In NTE, traditional fabrication methods—such as solvent casting, freeze-drying, and electrospinning—have been widely employed to produce porous scaffolds that facilitate neural cell adhesion. However, these approaches have significant limitations in replicating the intricate architecture and functional complexity of neural tissues. Solvent casting, often combined with powder extrusion, is commonly used to fabricate porous polymer scaffolds. However, this method limits precise control over pore shape and distribution, leading to uneven cell distribution and reduced nutrient transport efficiency. Residual solvents can cause cytotoxicity, rendering this approach unsuitable for highly sensitive neural tissue environments [ 28 29 30 2.3. Role of Three-Dimensional Bioprinting in Neural Tissue Engineering 3D bioprinting technology is becoming increasingly significant in NTE, enabling precise structural control, enhanced cell-scaffold interactions, and the creation of functional tissue models. Figure 2 31 11 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 3. Fundamentals of Three-Dimensional Bioprinting for Neural Tissues 3.1. Bioprinting Technologies 3D bioprinting employs computer-aided design and manufacturing technologies to precisely deposit biomaterials at specified locations, enabling the fabrication of complex 3D biological structures [ 40 41 42 43 44 As summarized in Table 1 3.1.1. Extrusion-Based Bioprinting Figure 3 45 46 47 48 3.1.2. Inkjet-Based Bioprinting The inkjet-based bioprinting method ( Figure 3 49 50 49 3.1.3. Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) Bioprinting Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) bioprinting is an emerging high-resolution printing technology that uses electrostatic forces to eject ultra-fine bioink droplets from a nozzle ( Figure 3 51 52 53 3.1.4. Laser-Assisted Bioprinting Laser-based bioprinting is a nozzle-free, non-contact technique capable of producing high-resolution structures ( Figure 3 54 55 56 Figure 3 57 58 3.2. Bioinks for Neural Tissue Engineering Post-stacking shape and structural stability largely depend on the rheological properties of bioink. Key parameters include shear-thinning behavior, viscoelasticity, and viscosity [ 59 60 61 62 63 As summarized in Table 2 3.2.1. Natural Polymers Natural polymers were the first materials used in neural tissue engineering. Derived from biological sources, these polymers demonstrate physicochemical and structural properties similar to those of native tissues. They exhibit excellent high biocompatibility and biodegradability. Collagen-based hydrogels, a representative example, enhance neural survival and proliferation and are primarily used as neural induction conduits [ 64 65 66 67 68 Recently, decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM)-based bioinks have attracted increasing attention. dECM preserves the ECM components and bioactive factors of the source tissue, facilitating cell-specific adhesion and functional differentiation while providing a tissue-specific biochemical and structural environment [ 69 70 3.2.2. Synthetic Polymers Synthetic polymers serve as customizable bioinks, allowing precise control over mechanical strength and physical characteristics. These polymers are fabricated using diverse technologies and platforms. Their composition, including biodegradability, can be finely regulated [ 76 77 71 30 72 3.2.3. Hybrid Polymers Hybrid polymer-based bioinks integrate the beneficial properties of both natural and synthetic polymers. They exhibit biological activity similar to that of natural polymers while offering mechanical strength comparable to synthetic polymers [ 72 73 74 75 3.3. Key Design Considerations for Neural Bioprinting 3.3.1. Biocompatibility and Cell Viability In brain tissue engineering, bioinks and scaffolds must exhibit biocompatibility for effective 3D bioprinting applications. Maintaining cellular viability is essential for effective regeneration. Recent studies have explored the use of conductive hydrogels and nanomaterials. One effective strategy for achieving this involves integrating a small quantity of graphene oxide (GO) into gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels [ 78 78 79 3.3.2. Mechanical and Rheological Properties Nerve tissue is classified as soft tissue with distinct mechanical properties. The mechanical strength and rheological behavior of scaffolds mimicking nerve tissue significantly affect cell adhesion, differentiation, and survival [ 80 81 82 83 3.3.3. Bioactivity and Electrical Conductivity Electrical signal transmission is a fundamental function of nerve tissue. Therefore, scaffold electrical conductivity is an essential factor for neural cell growth and functional recovery. Recently, extensive research has focused on using conductive hydrogels and nanomaterials to enhance these properties [ 84 85 86 4. Bioengineered Platforms for Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) 4.1. Biomaterial-Based Conduits for Peripheral Nerve Repair The PNS exhibits inherent capacity for regeneration; however, severe or complex injuries often limit full recovery [ 87 88 89 90 Figure 4 91 92 93 4.2. Schwann Cell-Based Scaffolds for Nerve Regeneration Schwann cells are the principal glial cells of the PNS, essential for axonal regeneration and myelin sheath formation following nerve injury [ 96 97 Figure 4 94 94 70 98 99 4.3. Controlled Release Systems for Peripheral Nerve Regeneration One key advantage of 3D bioprinting in peripheral nerve regeneration is its capacity to fabricate patient-specific structures. Scaffolds designed using CT or MRI imaging data demonstrate enhanced biocompatibility and superior therapeutic outcomes compared to conventional implants [ 100 Figure 4 21 101 102 103 104 105 4.4. Biophysical Gradients Platform for Axonal Guidance Recent advances in microfabrication techniques enable the precise fabrication of microenvironments incorporating both chemical and mechanical gradients [ 106 Figure 4 95 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 5. Bioengineered Platforms for Central Nervous System (CNS) 5.1. Biomaterial-Based Platforms for Central Nervous System Tissue Engineering The CNS, comprising the brain and spinal cord, serves as the primary control center for sensory information processing, motor coordination, and homeostatic regulation [ 114 115 116 117 Figure 5 118 5.2. Layered Neural Constructs Using 3D Bioprinting Traditional two-dimensional culture systems and animal models cannot sufficiently replicate the unique microenvironment of the CNS. To address these limitations, 3D bioprinting has emerged as a powerful technology for precisely depositing neural cells and biomaterials, creating models that more accurately mimic the cellular structure and functional properties of natural brain tissue ( Figure 5 119 122 123 5.3. Vascularized Central Nervous System Models Developed with Microfluidic Platforms Beyond layered tissue models, vascularization is essential for sustaining long-term cell viability and physiological function in CNS models. Figure 5 120 5.4. Developmental and Disease Models Using Bioprinted Central Nervous System Constructs Brain development involves complex spatial and temporal signaling. Three-dimensional bioprinting models provide valuable platforms for investigating neural development and associated disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, epilepsy, and intellectual disabilities [ 124 125 126 Figure 5 121 118 56 127 128 5.5. Neural Cancer Models (e.g., Glioblastoma) Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor characterized by high invasiveness and poor treatment response, largely due to its complex tumor microenvironment (TME) and the restrictive nature of the BBB [ 129 130 131 132 133 23 6. Bioprinting Strategies for Central and Peripheral Nervous System Models 6.1. Comparative Analysis of Bioprinted Models of the Central and Peripheral Nervous Systems The Three-dimensional bioprinting for neural tissue engineering should address the unique properties of the CNS and PNS, particularly regarding printing techniques, bioink composition, and design objectives. In CNS applications, bioprinting often focuses on replicating layered cortical architectures and interconnected synaptic networks. These constructs are typically fabricated using extrusion-based techniques with soft, neurocompatible hydrogels filled with neural progenitor and glial cells [ 66 131 134 135 6.2. Challenges and Opportunities in Bioprinting for Peripheral and Central Nervous Systems Regeneration Despite recent progress, bioprinted disease models of both the CNS and PNS face significant limitations. These include challenges in accurately mimicking chronic disease progression, limited integration of immune system components, and the lack of standardized fabrication protocols. While bioprinting technologies establish spatial and biochemical gradients crucial for neural tissue modeling, current platforms often struggle to generate stable, high-resolution gradients with precise mechanical and biochemical control [ 136 11 32 119 As summarized in Table 3 66 87 88 89 90 91 92 131 7. Future Directions and Challenges 7.1. Advancing Bioprinting Hardware for Gradient Control Although 3D bioprinting has significantly advanced the reproduction of neural tissue structures, precise control over the mechanical, biochemical, and electrical gradients crucial for neural development and regeneration remains a major challenge. Functional graded materials are crucial for replicating the heterogeneous microenvironment of neural tissue, but current bioprinting systems cannot generate such gradients continuously and accurately [ 137 138 139 140 7.2. Advancements in Bioink Development The performance and functionality of bioinks are crucial for successful bioprinting. Conventional hydrogel bioinks, including GelMA, alginate, and collagen, are widely used for their biocompatibility and shear-thinning properties. However, balancing mechanical strength, cellular viability, and printability remains challenging. Soft hydrogels lack sufficient mechanical integrity, whereas rigid materials compromise cell health. To address these limitations, hybrid and composite bioinks have been developed. dECM bioinks provide tissue-specific environments that promote cell differentiation and maturation [ 141 142 143 144 145 7.3. Integration of Bioprinting with Complementary Technologies The advancement in 3D bioprinting increasingly emphasizes its integration with complementary technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), ML, organ-on-a-chip (OoC) [ 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 8. Conclusions In summary, 3D bioprinting technology offers significant potential for neural tissue engineering by enabling precise replication of intricate cellular structures and circuit formation in the CNS and PNS. This approach addresses key limitations of traditional two-dimensional cultures and animal models. This review highlighted the significance of bioink properties, such as rheology, biocompatibility, bioactivity, and conductivity, in ensuring structural stability and cellular function. Furthermore, precise control of scaffold microstructure and mechanical properties, combined with the use of bifunctional materials, enhances the modulation of neuronal and Schwann cell activity. Incorporating patient-derived iPSCs for personalized disease modeling, alongside brain organoids and spatiotemporal regulation of growth factors and electrical stimulation, offers significant potential for advancing drug screening and regenerative therapies. Future research should prioritize sophisticated bioprinting techniques that enable multicellular patterning, vascularization, and electrophysiological integration. This focus will support the development of advanced neural tissue platforms for functional reconstruction and clinical application.
