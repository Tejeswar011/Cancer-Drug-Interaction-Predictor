Summary Tumor-type classification is critical for effective cancer treatment, yet current methods based on genomic alterations lack flexibility and have limited performance. Here, we introduce OncoChat, an artificial intelligence (AI) model designed to classify 69 tumor types by integrating diverse genomic alterations. Developed on genomic data from 158,836 tumors sequenced with targeted cancer gene panels, OncoChat demonstrates superior performance, achieving a micro-averaged precision-recall area under the curve (PRAUC) of 0.810 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.803–0.816), accuracy of 0.774, and an F1 score of 0.756, outperforming baseline methods. In a cancer of unknown primary (CUP) dataset of 26 cases whose types were subsequently confirmed, OncoChat correctly identified 22 cases. In two larger CUP datasets ( n Graphical abstract Highlights • OncoChat, a large language model, classifies tumor types from genomic alterations • OncoChat classifies known and unknown primary cancers with superior accuracy • Structural variant integration greatly improves tumor classification accuracy • OncoChat predictions are prognostic for survival in cancers of unknown primary Liu et al. develop OncoChat, a large language model that accurately classifies multiple cancer types, including cancers of unknown primary (CUP), from genomic data.

OncoChat enhances existing molecular classifiers by addressing key limitations, incorporating mutations, copy number changes, and structure variation in a flexible manner. The model is developed on a dataset of 158,836 across 69 tumors, all sequenced using clinically targeted cancer gene panels. OncoChat demonstrates strong performance, particularly in classifying CUP cases. Results Overall study design We developed OncoChat, a differential diagnostic tool that leverages LLMs to integrate genomic and clinical data for accurate tumor-type prediction. The study involved four key components: data collection, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation ( Figure S1 The dataset was sourced from the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) and comprised 163,585 targeted panel sequencing samples from 19 institutions. Genomic data include SNVs, copy number variations, and SVs, while clinical data encompassed age, gender, tumor type, and follow-up information ( Figure S1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Flowchart illustrating the development and evaluation of OncoChat The data were preprocessed into a single-turn dialogue format suitable for instruction-tuning LLMs ( Figure S1 n Figure S1 STAR Methods Model performance comparison with baseline methods OncoChat demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to existing models, including OncoNPC and GDD-ENS. On the testing set of 19,940 CKP cases consisting of 69 cancer types, OncoChat achieved an accuracy of 0.774 and an F1 score of 0.756 ( Table S2 Figure 2 p Figure 2 Figure 2 Performance of OncoChat compared with baseline models (A) Normalized confusion matrix of OncoChat’s performance across 23 pre-selected cancer types in the held-out test set ( n (B) Precision-recall curves comparing OncoChat, GDD-ENS, and OncoNPC on the testing set.

Figures 2 See Figure S14 Table S3 OncoChat’s performance was robust across a diverse range of tumor types, including traditionally challenging cases such as gliomas, prostate cancers, and soft tissue sarcomas, where it achieved superior precision and recall ( Figures 2 S14 Table S3 Figure 2 Table S3 A detailed comparison in Figure 2 Table S3 OncoChat demonstrated consistent and robust performance across diverse clinical and demographic settings, underscoring its broad applicability in cancer diagnosis. When stratified by cancer centers, OncoChat maintained stable predictive accuracy, achieving a PRAUC value of 0.809 at MSK ( n n n Figure S2 13 Figure S3 n n n n n n Figures S4 S5 Table S2 Figure S10 Figure S10 As an ensemble of nine language models ranging in size from 100 Mb to 7 billion parameters (see STAR Methods Table S2 Figure S12 Table S15 These results underscore OncoChat’s effectiveness in delivering high accuracy and robust performance across a broad spectrum of cancer types and clinical scenarios, making it a valuable tool for enhancing diagnostic workflows in oncology. Its precision in cancer classification has the potential to improve patient outcomes by enabling more accurate and tailored treatments. Integration of SVs enhances OncoChat’s performance Incorporating SV data significantly improved OncoChat’s predictive performance. The PRAUC increased from 0.802 (95% CI, 0.789–0.816) to 0.831 (95% CI, 0.819–0.843) ( p Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Enhanced performance of OncoChat with SV data (A) Normalized confusion matrix of OncoChat’s performance on the held-out test set for 15 pre-selected cancer types using SV data ( n (B) Precision-recall curves for OncoChat with and without SV data.

As shown in the confusion matrix ( Figure 3 42 , 43 Further cancer-specific analysis ( Figure 3 Incorporating SV data improved not only the ensemble performance but also the classification performance of individual models. On average, accuracy increased by 2.7%, while the F1 score improved by 2.5% across individual models ( Table S6 Figure S6 Rare tumor classification performance OncoChat demonstrated superior classification of rare cancers across prevalence thresholds in the full cohort. At the 15% prevalence threshold (see STAR Methods Figure S13 Table S14 Performance remained robust for ultra-rare tumors (<200 samples): mesothelioma (F1 = 0.746 vs. 0.690 and 0.367), bone cancer (F1 = 0.560 vs. 0.428 and 0.331), and uterine sarcoma (F1 = 0.402 vs. 0.342 and 0.390). OncoChat correctly reclassified 21/64 and 66/133 mesothelioma cases misclassified by OncoNPC and GDD-ENS, respectively, demonstrating improved sensitivity. While all models showed reduced accuracy for rare tumors, OncoChat’s consistent outperformance highlights its relative strength in this challenging domain, though further refinement remains necessary. 44 Performance across broad cancer categories OncoChat’s predictive performance was evaluated across broad categories, including gastrointestinal (GI), thoracic, breast, and brain/CNS tumors, reflecting the clinical grouping of cancers based on anatomical and biological characteristics ( Figures 4 S15 Figure 4 OncoChat’s performance across broad cancer categories (A) Normalized confusion matrix showing classification performance for 11 broad cancer types in held-out test set ( n (B) Bar plot of overall accuracy and F1 scores for OncoChat, GDD-ENS, and OncoNPC at the broad cancer-type level.

On the CKP test set ( n Figure 4 Table S4 As shown in Figure 4 Table S5 Figure 4 Performance of OncoChat in CUP samples To explore the clinical utility of OncoChat, we analyzed whether its cancer-type predictions could stratify overall survival in a CUP cohort consisting of 719 patients.

(E) Sankey plot comparing performance of OncoChat, OncoNPC, and GDD-ENS on an independent CUP cohort ( n In an independent cohort of 158 CUP cases, treatment concordance with OncoChat’s predictions trended toward improved survival (log rank test, p p Table S13 Figure S7 16 , 45 Mutation analysis further underscored this consistency. For instance, CUP samples classified as non-small cell lung cancer displayed mutation signatures associated with smoking and DNA mismatch repair deficiency (e.g., SBS3, SBS4, SBS8, SBS14, and SBS29), while those predicted as melanoma exhibited UV-related patterns (e.g., SBS7) ( Figure 5 46 Superior performance of OncoChat in confirmed CUP cohorts In a cohort of 26 CUP samples with subsequently confirmed diagnosis, OncoChat accurately predicted the tumor type in 22 cases ( Figure 5 Table S7 Overall, OncoChat effectively predicts the tissue of origin for CUP cases with accuracy comparable to its performance in CKP samples. Its ability to classify aggressive and rare cancers and inform site-specific treatment strategies underscores its potential to enhance diagnostic workflows and improve patient outcomes, particularly in cases where conventional methods fall short. Model interpretability reveals biological plausibility Analysis of CKP samples identified tumor-type-specific driver mutations ( Figure S8 TP53 BRAF PIK3CA KDM6A CTNNB1 SRSF2 In 22/26 correctly classified CUP cases ( Figure S9 APC VHL Attention mechanisms captured functional interactions: BRCA-PARP1 BRCA KRAS-EGFR p p Figure S11 47 STAR Methods Discussion The development and validation of OncoChat, a LLM-based diagnostic tool, mark a significant advancement in cancer diagnosis, particularly in challenging cases such as CUP. OncoChat provides a robust mechanism for accurate tumor classification, surpassing the performance of existing ML models in both CKP and CUP cases. This dual capability underscores the model’s potential for broader applications in clinical oncology, where precise tumor classification is critical for determining the most effective therapeutic strategies. OncoChat demonstrated impressive performance in the CKP test set, achieving an accuracy of 77.4%, an F1 score of 75.6%, and a PRAUC of 0.810. These metrics are particularly significant given the challenges in classifying rare and complex cancers, such as endometrial cancers and head and neck cancers, where OncoChat outperformed both OncoNPC and GDD-ENS. Furthermore, OncoChat offers a broader cancer classification spectrum, encompassing 69 tumor types, compared to models like OncoNPC and GDD-ENS, which focus on 20–30 types. Its ability to maintain strong predictive performance across a diverse array of tumor types highlights OncoChat’s generalizability and scalability, making it suitable for adoption in varied clinical settings. Besides, OncoChat demonstrated robust performance across diverse clinical and demographic contexts, reinforcing its potential broad applicability in cancer diagnosis. OncoChat’s application to CUP cases is particularly noteworthy. CUPs are notoriously difficult to diagnose due to the lack of an identifiable primary site. In this study, OncoChat’s predictions for CUP samples showed performance comparable to its accuracy in CKP cases. The correlation between OncoChat’s predictions and survival outcomes in CUP patients further underscores its clinical relevance. Patients predicted to have aggressive cancers, such as pancreatic and esophagogastric cancers, exhibited shorter survival times, while those predicted to have less aggressive tumors, such as HNSCC, had better prognoses. These findings suggest that OncoChat not only captures tumor type but also aligns with clinically relevant prognostic indicators, enhancing its potential as a tool for guiding personalized treatment plans. OncoChat demonstrates superior diagnostic performance in challenging clinical scenarios, particularly for CUP. The model correctly identified the tissue of origin in 84.6% (22/26) of confirmed CUP cases, outperforming existing approaches that frequently misclassified morphologically ambiguous tumors. More importantly, alignment between OncoChat’s predictions and empirical therapy selection was associated with improved survival outcomes, providing clinical validation of its potential utility in precision oncology. These findings strongly support current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines advocating for molecular profiling in CUP management. The clinical applicability of existing molecular classifiers has been limited by several factors: (1) restricted tumor-type coverage (22–38 types), (2) single-institution training biases, and (3) diminished performance in rare malignancies. OncoChat addresses these limitations through comprehensive training on 158,836 samples spanning 69 tumor types from 19 institutions. Notably, even when evaluated on the same tumor types as narrower scope models, OncoChat maintained superior performance (accuracy = 0.827 vs. 0.774 for OncoNPC), suggesting more robust feature learning. This advantage was particularly pronounced for rare tumors (≤15% prevalence: F1 = 0.531 vs. 0.474) and ultra-rare histologies (mesothelioma: F1 = 0.746 vs. 0.690), where existing models often fail. The incorporation of SVs into OncoChat further boosted its performance, especially in classifying complex cancers. SVs, which are often implicated in cancer progression and tumor heterogeneity, enabled OncoChat to more accurately classify cancers that are difficult to diagnose using point mutations or CNAs alone. 48 42 , 43 Through systematic interpretability analyses, we demonstrate that our model’s predictions are anchored in established cancer biology. 49 TP53 BRAF PIK3CA APC VHL 50 , 51 BRCA PARP1 47 52 Conventional diagnostic workflows for CUP, reliant on sequential immunohistochemistry (IHC) and imaging, remain limited by marker specificity and interpretive subjectivity. 14 , 15 , 16 53 , 54 55 , 56 57 , 58 59 , 60 9 , 61 45 OncoChat addresses these challenges by leveraging stable genomic alterations, even in dedifferentiated tumors, resolving 37% of IHC-indeterminate cases in published cohorts. 16 62 63 , 64 In conclusion, OncoChat represents a significant leap forward in cancer diagnosis, offering a powerful tool for accurately classifying both known and unknown tumors. By integrating genomic and clinical data, OncoChat provides superior performance in predicting cancer types from targeted genomic profiling, positioning it as a promising diagnostic tool in personalized medicine. As the model evolves, it has the potential to transform the clinical practices, especially for challenging cases like CUP, where precise tumor classification is critical for improving patient outcomes. Further validation and refinement will be essential for ensuring its widespread adoption. Limitations of the study While OncoChat demonstrates broad utility, key challenges remain. First, the model must be validated in substantially larger, well-annotated cohorts that include both cancers with a known-primary (CKP) tumors and CUP with definitive diagnostic labels, so that performance estimates reflect the full heterogeneity of real-world practice. Second, expanding the feature space to include multimodal data—such as bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing, epigenomic assays (e.g., DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility), circulating cell-free DNA fragmentomic patterns, and whole-slide pathology images—may uncover complementary biological signals and further enhance predictive power, particularly for challenging specimens with low tumor burden where DNA-based classifiers often underperform. Systematic evaluation of these transcriptomic, epigenetic, and histopathological features is essential to ensure robust performance across the full spectrum of clinical materials. Third, while OncoChat demonstrates robust performance across broad tumor types, we acknowledge that rare tumor entities remain markedly underrepresented in current training sets; enlarging the dataset to include more cases of uncommon malignancies—and subjecting predictions in these subgroups to rigorous prospective evaluation—will be essential before OncoChat can be confidently applied to the full breadth of oncologic diagnoses.

As this study is retrospective, patient consent was not required. A total of 197,980 next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel samples were collected from 171,957 patients across 19 institutions participating in the AACR Project GENIE. Detailed demographic information, including age, gender, and racial distribution, is provided in Table S1 Given the multi-institutional nature of the dataset, the targeted panels used varied, with differences in gene coverage. All panels detected single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variations (CNVs), while some also identified structural variants (SVs). Additional details on panel specifications are provided in Table S10 Figure S1 After quality control, 34,395 samples were excluded based on predefined criteria: 3,958 samples labeled as “UNKNOWN”, 731 with incomplete diagnostic information, 176 tumor types with fewer than 15 samples, and 29,530 samples with low mutation counts (<2 mutations). This resulted in a total of 163,585 eligible cancer samples, categorized as either Cancer of Known Primary (CKP; 158,836 samples across 69 cancer types) or Cancer of Unknown Primary (CUP; 4,749 samples). The CKP samples were randomly split into a training set (80%, n n Tables S11 S7 n Method details Data preprocessing To enable training of the large language model (LLM), unstructured raw data were transformed into a structured single-turn dialogue format. As illustrated in Figure S1 X I Y X C G C = Age : 36 , Gender : Female Genomic information included SNVs, CNVs and SVs. SNVs and SVs captured detailed genetic alterations, such as protein changes or structural modification. For instance: S N V s = A T M p . T 2396 S , C I C p . A 686 V , N F 1 p . V 34 I , … S V s = I N V E R S I O N : N A B 2 S T A T 6 , T R A N S L A T I O N : P R K A R 1 A U T R N , … CNVs, which indicate variations in gene copy number, were transformed into biologically interpretable terms. Numerical values from the raw data were converted as follows: −2 → deep loss; −1.5 → medium-level loss; −1 → single-copy loss; 1 → low-level gain; 1.5 → medium-level amplification; 2 → high-level amplification. For example, a CNV description might appear as: C N V s = C D K N 2 A : d e e p l o s s , E L F 3 : h i g h − l e v e l a m p l i f i c a t i o n User instruction ( I Y Y = n o n − s m a l l c e l l l u n g c a n c e r The raw data for all samples were processed using these predefined rules, ensuring consistency across the dataset. A detailed example of the dialogue structure is presented in Figure S1 Figure S1 Model architectures OncoChat is created through instruction-tuning of each individual model in the Qwen-series 65 66 Table S12 Qwen is a decoder-only transformer that incorporates self-attention mechanisms with causal masking and feedforward neural networks (FFNs). In Qwen-1.5, Grouped Query Attention (GQA) replaces traditional multi-head attention (MHA), enhancing efficiency. The model uses the SwiGLU activation function and rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) to better capture positional information. Additionally, Qwen-1.5 uses QKV bias in the attention mechanism, improving its ability to handle longer sequences. Mamba is a deep learning architecture tailored for sequence modeling, addressing the limitations of transformers when processing long sequences. It integrates the Structured State Space (S4) model, which combines continuous-time, recurrent, and convolutional mechanisms to effectively capture long-range dependencies. The S4 model allows Mamba to maintain an unbounded context while ensuring computational efficiency during both training and inference. Mamba introduces a dynamic mechanism that adjusts State Space Model (SSM) parameters based on input sequences. This adaptability enables the model to focus on relevant information and filter out less important data, transitioning from a time-invariant to a time-varying framework. The combination of SSM with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) blocks results in a streamlined architecture suitable for a wide range of sequence modeling tasks. Instruction fine-tuning objective Instruction-tuning involves fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM on a dataset D s t 67 θ L ( D , θ ) = − ∑ i ∑ j log p θ ( t i j | s i , t i , < j ) This approach ensures the model learns to follow instructions and generate accurate responses within a specific domain. Model development and evaluation Following data preprocessing, the structured sample data were used to fine-tune the Qwen-series and Mamba-series models for cancer classification. As depicted in Figure S1 Y p X I Y p Y In the evaluation phase, the model parameters were frozen, and predictions ( Y pi X I Y i i Figure S1 To enhance prediction reliability, we employed an ensemble strategy. For each sample, the nine models generate their own predicted label. Then, for each prediction label (e.g., “colorectal cancer”), we count how many models support that label. The confidence of the sample being predicted as a specific label is calculated as the proportion of models that predict that label, i.e., k 9 k Benchmark methods To evaluate the performance of OncoChat, we compared it against two state-of-the-art cancer type classification methods: OncoNPC 13 1 OncoNPC, a machine-learning classifier based on the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, was trained on the training set using somatic alterations (mutations, mutational signatures, and copy number alterations) along with patient age and gender. Model optimization was performed through hyperparameter tuning with random search and 10-fold cross-validation. We used the original code and parameter settings provided by the authors for model training and evaluation. GDD-ENS, a deep-learning system, was trained on the same training set. It utilized genomic features derived from the MSK-IMPACT panels, including mutations, indels, copy-number variations, gene fusions, and mutation signatures. The model architecture employed a hyperparameter ensemble of 10 multi-layer perceptrons. Training incorporated upsampling of smaller cancer types to balance class distribution and used a Gaussian process for hyperparameter optimization. Model optimization was conducted using random search and 10-fold cross-validation, followed by model ensembling. Final prediction results were obtained using the original code and default parameter settings provided by the authors. 1 Evaluation metrics To compare the performance of OncoChat, OncoNPC, and GDD-ENS, we used the following evaluation metrics.

Consistent with prior studies, 13 CUP patients from DFCI center who were lost to follow-up at the time of sequencing were excluded, resulting in a final cohort of 719 samples for analysis ( Table S8 survival survminer Mutation profiles of CUP samples To validate the reliability of CUP prediction, we analyzed the association between the SNVs of CUP samples and their corresponding CKP. This analysis included 9,272 CKP samples and 479 CUP samples from the DFCI Cancer Center, sequenced using the DFCI-ONCOPANEL-3.1 oncology panel, covering nine cancer types: Bladder Cancer, Breast Cancer, Colorectal Cancer, Esophagogastric Cancer, Head and Neck Cancer, Melanoma, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Ovarian Cancer, and Pancreatic Cancer ( Table S9 We used the R package MutationalPatterns get_known_signatures Independent validation of OncoChat for CUP We further validated OncoChat using an independent dataset from a prior study 1 Table S7 Empirical treatment and OncoChat prediction We analyzed an additional dataset of 158 CUP cases, referred to as the Empirical Treatments Cohort. 13 We defined concordance as the alignment between the cancer type predicted by OncoChat and the empirical treatment administered, based on established clinical guidelines (e.g., NCCN). Each case was categorized as either concordant (treatment matched the predicted cancer type) or not concordant (treatment deviated from the predicted type). Overall survival differences between concordant and non-concordant groups were assessed using Kaplan–Meier analysis and the log rank test. To further evaluate the prognostic significance of concordance, we conducted a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Covariates included in the model were gender, copy number alteration (CNA) burden, metastatic site, and histological subtype. Hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p Model interpretability To elucidate the biological signals driving tumor classification in OncoChat, we performed a comprehensive interpretability analysis using TransformerLens, a mechanistic interpretability library designed for transformer-based language models. This framework enabled direct inspection of internal model activations and attention mechanisms across CKP samples spanning 17 tumor types from MSK Center. Specifically, we applied activation patching (provided by TransformerLens), a causal intervention technique introduced in the ROME framework, to identify influential activations within OncoChat’s architecture. 68 To determine the most predictive genomic alterations, we analyzed model outputs across all samples and quantified the relative contribution of each gene to the final classification logits. High-impact mutations were defined as those consistently ranked among the top features within samples of a given tumor type. These were cross-referenced with known driver mutations to evaluate biological plausibility. Feature saliency scores were visualized to reveal tumor-type-specific patterns. To validate model predictions in cancers of unknown primary (CUP), we examined gene-level contributions in 22 of the 26 CUP cases that were confidently classified by OncoChat. Heatmaps were generated to illustrate the relative importance of each gene in contributing to the predicted tumor type. We further assessed OncoChat’s capacity to capture biologically meaningful gene–gene relationships by analyzing attention patterns between BRCA1/2 PARP1 47 BRCA1/2 PARP1 Quantification and statistical analysis The experiments were conducted using Python (version 3.11.7), R (version 4.2.0), ggplot2 (version 3.4.2) and scikit-learn (version 1.4.1). The area under the Precision-Recall curve (PRAUC) was calculated using multiROC (version 1.1.1). The 95% CIs and p References 1 Darmofal M. Suman S. Atwal G. Toomey M. Chen J.-F. Chang J.C.
