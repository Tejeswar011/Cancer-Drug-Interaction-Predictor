While conventional strategies focus on optimizing the physicochemical properties of lipid nanoparticles (LNP), they often fail to overcome the intrinsic biological barriers of these cells. Here, we introduced a “bioactive nanocarrier” paradigm, hypothesizing that incorporating a cellular modulator directly into LNP structure can synergistically overcome these barriers. We designed and synthesized a novel LNP by integrating the pro-inflammatory fatty acid, arachidonic acid (ARA), as a functional structural component (ARA-LNP). Systematic optimization of the ARA content and mRNA payload revealed a formulation that achieves high transfection efficiency (83.76%) in primary M2-polarized bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), a cell type that recapitulates pro-tumoral phenotype in the tumor microenvironment. Leveraging this advanced delivery platform, we successfully generated HER2-targeting CAR-M that demonstrated potent and specific phagocytic activity against HER2-expressing tumor cells in vitro. This work presents a powerful strategy where the nanocarrier itself transiently modulates the target cell state to enhance gene delivery, providing a new design principle for engineering macrophages and other hard-to-transfect immune cells for therapeutic applications. arachidonic acid lipid nanoparticles macrophages engineering transfection efficiency gene delivery Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai 24ZR1439000 Medical-Engineering Joint Funds of Shanghai Jiao Tong University 24X010301301 25X010301897 This study was financially supported by grants from the Natural Science Foundation of Shanghai (24ZR1439000) and Medical-Engineering Joint Funds of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (24X010301301, 25X010301897). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Macrophages are central orchestrators of tissue homeostasis and immunity, capable of adopting diverse functional phenotypes in response to microenvironmental cues [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Among the various strategies, direct genetic engineering of macrophages to generate Chimeric antigen receptor macrophages (CAR-M) provides unmatched antigen specificity and durable therapeutic activity, enabling macrophages to selectively recognize and eradicate cancer cells [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Efforts to overcome these limitations have largely centered on tuning the physicochemical properties of LNP-by modifying lipid composition, adjusting surface charge, or adding stealth coatings to prolong circulation and promote uptake [ 25 26 27 28 29 To test this concept, we selected arachidonic acid (ARA), a canonical pro-inflammatory ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) [ 30 31 32 33 34 35 Here, we present the rational design, systematic optimization, and validation of an ARA-integrated LNP (ARA-LNP) platform for efficient mRNA delivery into primary M2 macrophages ( Scheme 1 2. Results 2.1. Influence of Lipid Composition on ARA-LNP Physicochemical Properties and Transfection Efficacy To develop an LNP formulation with enhanced transfection efficiency in macrophages, we first investigated the effect of incorporating different ω-6 PUFA, such as ARA, γ-linolenic acid, and linoleic acid, into the lipid phase. The specific lipid formulations are depicted in Supplementary Table S1 Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 Figure 1 Next, we systematically investigated the impact of the ARA molar ratio on the physicochemical properties of the LNP. While the molar percentages of the ionizable lipid (SM-102), helper lipid (DSPC), and PEG lipid (DMG-PEG2000) remained constant, we formulated three LNP variants with increasing ARA content (8.5, 20.5, and 33.5 mol%), compensating with cholesterol to maintain a combined molar percentage of 38% for ARA and cholesterol ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 It is worth noting that TEM imaging revealed the presence of smaller spheroidal structures alongside the predominant ARA-LNP population, indicating a degree of size heterogeneity that is not fully captured by intensity-weighted DLS measurements. Such heterogeneity could influence the amount of mRNA cargo encapsulated per particle and thus impact the uniformity of the therapeutic dose. While this size diversity might facilitate uptake by phagocytic cells, achieving a more monodisperse particle population will be an important consideration for future translational applications. We then assessed the transfection performance of these formulations in M2-BMDMs ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 2.2. Influence of mRNA Concentration on ARA-LNP Properties and Transfection Efficacy Having established the optimal lipid composition, we next sought to optimize the mRNA payload by investigating the effect of mRNA concentration in the aqueous phase. Using the lead 20.5 mol% ARA lipid mixture, we prepared four LNP batches by varying the initial GFP mRNA concentration (100, 125, 150, and 200 µg/mL) in the sodium acetate buffer ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 36 Subsequently, we evaluated the impact of mRNA concentration on transfection efficiency in M2-BMDMs. A clear dose-dependent increase in GFP expression was observed, culminating in a striking peak efficiency of 83.76% with LNP formulated using 150 µg/mL mRNA (150 µg/mL GFP mRNA-ARA-LNP) ( Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 5 In summary, through a two-stage optimization process, we identified a lead ARA-LNP formulation with exceptional performance. We began our investigation by systematically evaluating lipid phase compositions, a critical reaction component in LNP formulation. By adjusting the molar percentage of ARA in the lipid phase, we prepared three representative ARA-LNP with varying ARA ratios. After assessing their physicochemical properties along with transfection efficiency in bone marrow-derived M2-type macrophages, 20.5 mol% ARA was determined as the optimal lipid phase composition for further optimization. Additionally, we also considered an additional key factor influencing transfection efficiency-mRNA concentration. By preparing four ARA-LNP formulations with different mRNA concentrations in sodium acetate buffer solution, we investigated their characteristics and transfection performance in bone marrow-derived M2-type macrophages. This analysis identified 150 μg/mL as the optimal mRNA concentration for the aqueous phase. The final optimized ARA-LNP formulation for M2-type macrophage transfection was as follows: the lipid phase consisted of an ethanolic solution containing 50 mol% SM-102, 10 mol% DSPC, 1.5 mol% DMG-PEG2000, 18 mol% cholesterol and 20.5 mol% ARA; the aqueous phase comprised a 150 μg/mL mRNA solution in sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). The resulting ARA-LNP loaded with GFP mRNA exhibited a zeta potential of −5.27 ± 0.36 mV, spherical nanoparticles of 195.46 nm, and achieved GFP expression levels of up to 83.76% in primary bone marrow-derived M2-type macrophages. This ARA-LNP laid a robust foundation for developing CAR-M therapeutics in vitro and in vivo, thereby enhancing antitumor immunotherapy. 2.3. In Vitro Generation and Anti-Tumor Efficacy Validation of CAR-M Macrophages via ARA-LNP Delivery Having developed a highly efficient LNP platform, we next sought to determine its utility for a therapeutically relevant application: the generation of functional CAR-M. We encapsulated mRNA encoding a second-generation CAR targeting the HER2 into our optimized ARA-LNP. These were used to transfect M2-BMDMs, generating HER2-CAR-M cells. The anti-tumor functionality of these engineered macrophages was evaluated in a co-culture assay with HER2-expressing TUBO mouse mammary carcinoma cells at an effector-to-target (E:T) ratio of 10:1. We monitored tumor cell fate over 48 h using a nanolive 3D holotomographic microscope, comparing the effects of HER2-CAR-M cells against unmodified M2 macrophages (negative control) and pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages (positive control for cytotoxicity). As expected, TUBO cells proliferated rapidly when cultured alone, reaching near-confluency within 48 h ( Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 7 3. Discussion In this study, we addressed the critical challenge of inefficient gene delivery to primary macrophages, a major roadblock in the development of macrophage-based immunotherapies such as CAR-M. To overcome this barrier, we introduced and validated a “bioactive nanocarrier” strategy by engineering lipid nanoparticles that incorporate ARA as a functional structural component. Through systematic optimization of both the lipid composition and mRNA payload, we developed an ARA-LNP formulation that achieved an exceptional transfection efficiency of over 80% in M2-BMDMs, a notoriously difficult-to-transfect cell type that models the immunosuppressive TAMs found in tumors. Importantly, we demonstrated the therapeutic potential of this platform by generating HER2-CAR-M that exhibited potent and antigen-specific anti-tumor activity in vitro. These findings not only provide a robust new tool for macrophage engineering but also establish a conceptual advance in nanocarrier design, where the delivery vehicle itself actively modulates the target cell to overcome intrinsic biological barriers. Our approach diverges from conventional LNP optimization, which has historically focused on passive physicochemical parameters such as particle size, surface charge, and stealth coatings. While these properties remain critical, our findings highlight the substantial gains achievable by actively engaging with the target cell’s biology. The selection of ARA was hypothesis-driven, based on its known pro-inflammatory and membrane-modulating activities [ 37 38 The successful generation of functional CAR-M underscores the translational significance of our platform. By achieving high-efficiency transfection, ARA-LNP make it possible to generate large numbers of therapeutically active macrophages from primary cells without the use of viral vectors or extensive pre-conditioning protocols. Notably, the engineered CAR-M demonstrated robust tumoricidal activity comparable to that of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages. This suggests that the CAR-mediated activation signal is sufficient to override the baseline M2 polarization, effectively reprogramming these cells into tumoricidal effectors upon antigen encounter. While this study provides a strong proof-of-concept, several avenues warrant future investigation. A deeper mechanistic exploration is needed to precisely delineate how ARA enhances transfection. Studies employing lipidomics, transcriptomics, and metabolic profiling (e.g., Seahorse assays) would help confirm our hypothesis regarding membrane fusion and metabolic reprogramming. Furthermore, while we demonstrated robust in vitro efficacy, the true potential of this technology must be validated in vivo. Future work will focus on assessing the biodistribution, safety, and therapeutic efficacy of systemically or locally administered ARA-LNP in preclinical solid tumor models. Another intriguing direction is to examine whether the pro-inflammatory properties of ARA synergistically remodel the tumor microenvironment by recruiting other immune cells. Finally, the “bioactive nanocarrier” concept introduced here with ARA could be extended to a broader class of immunomodulatory lipids or small molecules. Incorporating molecules that, for example, inhibit lysosomal acidification or modulate specific innate immune sensors could provide alternative or complementary strategies to enhance gene delivery in primary macrophages and other challenging immune cell types like dendritic cells or neutrophils. In conclusion, this work presents a paradigm-shifting approach to nanocarrier design that bridges materials science and immunology. By embedding intrinsic biological activity into the delivery vehicle, we created a potent platform that effectively overcomes the inherent resistance of primary macrophages to genetic engineering. This technology holds significant promise for advancing CAR-M therapy and offers a versatile blueprint for the development of next-generation delivery systems for a wide range of immunotherapeutic applications. 4.

The Preparation of LNP LNP synthesis was performed using microfluidic technology (Micro&Nano Instrument Technology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China, INanoE). The lipid phase, dissolved in ethanol, comprised the following components at specified molar ratios: SM-102 (50 mol%), DSPC (10 mol%), DMG-PEG2000 (1.5 mol%), cholesterol and PUFA (accounting for 38.5 mol% in total). The aqueous phase consisted of mRNA in sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0). LNP were formulated by mixing the lipid and aqueous phases at a volumetric ratio of 1:3, with a total flow rate of 16 mL/min.

HER2-CAR-M are identifiable by their expression of a GFP-tagged CAR construct (green) and an irregular morphology with cellular protrusions. In contrast, TUBO cells are non-fluorescent and exhibit a more uniform, rounded, or elongated shape, allowing for unambiguous identification and quantification of each cell type. Scale bars: 20 µm.
