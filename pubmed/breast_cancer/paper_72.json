Transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) is relevant for diseases like cancer, cardiac dysfunction, and infection, warranting drug development targeting TRPV2. However, this has been complicated by the lack of good modulators targeting TRPV2 and questions about species selectivity, so more detailed molecular insights into channel function and pharmacology are required. Two recent studies identified distinct binding sites on rat (r) and mouse (m) TRPV2 for activation by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). Here we aimed to determine whether the mechanisms for 2-APB sensitivity of TRPV2 indeed differ among these closely related orthologs. Patch clamp electrophysiology revealed that mTRPV2 and human TRPV2 display similar sensitivities to 2-APB when compared with a considerably higher sensitivity of rTRPV2. For both mTRPV2 and rTRPV2, we observed that the exchange of putative 2-APB binding residues within the vanilloid binding pocket alters overall channel sensitivity to 3 TRPV2 pharmacological activators that bind at different sites: 2-APB, cannabidiol, and probenecid. By contrast, the exchange of putative 2-APB binding residues at the S5 binding pocket in both channels resulted in strongly reduced 2-APB sensitivies without reducing sensitivity to cannabidiol and probenecid. rTRPV2 mutants lacking key residues of both binding sites were almost completely 2-APB insensitive. These functional data suggest that the mechanisms accounting for 2-APB sensitivity are similar across mammalian TRPV2 orthologs. Except for serving as a binding site for 2-APB, the vanilloid binding pocket plays a key role in the overall function of TRPV2. These findings are relevant for the emerging framework toward an improved understanding of TRPV2. Significance Statement This study resolves the conflict regarding how 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate binds to transient receptor potential vanilloid 2 (TRPV2), showing a shared mechanism despite sensitivity differences. These findings enhance TRPV2 modulation insights and highlight species considerations in drug design, aiding the development of selective TRPV2-targeted therapies.

Compounds such as 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and cannabidiol (CBD) are commonly used to activate TRPV2, but these substances are nonspecific and affect many other proteins, including the closely related TRPV1 and TRPV3. 19 20 21 22 1 , 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 Despite being commonly used to examine TRPV2 function, the binding site and mechanism for 2-APB have proved controversial. Three groups, including our own, have published cryo-election microscopy structures of TRPV2 in the presence of 2-APB with 3 different results. First, our group suggested binding of 2-APB in a pocket between the S5 helix and the S4-S5 linker of 2 adjacent monomers (S5 binding pocket). 22 22 29 , 30 27 27 31 Due to the inconsistency between the 2 identified binding sites, Su et al 27 Fig. 1 Supplemental Fig. 1 Fig. 1 (A) 2-APB binding site in mTRPV2 (pdb 7YEP 7N0N This study aims to comprehensively examine the role of the 2 predicted 2-APB binding sites to gain a better understanding of possible species specificity. We rigorously re-examined 2-APB-induced activation of both rTRPV2 and mTRPV2 by employing patch clamp electrophysiology to investigate multiple mutant constructs. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Chemicals All chemicals were diluted immediately prior to use. 2-APB was obtained from Tocris (Bio-Technology) and stored at –8 °C in a 100 mM stock in DMSO. CBD and methyl- β β 2.2 Cell culture HEK 293T cells were transfected with various plasmids using jetPEI (Polyplus-transfection SA). The cDNA of mTRPV2 was kindly donated by Dr Itaru Kojima (Gunma University) and the cDNA of rTRPV2 was generously provided by Dr Michael Caterina (Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). Cells were cultured under standard conditions (5% CO 2 Mutants of mTRPV2 (Q525N, Q525A, Y466A, L627A, and H516A) and rTRPV2 (Q530A, Q530N, Y471A, L632A, H521A, H521A/R529K, H521A/Q530N/R539K, H521A/R539K/L632A, H521A/Q530N/R539K/L632A, F472S/L510T, and F472S/L510T/Q530E) (see the sequence alignment in Supplemental Fig. 2 Stably TRPV2-expressing HEK 293 cells were created by transfection of the vector encoding for rTRPV2, mTRPV2, or human (h) TRPV2 with a selection antibiotic tag with jetPEI following the manufacturer’s instructions. Twenty-hours posttransfection cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium F12 with 10% FBS containing the selection antibiotic to select for stable integrands. Individual colonies were transferred to a 24-well plate and expanded under continuous antibiotic selection. To verify functional expression calcium imaging experiments and patch clamp recordings were performed to assess TRPV2 activity in response to 2-APB. Approximately 24 hours posttransfection, cells were washed using phosphate-buffered saline (Lonza), detached with trypsin/EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (0.05%, Bio & Sell), and seeded for patch clamp experiments. 2.3 Cholesterol depletion and quantification To confirm the effective depletion of membrane cholesterol, HEK293t cells were treated with 10 mM M β Membrane cholesterol levels were quantified using the Amplex Red Cholesterol Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Fluorescence intensities were measured using a FLUOstar Optima microplate reader (BMG Labtech). To normalize lipid levels across samples, total protein concentrations were measured using the Roti-Nanoquant protein assay (Carl Roth GmbH), and lipid concentrations were expressed relative to total protein content. Comparisons were made between M β 2.4 Patch clamp Whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments were conducted on cells expressing mTRPV2, rTRPV2, and hTRPV2. Signals were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz and sampled at 2–10 kHz using an EPC10 USB HEKA amplifier (HEKA Elektronik) during these experiments. Patch pipettes had a resistance of 2.0–5.0 MΩ and were made from borosilicate glass tubes (TW150F-3; World Precision Instruments). Only cells with an initial series resistance <10 MOhm were used for experiments. No series resistance compensation was performed. The standard external solution contained (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl 2 2 2.5 Statistical analysis All data are presented as the mean ± SEM plus scatter plots. Box-and-whisker plots were used to visualize data distributions. Each box represents the interquartile range, spanning from the 25th to the 75th percentile, with the median (50th percentile) shown as a horizontal line. Whiskers extend to the 5th and 95th percentiles. Data points outside of this range are plotted individually. This definition of whiskers differs from Tukey’s 1.5× interquartile range method and was chosen to better represent the full range of typical values in the dataset. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad). Comparison between groups was determined using a 2-tailed 2-sample t-test or ANOVA with a post hoc Tukey test. The details of the tests and sample sizes for each experiment are provided in the figure legends.

Although the investigated residues are conserved in rTRPV2, mTRPV2, and even hTRPV2, 2 recent reports have presented data suggesting distinct and possibly species-specific mechanisms for 2-APB sensitivity. TRPV2 has been implicated in numerous pathophysiological processes, including heart failure and various cancers, with early studies demonstrating that TRPV2 modulators binding to the S4/S5 linker or the VBP can suppress glioblastoma progression or reduce prostate cancer metastasis. 12 , 16 , 18 Our findings suggest that the mechanisms that encode for 2-APB sensitivity in mTRPV2 and rTRPV2 are conserved, with no detectable species-specific differences at the predicted binding sites. However, a key difference between rTRPV2 and mTRPV2 is the 3-fold higher sensitivity of rTRPV2 (EC 50 μ μ 16 , 22 , 27 50 μ 25 , 37 25 , 38 39 40 41 We argue that our data are sufficient to support the assumption that 2-APB seems to bind to the S5 binding pocket to activate both rTRPV2 and mTRPV2. This is supported by our data showing that mutations of the S5 binding pocket reduce 2-APB sensitivity without reducing responses to CBD and probenecid. Although these results align with our originally proposed 2-APB binding site, subsequent reports from other groups have failed to confirm this site in both mTRPV2 and rTRPV2. 27 , 31 22 , 29 , 30 Our functional data neither confirm nor refute the proposed binding of 2-APB within the VBP. However, some observations allow us to be critical of this mechanism. First, our data clearly show that the general function of TRPV2 depends on a mechanism at the VBP, possibly related to lipid dynamics. All investigated VBP mutations predicted to have an impact on 2-APB sensitivity displayed reduced sensitivities to all 3 agonists or, in the case of the Q530A/Q525A mutants, increased sensitivities to all 3 agonists. Thus, the mutated residues have a strong global role for TRPV2 function, and not specifically for 2-APB sensitivity. Still, these data do not speak against the binding of 2-APB within the VBD. Second, Su et al 27 27 A coincidental observation in this study was the 3–4× fold increase in 2-APB sensitivity of the resiniferatoxin-sensitive rTRPV2 mutants rTRPV2-F472S/L510T and rTRPV2-F472S/L510T/Q530E, where the mutated residues were exchanged by the corresponding residues in TRPV1. 35 , 36 31 In conclusion, our data suggest that although there are differences between rTRPV2, mTRPV2, and hTRPV2 sensitivity to several stimuli, they likely share binding sites for 2-APB. Exploring species-specific differences like this is crucial for translational research, as it ensures that findings from model organisms can be accurately applied to human physiology. Although further studies on hTRPV2 are warranted, our findings may aid in the development of selective compounds targeting TRPV2. Conflicts of interest The authors declare no conflicts of interest.
