Introduction Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among men in North America [ 1 2 1 18 3 Currently, PCa screening relies on serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements and digital rectal examination (DRE), both of which have limited sensitivity and specificity [ 4 5 In this regard, a promising non-invasive approach to enhancing PCa screening across various stages is the use of targeted molecular imaging and radiotherapy through theranostics. These innovative agents combine diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities within a single molecule. Unlike traditional non-selective chemotherapy, theranostics enable precise identification of patients whose tumors express specific molecular targets, facilitating personalized treatment and predicting a more favorable response to radiation therapy [ 6 7 Peptide-activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are attractive biomarker targets for developing cancer theranostics due to their overexpression on cancer cell surfaces and their role in regulating key cellular processes critical for cancer, such as proliferation, apoptosis, migration, chemoresistance, angiogenesis, immune invasion, and metastasis [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 9 18 19 20 21 22 The main objectives of the study were to further investigate the clinical importance of B1R as a biomarker and therapeutic target for PCa using molecular profiling of relevant in vitro human PCa cell lines and clinical samples, and to evaluate the theranostic potential of a new radiopeptide targeting B1R for PCa detection and therapy. For this purpose, we employed our optimized lead peptide B1R antagonist, AcOrn[Oic 2 (αMe) d 7 8 9 23 24 25 26 64 1/2 + − 27 28 29 30 In this study, we present new evidence regarding the clinical utility of B1R as a biomarker for PCa therapy. We also demonstrate the efficacy of the newly designed B1R radioantagonist 64 2. Materials and Methods 2.1.

Tissue Microarray (TMA) Construction and Immunohistochemical (IHC) Analysis Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archived prostate specimens from patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2006 and 2011 at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke were used. Patients consented to participate and signed a consent form. The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Committee for the Use of Human Resected Material at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke (approval #10-017). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Human Ethics Committee at the Centre de Recherche du CHUS (Protocol #2013-490; 24 October 2012), Sherbrooke. Consent to use paraffin-embedded prostate tissue specimens for the current study was obtained through telephone interviews from all subjects or their families, with appropriate written documentation. For each prostate tissue, duplicate cores (1.5 mm diameter of both tumor primary pattern and secondary pattern as well as prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and normal prostate glandular tissues) were extracted from donor blocks and inserted into a new paraffin block. The nature of each core was confirmed by hematoxylin–eosin (H&E) staining and examined by an expert uropathologist (SG). One case of metastatic PCa obtained by fine needle aspiration of peripancreatic ganglia was also included in the study. TMA sections (4 µm) were deparaffinized and stained with the anti-B1R antibody LS-A799 (1:400) using a Dako streptavidin–biotin-based automated stainer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and counterstained with hematoxylin. Stained sections were scanned in brightfield using the Hamamatsu Nanozoomer 2.0-RS whole slide scanner (Hamamatsu Corporation, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) and images exported with Nanozoomer Digital Pathology (NDP) view 2 imaging software (version 2.6.13; Hamamatsu Corporation. Images were then analyzed by 2 independent observers (FC and SG) using a pre-established scale for staining evaluation (see Supplementary Figure S2 2.3. Fresh Tissue Dissection and RNA Isolation Prostate tissues used for RNA extraction were freshly (typically within 30 min) dissected from prostate specimens obtained from radical prostatectomies performed at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke. The tissues were frozen at −20 °C with OCT compound (Tissue-Tek; Miles Scientific, Elkhart, IN, USA). Sections of 5 µm were cut and fixed in formalin for H&E staining to enable pathological examination. Tumor regions were delineated along with adjacent non-cancerous tissues by a clinical pathologist, and dissection was performed accordingly. The dissected tissues were washed with nano-pure RNase-free water (Wisent Inc., Saint-Jean-Baptiste, QC, Canada) to remove any visible traces of the OCT compound. The tissues were then finely ground in liquid nitrogen, and RNA was extracted using QIAGEN RNeasy spin columns (QIAGEN, Toronto, ON, Canada) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity (200 ng total) was assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. 2.4. Expression and Survival from Databases Expression levels of BDKRB1 and survival data were retrieved using cBioportal in the datasets: TCGA Prostate Adenocarcinoma (Previously known as TCGA Provisional) and MSKCC Cancer Cell 2010 [ 34 2.5. Cell Cultures The PCa cell lines LNCaP (AR+/PSA+/p53wt), PC3 (AR-/PSA-/p53null), CWR22Rv1 (AR+/PSA+/p53mutated), and DU145 (AR-/PSA-/p53mutated) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). PCa cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Wisent Inc.) + 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Pen/Strep) and were maintained in a humidified 5% CO 2 ® 2.6. RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-Time PCR Analysis Total RNAs from human PCa cell lines and PCa tissues were isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Genomic DNA was removed from total RNA using RNase-Free DNase (Qiagen). RNA integrity was assessed with a TapeStation System (Agilent Technologies). Then, 0.5 to 2 µg of total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using Oligo-dT primers and Superscript III transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was conducted on a MX3005p Stratagene instrument (Agilent technologies) or on a CFX OPUS-384 system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with Brilliant III SYBR green (Agilent technologies). Primers used were B1R sense, 5′-CTTTTGGGAGGACTTCATTGAC-3′; antisense, 5′-GGGATGAAGATATTGGAGCAAG-3′; β-actin sense, 5′-GTTGCTATCCAGGCTGTGCTA- 3′; antisense, 5′-GCGGATGTCCACGTCACACTT-3′. Relative mRNA expression was analyzed with the comparative Ct method (2 −∆∆CT 2.7.

Ligand Competition Binding Assays Radiolabeled ligand competition binding assays were performed on HEK293 cells stably expressing hB1R or hB2R, as previously described [ 37 38 3 8 9 3 −11 −5 50 2.13. Generation of NFAT-eGFP Reporter Cells The pLenti-6V5-NFAT-eGFP vector was generated from the pSIRV-NFAT-eGFP vector (a gift from Peter Steinberger, Addgene plasmid #118031). Briefly, NFAT-eGFP gene was PCR amplified using the following primers: 5′-TTTTATCGATTCCTCTAGACTGCCGGATC-3′ and 5′-AAAACCGGTCGATCGACCACTGTGC-3′). The amplified gene was then ligated into the ClaI and AgeI restriction sites of the pLenti-6V5 vector. Lentiviruses were produced using the pLenti-6V5-NFAT-eGFP vector in HEK293T cells and used to transduce a hB1R-expressing CHO cell line, followed by selection with 10 µg/mL blasticidin. The stable cell population was treated with 1 μM of LysdesArg 9 41 42 2.14. NFAT-eGFP-Based Reporter Assays Fluorescence assays performed on CHO-hB1R-NFAT-eGFP cells. Target cells were plated at 10,000 cells/well in a 96-well microplate (opaque black wells with clear flat bottom, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) using RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). After 24 h, the medium was replaced by RPMI without FBS and phenol red. Cells were then stimulated with the B1R agonist LDBK at concentrations ranging from 1 pM to 10 μM at 37 °C/5% CO 2 50 9 50 42 Supplementary Table S2 50 50 2.15.

Discussion In this study, we demonstrated consistent expression of B1R transcripts across various cultured human PCa cell lines, CDX-derived xenografts implanted in nude mice, and resected human PCa tumor samples. Furthermore, B1R proteins were found to be overexpressed in primary PCa (and potentially in lymphatic metastases), with their expression significantly correlating with higher overall tumor grades. This observation was further validated through analyses of data from the TCGA and MSKCC databases, which also reveal that elevated B1R mRNA levels were associated with poor prognosis and reduced survival rates in PCa patients. Similarly, data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) show that high B1R mRNA levels were also linked to decreased survival in lung and kidney cancer patients (see Supplementary Figure S5 55 64 23 64 68 111 177 56 Recent advancements have been made in the development of B1R-targeted radiolabeled peptides for PET imaging of cancers (see an excellent review [ 57 57 68 18 68 18 3 2 57 111 58 57 58 In our study, we focused on a B1R-targeting theranostics based on the R954, which displays structural differences from the previously reported compounds, more specifically in the linker, chelator, and radionuclide.
