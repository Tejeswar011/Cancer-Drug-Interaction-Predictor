Introduction Parents and caregivers of children with medical complexity (CMC) face untenable levels of stress [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 2 7 8 9 10 11 3 12 3 13 4 14 7 15 16 1 17 18 Studies have shown the benefits of care coordination and patient-centered care for families with CMC. In NICU studies, healthcare workers attuned to supporting mothers’ needs while promoting collaborative decision-making during labor and delivery contribute positively to childbirth experiences [ 19 20 19 20 21 22 4 23 24 25 26 27 This study aimed to further explore how various factors such as resilience, coping, and support impacted well-being and trauma symptom severity in parents of CMC as further understanding could support interventions designed to reduce the impact of trauma and improve well-being and family functioning [ 26 28 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Procedure This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of [university name withheld for review] (HM20030584, approved 14 August 2024). Upon approval, all enrolled parents and caregivers of CMC in a complex care clinic at a MidAtlantic children’s hospital were recruited via email. Parents/caregivers were also recruited in person during clinic appointments by a research assistant. This study was funded by an internal university grant, and participants were offered a $30 gift card for the completion of the survey. Inclusion criteria included: age of 18+ of the parent and child enrolled in the complex care clinic, and English speaking. Consenting participants completed a battery of measures with a completion time of less than 20 min, and all surveys were collected with REDCap [ 29 30 Section 2.4 2.2. Participants The study includes 121 participants who are caregivers of children with medically complex needs. Participant demographic characteristics are presented in Table 1 n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n 2.3. Measures 2.3.1. Subjective Well-Being Subjective well-being (SWB) was measured using the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) [ 31 Strongly disagree Strongly agree 2.3.2. PTSD Symptom Severity The Structured Trauma-Related Experiences & Symptoms Screener (STRESS) [ 32 None Day Days Most Days 32 33 2.3.3. Resilience The Brief Resilience Scale (BRS) [ 34 strongly disagree strongly agree 35 2.3.4. Emotional Support Emotional Support was measured using the PROMIS Short Form v2.0—Emotional Support 4a [ 36 Never Always 36 2.3.5. Informational Support Informational Support was measured using the PROMIS Short Form v2.0—Informational Support 4a [ 37 Never Always 37 2.3.6. Adaptive Coping Adaptive Coping was measured using the Adaptive Coping subscale of the Coping Flexibility Scale [ 38 Not applicable Very applicable 38 2.4. Data Analysis All statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 29.0). Descriptive statistics were computed to obtain the means and standard deviations for all independent and dependent variables. Correlation analysis was used to examine the relationships among variables. A parallel mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro for SPSS (Version 4.0) [ 39 40 41 A total of 125 participants completed the survey. However, some participants had missing responses on one or more scales. Cases with more than 50% missing items on any scale were excluded from the analysis. For cases with less than 50% missing data on a given scale, missing values were replaced using mean imputation based on the available items within that scale. Because only a small amount of data was missing and there was no clear pattern, we assumed the data were Missing at Random (MAR), which made mean imputation appropriate. Approximately 1 to 3 cases were recovered per variable through this method. As a result, the number of valid cases slightly varied across measures (e.g., between 123 and 125). For the descriptive and parallel mediation analysis, only participants with complete data on all study variables were included, resulting in a final analytic sample of 121. Multivariate outliers were assessed using Mahalanobis distance, and none were identified. Multicollinearity was evaluated using variance inflation factors (VIFs) and tolerance values. All VIF values were below 4.0, and all tolerance values exceeded 0.20, indicating no issues with multicollinearity. 3. Results 3.1. Descriptive Statistics and Correlations Means, standard deviations, and the correlation matrix for variables in the hypothesized mediational model are shown in Table 2 Results from the correlational analysis indicated that PTSD symptom severity was significantly negatively associated with SWB (r = −0.33, p p p p p p p p p p p p p p 3.2. Parallel Mediation Analysis A parallel mediation analysis was computed to evaluate resilience, emotional support, informational support, and adaptive coping as mediators (Ms) in the relationship between PTSD symptom severity (X) and SWB (Y). A graphical representation of this model and information on the standardized path coefficients is presented in Figure 1 3.2.1. Total Effect As can be observed in Figure 1 p 3.2.2. Direct Effects The relationship between PTSD symptom severity and each of the mediators was assessed. PTSD symptom severity was directly, negatively related to resilience [a 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 p 1 p 3 p 2 p 4 p p 3.2.3. Indirect Effects The mediation was tested by estimating the indirect effects of PTSD symptoms severity on SWB through resilience, emotional support, informational support, and adaptive coping. Specific indirect effects were considered statistically significant if the bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals (CIs) for the products of these paths did not include zero [ 39 4. Discussion This study examined how resilience, perceived support, and adaptive coping mediate the relationship between PTSD symptom severity and subjective well-being in caregivers of CMC. The findings revealed that informational support and resilience significantly mediated this relationship, suggesting that caregivers who report higher levels of these protective factors tend to experience greater well-being despite the presence of trauma symptoms. These mediating mechanisms represent modifiable targets for intervention, especially critical for caregivers who often face high levels of stress and uncertainty. Informational support refers to access to useful, accurate, and timely information that helps caregivers manage care-related stressors, such as learning facts about their child’s condition, receiving guidance from trusted professionals, or connecting with others who have navigated similar challenges [ 36 In practice, informational support may be offered through structured communication tools like care binders, electronic portals, and individualized health education resources [ 43 44 45 46 47 48 12 49 25 Although both informational and emotional support were positively correlated with well-being, only informational support significantly mediated the relationship between PTSD symptoms severity and subjective well-being in this study. While emotional support includes empathy, compassion, and feeling understood by others, informational support provides more concrete, action-oriented guidance that may be especially helpful when caregivers are trying to make decisions, plan for care, or cope with crises. These results may indicate that the ability to access and apply helpful information is more immediately protective in the context of caregiving stress. The difference may also be explained by theoretical frameworks. According to Lazarus and Folkman’s (1984) transactional model of stress and coping, informational support aligns more closely with problem-focused coping, helping individuals assess, plan, and take action, whereas emotional support is aligned with emotion-focused coping, which may be more beneficial when stressors are less controllable [ 50 51 52 When conducting care coordination plans, providers must also consider the significant role of factors such as cultural background, language preferences, perception of health outcomes, and the method of communicating information. Consideration of cultural values has been found to be important in relation to information needs, level of honesty in communication, and concordance between patient and provider values [ 53 54 55 56 57 57 54 58 In addition to informational support, resilience significantly mediated the relationship between PTSD symptom severity and subjective well-being. This finding highlights the role of resilience as a protective factor that may help caregivers of CMC manage psychological stress. Often defined as the ability to adapt and recover from adversity, resilience can enable caregivers to reframe challenges, maintain motivation, and stay engaged in their caregiving roles, even when faced with trauma-related symptoms. While some aspects of resilience may be innate, it is widely understood as a quality that can be strengthened. Interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness, narrative-based approaches, and positive psychology practices have shown promise in enhancing resilience in parent and caregiver populations [ 59 60 Although emotional support and adaptive coping were positively correlated with well-being, neither significantly mediated the relationship between PTSD symptoms and well-being in this study. One possible explanation is the high degree of overlap between emotional and informational support, which may have introduced shared variance and reduced the unique effect of emotional support. Another interpretation is that certain forms of support may be more effective than others in managing trauma-related stress. While emotional support offers general comfort and validation, informational support and resilience may more directly influence caregivers’ perceptions of control and capacity to manage the demands of complex medical care. Similarly, the non-significant finding for adaptive coping may reflect variability in how caregivers interpret or apply coping strategies under conditions of chronic and prolonged stress. Finally, the continued significance of the direct effect between PTSD symptom severity and subjective well-being suggests that other contributing factors were not captured in the current model. Recent studies point to a range of psychological and contextual influences that may also shape caregiver well-being. Caregiver burden has been consistently linked to emotional strain, with many caregivers reporting ongoing fatigue, role conflict, and reduced quality of life [ 61 62 63 64 65 Limitations This study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings. First, the cross-sectional design limits the ability to make causal inferences. Although mediation analysis was used to examine potential pathways, the data do not establish the temporal ordering of variables. Second, the single-informant data were based entirely on caregiver self-report, which may introduce response biases such as recall errors or the tendency to respond in socially desirable ways. This is particularly important when measuring sensitive constructs like PTSD symptoms and well-being. Third, the sample was drawn from a single tertiary care center, which may limit generalizability. The demographic composition of the sample may not reflect the broader population of caregivers of children with medical complexity, especially in terms of racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic diversity. Finally, while the study focused on several important protective and supportive factors, it is likely that other relevant variables, such as caregiver burden, sleep quality, financial stress, or access to respite and mental healthcare, also contribute to caregiver well-being. These factors were not captured in the present analysis and should be considered in future research. 5. Conclusions Providers of families with CMC can benefit from the outcomes of this mediation analysis. Resilience and well-being can be fostered and improved through the delivery of collaborative and intentional informational support. Parents and caregivers of CMC often provide a significant amount of healthcare within the family context. When provided the opportunity to learn from and with healthcare providers, this can serve as a highly effective coping strategy to bolster well-being and foster resilience. This study serves to support the ongoing developments in collaborative, patient-centered care models for CMC and provides support for an increase in integrated care clinics that serve CMC and their families.
