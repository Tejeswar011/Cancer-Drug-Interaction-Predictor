Little is known about whether continuous Medicaid coverage pre- through post-diagnosis (versus gaining Medicaid at/after diagnosis) provides survival benefits for pediatric/adolescent oncology patients. Methods: We identified patients newly diagnosed with cancer at age 21 or younger in a large pediatric health system between 2007–2016. Electronic medical records (EMR) were linked to Medicaid administrative data to differentiate insurance continuity patterns during the six months preceding through the six months following cancer diagnosis (assessment window): continuous Medicaid, newly gained Medicaid (at or after diagnosis), and other Medicaid enrollment patterns. For patients not linked to Medicaid data, we used EMR-reported insurance types at diagnosis. We followed patients from six months post-diagnosis up to five years, death, or December 2020, whichever came first. Multivariable regressions estimated all-cause and cancer-specific survival, controlling for sociodemographic and cancer-related factors. Results: Over two-thirds of the 1,800 patients (1,293, 71.8%) had some Medicaid enrollment during the assessment window; among these, 47.6% had continuous Medicaid and 36.3% had newly gained Medicaid. Patients not linked with Medicaid data had private (26.9%) or other/no insurance (1.2%) at diagnosis. Compared to patients with continuous Medicaid, those with newly gained Medicaid had higher risks of all-cause death (hazard ratio [HR]=1.41, 95% CI=1.10–1.81, p p Conclusion: Continuous Medicaid coverage throughout cancer diagnosis is associated with survival benefits for pediatric/adolescent patients. This finding has critical implications as millions of Americans have been losing coverage under the unwinding of the Medicaid Continuous Enrollment Provision. Précis: This study examined the association of Medicaid enrollment patterns with overall and cancer-specific 5-year survival in a cohort of patients newly diagnosed with pediatric and adolescent cancer in a large pediatric health system in Georgia. Continuous Medicaid coverage throughout a cancer diagnosis is significantly associated with survival benefits for pediatric and adolescent patients; however, less than half of Medicaid-insured patients had continuous coverage.
