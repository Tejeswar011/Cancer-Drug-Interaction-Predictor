Therefore, the availability of such a catalytic complex to a broader community is an absolutely vital step for dissemination of the groundbreaking SABRE methodology. The most common SABRE catalyst, which is activated in situ, is based on Ir-IMes system (IMes = 1,3-Bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazol-2-ylidene). Earlier approaches for the synthesis of this catalyst often relied on specialized equipment and were limited to a comparatively small scale. This, in turn, increased the barrier of entry for new scientists to the area of SABRE hyperpolarization. Here, we present a robust, inexpensive, and easy to reproduce synthetic procedure for the preparation of this SABRE catalyst, which does not require specialized inert atmosphere equipment like a glove box or Schlenk line. The synthesis was validated on the scale of several grams vs. tens of milligrams scale in the reported approaches. The resulting SABRE catalyst, [Ir(IMes)(COD)Cl], was activated in situ and further evaluated in hyperpolarization experiments resulting in signal enhancements comparable to (or higher than) those for the catalyst prepared using Schlenk line equipment. hyperpolarization parahydrogen SABRE NMR spectroscopy iridium Russian Science Foundation 25-13-00053 Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation NSF CHE-2404387 CHE-2404388 NIH NIBIB R01 EB034197 NIH R21 EB033872 DOE DE-SC0025315 Wayne State University University of Mainz (GE) subaward 442287 South Dakota Mines startup South Dakota Mines (Nelson Research Grant) NSF 2404388 O.G.S. and I.V.K. thank the Russian Science Foundation (grant 25-13-00053) for the support of the data analysis and writing and editing of the manuscript draft, and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation for the access to NMR equipment.

Introduction Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques are used for a broad range of applications, such as structural characterization of chemicals and biomolecules, quantitative analysis, metabolomics, materials science, preclinical studies, and clinical diagnostics. However, the sensitivity of these techniques is inherently low, as the thermal polarization of nuclear spins is on the order of 10 −4 −5 1 2 3 4 5 6 3 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 13 7 8 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 In the pursuit of affordable hyperpolarization techniques, PHIP and SABRE stand out as they operate without the need for strong magnetic fields, cryogenic temperatures of several kelvin, or high-frequency microwaves to generate strong signals on heteronuclei [ 1 p 2 2 I p 2 27 28 29 p 2 p 2 p 2 3 5 30 31 32 33 34 p 2 35 p 2 p 2 36 p 2 Figure 1 p 2 37 38 The remaining barrier for SABRE methodology is the availability of a suitable polarization transfer catalyst (PTC) for efficient spin order transfer. A typical SABRE catalyst comprises an Ir complex, [Ir(NHC)(COD)Cl], where NHC is an N-heterocyclic carbene ligand [ 39 2 3 + 2 2 40 41 p 2 Figure 1 42 43 31 44 45 46 Of note, [Ir(IMes)(COD)Cl] SABRE catalyst is currently not readily commercially available and needs to be synthesized on demand, typically from [Ir(COD)(μ-Cl)] 2 Figure 2 47 48 3 + 49 39 1 31 50 31 Figure 2 Scheme of the reported routes of [Ir(IMes)(COD)Cl] SABRE catalyst synthesis. The corresponding reaction conditions and yields are presented in Table 1 molecules-30-03837-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Summary of the reported syntheses of [Ir(IMes)(COD)Cl] SABRE catalyst.

Later, it was proposed to replace IMes with its corresponding hydrochloride (IMes·HCl) and to add K 2 3 Figure 2 45 51 51 2 52 This work addresses this remaining challenge by providing an easy-to-follow large-scale synthesis of the [Ir(IMes)(COD)Cl] catalyst typically employed in the SABRE process. The presented synthetic protocol does not demand specialized equipment and is based on a less expensive protonated IMes·HCl ligand. Due to simplicity, it is suitable for a greater science community outside of synthetic chemistry circles. The SABRE performance of the prepared material was shown to be similar to that of [Ir(IMes)(COD)Cl] synthesized using literature protocols [ 48 2. Results and Discussion IMes·HCl hydrochloride is typically ca. 2 times less expensive than the neutral IMes ligand. More importantly, “Route B” does not require a glove box, and it is tolerant to commercial solvents and atmospheric conditions (to some extent). Therefore, we set ourselves to optimize “Route B” approach for the affordable large-scale synthesis of [Ir(IMes)(COD)Cl]. Our initial inclination was to simply scale up the synthesis described in the references [ 51 52 Figure 2 Table 2 It is well known that the rate of an average chemical reaction expedites ~2 times with every 10 °C reaction temperature increase. The reverse of this empirical law is true as well. Thus, we decided to conduct the reaction at room temperature, drastically simplifying the synthetic setup used in the process. Consequentially, such simplification came at the expense of comparatively long reaction time. Thus, the reaction was conducted in acetone at the typical scale based on Ir starting material (4.0 g of [Ir(COD)(μ-Cl)] 2 Table 2 1 Figure S1 1 Next, we further experimented with reaction time and reagent concentrations. A longer reaction time seemingly resulted in a slightly higher overall yield ( Table 2 Table 2 Table 2 Figure S2 51 52 2 Figure S3 Acetonitrile was the next obvious choice of solvent stable under the reaction conditions. It is expected because acetonitrile is an aprotic solvent with an even higher dielectric constant compared to acetone (36.6 vs. ~21 for acetone). Thus, we expected that acetonitrile would allow us to conduct the preparation process in a manner similar to the acetone-based procedure described above. First, acetonitrile was used under standard conditions ( Table 2 Table 2 Table 2 Figure S4 Figure S5 Figure S6 Figure S6 Figure S2 Table 2 Afterward, we experimented with the slight excess of the iridium precursor, [Ir(COD)(μ-Cl)] 2 1 2 Table 2 2 2 Table 2 Table 2 Table 2 Table 2 51 Table 2 The performance of the synthesized SABRE catalyst (a combined mixture of all fractions, Table 2 48 53 13 Figure S7 13 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 13 13 60 66 67 68 69 13 Figure 3 13 Figure 3 Table S1 13 48 Figure 3 Table S2 65 T b T 1 Figure 3 Tables S1 and S3 48 Figure 3 Tables S2 and S4 48 3. Materials and Methods Dichloromethane and bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)diiridium(I) dichloride were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Acetone, acetonitrile, and chloroform-D with TMS were procured from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). 1,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazolium chloride was purchased from STREM Chemicals (Newburyport, MA, USA). Silica Flash was purchased from Silicycle (Quebec City, QC, Canada). NMR analysis was conducted on a 60 MHz 1 3.1. General Synthesis Procedure In order to better illustrate the entire preparation process for the broader scientific community, each step of the process is shown schematically in Figure 4 Table 2 Figure 4 Figure 4 ® Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 ® Figure 4 Table 2 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure S5 Figure 4 Figure 4 Table 2 Figure 4 Figure 4 Table 2 3.2. SABRE-SHEATH Hyperpolarization Experiments [1- 13 4 13 13 70 2 2 13 p 2 13 p 2 4. Conclusions In this work, we present a new variant of the procedure for the preparation of SABRE catalyst [Ir(IMes)(COD)Cl] on a previously unprecedented scale, multigram per batch (50 g in total over ten batches). The developed approach is robust, and the synthesis procedure can be performed in practically any “wet” laboratory, which may lack advanced equipment such as a glove box or even access to inert gases. In addition, IMes·HCl ligand is significantly less expensive than its “free” form IMes, lowering the overall cost of the process. We also addressed the issue of ecological regulations by developing a DCM-free version of this synthetic methodology. While the methodology described here has some room for improvement in terms of yields, it drastically lowers the entry barrier to the area of NMR hyperpolarization for anyone wishing to join this exciting area of science.
