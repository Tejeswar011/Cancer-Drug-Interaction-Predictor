Introduction Cross-sex hormone therapy (CSHT) plays an essential role in managing gender dysphoria among transgender population. However, our understanding of the impact of CSHT on cardiovascular health of the transgender population remains limited [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A CAS rat model treated with estrogen may serve as a valuable model of MtF transition for elucidating the mechanisms underlying altered metabolic function. In the current study, we hypothesized that treatment with 17β-estradiol (E 2 2 10 2 White adipose tissue (WAT) is one of the key organs involved in insulin-mediated glucose uptake [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 2 In addition to ERα and ERβ, G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER or GPR30) has been detected on the aortic endothelial and smooth muscle cells [ 17 18 19 20 2 21 22 23 24 24 25 26 27 28 2 2 2.

Discussion This study demonstrates that E 2 In the current study, our data shows that castration did not affect body weight and vWAT weight, as no differences in these parameters were observed between CAS + PL and intact male rats ( Table 2 36 37 2 Table 2 2 38 39 2 Table 2 40 Estrogen has also been implicated in reducing muscle weight; for example, Ikeda et al. demonstrated decrease in both soleus and gastrocnemius muscles in estrogen-treated male mice [ 41 2 42 2 Table 2 2 Figure 1 2 2 42 2 2 Estrogen treatment has been shown to enhance insulin-mediated glycemic control by activating the ERα-Akt-Glut-4 signaling pathway in WAT in both rodents and humans [ 14 43 14 2 Figure 2 Figure 3 2 2 Prior studies have demonstrated that both ERα and ERβ are expressed in insulin-sensitive tissues, with ERα being more predominant in adipose tissue and implicated in metabolic regulation [ 44 45 15 16 Supplementary Figure S1 In the current study, although the plasma HDL level was significantly higher in CAS + E 2 Table 2 2 46 47 48 49 3 8 47 50 51 52 53 54 2 Endothelial dysfunction is widely recognized as a critical early event in the development of vascular dysfunction and CVD.

The relatively small sample sizes for the Western blot analyses may have limited our ability to detect modest changes in protein expression; thus, future studies with larger cohorts will be important to strengthen these molecular findings. Another limitation of our study design is the absence of an Intact Male + E 2 2 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Chemicals All Chemicals were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and dissolved in water unless indicated otherwise. 4.2. Experimental Animals 8-week-old castrated (CAS) male Sprague Dawley (SD) and age-matched intact male rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, USA) and housed in the animal facility at the University of the Pacific. After 1–2 weeks of acclimatization, the CAS rats were subcutaneously implanted either with placebo (PL) or 1.5 mg 17β-estradiol (E 2 The rats were housed in a vivarium with controlled humidity and temperature at the University of the Pacific. They were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle and provided with ad libitum access to water and standard rodent chow (Mazuri rodent chow). All animal study related protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of the Pacific and complied with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals: Eighth Edition [Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, 21R01). The animals were euthanized using carbon dioxide (CO 2 The intra-abdominal visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) was collected from both the mesenteric depot (surrounding the small intestine and its vasculature) and the omental depot (greater omentum), following the careful removal of the mesenteric arterial cascade. Both depots were combined for total vWAT weight measurements. The ratio of vWAT weight to total body weight was then calculated, with the results expressed as the percentage of vWAT weight relative to the total body weight. 4.3. Measurement of Metabolic Parameters in Blood and Plasma The glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed before sacrificing the animals. Briefly, the rats were fasted overnight. Next morning, blood was collected via a tail nick to assess the fasting blood glucose using a standard glucometer (OneTouch UltraMin). Glucose solution (2 g/Kg body weight) was then injected intraperitoneally, and blood glucose level was measured at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min. At the time of sacrifice, blood obtained by intra-cardiac puncture was used to measure non-fasting blood glucose using OneTouch UltraMin, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level using A1cNow kit (PTS diagnostics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Additionally, for collection of plasma, blood was taken in tubes containing anticoagulants (heparin and sodium citrate), centrifuged at 10,000× g 2 4.4. Measurement of Aortic Tension The thoracic aortas were excised, cleaned of adhering connective tissue, and cut into 2 mm rings. Isometric tension was measured by suspending the rings horizontally between two stainless steel hooks in separate organ baths, each containing 20 mL of Krebs buffer (in mM: 119 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.18 KH 2 4 4 3 2 2 2 80 10 4.4.1. Measurement of Aortic Relaxation EDV was measured in PE (2 µM) precontracted aortas. The ACh concentrations used to generate the relaxation curves were determined based on the standard protocol previously reported by our group [ 10 29 76 −8 −5 −9 −5 4.4.2. Measurement of Aortic Contraction First the CRC to PE (10 −8 −5 Figure 8 Supplementary Figure S2 4.5. Western Blot Analysis The harvested tissue samples such as subcutaneous white adipose tissue (ScWAT) and aorta collected after euthanizing the animals were flash-frozen by liquid nitrogen and saved at −80 °C for later analysis. We used T-PER tissue dissociation buffer (#78510, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitor cocktail for protein extraction from the tissues. First, tissues were taken in M-tubes (#130096335, Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch, Germany) containing the buffer cocktail and then the tubes were placed on the gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch, Germany). Next, the protein extraction protocol was selected from the menu and after 1 min, the blended tissue was centrifuged at 15,000× g A55861 The host species for all the primary antibodies was rabbits. Antibodies were diluted with commercially available antibody diluent (#927-65001, LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) and the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies for Akt (#9272), p-Akt (Ser473) (#4060), eNOS (#32027), p-eNOS (Ser1177) (#9571), vinculin (#4650), β-Actin (#4970) and GAPDH (#2118) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA). Antibodies against ERα (#ab32063), ERβ (#ab3576) and Glut-4 (#ab654) were obtained from Abcam (Waltham, MA, USA) and antibodies against GPR30 (#PA5-28647) and iNOS (#PA1-036) were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). 1:1000 dilution was used for all primary antibodies except ERα (1:500), ERβ (1:300), GPR30 (1:500), p-Akt (1:500), p-eNOS (1:300), β-Actin (1:4000) and GAPDH (1:10,000). Evaluation of targets (Akt and p-Akt and eNOS and p-eNOS) was performed on the same gel and membrane to ensure accurate detection and measurement of phosphorylated and total protein. After incubation with primary antibody, the membranes were washed 3–4 times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with IRDye 680 Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG secondary antibody (dilution 1:10,000; LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). Finally, after removing the secondary antibody, membranes were washed again 3–4 times and bands were detected using the LI-COR Odyssey M imaging system (Serial Number #ODM-0412, LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). The bands were quantified by densitometry using LI-COR Image Studio Lite software v5.2 (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA). To confirm the uniformity of protein loading, membranes were incubated with vinculin, β-Actin or GAPDH antibodies for the detection of housekeeping proteins. Then, the target protein bands were normalized to the respective housekeeping protein levels and expressed as fold changes compared to the other groups. The full blot images are shown in Supplementary Figures S3 and S4 4.6. Statistical Analysis The data was analyzed with GraphPad Prism v10.4.0. (GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and is presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). A one-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the group means (e.g., metabolic parameters, R max 2 Relaxation responses to agonists (ACh and SNP) were calculated as the percent (%) relaxation from the maximum PE (2 μM) contraction at each concentration. To calculate the sensitivity to the agonist [pD 2 50 50 max max To compare the ACh CRC before and after inhibitor treatment within each group, a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures, followed by Tukey’s post hoc test was applied. On the other hand, a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures, followed by Šídák’s post hoc test was used for comparison of PE CRC before and after L-NAME treatment in the presence of Indo within each group. The two variables were agonist concentration and pre- and post-inhibitor treatment. The agonist concentration was considered as the repeated-measure factor. The ΔAUC (AUC, area under the curve) represents the difference between two CRC, comparing the absence and presence of inhibitors. It was measured to determine the relative contribution of different endothelium-derived relaxing factors (EDRF) to ACh-induced vasorelaxation or production of endothelial NO during smooth muscle contraction to PE. 4.7. Database and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria We used PubMed and Google Scholar for our database search. For inclusion and exclusion criteria, only studies with consistent strain, age, sex, surgical technique, drug, dose, and treatment duration were included, while animals showing signs of illness were excluded. Endothelial function was confirmed by ACh (10 μM)-induced relaxation of PE (2 μM)-precontracted vessels. Overall, explicit attention to randomization and blinding has strengthened the internal validity of the present study.
