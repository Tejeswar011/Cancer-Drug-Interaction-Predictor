Highlights • Dual-purpose prognostic model: A novel KRAS-G12D-associated coagulation gene (KMCG) signature (PLCG2/MAPK12/C4B) stratifies CRC patients into high-risk groups with reduced survival (HR=3.44), elevated thrombotic risk, and enhanced immunotherapy sensitivity, integrating thrombogenesis and tumor progression prognostication. • Mechanistic dualism of KRAS-G12D: The mutation drives both cancer metastasis and thrombosis via MAPK/ERK pathway activation, inducing platelet hyperactivation, endothelial procoagulant transformation, and increased VTE incidence (clinically validated by elevated D-dimer levels). • Therapeutic axis validation: MAPK/ERK inhibition (U0126) concurrently attenuates thrombosis and metastasis in vivo, identifying a dual-targetable pathway to manage thrombotic complications and malignant progression in KRAS-mutant CRC. Objective KRAS mutations occur in nearly 50 % of colorectal cancer (CRC) cases, with G12D representing the most frequent variant. While CRC is recognized as a moderate risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), the thrombogenic potential of KRAS-G12D mutations remains poorly understood. Methods We established a KRAS-G12D-associated coagulation gene (KMCG) prognostic model through integrative analysis of clinical data from CRC patients. Mechanistic investigations combining in vitro and in vivo models revealed that KRAS-G12D potentiates thrombotic risk through MAPK/ERK pathway activation. Results Integrating TCGA data, we constructed a KRAS-G12D-associated coagulation gene (PLCG2/MAPK12/C4B)-based prognostic model, where high-risk patients exhibited significantly reduced overall survival (HR=3.44) and superior 1-year AUC (0.718). Mechanistic profiling revealed high-risk enrichment in coagulation cascades, MAPK signaling, and immune infiltration, coupled with elevated tumor mutational burden (TMB) and immunotherapy sensitivity. Clinical validation confirmed KRAS-G12D mutation markedly increased D-dimer levelsand VTE incidence. Functional studies demonstrated mutant-driven platelet hyperactivation via MAPK/ERK pathway activation, evidenced by elevated aggregation rates and procoagulant endothelial transformation. In vivo, MAPK/ERK inhibitor U0126 attenuated thrombosis and metastasis, validating the pathway’s dual role in thrombogenesis and tumor progression. Conclusion Our findings establish KMCG as a novel biomarker integrating thrombotic risk and tumor progression, while mechanistically linking KRAS-G12D-driven MAPK activation to both cancer metastasis and thrombosis. This dual regulatory axis provides therapeutic targets for simultaneously managing thrombotic complications and malignant progression in KRAS-mutant CRC.

While CRC itself moderately increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), KRAS mutations further elevate this risk (HR=2.21, 95 % CI:1.08-4.53) [ 7 8 [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] 15 16 KRAS oncoproteins regulate key signaling cascades such as MAPK and PI3K-AKT, which influence both tumor growth and platelet activation [ 17 18 This study addresses these gaps through three integrated approaches: First, we develop a KRAS-G12D-specific coagulation gene (KMCG) signature using multi-omics integration. Second, we validate KMCG’s prognostic utility across clinical endpoints including overall survival (OS), chemotherapy response, and immunotherapy sensitivity. Third, using experimental models, we demonstrate that KRAS-G12D drives thrombotic risk via MAPK-mediated platelet activation and a hypercoagulable state. Our results establish KRAS-G12D as a key molecular node linking tumor progression and thrombosis, providing a precision medicine strategy for co-targeting oncogenic and thrombotic pathways in CRC. Materials and methods Data resources and clinical cohorts Clinical data including annotations, prognostic records, and RNA-seq profiles for CRC were acquired from TCGA (44 normal/571 tumor samples), complemented by somatic mutation data. External validation utilized GEO dataset GSE69164 Identification of KRAS G12D mutation coagulation genes (KMCG) and prognostic modeling Coagulation-related genes were curated from KEGG pathways (hsa04610, complement and coagulation cascade; hsa04611, platelet activation). Using limma package, we identified KRAS-G12D-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (|log2FC|>1, FDR < 0.05) between mutation subgroups. Intersection analysis yielded 10 KMCGs functionally linked to thrombosis. Expression profiles of 10 KMCGs were integrated from 352 CRC samples with complete clinical/OS data, randomly divided 1:1 into training/test cohorts. The training set underwent univariate Cox, LASSO, and multivariate Cox regression to identify prognostic KMCGs, generating a risk score: risk score = ∑ i = 1 n c o e f ( K M C G i ) * e x p ( K M C G i ) Functional enrichment and immune infiltration analysis Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was employed to identify enriched biological pathways. ssGSEA assessed immune cell and function enrichment. The immune score, stromal score, and tumor purity for each sample were calculated using the ESTIMATE algorithm. TMB and microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis TMB was calculated using the ‘maftools’ R package. Kaplan-Meier analysis compared survival differences between risk groups with varying TMB status. The proportions of microsatellite stability (MSS), high MSI (MSI-H) and low MSI (MSI-L) were compared between different groups. Chemotherapy drug sensitivity assessment To evaluate the efficacy of different chemotherapy drugs across risk scores and clusters, the ‘pRRophetic’ package was used to calculate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for 198 commonly used chemotherapy drugs, such as Gefitinib and Bicalutamide. Definition of VTE and D-Dimer The definition of VTE: Deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities confirmed by color doppler ultrasonography or pulmonary artery embolism confirmed by CT angiography of the pulmonary arteries. The definition of elevated D-dimer: Serum D-dimer levels exceeding the normal value (550 μg/l); Significantly elevated D-dimer: Exceeding the normal value by more than three times (>1650 μg/l). Construction of KRAS G12D CRC cell line Shanghai Zorin Biotech generated KRAS knockdown vectors (shRNA sequences: h-KRAS-sh1: GAGGGCTTTCTTTGTGTATTT; h-KRAS-sh2: CAGTTGAGACCTT CTAATTGG) for stable HT29 cell line establishment. Using wild-type KRAS overexpression plasmids (Beijing TransGen Biotech’s Fast Mutagenesis System), KRAS G12D mutant plasmids were PCR-amplified with primers (forward: 5′-GAAGATCTACCATGACTGAATATAAACTTGTGGTAGTTGGAGCTGATGGCG-3′; reverse: 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTTACATAATTACACA-3′). Lentivirus carrying the mutation was transfected into knockdown HT29 cells. Successfully engineered KRAS G12D HT29 clones were cryopreserved for downstream studies. Hematoxylin (HE) and eosin and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining Tissue embedding, fixation, sectioning, and HE staining were performed by Shanghai Servicebio Technology Co., Ltd. IHC was conducted using kits from Zhongshan Golden Bridge Biotechnology Co., Ltd. Antigen retrieval was done with citrate buffer or EDTA retrieval solution. The antibodies were anti-CD31 (Abcam, USA) and anti-Ki67 (Abcam, USA). IHC scoring followed previously described methods [ 19 Western blot Proteins were extracted from cells, and mixed with SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer (Beyotime, China). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, MA). Membranes were blocked with NcmBlot blocking buffer (NCM, China), then incubated overnight with primary antibodies at 4°C. Primary antibodies were KRAS rabbit mAb (Abclonal, China), pERK1/2 rabbit pAb (Abclonal, China), anti-ERK1/2-antibody (Abcam, USA), GAPDH (Proteintech, USA). Protein detection was performed using ECL reagent (Tanon, China). Platelet count and function testing Blood was collected from the mouse abdominal aorta and centrifuged. Serum was collected and stored at -80°C. Platelet function, including thromboelastography, was assessed by the Clinical Laboratory of Shanghai General Hospital. ELISA TF, PS, thrombomodulin (TM) in serum were quantified using ELISA kits: TF (WEIAOBIO, China), PS (WEIAOBIO, China), TM (WEIAOBIO, China). CCK-8 cell proliferation, cell plate colony formation, and scratch assay Log-phase cells were trypsinized, resuspended, and seeded into 96-well (CCK-8 assay) or 6-well plates (colony formation: 200 cells/well). For viability, CCK-8 reagent (Beyotime, China) was added at 24/48/96 h, incubated for 2 h, and absorbance measured at 450 nm. Colonies were fixed (4 % PFA, 15 min), stained (0.1 % crystal violet), and quantified after 14–21 days. For migration, confluent monolayers were scratched with pipette tips, washed, and wound closure tracked in serum-free medium at 0/48/96 h. Transwell assay Matrigel was diluted in serum-free medium, coated onto transwell inserts, and polymerized at 37°C for 2 h. Chambers were blocked with serum-free medium (100 µL, 30 min). Log-phase cells were trypsinized, counted, resuspended, and seeded (100 µL/insert). Post-incubation, non-migratory cells were removed. Membranes were fixed (4 % PFA, 20 min), stained (0.1 % crystal violet, 30 min), washed, and imaged. Invaded cells were quantified in 5 random fields/membrane. VTE model construction in vivo Mice were anesthetized and disinfected. A midline laparotomy exposed the inferior vena cava, ligated below renal veins with 6-–0 suture around a 30-gauge needle. Needle removal created ∼90 % stenosis to induce stasis. Post-thrombosis, thrombi and serum were collected before euthanasia. Subcutaneous tumor model in nude mice and intraperitoneal metastasis model Select SPF-grade male nude mice, 6-8 weeks old, weighing 20-–30 g. Digest, centrifuge, and count tumor cells in the logarithmic growth phase. Anesthetize and immobilize the mice, disinfect the injection site, and subcutaneously inject 1 × 10^7 tumor cells/100 μl using an insulin syringe into the left axilla without leakage. Record tumor growth, including volume and weight, every 3 days. Euthanize the animals and abtain the tumors. Log-phase cells (∼90 % confluent) were trypsinized, PBS-washed, resuspended, and counted. Mice received 100 µL cell suspension (5 × 10⁶ cells) via left lower abdominal injection. Body weight/tumor growth were monitored triweekly. After 4 weeks, mice were euthanized; necropsy assessed metastasis. Tissues were photographed and formalin-fixed. Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using R v4.1.2 and Strawberry Perl v5.3.0. Clinical analyses employed SPSS 26.0, and visualization used GraphPad Prism 9.0. Continuous variables were compared via Student’s t Results Construction and validation of a KRAS mutation-associated coagulation-related prognostic model in CRC The study design is illustrated in Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Workflow overview and expression patterns of KMCGs in CRC. ( A B C D E Fig 1 In the TCGA database, mutation data of the KRAS gene system were obtained, and 227 CRC samples with KRAS mutations were analyzed for their mutation types. It was found that G12D had the highest mutation frequency (28.19 %, 64 cases), followed by G12V (22.91 %) and G13D (18.50 %) ( Fig.1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Stratification by median risk score distinguished high- and low-risk groups across all cohorts. Survival analysis demonstrated significantly worse OS in high-risk patients ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Prognostic stratification and clinical utility of the KMCG risk model. Survival analysis comparing high- versus low-risk groups in the training cohort ( A B C D E F G H I J K L Fig 2 KMCG risk scores model links thrombotic risk, immune activation, and chemosensitivity in CRC Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significantly inferior OS in high-risk patients with advanced disease (T3–4, N1–2, M1, or stage III-IV) compared to their low-risk counterparts ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 + Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 GSE69164 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Clinical relevance of the KMCG risk model in CRC: associations with clinicopathological features, survival outcomes, and tumor mutational burden ( A, B C D E F G, H GSE69164 Fig 3 KRAS G12D mutations and metastasis drive hypercoagulability in CRC The cohort (N=322) was stratified by preoperative D-dimer levels: normal (≤550 μg/L, 56.8 %), moderately elevated (551-1650 μg/L, 33.9 %), and markedly elevated (>1650 μg/L, 9.3 %). VTE incidence progressively increased across these strata ( Table 1 Fig. 4 Table 1 The Relationship between Elevated D-Dimer Levels and the Occurrence of VTE.

( A B Fig 4 Comparative analysis revealed distinct D-dimer patterns: pT4 tumors exhibited higher concentrations (892±1072 vs 660±778 μg/L, p=0.025) and elevated frequency (51.4 % vs 35.0 %, p=0.003) versus pT0–3. Similarly, pN2 status correlated with increased D-dimer levels (954±949 vs 708±920 μg/L, p=0.047) and prevalence (54.1 % vs 38.3 %, p=0.029). Metastatic disease demonstrated the most pronounced hypercoagulability (elevated D-dimer: 73.2 % vs 32.1 %, p < 0.001; levels: 1162±1205 vs 658±904 μg/L, p < 0.001). While mucinous/signet-ring carcinomas showed comparable D-dimer levels to adenocarcinomas (p>0.2), vascular invasion (p=0.001) and KRAS G12D mutation (954±1244 vs 574±533 μg/L, p=0.001; elevated frequency p=0.002) significantly predicted coagulopathy. Multivariate analysis confirmed hematogenous metastasis (RR=5.55, 2.77-11.13; p < 0.001) and KRAS G12D mutation (RR=1.70, 1.02-2.82; p=0.041) as independent hypercoagulability predictors ( Fig. 4 KRAS G12D mutation enhances platelet-driven hypercoagulability in CRC IHC was performed on surgical samples showed that, relative to the KRAS wild-type (WT), the expression levels of Ki67 and CD31 were relatively higher in samples with the KRAS G12D mutation (Mut) ( Fig.5 Fig. 5 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 5 KRAS G12D mutation affects CRC biomarkers, platelet/cell function, and constructs knockdown CRC cell lines of KRAS G12D. ( A B C D E F Fig 5 Mechanistic insights into KRAS G12D-driven MAPK pathway activation and therapeutic implications Initial functional characterization revealed that KRAS G12D mutation confers enhanced oncogenic properties to CRC cells. The KRAS G12D mutation drives aggressive CRC phenotypes through enhanced proliferation, invasion, and migration versus WT ( Fig.5 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 KRAS G12D mutation modulates platelet functional dynamics through MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling in CRC cells. ( A B C D E F G Fig 6 Consistent with pERK1/2 dynamics, TF expression in CRC cells mirrored MAPK pathway activity across treatment groups. Mut+Cet cells exhibited the highest TF expression, significantly exceeding levels in WT+Cet and Mut+Cet+U0126 groups ( Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Fig. 7 Pharmacological modulation of KRAS-mutant vs. wild-type CRC cellular functions through Cetuximab and MEK inhibition. ( A B, D C, E, F Fig 7 KRAS G12D mutation drives platelet dysfunction and tumor progression via MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling in vivo To investigate KRAS G12D-mediated thrombotic and oncogenic effects, we developed a CRC peritoneal metastasis model with inferior vena cava thrombosis. Mice received systemic treatment with Cetuximab (Cet, 50 mg/kg biweekly) and/or the MEK inhibitor U0126 (15 mg/kg daily). Notably, the Mut+Cet cohort exhibited a marked increase in metastatic tumor burden compared to WT+Cet and Mut+Cet+U0126 groups ( Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Fig. 9 Fig. 8 Systemic validation of KRAS-MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling in platelet-mediated thrombotic and oncogenic processes. ( A B, C D E F Fig 8 Fig. 9 Schematic diagram of this study. Fig 9 Discussion Cancer-associated thrombosis (CAT) represents a major cause of mortality among cancer patients, with venous thromboembolism (VTE) being the most common manifestation [ 9 20 21 8 22 The key novel finding of this work is the development and validation of a KRAS G12D-associated coagulation gene (KMCG) signature. This model not only stratified patients into distinct risk categories with significant differences in overall survival but also correlated with enhanced immune infiltration and elevated expression of checkpoint molecules, suggesting a potential link between coagulation signaling and immune regulation within the TME. Emerging evidence highlights bidirectional crosstalk between coagulation cascades and tumor biology, mediated through systemic and stromal interactions that engage both hemostatic and immune pathways [ 23 24 25 Translationally, the KMCG signature may offer clinical utility in identifying high-risk patients who could benefit from personalized thromboprophylaxis and intensified monitoring. Furthermore, our data indicate that high-risk patients exhibit increased sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic agents, which could inform treatment selection. In breast cancer, coagulation signatures correlate with immune scores and stromal purity as prognostic indicators [ 26 + 27 In conclusion, our results uncover KRAS G12D as a key mediator of thrombosis in CRC and propose the KMCG signature as a promising risk stratification tool. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the observed clinical associations and open new avenues for co-targeting oncogenic and coagulatory pathways in CRC patients.
