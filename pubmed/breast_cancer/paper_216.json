Introduction Impaired fracture healing remains a significant clinical challenge due to the complexity of the healing process. Osteoclasts, derived from monocytes, are pivotal in bone tissue reconstruction, yet no effective clinical tools exist to promote fracture healing by modulating osteoclast activity. Methods We investigated the role of Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) in fracture healing, focusing on its regulation of osteoclast glucose metabolism. PRMT6 deficiency and pharmacological inhibition were employed to assess its functional impact. Results PRMT6 was found to promote osteoclastogenesis and activate glycolysis. Both genetic deficiency and pharmacological inhibition of PRMT6 suppressed osteoclast formation and glycolytic activity. Further, PRMT6 inhibitors significantly enhanced fracture healing in vivo by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis. Discussion Our study identifies PRMT6 as a key regulator of osteoclast metabolism and fracture repair. Targeting PRMT6 offers a novel therapeutic strategy for impaired fracture healing and provides new insights into the mechanisms of bone tissue regeneration.

Impaired fracture healing is caused by a variety of reasons, such as aging, chronic inflammation, and metabolic abnormalities ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 PRMT6 is an enzyme that plays an important role in various biological processes by methylating the arginine residues of proteins, thereby regulating protein function and stability. PRMT6 deficiency leads to a significant reduction in the expression of key glycolysis enzymes such as PKM (pyruvate kinase), PFKM/L (phosphofructokinase), and LDHA (lactate dehydrogenase), thereby hindering the progression of glycolysis ( 11 12 12 13 Here, our work demonstrates that PRMT6 is involved in the whole process of fracture healing and that PRMT6 plays a key role in fracture healing-induced osteoclast activation. When PRMT6 was deficient or inhibited, the key proteins of osteoclasts, CTSK (tissue protease K), C-FOS (cellular Fos protein), MMP9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9), and the related genes, NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1), and DC-STAMP (dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein), were significantly decreased. Further we demonstrate that utilizing PRMT6 inhibitors EPZ020411 can have the ability to promote rapid fracture healing by inhibiting osteoclast formation. Our work develops new means to promote fracture healing and provides new clues for further understanding of the fracture healing process. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Mice PRMT6-/- purebreds as well as littermate control PRMT6+/+ were obtained by breeding. Tailed genomic DNA PCR was used to characterize mice of the expected genotype. Primers and PCR procedures are detailed in  Table 1 Table 1 Primers list.

The bone marrow was flushed out and cultured in α-MEM medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 25 ng/ml Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (M-CSF, Peprotech, USA) and 50 ng/ml Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-κB Ligand (RANKL, Peprotech, USA) for 7 days. The cells were incubated in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO 2 14 2.3 Micro-CT To investigate the impact of PRMT6 deficiency on fracture healing in mice, Micro-CT was employed to examine the microstructural changes in the femurs of fractured mice. In brief, femurs from five mice per group were collected, dissected to remove excess soft tissue, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 hours. The instrument settings were as follows: resolution, 10 µm/pixel; voltage, 40 kV; current, 250 µA; exposure time, 0.9 seconds; rotation step, 0.4˚, with a total rotation of 180˚. Within the callus region, bone parameters were measured, including bone volume fraction (BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), and bone mineral density (BMD). 2.4 Western blotting To extract total protein, BMMs were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (catalog number PC103, Yamei Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) containing Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail (100X, catalog number GFR103, Yamei Biotechnology Co., Ltd.). The concentration of total protein was quantified using a BCA Protein Quantitation Kit (catalog number ZJ101, Yamei Biotechnology Co., Ltd.). Equal amounts of total protein were loaded into each lane for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were blocked in 1xTBST solution (Servicebio Technology Co., Ltd.) for 1 hour and subsequently incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies specific to PRMT6, CTSK (Cathepsin K), C-FOS (Cellular FOS Protein), MMP9 (Matrix Metalloproteinase-9), or GAPDH. After washing with 1xTBST, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 hour. Signals were detected using a Western Blot Imaging System (ibright FL1500, Invitrogen, Singapore), and band intensities were normalized to GAPDH and quantified using ImageJ. 2.5 qRT-PCR According to the manufacturer’s instructions ( 15  Table 2 Table 2 Workflow of PCR.

Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 1x10 5 2.7 Femur fracture model Firstly, six-week-old PRMT6 +/+ -/- 15 16 2.8 RNA-seq RNA-Seq process begins with the extraction of total RNA using Trizol reagent. Subsequently, mRNA is enriched through Oligo(dT) beads and fragmented into short segments. These mRNA fragments are then reverse transcribed into cDNA using random primers. Purification of the cDNA fragments is achieved using the QiaQuick PCR extraction kit, followed by end repair, poly(A) tail addition, and ligation to Illumina sequencing adapters. The ligation products undergo size selection via agarose gel electrophoresis, PCR amplification, and are sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq™ 2500 platform. To ensure data quality, raw reads are filtered to exclude those containing adapters, more than 10% unknown nucleotides, or more than 50% low-quality bases (Q-value ≤ 20). Subsequently, rRNA-mapped reads are removed using the Bowtie2 short read alignment tool. The remaining reads are mapped to the reference genome using TopHat2 (version 2.0.3.12). Gene abundance is quantified using RSEM software and normalized by the FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) method. 2.9 Statistical Analysis All data were analyzed using SPSS 24.0 (IBM, Armonk, USA). Statistic difference was analyzed by unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test or by a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the lest significant difference test. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 3 Results 3.1 PRMT6 is involved in the process of fracture healing In search of crucial regulatory genes in the process of bone fracture healing, C57 mice were modeled for fracture and analyzed by RNA sequencing one week versus three weeks after fracture. The analysis showed a total of 7731 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (FC>1.5, P<0.05), of which, 4314 were down-regulated and 3417 were up-regulated (  Figures 1A, B  Figure 1C  Figures 1D, E  Figures 1D, E  Figure 1F Figure 1 PRMT6 is a key regulatory gene that can participate in the process of bone fracture healing. (A, B) (C) (D, E) (F) Bar chart, volcano plot, heatmap, microscopy images, bar graph, and Western blot results analyze gene expression and protein levels over time. Expression data are compared across different conditions, showing variations in depicted variables. Overall, these results established that PRMT6 is able to participate in the fracture healing process, and that its expression changes with time and is a key regulatory gene in the fracture healing process. 3.2 PRMT6 gene knockout mice can promote fracture healing Given that PRMT6 can participate in the fracture healing process, we investigated the role of PRMT6 in the fracture healing process. We first compared PRMT6+/+ mice with PRMT6-/- mice, and it could be observed that PRMT6-/- mice were slightly smaller than PRMT6+/+ mice in appearance (  Figure 2A  Supplementary Figure S1A  Supplementary Figure S1B  Figures 2B, C Figure 2 PRMT6 gene deficiency mice can promote fracture healing. (A) -/- +/+ (B) (C) (D) (E) (F) (G) Panel A shows two mice, one PRMT6+/+ and one PRMT6−/−. Panel B displays CT scans of femurs from both genotypes. Panel C includes four bar graphs comparing bone volume, thickness, mineral density, and spacing, with significant differences indicated. Panel D shows histological images of bone sections with a magnified view and a bar graph indicating trabecular area differences. Panel F presents additional histological images with a bar graph showing trabecular area percentage. Significant differences are indicated with asterisks. These findings were further confirmed by histomorphometric staining analysis. In HE staining, we observed a significant increase in bone trabecular area in PRMT6-/- mice compared with PRMT6+/+ mice (  Figures 2D, E  Figures 2F, G  Supplementary Figure S1C Taken together, these results demonstrate that PRMT6 can promote osteoclast differentiation in vivo 3.3 Glycolysis is a key signaling pathway that influences the process of fracture healing To further investigate the specific molecular mechanisms by which PRMT6 affects fracture healing,\nPRMT6-/- mice PRMT6+/+ mice were subjected to fracture modeling, and RNA-seq analysis was performed three weeks after fracture. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that samples before and after PRMT6 knockdown clustered significantly, indicating significant transcriptional changes (  Supplementary Figure S1D P  Supplementary Figure S1E  Supplementary Figure S2A  Figure 3A  Figure 3B  Supplementary Figure S2B Figure 3 Glycolysis can play a crucial role in the process of fracture healing. (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) (F) Bar graph A shows pathway enrichments with TNF signaling as highest. Graph B illustrates gene percentages in various pathways, with oxidative phosphorylation and TNF signaling dominating. Plot C details glycolysis/gluconeogenesis enrichment scores in PRMT6 conditions, while plot E shows NF-kappa B signaling pathway scores. Western blots in D show protein expressions (PFKM/L, PKM, LDHA, β-actin) in PRMT6 conditions. Blots in F display p-p65, p65, and GAPDH expressions in the same conditions. Considering the role of HIF-1 in being able to mediate the onset of glycolysis and the enrichment observed in the glycolysis/glycolysis pathway, we explored how PRMT6 deficiency affects glycolysis during fracture healing. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of RNA-seq data three weeks after fracture showed a significant reduction in glycolysis in the PRMT6-/- group (  Figure 3C  Figure 3D  Supplementary Figures S2C–E Based on previous studies we learned that NF-κB is a key signaling pathway for osteoblast differentiation, so we explored its activation in the absence of PRMT6, and GSEA showed that the NF-κB signaling pathway was significantly activated in PRMT6+/+ samples (  Figure 3E  Figure 3F  Supplementary Figure S2F Collectively, these results suggest that PRMT6 promotes osteoclastogenesis and that glycolysis is an important signaling pathway in this process. 3.4 PRMT6 deficiency inhibits differentiation and activation in osteoclasts in mouse bone marrow macrophages To investigate the role of PRMT6 in osteoclast differentiation induced by BMMs, we first subjected PRMT6+/+ mice without any intervention to Micro-CT scanning compared with PRMT6-/- mice, which showed that PRMT6-/- mice had significantly elevated BV/TV, Tb.BMD compared with PRMT6+/+ mice (  Figures 4A, B  Supplementary Figure S3A  Figures 4C–E  Figures 4C–E  Supplementary Figure S3B  Figures 4F, G Figure 4 PRMT6 deficiency can suppress osteoclast differentiation and activation in mice BMMs. (A) -/- +/+ (B) (C-E) -/- +/+ + (F, G) Panels A to G depict comparative analyses between PRMT6+/+ and PRMT6−/−. Panel A shows bone scans, Panel B presents bar graphs of BV/TV and Tb BMD, and Panel C includes histological images. Panel D and Panel E display TRAP-positive and bone resorption area graphs. Panel F shows a Western blot for MMP9, PRMT6, CTSK, and GAPDH. Panel G contains bar graphs for MMP9/GAPDH and CTSK/GAPDH fold changes, with significant differences marked by asterisks. Collectively, these results suggest that PRMT6 promotes RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro in vivo 3.5 PRMT6 inhibitor EPZ020411 inhibits differentiation and activation in osteoclasts in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages Previously, we demonstrated the ability to inhibit osteoclastogenesis in the absence of PRMT6, and to further investigate the role of PRMT6 in RANKL- induced osteoclastogenesis, we used a selective PRMT6 inhibitor, EPZ020411, in our experiments. Subsequently, in order to determine whether the inhibitory effect of PRMT6 deficiency on osteoclast formation was associated with cytotoxicity, the BMMs viability assays were performed using Cell Counting Kit-8 assays (CCK-8). The results obtained indicated that EPZ020411 did not produce cytotoxicity on BMMs at concentrations lower than 15 µM (  Supplementary Figure S3C  Figures 5A, B  Figures 5A–C  Supplementary Figure S3D  Figures 5D, E  Figure 5F Figure 5 PRMT6 inhibitor EPZ020411 can suppress osteoclast differentiation and activation in mice BMMs. (A-C) + (D, E) (F) Microscopic images and graphs depict effects of different concentrations of a substance (0 µM, 5 µM, 10 µM) on osteoclasts. A: Microscopic images show reduced TRAP-positive and bone resorption areas with increasing concentration. B and C: Bar graphs indicate a significant decrease in TRAP-positive areas, osteoclast numbers, and bone resorption areas at higher concentrations. D: Western blots display protein expression levels; C-FOS and CTSK levels decrease with higher doses. E and F: Bar graphs show fold changes in mRNA levels for PRMT6, C-FOS, and other markers, with significant reductions at higher concentrations. Collectively, these results suggest that PRMT6 promotes RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis in vitro 3.6 PRMT6 inhibitor EPZ020411 accelerates the fracture healing process Considering our previously mentioned critical role of PRMT6 in promoting osteoclastogenesis in vivo in vitro  Supplementary Figure S3E  Figures 6A–C Figure 6 PRMT6 inhibitor EPZ020411 can accelerate the process of fracture healing (A) (B, C) (D, E) (F, G) Imaging and graphs comparing PBS and EPZ treatments in bone analysis. Panel A shows femur scans. Panel B displays increased bone volume with EPZ. Panel C shows graphs of trabecular thickness, bone mineral density, and spacing, all improved under EPZ. Panels D and E include histological images showing more bone trabeculae and chondrocyte areas in EPZ-treated samples. Graphs indicate significant enhancements with EPZ. In addition, histological staining was performed one week after the injection of the drug, and we further confirmed the previous results, and in HE staining, a significant increase in trabecular area could be observed in fracture tissues injected with EPZ020411 compared to bone tissues injected with PBS (  Figures 6D, E  Figures 6F, G  Supplementary Figure S3F Taken together, these results demonstrate that inhibition of PRMT6 effectively reduces osteoclastogenesis and trabecular bone loss during fracture healing. This highlights PRMT6 as a promising therapeutic target for fracture healing treatment as well as for bone nonunion. 4 Discussion Fracture is the most common and most frequent disease in orthopedics, and 5-10% of fracture patients worldwide suffer from non-union, delayed healing, and nonunion due to various factors. Therefore, impaired healing after fracture is an important clinical problem in trauma orthopedics, and the study of its mechanism is of great significance to the clinical fracture treatment strategy. Fracture healing is a complex system that is regulated by multiple signaling pathways ( 17 18 PRMT6 is an enzyme involved in post-translational modification of proteins, which regulates the function and stability of proteins mainly through methylation modification of arginine residues. Recent studies have shown that PRMT6 plays an important role in a variety of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and immune responses ( 19 20 21 22 To further investigate the role of PRMT6 in fracture healing, this study constructed a mouse model with PRMT6 deficiency or inhibition and observed its effect on fracture healing. The results showed that PRMT6 deficiency or inhibition significantly inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and glycolysis processes, thereby slowing down the bone resorption process at the fracture site. This effect favored the reduction of inflammatory response and excessive bone resorption at the fracture site, providing a better environment for subsequent bone regeneration and repair. As a result, PRMT6-deficient or inhibited mice exhibited faster healing and better healing quality during fracture healing. Therefore, PRMT6 is expected to be a new target for fracture healing and bone nonunion treatment and a candidate gene for new drug development. 5 Conclusion In this study, we revealed the critical role of PRMT6 in RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and fracture healing by transcriptional sequencing analysis and other methods, and explored the mechanism by which it affects osteoclastogenesis and function by regulating glycolysis. This finding provides new ideas and targets for the treatment of fracture healing and bone nonunion. In the future, we will continue to delve into the specific mechanism of PRMT6’s role in fracture healing and explore the prospects for drug development and clinical application targeting PRMT6. Meanwhile, we will also focus on other metabolic pathways and signaling pathways that may affect fracture healing, with the aim of providing a more comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the treatment of fracture healing and related diseases.
