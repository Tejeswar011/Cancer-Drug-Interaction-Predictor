They commonly arise as multiple painless nodules in patients with a cancer history. Differential diagnoses are challenging, and zosteriform metastases should not be mistaken for herpes zoster. Dermoscopy typically reveals a white, structureless pattern. A skin biopsy with routine hematoxylin–eosin staining is essential for an accurate diagnosis, while immunohistochemistry is particularly useful in cases of anaplastic tumors. Breast cancer is the most common cause of skin metastasis in women, and lung cancer is the most common in men. The life expectancy after diagnosis is generally low. Cutaneous metastasectomy, electrochemotherapy, and radiotherapy are generally regarded as beneficial for palliative purposes. Intralesional cryosurgery was found to be beneficial in a few case series. Systemic immunotherapy can induce the regression of cutaneous metastases in selected patients. skin metastases cutaneous metastases dermoscopy biopsy electrochemotherapy palliative therapy intralesional cryosurgery breast cancer lungs cancer ovarian cancer This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Cutaneous metastases (CMs) are neoplastic infiltrations of the skin originating from distant malignant tumors. Their reported incidence ranges between 0.7% and 9%, accounting for only 2% of all skin cancers, and they occur in up to 10% of cancer patients. Usually, CMs appear as an evolution of the primary tumor, but they may also represent the initial sign of visceral cancers or announce cancer recurrence many years after the initial diagnosis. Certain tumors have a predilection for metastasizing to specific sites, which can guide the diagnostic approach for the underlying tumor. Moreover, the skin represents an easily accessible site for a biopsy specimen, with great implications in metastatic tumors of unknown origin [ 1 2 3 4 5 3 CMs typically present as asymptomatic dermal nodules, although their clinical appearance can vary significantly. Disfigurement, impetiginization, fetor, ulceration, bleeding, necrosis, and drainage may worsen the natural evolution of skin metastases. It is essential to establish a prompt diagnosis to conduct an adequate treatment; hence, clinical recognition and skin biopsy of the suspicious lesions are crucial [ 5 6 7 et al 4 3 5 6 Although CMs generally retain the histopathological features of the primary tumor, poorly differentiated or undifferentiated cells may also be present, in which case immunohistochemical studies are particularly valuable. Dermal pleiomorphic cells, mitotic figures, and neoplastic cells are characteristic findings of CMs. In contrast to primary cutaneous tumors, CMs do not originate from the epidermis and are completely separated from it [ 1 2 3 4 5 7 8 2. Materials and Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science up to August 2025, using the following terms and combinations: “cutaneous metastases,” “skin metastases”, “visceral cancer”, “breast cancer”, “lung cancer”, “mesothelioma”, “colon cancer”, “colorectal cancer”, “pancreatic cancer”, “stomach cancer”, “liver cancer”, “bladder cancer”, “prostate cancer”, “cervical cancer”, “ovarian cancer”, “endometrial cancer”, “cervical cancer”, “renal cell carcinoma”, “kidney cancer”, “”head and neck cancer”, “immunotherapy”, and “dermoscopy”. Boolean operators (AND, OR) were applied to refine searches. We included original articles, reviews, case series, and case reports published in English (and selected articles in Spanish and Portuguese with English abstracts) that described CMs of visceral malignancies, emphasizing clinical presentation, dermoscopic findings, histopathology, prognosis, and management. Exclusion criteria were studies on primary cutaneous malignancies (e.g., melanoma, cutaneous lymphomas, adnexal tumors), articles lacking sufficient clinical or pathological details, and non-peer-reviewed reports (abstracts without full text, editorial letters without cases). After screening, a total of 181 references were selected, prioritizing landmark retrospective series, systematic and narrative reviews, and illustrative case reports of rare or unusual metastatic presentations. We extracted information on the primary tumor type and site, latency period, clinical morphology, dermoscopic and histopathologic features, metastatic sites, prognostic implications, survival data, and therapeutic approaches. This review is limited by the predominance of case reports and small series. The restriction to selected databases and mainly English-language publications may have introduced selection and language bias, while heterogeneity in reporting clinical and pathological findings limited direct comparisons across studies. 3. Cutaneous Metastases of Breast Cancer Breast cancer is reported to be the leading cause of CMs in women with non-melanoma solid tumors [ 5 6 7 6 7 8 3 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Figure 1 Another relatively frequent breast cancer CM is alopecia neoplastica 14 Figure 2 Figure 3 8 10 14 Dermoscopy of breast cancer metastases predominantly displays a structureless pattern (98%), as well as a few blue-nevus-like and heterogeneous patterns. White (97.5%), blue (41.5%), and red (34.3%) are the most encountered colors. Irregular vessels account for the most frequent vascular subtype (13.6%), followed by comma (8.4%) and dotted vessels (7.65%). Dots and milky-red structures are a rare finding (2.47% and 1.23%, respectively) [ 4 Microscopically, CMs are composed of neoplastic cells grouped in linear or glandular structures in a single layer between the collagen fibers, surrounded by fibrotic tissue. Immunohistochemistry provides positive tumor diagnostic markers such as cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK19, S100 protein, gamma-globulin, estrogen and progesterone receptors, and GCDFP-15 [ 12 10 Up to one-third of patients with metastatic breast cancer present with disease confined to the skin, a finding associated with a more favorable prognosis compared with visceral metastases. Loonkbill et al. reported an average survival of 31 months from the diagnosis of CMs to death. Overall, patients with breast-cancer-related CMs appear to have a better prognosis than those with CMs arising from other malignancies [ 3 7 9 11 15 4. Skin Metastases of Lung and Pleural Cancers 4.1. Lung Cancer Lung cancer is reported to be the leading cause of skin metastasis in men with non-melanoma solid tumors, with an incidence between 1.8% and 11.8% [ 5 7 18 19 20 7 18 19 The clinical presentation of CMs includes several forms, most commonly the nodular subtype, but also inflammatory and scleroderma-like variants. Lesions typically measure 1–6 cm in diameter [ 19 21 21 Less common forms include the ulcerated, vascular, plaque-like, papular, zosteriform, and erysipelas-like subtypes and, in some cases, scarring alopecia [ 21 21 22 23 21 7 19 Figure 4 4.2. Pleural Cancer (Mesothelioma) Unlike lung cancer, malignant mesothelioma is a rare neoplasm and an uncommon cause of CMs. CMs most often occur near the primary tumor site. Periumbilical lesions, such as Sister Mary Joseph’s nodule, may represent metastatic spread from peritoneal malignant mesothelioma. Other reported sites include the chest, face, and scalp [ 24 25 26 27 28 Figure 5 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 Hematoxylin and eosin staining typically displays the dermal proliferation of infiltrative epithelioid cells, pseudoglandular structures, cytologic atypia, and increased mitotic activity [ 24 29 33 22 34 35 34 5. Skin Metastases of Gastrointestinal Cancers 5.1. Colorectal Cancer Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of skin metastasis for men with non-melanoma solid tumors (incidence of 11%). For women, the incidence is almost ten times lower (approximately 1.3%) and represents the sixth cause of cutaneous metastasis. The rectum is reported to be the first site of skin metastasis (55% of cases), followed by the sigmoid colon (17%), transverse colon (9%), rectosigmoid (7%), cecum (4%), and ascending colon (4%) ( Figure 6 36 37 38 39 CMs typically develop approximately two years after resection of the primary tumor and are usually associated with additional metastatic sites. The most frequent locations are the thoracic and abdominal regions, particularly along surgical incision scars ( Figure 7 38 39 40 Colorectal CMs commonly arise as painless, violaceous, or flesh-colored, firm nodules. They may occasionally be misdiagnosed and confounded with epidermal cysts, neurofibromas, lipomas, cicatricial morphea-like plaques, lymphomas, annular erythema, condylomas, and elephantiasis nostra verrucosa 5 7 12 36 37 38 39 40 Colorectal CMs share certain histological features with the primary tumor. Most are well differentiated and mucin-secreting [ 37 12 36 11 36 7 5.2. Stomach Cancer Gastric cancer is a rare cause of CMs with an incidence below 1.5% and a higher risk reported for men; survival time is up to 16 months. The most frequent metastatic sites are the abdomen, neck, chest, and inguinal region. The most common histological subtype is adenocarcinoma. Skin metastases can manifest as solitary or multiple firm nodules, with colors ranging from red to violaceous. In most cases, stomach CMs are painless, having the starting point in the subcutaneous or dermal layer. Other clinical appearances can include erysipelas-like erythematous plaques, a cellulitis-like morphology, or a scleroderma-like type [ 7 41 42 43 44 45 46 46 Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet-ring cell features is characteristic of stomach cancer CM [ 46 22 5.3. Pancreatic Cancer CMs from pancreatic cancer are rare, usually of the adenocarcinoma subtype, accounting for approximately2% of all metastases. The most frequent metastatic site is the umbilicus (known as the Sister Mary Joseph Nodule), although CMs can also occur at surgical scars, including incision or drainage sites [ 7 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 47 53 50 53 At diagnosis, CMs are often accompanied by other metastatic sites, although in some cases, they may precede identification of the primary tumor [ 52 47 A histopathological examination typically reveals metastatic adenocarcinoma, usually poorly differentiated, infiltrating the dermis and subcutaneous tissue as invasive strands of pleomorphic cells with hyperchromatic, angulated nuclei. The immunohistochemistry examination is positive for diagnostic markers such as CK7, CK19, and carbohydrate antigen (CA)19-9, while the expression of CK20 is variable. Neither the sex nor the number of skin lesions impacts overall survival [ 47 48 53 5.4. Liver Cancer Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a rare cause of CMs and accounts for less than 1% of all CMs. Cutaneous dissemination appears more frequently following a cirrhotic HHC. Metastatic carcinomatosis cirrhosis occurs when other organ malignancies infiltrate the liver and provoke fibrosis and should not be mistaken for HCC [ 7 54 55 56 HCC skin metastases appear in the late stage of the disease, but they can rarely arise as a first clinical finding in an otherwise healthy patient. The most frequent sites are the head, trunk, and shoulders. The most common clinical presentation is asymptomatic, firm nodules with fast growth patterns and diameters less than 2.5 cm. HCC skin metastases can mimic pyogenic granuloma, granuloma teleangiectaticum, or a cutaneous abscess [ 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 HCC is characterized by an affinity for Gallium, with arterial phase enhancement followed by a washout in the portal phase. It appears that skin metastases from HCC also have a higher uptake of gallium [ 59 61 64 65 59 65 66 60 63 6. Skin Metastases of Renal and Urogenital Cancers 6.1. Bladder Cancer CMs from bladder cancer are rare, with an incidence below 4%. The direct implantation of the tumor cells into the granulation tissue of the surgical scar in the suprapubic area is a well-known cause of skin metastasis. The clinical presentation is usually nonspecific, most often manifesting as infiltrated plaques or nodules. These nodules are typically firm, round or oval, of variable size (median diameter of 1 cm), and mobile over the underlying structures [ 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 carcinoma erysipelatoides 68 Urothelial cancer pathology, including infiltrating strands and nests of poorly differentiated carcinoma in the lower dermis, is encountered in more than 90% of CMs. Immunohistochemical studies reveal the positivity for the expression of CK7 and CK20 in 89% of urothelial bladder cancers [ 68 71 74 75 69 70 6.2. Prostate Cancer Although prostate cancer has a high incidence in males, CMs are rare, with an overall incidence lower than 1%. The most frequent histological subtype is adenocarcinoma. Metastatic spread most commonly involves the inguinal region and abdomen, while less typical sites include the face, scalp [ 7 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 The clinical presentation consists of pink, dome-shaped, usually multiple nodules, with a firm consistency and a smooth surface. Other clinical findings are lymphedema or nonspecific, disguising rashes [ 78 88 79 83 89 90 78 86 88 91 6.3. Ovarian Cancer CMs of ovarian cancers have an incidence of approximately 3.5–3.8% and represent the fourth site of extra-abdominal metastasis in affected women. Their presence at the time of initial diagnosis is uncommon. The prognosis is poor, with a median survival of four to 12 months following diagnosis [ 91 92 93 94 The most common affected area is the abdomen. Periumbilical Sister Joseph’s nodules are frequent, but other sites such as the pelvic region, thighs, or trunk can be involved. Orbital metastases have also been reported. Among histological subtypes, epithelial ovarian adenocarcinoma (especially serous papillary cystadenocarcinoma) most frequently metastasizes to the skin. Clinically, ovarian CMs usually present as multiple nodules less than 3 cm in diameter. While typically asymptomatic, some lesions may be painful or appear with herpetiform erythematous patterns, erythema annulare, or lymphangiosis carcinomatosa. Histopathology reveals neoplastic cells, organized in papillary groups, with hyperchromasia or enlarged nuclei, thinner nuclear membranes, enlarged nucleoli, and cytoplasmic vacuoles. Immunohistochemistry markers include progesterone and estrogen receptors, CK7, CA125, vimentin, and mesothelin, as well as Glut1 and PAX8 for a differential diagnosis [ 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 6.4. Uterine Cancer Uterine cancer is a rare source of CMs [ 7 107 22 108 109 109 110 111 112 113 114 108 115 22 7 6.5. Cervical Cancer Cutaneous metastases from cervical cancer are rare, with an incidence below 2%. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common histological subtype to metastasize to the skin [ 107 116 117 107 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 118 108 117 118 119 120 116 117 118 6.6. Renal Cancer Between 4% and 8% of CMs originate from kidney cancer, most commonly from the renal clear cell carcinoma (RCC) [ 5 7 127 128 129 130 7 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 7 Clinically, RCC-related CMs usually present as multiple nodules, with an elastic or firm consistency, increased vascularity, and various colors (black, brown, or purple) [ 7 135 131 132 135 135 136 7 133 Figure 8 7. Skin Metastases of Head and Neck Cancers The incidence of CMs from head and neck squamous carcinomas appears to be below 2%. However, it represents 10% to 15% of all distant metastases. Contiguous involvement and tumor implantation after surgery are common. Squamous cell carcinoma is by far the most common histological subtype of head and neck cancers. CMs from head and neck malignancies are, however, exceedingly uncommon. Interestingly, among the limited cases reported, laryngeal atypical carcinoid (although rare as a primary tumor) appears disproportionately represented among those that metastasize to the skin. In suspected head and neck CMs, the immunohistochemical panel should include CK5/6 and EMA for squamous differentiation, p16 immunostaining as a surrogate for high-risk HPV infection (particularly in oropharyngeal primary tumors), and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), which is commonly overexpressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and can further support the diagnosis [ 16 139 140 141 142 143 An important risk factor for developing skin metastases is the existence of a minimum of two cervical metastases or extracapsular extension in the cervical metastases. The existence of distant metastases without nodal involvement is a rare event [ 16 139 8. Diagnostic Challenges and Differentials The diagnosis of CMs can be particularly challenging, especially in patients without a known history of visceral malignancy. Among nodular presentations, 27% occur as solitary nodules and 23% as multiple nodules. Therefore, CMs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of indolent skin nodules, and biopsy is warranted when clinical suspicion is high [ 144 145 3 Zosteriform metastases (ZMs) are CMs that occur in a dermatomal distribution. The pathophysiological mechanism of ZMs remains unclear and includes lymphatic and neural spread, a Koebner phenomenon at the site of a previous zoster infection, and the surgical implantation of tumor cells [ 146 147 Table 1 1 2 3 5 6 7 148 149 150 A CM suspicion should be raised in patients with a prior history of internal malignancy who develop firm, painless nodules (or papules/plaques/ulceration), commonly on the scalp, chest, and abdomen. The differentials should be excluded (clinical examination, dermoscopy); a skin biopsy is mandatory, and the biopsy site should ideally be selected under dermoscopic guidance ( Figure 9 Figure 10 Table 2 9. Current Treatment Advances Conventional surgery (metastasectomy) is commonly recommended for solitary skin metastases, with the aim of improving quality of life and regional functionality and reducing morbidity. Other established treatment modalities include electrochemotherapy, radiotherapy, intralesional and topical chemotherapy, and various combined approaches [ 151 The electrochemotherapy technique combines the administration of a chemotherapy agent (usually bleomycin) with the local delivery of electric impulses (electroporation). The electric discharge increases the local permeability of the cellular membranes, with promising results regarding loco-regional disease control, especially in breast cancer metastases. In one study, bleomycin-based electrochemotherapy achieved a complete response rate of 46% in a palliative setting, irrespective of the tumor type. A novel variation of this technique combines electroporation with the local administration of CaCl 2 152 153 154 Radiotherapy is primarily used for palliation, aiming to reduce local symptoms such as pain, weeping, fetor, and bleeding, rather than to decrease the size of large cutaneous or subcutaneous tumors. Treatment is typically brief and delivered in high individual doses of radiation, with palliative intent. Radiotherapy provides effective analgesia at low doses, with symptom relief reported even after a single 8 Gy fraction. Ulcerations usually heal within weeks [ 155 156 Intralesional cryosurgery (ILC) is a novel therapeutic approach to CMs. The technique involves inserting a cryoprobe into the center of the tumor mass, followed by the passage of a cryogen through the probe until the lesion is visibly frozen, forming a surrounding frozen halo. ILC has shown benefits for CMs originating from breast, prostate, hepatic, non-small cell lung, and esophageal cancers [ 157 158 159 160 10. Novel Systemic Therapies Since the appearance of CMs usually reflects advanced disease, it often coincides with the availability of biomarker-driven systemic treatments that may prolong survival and improve quality of life. The choice of therapy depends on the molecular profile of the primary tumor. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), molecular testing for EGFR mutations, ALK or ROS1 rearrangements, BRAF V600E mutations, and KRAS G12C mutations is now standard practice. Patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC benefit from tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as osimertinib [ 161 162 HER2-positive breast tumors are treated with targeted agents including trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab deruxtecan, which significantly improve progression-free and overall survival [ 163 164 165 Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) remains the mainstay for metastatic prostate cancer, with second-generation androgen receptor antagonists (enzalutamide, apalutamide) and androgen synthesis inhibitors (abiraterone) improving outcomes [ 166 167 168 In metastatic colorectal cancer, anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab, panitumumab) are indicated for RAS wild-type tumors, while HER2 amplification identifies another actionable subgroup [ 169 170 171 172 In ovarian cancer, PARP inhibitors (olaparib, niraparib) are effective in BRCA-mutated or homologous-recombination-deficient metastatic disease [ 173 174 175 Most head and neck squamous cell carcinomas overexpress EGFR, and cetuximab remains the primary targeted agent used in combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapy [ 176 177 Although CMs usually reflect advanced disease, selected patients may experience the regression of these lesions under immunotherapy [ 178 179 Nonetheless, the efficacy of novel systemic therapies is often limited in patients with cancer cachexia, a syndrome affecting up to 80% of those with metastatic disease. Cachexia reflects profound tumor-driven alterations in neuroendocrine and immune homeostasis. Tumors may release hypothalamic and pituitary hormones, POMC-derived peptides, glucocorticoids, melatonin, leptin, acetylcholine, biogenic amines, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which act both locally and on central regulatory axes such as the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal system. These mediators reset the energy balance, promote catabolism, and drive muscle wasting, while systemic inflammation further disrupts drug distribution and metabolism. As a result, cachexia not only accelerates clinical decline but also reduces tolerance and responsiveness to targeted agents and immunotherapy [ 180 181 11. Conclusions CMs of visceral cancers have an overall low incidence among skin cancers, but they display a poor prognosis and low survival rates. Still, patients with CMs of breast and uterine cancer survive up to two to three years after diagnosis. CMs most commonly arise as nodules, and other primary skin lesions such as papules, macules, plaques, and ulcerations are encountered. Clinical recognition is essential, but is challenging, especially in patients without a history of visceral neoplasia. Zosteriform cutaneous metastases may be mistaken for zoster, and numerous differential diagnoses should be considered. Their early diagnosis can serve as a tool in staging the original cancer and reducing overall morbidity. Dermoscopy of CMs generally reveals a white, structureless pattern with few, irregular vessels. Still, histopathology and immunohistochemistry are the gold standard for a definitive diagnosis. Surgery, classical bleomycin electrochemotherapy, and the novel calcium electrochemotherapy are regarded as generally safe and effective for reducing the disease burden and improving the quality of life for these patients. Radiotherapy is an analgesic and promotes healing of the ulcerated metastatic plaques. Intralesional cryosurgery was recently found to be beneficial in CMs. Immunotherapy may achieve the regression of CMs in selected patients, offering improvements in survival and quality of life.

Figure 8 Frequency and topography of renal and urogenital CMs. While CMs from cervical and uterine cancers display a rather heterogeneous topography, the ovarian cancer CMs are confined to the periumbilical area, bladder and prostate cancers are confined to the pubic area/surgical scar, and renal cancer is confined to the scalp. CMs from renal cancer are most frequent among these organs. Multiple nodules are the most frequent clinical finding for all these CMs. Figure 9 Dermoscopy of various skin metastases: ( a b c d e f Figure 10 Diagnostic management of patients with CMs. The suspicion is high (*) in patients with a known history of visceral cancer. Skin biopsy is mandatory, preferably under dermoscope guidance. If the patient was known for a visceral cancer, he will undergo multidisciplinary board reevaluation and staging. If the patient does not have a cancer history, screening for primary cancer, including imaging and serology, will be conducted.
