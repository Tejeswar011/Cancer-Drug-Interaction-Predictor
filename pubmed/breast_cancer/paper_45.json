Ciprofloxacin (CFX) is a broad-spectrum antibiotic belonging to the fluoroquinolone class, widely used to treat bacterial infections by inhibiting bacterial DNA replication. Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death, is characterized by lipid peroxidation on cellular and organelle membranes. Our previous studies demonstrated that CFX inhibits erastin-induced ferroptosis by enhancing glutathione peroxidase 4 protein stability. In contrast, we report here a distinct role of CFX in potentiating RSL3-induced ferroptosis in various cancer cells. Mechanistically, CFX inhibits topoisomerase 2β, and when combined with RSL3, induces significant mitochondrial DNA stress. This mitochondrial DNA stress triggers a signaling cascade involving the stimulator of interferon genes cGAMP interactor 1 and caveolin-2, ultimately disrupting intracellular zinc homeostasis.

Edited by Paul Shapiro The primary goal of cancer therapies is to selectively target and eliminate malignant cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. Recent advances in the understanding of regulated cell death processes have significantly influenced the development of novel cancer treatment strategies ( 1 2 3 4 5 Ciprofloxacin (CFX), a broad-spectrum antibiotic from the fluoroquinolone class, is widely used for treating bacterial infections by inhibiting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase, which are essential for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, and repair ( 6 7 8 9 10 Zinc, an essential trace element, plays a pivotal role in numerous biological processes, including enzyme activity, protein structure, and signaling ( 11 12 13 14 In this study, we conducted an antibiotic screening and identified a significant synergistic effect of low-dose CFX and RSL3 in sensitizing tumor cells to ferroptosis by promoting mitochondrial Zn 2+ Results CFX enhances the anticancer activity of RSL3 in tumor cells To evaluate the potential of antibiotics to enhance the antitumor activity of RSL3, a ferroptosis inducer, we screened 50 clinically utilized antibiotics for their synergistic interactions in the human PDAC cell line PANC1 following a 24-h treatment with RSL3. Synergy was quantified using Zero Interaction Potency scores ( Fig. 1 A Fig. 1 B Figure 1 Antibiotics screening identifies ciprofloxacin (CFX) synergies with RSL3 to inhibit PDAC cell viability. A, B, C, D, E, p C E CFX, a synthetic second-generation quinolone antibacterial drug, is well known for its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and potent bactericidal properties ( 15 10 Beyond PANC1 cells, the synergistic effect of CFX with RSL3 was validated in additional cancer cell lines, including SW1990 (another PDAC cell line), HeLa (a cervical cancer cell line), and OVCAR-3 (an ovarian cancer cell line) ( Fig. 1 C D Fig. 1 E CFX sensitizes tumor cells to RSL3-induced ferroptosis To further evaluate the therapeutic potential of CFX in cancer treatment, we exposed cancer cells to varying concentrations of CFX and conducted cell viability assays to determine the optimal nontoxic concentration for subsequent experiments. Our findings revealed that 50 μg/ml of CFX effectively inhibited cell proliferation without causing significant cytotoxicity ( Fig. 2 A Figure 2 Ciprofloxacin (CFX) amplifies RSL3-driven ferroptosis. A, B, C, D, E, F, Green 2+ G, H, p B C H To investigate whether CFX enhances the antitumor efficacy of RSL3 through ferroptosis, we coadministered liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1), a specific ferroptosis inhibitor, and observed that Lip-1 mitigated the reduction in cell viability caused by the combination of CFX and RSL3 ( Fig. 2 B 16 Fig. 2 C Given that ferroptosis is driven by iron accumulation and GSH depletion, which promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation ( 17 18 Fig. 2 D E 19 20 2+ Fig. 2 F G To further examine the specificity of CFX's effects on RSL3, we evaluated its influence on cell death induced by other mechanisms, including necroptosis (tumor necrosis factor-α, SM-164, and Z-VAD-FMK [TSZ]) and apoptosis (staurosporine [STS]) ( 21 22 23 Fig. 2 H Collectively, these findings suggest that CFX selectively enhances the antitumor properties of RSL3 by promoting ferroptosis through mechanisms independent of iron accumulation and GSH depletion. CFX amplifies RSL3 sensitivity independently of GXP4 Our previous research demonstrated that CFX can confer resistance to erastin-induced ferroptosis in cancer cells by upregulating GPX4 levels. Specifically, CFX partially restored cell viability against the inhibitory effects of erastin, whereas paradoxically enhancing the cytotoxicity of other ferroptosis inducers, such as ML162 and FIN56 ( Fig. S1 A B Fig. S1 C D Fig. S1 E Fig. S1 F via Erastin triggers ferroptosis by inhibiting SLC7A11, thereby reducing cystine uptake and impairing GPX4 synthesis ( Fig. S1 G 24 Fig. S1 G To explore whether CFX influences other key regulators of ferroptosis, we assessed its impact on proteins such as dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, transferrin receptor, and activating transcription factor 4 ( 25 26 27 Fig. S1 H CFX sensitizes ferroptosis through the topoisomerase 2β–STING1 pathway To investigate the role of CFX in modulating the efficacy of RSL3, we focused on topoisomerase, the primary target in CFX's established antimicrobial mechanism ( 28 29 Figs. 3 A S2 A Fig. 3 B C Figure 3 TOP2B–mtDNA–STING1 axis contributes to ferroptosis. A, B, TOP2B C, D, E, F, G, STING1 H, I, J, p D F C E H I J TOP2B is localized to both the nucleus and mitochondria, where it plays a critical role in maintaining nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) homeostasis ( 30 Fig. S2 B Fig. S2 C Fig. S2 D Fig. S2 E Fig. 3 D 31 Fig. 3 D F To determine whether the counteracting effect of VBIT-4 on CFX–RSL3 was linked to ferroptosis inhibition, we measured lipid ROS and MDA levels. VBIT-4 effectively reduced the accumulation of both lipid ROS and MDA ( Fig. S2 F G VDAC is not the only pathway by which mtDNA is released into the cytoplasm, as BAX/BAK macropores and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) also allow the release of mtDNA ( 32 33 BAX BAK Fig. S2 H K Cytosolic release of mtDNA can act as a damage-associated molecular pattern, triggering various signaling pathways, including activation of the STING1. STING1 has been implicated in enhancing sensitivity to ferroptosis ( 34 35 Fig. S3 A C STING1 STING1 Figs. 3 G H S3 D To validate whether STING1 STING1 Fig. 3 I J Collectively, these findings suggest that CFX enhances the antitumor efficacy of RSL3 by sensitizing tumor cells to ferroptosis through the TOP2BSTING1 signaling pathway. STING1 binding to CAV2 stabilizes CAV2 Phosphorylation of STING1 is a hallmark of its activation. However, our experiments revealed that CFX treatment did not induce STING1 phosphorylation in tumor cells, in contrast to the robust phosphorylation triggered by 2′,3′-cGAMP ( Fig. 4 A B 36 37 Fig. S3 A C Figure 4 STING1 increased protein stability of CAV2 by interaction. A, B, C, D, E, F, STING1 G, CAV2 H, I, J, K, p G To elucidate the mechanism by which STING1 sensitizes cells to ferroptosis, we performed coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) followed by mass spectrometry (MS) to identify STING1-binding proteins in PANC1 cells, with and without CFX and RSL3 treatment. Among the STING1-interacting proteins, 21 were uniquely associated with STING1 in the presence of both CFX and RSL3. However, none of the top 10 proteins identified were previously known to be ferroptosis related ( Fig. 5 C 38 39 40 Figure 5 Increase in intracellular Zn 2+ A, CAV2 B, C, D, E, F, G, 2+ H, 2+ tor TSQ.

CAV2 is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, matures through the Golgi apparatus, and is subsequently transported to the plasma membrane, where it participates in caveolae formation ( 41 42 Fig. 5 F Caveolae are enriched in ion channel regulatory proteins, and their structural integrity is maintained by caveolins ( 43 44 45 14 46 47 2+ Fig. 2 G 2+ 2+ 48 49 2+ 2+ Fig. 5 G H 2+ Fig. 5 I 2+ 2+ Fig. 5 J K 2+ We further investigated the source of excess Zn 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ Fig. 5 L 2+ STING1 CAV2 2+ Fig. 5 M Collectively, these findings demonstrate that CFX–RSL3 sensitizes cells to ferroptosis via 2+ 2+ Zn 2+ Zn 2+ 2+ 2+ Figs. 6 A S4 A 2+ 50 Figs. 6 B S4 B Figure 6 Zn 2+ A, 2+ B, C, N D, E, F, G, SLC25A25 H, 2+ Green I, J, p C F I J CFX–RSL3 also increased mitochondrial ROS (mtROS, detected using MitoSOX probes) and total ROS (detected using 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) levels, as measured by flow cytometry ( Fig. 6 C D N Fig. 6 E Fig. 6 F 2+ To investigate the mechanism of Zn 2+ 2+ 51 Fig. S4 C D SLC25A25 2+ 2+ Fig. 6 G H 2+ SLC25A25 Fig. 6 I J Together, these findings suggest that CFX–RSL3 induces ferroptosis in cancer cells by triggering TOP2B-associated mtDNA stress and activating a STING1–CAV2-dependent increase in intracellular Zn 2+ Fig. 7 Figure 7 Molecular mechanism of ferroptosis in tumor cells induced by RSL3 in synergy with ciprofloxacin. Discussion Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by redox imbalance, is implicated in various diseases, including cancer ( 52 53 54 55 Our study demonstrates that the antibiotic CFX potentiates the effects of the GPX4 inhibitor RSL3 in inducing tumor cell ferroptosis. CFX is primarily recognized for its potent antibacterial properties, with documented off-target effects and limited efficacy as a standalone anticancer agent because of high-dose requirements and cell line–specific responses. Here, we identify subtoxic concentrations of CFX that sensitize tumor cells to RSL3, highlighting its potential as an adjuvant in ferroptosis-based cancer therapy. Topoisomerases are essential enzymes that resolve DNA supercoiling and entanglements during replication, transcription, and chromosomal segregation ( 30 56 57 STING1, an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane protein, is typically activated by cytosolic DNA (including mtDNA) through the cGAS–STING1 pathway, leading to the production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines ( 58 34 37 59 60 61 Our findings further reveal that the combination of CFX and RSL3 enhances cellular Zn 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ Finally, our findings demonstrate that Zn 2+ via SLC25A25 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 62 In conclusion, our study reveals a novel mechanism by which low-dose CFX synergizes with RSL3 to induce ferroptosis.

Antibodies targeting CAV2 (F1431), GPX4 (A5569), SLC7A11 (A5912), activating transcription factor 4 (A5514), and FTH (A5654) were purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Cell culture Human tumor cell lines SW1990 (CRL-2172), PANC1 (CRL-1469), HeLa (CCL-2), and OVCAR-3 (HTB-161) were procured from the American Type Culture Collection and examined every 3 months to ensure they remained free of mycoplasma contamination. The cells were cultured in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 11995073) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (ExCell Bio; FSP500) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Yeasen; 60162ES76) under standard conditions of 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 Cell viability analysis, drug screening, and synergy evaluation Tumor cells in the logarithmic growth phase were seeded into 96-well plates for cell viability assays. After 24 h, experimental drugs were administered, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 2 For drug screening, a library of 50 antibiotics or RSL3 was serially diluted across four concentrations and applied to PANC1 cells. After 48 h, cell viability was evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Drug synergy was assessed using the model through the SynergyFinder web application (version 3.0; https://synergyfinder.fimm.fi/ 63 64 Western blot To prepare the cell lysis buffer, a phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Cell Signaling Technology; 5872) was mixed with radioimmunoprecipitation lysis buffer (Biosharp; BL509A) at a ratio of 1:1000. Cells were lysed in the prepared buffer, and nucleic acids were disrupted using an ultrasonic cell disruptor. The lysates were kept on ice, vortexed every 10 min for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 15,000 g For Western blot analysis, 30 μg of protein was separated on 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Epizyme; PG112) and subsequently transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore; IPVH00010). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies. After three washes with Tris-buffered saline with Tween-20, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Protein signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher Scientific; 34095) and visualized with the ChemiDoc Touch Imaging System and Image Lab Software (Bio-Rad). Cell death analysis Tumor cells in the logarithmic growth phase were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of approximately 1 × 10 5 2 To assess cell death, PI and Hoechst 33342 (BestBio; BB-4131-1) were diluted at a 1:1000 ratio in PBS and added to each well. The plates were then incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 ImageJ software ( https://imagej.net/ij/ Colony formation assay Tumor cells in the logarithmic growth phase were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of 1000 cells per well in complete growth medium. Cells were allowed to adhere overnight and recover before experimental treatments. On the second day, cells were treated with experimental drugs for 24 h. Following treatment, the drug-containing medium was replaced with fresh complete medium, and cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO 2 At the endpoint, the medium was aspirated, and cells were gently washed twice with PBS to remove debris. Colonies were fixed by adding 4% formaldehyde and incubating for 20 min at room temperature. After fixation, cells were stained with 4% crystal violet solution (Solarbio; C8470) for 1 h at room temperature. Excess stain was removed by thoroughly rinsing the wells with distilled water, and the plates were air-dried. Images of each well were captured using a flatbed scanner or microscope for analysis. Colony counts were determined using ImageJ software, with thresholds adjusted to define colonies containing at least 50 cells. Untreated wells served as the baseline, representing 100% colony formation. The relative colony formation ratio was calculated by comparing the number of colonies in treated wells to those in untreated controls. Lipid peroxidation assay Lipid ROS was assessed using BODIPY 581/591 C11 staining (Thermo Fisher Scientific; D3861). Cells were seeded at 3 × 10 5 2 The relative MDA concentration in cell lysates was measured following the manufacturer's protocol using the Lipid Peroxidation MDA Assay Kit (S0131S; Beyotime). Iron staining To measure intracellular labile iron levels, the metal-sensitive probe Phen Green SK diacetate (Thermo Fisher Scientific; P14313 Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10 5 2 After staining, fluorescence was observed under a fluorescence microscope at 200× magnification. Images were acquired from multiple fields per well to ensure representative results. Changes in fluorescence intensity were analyzed to estimate intracellular labile iron levels, with untreated cells serving as controls. GSH assay The relative GSH concentration in tumor cells was quantified using the GSH and GSSG Assay Kit (Beyotime; S0053) following the manufacturer's protocol. Tumor cells were seeded into appropriate culture plates and treated under the specified experimental conditions. After treatment, cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in the lysis buffer provided in the kit. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 g The GSH concentration was calculated by subtracting the GSSG content from the total glutathione measured. Results were normalized to protein concentration, determined using a BCA assay. RNAi and plasmid transfection Predesigned human STING1 STING1 TOP2B TOP2B CAV2 CAV2 BAK BAX SLC25A25 SLC25A25 High-titer lentiviral particles were generated using 293FT cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific; R70007 For target cell transduction, lentiviral particles containing the desired shRNA were added to the culture medium of target cells, and incubation was carried out for 24 to 48 h in the presence of polybrene to enhance transduction efficiency. Following transduction, cells were selected with puromycin (2 μg/ml; YEASEN; 60210ES72) for 7 days to ensure stable integration of the lentiviral construct. Knockdown efficiency was validated by Western blot analysis to confirm the expression of the targeted gene. Transfection with mitochondrial localization signal TOP2B (MLS-TOP2B) was performed using NanoTrans Transfection Reagent Plus (CYTOCH; CT0005) according to the manufacturer's instructions. mPTP detection The mPTP was detected using an mPTP Assay Kit (Beyotime; C2009S). In summary, the treated cells were washed with PBS and subsequently incubated with calcein plus CoCl 2 Cytoplasmic mtDNA detection Treated tumor cells were lysed using cell lysis buffer (Beyotime; P0013J) and centrifuged at 700 g g DNA was precipitated and extracted from the cytosolic fraction using a DNA isolation protocol. Quantification of mtDNA was performed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) with primers targeting mitochondrial cytochrome c mtCOI IP assay Treated tumor cells were lysed using cell lysis buffer (Beyotime; P0013J) and centrifuged at 15,000 g B23201 Co-IP MS Dithiothreitol was added to the protein sample to a final concentration of 5 mM, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. After the sample returned to room temperature, iodoacetamide was added to a final concentration of 10 mM, and the sample was incubated in the dark at room temperature for 45 min. The sample was then diluted fourfold with 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, and trypsin was added at a 50:1 protein-to-trypsin ratio. The mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. On the following day, the pH was adjusted to below 3 using formic acid to halt digestion. The sample was desalted using a C18 column, which was activated with 100% acetonitrile and equilibrated with 0.1% formic acid before loading the sample. The column was washed with 0.1% formic acid to remove impurities, and the peptides were eluted with 70% acetonitrile. The eluate was collected and lyophilized to dryness. Mobile phase A (100% water with 0.1% formic acid) and mobile phase B (80% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) were prepared. The lyophilized sample was dissolved in 10 μl of mobile phase A, centrifuged at 14,000 g qPCR assay Total RNA was isolated using the QIAGEN RNeasy Plus Micro Kit (QIAGEN; 74034) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To eliminate genomic DNA contamination, cell lysates were passed through gDNA Eliminator spin columns, followed by RNA purification using RNeasy MinElute spin columns. First-strand complementary DNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using the Hifair AdvanceFast One-step RT-gDNA Digestion SuperMix (Yeasen; 11151ES), which includes a built-in gDNA removal step. qPCRs were prepared in a final volume of 20 μl, consisting of 5 μl of Hifair AdvanceFast One-Step RT SuperMix, 1 μl of gDNA Remover Mix, 1 μg of RNA, and RNase-free water. Amplification was carried out using Hieff qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Yeasen; 11201ES) on the C1000 Touch Thermocycler CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad). Data were normalized to 18S ribosomal RNA as the reference gene and analyzed with Bio-Rad CFX Manager 2.0 software. The relative fold changes in mRNA expression were calculated using the 2 -ΔΔCt Organelle staining Cells were seeded onto specialized laser confocal Petri dishes designed to optimize imaging conditions. After allowing sufficient time for cell attachment, the cells were treated with the indicated drugs for the required duration. To visualize specific organelles, cells were incubated with ER-Tracker Red (Beyotime; C1041S) at a 1:1000 dilution and Mito-Tracker Green (Beyotime; C1048) at a 1:5000 dilution. The staining was performed at 37 °C for 30 min in a dark environment to protect the fluorophores from photobleaching. Following staining, the cells were gently washed with prewarmed PBS to remove excess dye and were immediately imaged using a high-resolution confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon A1+). The microscope was equipped with excitation and emission filters optimized for detecting the respective fluorophores, ensuring clear visualization of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria-specific fluorescence patterns. Zinc detection An appropriate number of cells were seeded into specialized confocal cell culture dishes and allowed to adhere. After treatment with the indicated drugs, the cells were stained with 30 μM TSQ (AAT Bioquest; 21254) to detect zinc ions. The staining was performed at 37 °C for 30 min in a dark environment to protect the fluorophore from photobleaching. Following incubation, the cells were washed with PBS to remove excess dye and immediately imaged using a state-of-the-art confocal laser scanning microscope (Nikon A1+). The microscope was configured to capture zinc-specific blue fluorescence patterns, enabling the visualization of intracellular zinc distribution. For flow cytometry analysis, an appropriate number of cells were seeded into 6-well plates and treated under the indicated conditions. Subsequently, 30 μM TSQ (AAT Bioquest; 21254) was added for staining, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. After incubation, the cells were washed with PBS and harvested using EDTA-free trypsin to avoid chelation of zinc ions. The blue fluorescence intensity of Zn 2+ ATP luminescence Cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a density of 8000 cells per well. After 24 h of incubation to allow cell attachment, the indicated concentrations of compounds were added to the wells, with each condition tested in at least triplicate. Following treatment, 50 μl of Luminescent ATP Cell Viability Assay reagent (APExBIO; K2041) and 50 μl of serum-free medium were added to each well. The plates were gently vortexed for 2 min at room temperature to ensure proper mixing and then incubated for 10 min to allow the luminescent signal to stabilize. Relative luminescence units (RLUs) were measured using a microplate reader. Cell viability was calculated from RLU values as ([RLU experimental blank negative blank JC-1 staining To each well of a 6-well plate, 1 ml of 5 μg/ml JC-1 staining working solution (Beyotime; C2005) was added and mixed gently to ensure even distribution. The plate was incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator to allow JC-1 dye uptake. After incubation, the supernatant was carefully discarded, and the cells were washed twice with 1X JC-1 staining buffer to remove excess dye. Subsequently, 2 ml of fresh cell culture medium was added to each well. The cells were then observed under a fluorescence microscope, with green and red fluorescence signals visualized to assess mitochondrial membrane potential.
