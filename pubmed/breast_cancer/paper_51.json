Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis underlie cardiomyopathies and heart failure. While previous studies have reported both hypertrophy and apoptosis at the population level, how individual cells commit to these distinct analog and digital fates is unclear. To elucidate how individual cells decide to grow and/or die, we developed a high-content microscopy approach to track single-cell dynamics of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Even untreated cells exhibited substantial single-cell variability in growth and death. Uniform treatments of staurosporine or phenylephrine induced distinctive morphological programs resulting in apoptosis and hypertrophy, respectively, but only in cell subpopulations. Increasing concentrations of the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol caused a population-level biphasic induction of hypertrophy and then apoptosis, consistent with either apoptosis in the most hypertrophic cells (a grow-and-die model) or an early decision between hypertrophy and delayed apoptosis (a grow-or-die model). By tracking single-cell fates, we found that when stressed with either isoproterenol or phenylephrine, individual cells that hypertrophy are protected from later apoptosis. Further, caspase 3 inhibition shifted the single-cell probability from apoptosis to hypertrophy fates. Machine learning models found that a cell's initial size and DNA content or condensation could predict a cell's bias for hypertrophy or apoptosis. Together, these data support a grow-or-die conceptual model for cardiomyocyte decisions. This single-cell profiling method for tracking joint analog-digital cell decisions reveals that despite hypertrophy and apoptosis co-occurring at the population level, individual cardiomyocytes decide early whether to grow or die.

[17] [18] [19] 20 21 22 One recent technology for capturing single-cell heterogeneity is single-cell RNA sequencing, which has provided a number of important insights into health and disease [ 3 4 23 24 Other studies have used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to characterize cell subpopulations that regulate development, differentiation, and in response to drugs that could not be resolved with bulk measurements at the population level. Still, for most pathological responses in the heart, the dynamic and causal relationships between these co-occurring subpopulations as they respond to perturbations remains unclear [ 12 25 In this work, we propose two simple conceptual models for joint cardiomyocyte decision-making of hypertrophy and apoptosis. A “grow-and-die” model represents serial decision-making, where cells hypertrophy but then later apoptose due to an inability to handle growth stresses [ 26 27 27 28 [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] 2 Results 2.1 Assay design for single-cell phenotyping of hypertrophy-apoptosis dynamics We developed a live single-cell microscopy assay to track multiple simultaneous fluorescent readouts of hypertrophic and apoptotic activity ( Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 High-content time-lapse microscopy of single-cell morphological and apoptosis dynamics of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes.

Even in the absence of hypertrophic or apoptotic stimuli, there was considerable single-cell variability of both hypertrophic ( Fig. 1 Supplemental Movie 1 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 2.2 Cellular and nuclear profiling of staurosporine-induced apoptosis dynamics Apoptosis is characterized by morphological and biochemical changes to both cell and nucleus. As a representative cellular perturbation to examine apoptosis dynamics with our high-content imaging assay, we used the broad spectrum ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor staurosporine (STS), which is well-known to induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and other cell types [ [35] [36] [37] [38] 38 39 Treatment with STS induced substantial A5 binding and PI uptake compared to DMSO vehicle-control treatment ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Supplemental Movie 2 Fig. 2 Next, we sought to characterize the temporal dynamics of additional cellular features that may be associated with apoptosis ( Fig. 2 40 40 40 41 Fig. 2 Single-cell dynamics show that cardiomyocyte death induced by staurosporine follows a sequence of nuclear permeability and shape, chromatin condensation, annexin 5 binding, and membrane permeability.

Fig. 2 2.3 Cellular profiling of phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy dynamics To examine hypertrophy dynamics with our high-content imaging assay, we stimulated cardiomyocytes with the catecholamine phenylephrine (PE), an α1-adrenergic agonist and a well-known inducer of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy [ 42 43 32 44 45 Treatment with PE increased two established metrics of hypertrophy: an increase in cell area and hypertrophy and eGFP expression ( Fig. 3 43 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Supplemental Movie 3 We previously identified divergent characteristics of cellular hypertrophy induced by different hypertrophic agonists [ 46 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Phenylephrine induces coordinated changes in cell morphology, protein synthesis, and nuclear integrity.

Therefore, we proposed two distinct conceptual models of single-cell heterogeneous decision making that may reconcile this paradox. We hypothesized that single-cell decisions may be made via either 1) a “grow-and-die” model where hypertrophic stress causes apoptosis, or 2) a “grow-or-die” model, where either the local environment or initial cell state dictates cell fate ( Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Single-cell hypertrophy-apoptosis tracking in response to isoproterenol supports a “grow-or-die” conceptual model. All data is from experiments reported in Fig. 4 (A) Schematic of possible cardiomyocyte phenotypic decision-making models and relationships between hypertrophy and apoptosis. (B) The population of cells treated with 100 μM ISO was partitioned into 3 hypertrophic trajectory groups relative to the DMSO-treated population at 48 h. Growers (purple) were defined as cells whose max fold change area was greater than that of the 75th percentile of the DMSO-treated population. Stunned (orange) cells were defined as cells whose max fold change area was in the DMSO-treated interquartile range. Shrinkers (green) were defined as cells whose max fold change area was less than the 25th percentile of the DMSO-treated cells.

(G) Single-cell quantification for 100 μM ISO, of onset of maximal hypertrophic area and A5 binding, and with the lag between those two events for cells that become A5+/PI− (diers) or remain A5−/PI− (survivors). For each hypertrophy subpopulation, we quantified time to maximal hypertrophy ( H n p p Fig. 5 To facilitate the comparison of these distinct conceptual models of hypertrophy-apoptosis decision making, we first classified cells as “growers”, “stunned”, or “shrinkers”. Strikingly, the hypertrophic dynamics of these three subpopulations identified by single-cell tracking ( Fig. 5 Fig. 4 Fig. 5 As expected from the single-cell ISO concentration hypertrophy responses at 48 h, we saw a trend towards an increased proportion of grower cells with ISO stimulation compared to DMSO. In addition, the largest proportion of grower cells was seen with 1 μM ISO, which corresponds to the dose at which we saw the greatest population-level hypertrophy response ( Figs. 5 4 Fig. 4 We hypothesized that growth and death responses may be discordant at the single-cell level, with apoptosis primarily occurring in “shrinker” cells. We quantified the proportions of cells from the three growth subpopulations that contribute to the ultrasensitive response of A5 binding with increasing ISO concentration ( Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Supplemental Movie 4 Supplemental Movie 5 Having found that apoptotic cells also tended to become smaller as “shrinkers” ( Fig. 4 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 The three hypertrophic subpopulations further differed in their rate of apoptosis. The grower and stunned subpopulations became A5+/PI- 11 and 13 h after reaching their maximal cell area, respectively. Despite reaching maximal cell area early, the shrinker subpopulation persisted longer with a median time lag of 18 h before binding A5 ( Fig. 5 Fig. 4 As a validation of this “grow-or-die” conceptual model, we hypothesized that inhibiting the apoptosis pathway may redirect cell decisions to the hypertrophy pathway. Under conditions of 100 μM ISO where we had found a mixed hypertrophy-apoptosis response, treatment with caspase-3 inhibitor Z 27 Fig. 5 We next asked whether, like ISO, PE-induced hypertrophy would also be protective from apoptosis. As shown in Supplemental Fig. 6, PE-treated growers were less likely to die than shrinkers or stunned cells (C), and PE treatment increases the proportion of the grower subpopulation compared to DMSO control (D). Thus, the “grow-or-die” conceptual model best explains single-cell decisions in response to both ISO and PE stimulation. 2.6 Initial cell morphology and nucleus predicts single-cell decisions of growth or death Given the considerable single-cell heterogeneity in response to ISO stimulation, we asked whether pre-existing features of cardiomyocytes would predict their subsequent growth or death. We trained a multinomial log-linear regression machine learning model (see Methods Fig. 6 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 2 McFadden Fig. 6 Multinomial log-linear model reveals initial cell features that predict single-cell hypertrophy-apoptosis decisions in cardiomyocytes treated with 100 μM ISO. All data is from experiments reported in Fig. 4 (A) Significant multinomial log-linear model coefficient z-scores. The contingency table contains the number of cells in each hypertrophy-death category.

Arrow colours are relative to the DMSO diagram in Fig. 5 Fig. 6 An advantage of the log-linear modeling approach is that it provides interpretability of the coefficient values of each classifier. The log-linear model identified several initial cell metrics that were predictive of hypertrophy, apoptosis, or both. One such metric was the initial cell area - the model predicted that initially larger cells had a higher likelihood of being stunned or shrinking and a lower likelihood of growing ( Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Interestingly, this analysis identified nuclear Hoechst intensity (reflecting DNA content or nuclear permeability) and its median absolute deviation (reflecting chromatin condensation) as two nuclear metrics predictive of both cell shrinking and dying ( Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 3 3 Discussion Single-cell, multiplexed, or longitudinal data each have the potential for elucidating new causal relationships or differential cell responses to stimuli [ [61] [62] [63] 24 64 65 Expression of the fetal gene program is a common surrogate for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy measurements [ 66 67 27 63 68 28 69 70 After validating our cardiomyocyte assay for hypertrophy and apoptosis measurements separately and identifying new features of those processes, we used our assay to examine the dynamics of decision-making between hypertrophy and apoptosis in response to catecholamines. Theoretical mechanisms underlying the simultaneous regulation of analog and digital phenotypic decision-making by a single signaling network have been proposed. To our knowledge, however, the relative timing of early analog hypertrophy responses and late digital apoptosis decisions represents the first experimental support of a single signaling network regulating a mixture of analog and digital phenotypic decisions [ 71 Our data with both ISO and PE treatment best supports a “grow or die” conceptual model in which hypertrophic signaling is moderately protective against apoptosis. The transition-state diagrams show that while all three subpopulations undergo apoptosis at high-dose ISO treatment, the grower subpopulation is more resistant to undergo apoptosis compared to the shrinker subpopulation. Likewise, the PE-treated grower subpopulation had a decreased incidence of apoptosis. However, at low-dose ISO treatment, there is an increase in the grower subpopulation and a decrease in the shrinker subpopulation without any increase in apoptosis between those populations. Further, inhibiting caspase 3 activity re-routed cardiomyocytes from apoptosis to hypertrophy. Isoproterenol-induced apoptosis typically occurred at >24 h, indicating multi-potent state before commitment. Together, these observations of differential apoptosis among hypertrophic subpopulations undermine the “grow-and-die” model and in favor of the “grow-or-die” model under both ISO and PE treatment. We used cyclic data-driven hypothesis testing and modeling to identify characteristic features of these different subpopulations. Our multinomial log-linear regression models sought to identify nongenetic heterogeneities in initial cell size, morphology, and fluorescence metrics at a single ISO dose that would predict dynamic, single-cell decision-making. This modeling approach had an accuracy rate similar to the more agnostic, black-box “random forest” model. This shows that differences in model structure (such as the presence of non-linear interactions between predictors) were less important than other, non-characterized factors or biochemical sources of stochasticity [ 72 73 74 75 Z The current live-cell imaging system has several limitations that could be addressed in future extensions. Our identification of initial cell features predictive of growth or death indicates heterogeneity in the cardiomyocyte population, which could be affected by the mixed sex neonatal culture, heterogeneity in receptor expression, or other factors. Such variables could be disentangled by immunostaining for sex or receptor-specific markers at the final timepoint. Given the “grow-or-die” model supported by non-specific α- or β-adrenergic agonists PE and ISO, it would be valuable to examine the relative contributions of their receptor isoforms that differentially affect hypertrophy or apoptosis with distinct mechanisms [ 76 33 53 54 58 77 Measuring additional phenotypes such as cardiomyocyte proliferation could also multiplex with our assay to examine additional single-cell decisions [ 48 79 78 80 81 82 4 Methods 4.1 Chemical reagents  • DMSO (R&D Systems, Cat#3176) • Staurosporine (R&D Systems, Cat#1285) • ( R • Isoproterenol hydrochloride (R&D systems, Cat#1747) • Z 4.2 Lentivirus Lentiviruses were prepared in 293T/17 cells (ATCC) by triple transfection with psPAX2, pMD.2G, and PLX302 eGFP as previously described [ 83 84 4.3 Cell culture Cardiac myocytes were harvested from 1 to 2 day-old Sprague-Dawley rats using the Neomyts isolation kit (Cellutron, Baltimore, MD). All procedures were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and approved by the University of Virginia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Myocytes were cultured in plating media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle media supplemented with 17 % M199, 10 % horse serum (Gibco, 16050122), 5 % fetal bovine serum (HyClone FBS Thermo Scientific Cat: SH30396.03 Lot: AUD34652 l l Fig. 3 4.4 Dual hypertrophy/apoptosis assay Cells were pre-stained and pre-treated with relevant small molecule inhibitors in low-serum media supplemented with 27 nM Hoechst 33342, 0.5 nM Propidium iodide, and 0.5× Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated A5 (Invitrogen) for 2 h. Cells were imaged on the Operetta CLS high-content imaging system (Perkin-Elmer) using a 10 × 0.3NA objective in widefield mode, which integrates over the entire cell thickness. Temperature and CO2 control options were set to 37 °C and 5 % CO2, respectively. Images were captured every 1 h for 48 h. 4 fields of view were acquired for each well. After live-cell imaging, the cells were fixed with 4 % PFA and stained with DAPI and monoclonal anti-α-Actinin antibody (Sigma, Cat#A7811). The same fields of view acquired during live imaging were again imaged. 4.5 Image processing All images were processed using Matlab 2018a (MathWorks), ilastik [ 78 79 85 An image analysis pipeline was developed in CellProfiler to automatically segment, measure, and classify the cells from the corrected images and signal probability maps. Briefly, all live timepoints and fixed immunofluorescence images were aligned to the final timepoint images. Hoechst- and propidium iodide-positive nuclei were independently segmented using Otsu thresholding. Binucleates were identified by merging touching nuclei and then shrunken by a radius of 1 pixel. GFP positive cells were identified using a watershed segmentation algorithm on the GFP probability map using the merged nuclei as starting seeds. These GFP positive cells were tracked and measured for morphological and fluorescence intensity characteristics including area, GFP intensity, A5 intensity and probability, final α-Actinin intensity and probability. Nuclei were also measured for morphological and propidium iodide and Hoechst intensities. Cells that were PI+ at the beginning of the experiment were excluded. 4.6 Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were done in R version 3.6.3. The following packages were additionally used for general data preparation and visualization: tidyverse [ 86 87 88 89 90 91 https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=ldpjy4 92 93 94 95 4.7 Modeling Data were normalized prior to statistical modeling. For multinomial log-linear modeling, predictor variables were filtered for multicollinearity on the basis of their variance inflation factor (VIF) scores - removal of the raw major axis length metric reduced all VIF scores below a maximum of 2.4. We also verified the remaining collinearities with a tableplot and that those variables described sufficiently different metrics (Supplemental Fig. 7A). For random forest modeling, default values from the randomForest package were used with the exception of 1000 trees [ 92 The following are the supplementary data related to this article.
