Currently, the primary treatment methods include surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and emerging neoadjuvant therapies. These treatments have effectively reduced the mortality rate associated with bladder tumors. However, the prognosis for bladder cancer patients remains poor due to the high rates of recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance. Therefore, identifying the pathological features and tumor immune environment of each patient to develop optimal treatment strategies is an urgent health issue. Methods We analyzed a single-cell dataset of bladder cancer to identify key signaling pathways and chromosomal mutations among different subgroups of bladder tumors. Additionally, we sought to identify ligand-receptor pairs between malignant bladder tumor epithelial cells and other cell subgroups. Using the TCGA-BLCA database and COX regression analysis, we screened key ligand-receptor pairs closely related to patient prognosis. We then used LASSO regression analysis to construct a bladder cancer risk prediction model based on these key ligand-receptor pairs (LR.Riskscore). To evaluate the impact of different LR.Riskscores on prognosis and clinical benefits for bladder cancer patients, we used Kaplan-Meier survival curves, risk forest plots, nomograms, and decision curve analysis. We also conducted cellular experiments, including clone formation, CCK8 assays, Transwell migration assays, and scratch assays, to elucidate the important cellular role of the key receptor CXCR4 in bladder tumor cells. Finally, we utilized the IMvigor210 bladder cancer immunotherapy dataset to reveal the correlation between the LR.Riskscore risk equation and bladder cancer immunotherapy. Results We constructed a bladder cancer risk prediction model based on key ligand-receptor pairs, including CXCL12_CXCR4, VEGFA_FLT1, PDGFRA_PDGFC, WNT2_SFRP4, and HLA-E_KLRC1. This model effectively predicted the prognosis and immunotherapy responsiveness of bladder cancer patients, significantly enhancing clinical benefits compared to conventional clinical features. Additionally, our cellular experiments confirmed the oncogenic role of the key receptor CXCR4 in bladder cancer. Conclusion Our risk prediction model significantly improves the evaluation of prognosis and the prediction of immunotherapy responsiveness in bladder cancer patients. This advancement promotes the development of precise, individualized treatment strategies for bladder cancer.

Annually, approximately 573,000 new cases of bladder cancer are reported, leading to around 213,000 deaths [ 1 2 3 In recent years, the concept of the tumor microenvironment has gained attention in understanding the internal dynamics of tumors. The tumor microenvironment consists of diverse entities such as cancer cells, immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), endothelial cells, and other cell types, all playing pivotal roles in cancer pathogenesis [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 Next-generation sequencing has become widely used in the study of various tumors [ 10 11 12 The evolution of single-cell sequencing technology now makes it feasible to investigate cellular communication within the tumor microenvironment, providing a clearer understanding of its specific dynamics [ 13 14 15 In our study, we integrated single-cell sequencing data from public datasets with bulk RNA data to investigate the composition of the tumor microenvironment in bladder cancer. We constructed a model to enhance prognosis assessment for bladder cancer patients, focusing on inter-cell communication. Our aim is to provide prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets that can contribute to advancing bladder cancer treatment. Methods Patients enrolled The Ethics Committee of Xiangya Hospital of Central South University approved and supervised this study. Pathological slides utilized in this research were obtained from patients diagnosed with first-onset bladder cancer who were admitted to Xiangya Hospital from January 2016 onwards and followed up for a minimum of 5 years. All patients had comprehensive medical records and follow-up information, and none had a confirmed history of other tumors prior to treatment. Pathological types and stages of the tumors were determined post-surgery by at least two pathologists with intermediate professional titles or higher. The pathological sections and clinical specimens used in this study were obtained with informed written consent from each patient. Datasets in the study We downloaded single-cell sequencing data for bladder cancer from the BioProject-PRJNA662018 dataset [ 16 17 RNA-seq transcriptome data and clinical metadata for bladder cancer were downloaded from the GDC Data Portal ( https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/ n 18 GSE13507 19 scRNA-seq data analysis and enrichment analysis We utilized the Seurat software package for follow-up analysis of the single-cell dataset. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), FindIntegrationAnchors, and IntegratedData functions were employed to address differences between samples and integrate the data. Subsequently, FindNeighbors and FindClusters were used to cluster the single-cell integrated data, and the tSNE method was applied to visualize the cells in two-dimensional space. Highly expressed genes in each cell subset were identified using the FindAllMarkers function, and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) was conducted. The GSVA software package performed unsupervised analysis and calculated GSVA enrichment scores for each cell subgroup. The human gene set used for gene function enrichment was specified as Species= “Homo sapiens”, category= “H”. InferCNV analysis and cell-cell communication analysis We employed InferCNV to infer chromosomal variations between bladder tumor tissue and normal bladder mucosa. Using stromal cells as a standard reference, we visualized genetic variations on chromosomes and calculated the sum of squares of inferCNV return values in normal bladder mucosa and bladder tumor samples to quantify chromosomal mutations in bladder tumor tissue. Subsequently, we projected the gene expression data onto the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using CellChat. We identified LR-pairs between bladder tumor malignant cells and other cell subsets through arrangement testing ( p Determination of receptor-ligand pairs associated with the prognosis of bladder cancer The level of co-expression of LR-pairs is crucial for cell-cell interactions. Additionally, to increase the sample size of patients, we identified co-expressing LR-pairs in bladder tumors using sequencing data from the TCGA-BLCA database and Pearson correlation analysis (correlation coefficient > 0.4, p p Molecular subtyping based on LR-pairs Based on 52 prognostically correlated LR-pairs, we utilized ConsensusClusterPlus to further classify the molecular subtypes of bladder cancer. The cluster number (k) was set from 2 to 6, and the optimal classification was determined by calculating the consensus matrix and cumulative distribution function. The PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids) algorithm was employed with Pearson as the distance calculation method. We performed 1000 iterations of resampling, with 80% of samples used in each iteration. Subsequently, the 411 bladder cancer samples in the TCGA-BLCA dataset were molecularly typed based on the expression levels of prognostically correlated LR-pairs. We used maftools to visualize key gene mutations in different molecular subtypes of bladder cancer. Prognostic model construction We utilized the Glmnet package to perform Lasso regression analysis on the 52 prognostically correlated LR-pairs identified earlier. From the 52 LR pairs, we applied LASSO regression(via the glmnet R package) to penalize overfitting and select the most predictive pairs. 10-fold cross-validation was used to determine the optimal penalty parameter (λ). Theλ value yielding the minimum partial likelihood deviance identified the top 5 pairs with non-zero coefficients: CXCL12_CXCR4, VEGFA_FLT1, PDGFC_PDGFRA, WNT2_SFRP4, and HLA-E_KLRC1, which were identified as key LR-pairs. Subsequently, we used the coefficients obtained from the Lasso regression model to calculate the LR.Riskscore using the formula Riskscore = \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:\\sum\\:_{\\text{i}\\:=\\:1}^{\\text{n}}\\text{C}\\text{o}\\text{e}\\text{f}\\text{i}\\text{*}\\:\\text{E}\\text{x}\\text{p}\\text{r}\\text{i}$$\\end{document} Cell culture and transfection We cultured bladder cancer cells T24 and normal bladder cells SV-HUC-1 in a CO 2 4 Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot assay Quantitative Real-time PCR: we packed cysteinocarcinoma tissue samples into 1 mL of Trizol lysate, inactivated the RNA enzyme, ground the tissue, and centrifuged the mixture at 5000 rpm for 3 min at 4 ℃. We then collected the supernatant and extracted cDNA using the Promega M-MLV kit (Promega Biotech, M1705). After obtaining the cDNA, we prepared a Real-time PCR reaction system (20 µL) with the following components: 10.0 µL SYBR premix ex taq, 0.5 µL upstream primer (2.5 µM), 0.5 µL downstream primer (2.5 µM), 1.0 µL cDNA, and 8.0 µL RNase-Free H2O. We then used a Real-time PCR instrument (MX3000p, Agilent) for qPCR detection. The qPCR reaction procedure was as follows: 95 ℃ for 300 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 ℃ for 20 s, 55 ℃ for 20 s, and 72 ℃ for 20 s. We performed relative quantitative analysis using the formula F = 2 −∆∆Ct CXCR4: Forward primer sequence: ATGGTGTGCAGAGCGGCGTGA. Reverse primer sequence: TCAGCAGCCAGTCAGGTTTGC. GAPDH: Forward primer sequence: GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC. Reverse primer sequence: GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC. Western Blot: we prepared the cell suspension using RIPA buffer and quantified the total protein concentration in the extract with a BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher, USA). We subjected equal amounts of total protein from each sample to 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). After transferring the protein to a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane, we blocked the membrane with 5% skim milk at room temperature for 1 h. We then incubated the membrane with the primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. The following day, we incubated the membrane with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h and washed it three times with TBST. Finally, we detected the target protein on the PVDF membrane using ECL chemiluminescence developer. IHC, cell proliferation and migration assay Immunohistochemistry (IHC): we baked the embedded paraffin sections in an oven at 68 ℃ for 1 h and then dewaxed them with turpentine and a series of gradient alcohol solutions (100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, 75%). After dewaxing, we placed the sections in EDTA antigen repair solution and boiled them for 30 min. Once cooled to room temperature, we washed the sections three times with PBST. We then blocked endogenous peroxidase activity for 15 min and blocked non-specific binding with 5% BSA for 30 min. After blocking, we applied a primary antibody working solution and incubated the sections overnight at 4 ℃. The next day, we washed the sections and incubated them with the secondary antibody at 37 ℃ for 30 min. We used DAB for color development for 30 s and counterstained the nuclei with hematoxylin. Finally, we dehydrated the sections with ethanol from low to high concentrations before sealing them. CCK8 assay: we inoculated control group cells and T24 cells with stable CXCR4 knockout into six-well plates at a density of 500 cells per well. After 10 days of complete culture, we fixed the cells in 4% methanol for 30 min and stained them with 1% crystal violet solution. We then compared and analyzed cell proliferation between the two groups. For the CCK8 experiment, we suspended T24 cells with stable CXCR4 knockout in 1640 medium. We cultured 1000 cells per well in 96-well plates for 24 h. We added 10 µL of CCK8 solution per well on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 using the CCK8 test kit. Finally, we measured the optical density (OD) value at 450 nm using an enzyme-labeled instrument (Eppendorf, Germany) and performed statistical analysis. Transwell assay: we inoculated T24 cells with stable CXCR4 knockdown into the upper chamber of a Transwell insert coated with 200 mg/mL matrix gel. We added RPMI 1640 FBS-free medium to the upper chamber and filled the lower chamber with medium containing 10% FBS. After 24 h, we scrubbed the non-migrating cells from the upper surface of the membrane. We then fixed the migrated cells on the lower surface with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, stained them with 1% crystal violet for 30 min, and counted them using ImageJ. Scratch Test: we cultured T24 cells with stable CXCR4 knockout in 6-well plates until they reached confluence. We then created a scratch along the center line of the well using a 10 µL pipette tip and replaced the medium with RPMI 1640. We took images of the scratch at 0 h and 12 h using 20x magnification and measured the wound closure area. We calculated cell mobility using the formula: Cell mobility = (0 h wound closure area − 12 h wound closure area) / 0 h wound closure area ×100%. Tumor immune microenvironment analysis Based on the metagene gene set of immune cells, we used the “GSVA” R package to calculate the abundance of immune cells in bladder tumors and normal bladder mucosa. We utilized the Wilcoxon test to compare immune scores and stromal scores between tumor tissues and normal tissues. We extracted bladder cancer patient information and gene expression data after immunotherapy using the IMvigor210 Corebiologies R package. Statistical analysis We used R (version 4.1.0) for the above bioinformatics analysis. We employed one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests for statistical comparisons among multiple groups, the Wilcoxon test for comparisons between two groups, and Spearman analysis for correlation analysis. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Result Landscape of BLCA Single-cell sequencing and cell type We utilized the bladder cancer single-cell sequencing dataset sourced from a public database, which included 8 tumor tissues and 3 para-cancer tissues. Following standard quality control procedures (methods, the study process diagram is shown in Figure S1 S1 Subsequently, we employed Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction clustering, identifying 17 cell clusters (Figure S2 1  Fig. 1 Single cell atlas of bladder cancer tissue. a b c d e Following this classification, GSVA was conducted on each cell population. We found enrichment of DNA repair and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) pathways in Epithelial cells, while Myeloid cells exhibited enrichment in inflammatory response pathways (Fig. 1 2 2  Fig. 2 Analysis of chromosomal variation in bladder cancer. a b c Complex communication between bladder cancer cells To explore the interplay among the 8 identified cell populations, we used CellChat [ 20 3 3 3 S2  Fig. 3 Cell interactions and communication networks in bladder cancer. a b c d f g h j GSE13507 Subsequently, we employed the TCGA bladder cancer dataset to further refine LR-pairs with significant interactions between different cell types, based on their expression levels using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (correlation coefficient > 0.4 and correlation p-value < 0.05). The expression level of LR-pairs was defined as the average sum of the expression values of receptors and ligands in the TCGA cohort. Remarkably, we identified a total of 94 LR-pairs significantly associated with outcomes in the TCGA cohort (HR > 1 and p S3 Conducting ConsensusClusterPlus analysis [ 21 3 S4 p 3 S3 GSE13507 p p 3 Characteristics of different subtypes are different Gene mutation significantly influences tumorigenesis [ 22 4 4 p p 4 4 23 24 25  Fig. 4 Mutation characteristics of different molecular subtypes. a b c d e g p Following this, we evaluated immune cell infiltration in bladder cancer across different molecular subtypes (Figure S3 S5 26 27 S3 S4 3 28 The prognosis model based on LR Given the significant differences observed in various aspects, such as the genome, tumor immune microenvironment, and functional enrichment among distinct LR pairs, our objective was to identify key LR pairs. Using LASSO Cox regression, we selected five key LR pairs by integrating patient survival time and the expression levels of LR pairs (Fig. 5  Fig. 5 Construction of LR.Riskscore (LRS). a b c e GSE13507 f h GSE13507 i j k \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ $$$$\\begin{aligned} {\\text{LR}}\\text.Riskscore & = {\\text{ 0}}{\\text{.481*CXCL12\\_CXCR4 + 0}}{\\text{.276*VEGFA\\_FLT1 }} \\\\ & {\\text{ + 0}}{\\text{.104*PDGFC\\_ PDGFRA + 0}}{\\text{.056*WNT2\\_SFRP4 }} \\\\ & {\\text{ + 0}}{\\text{.031*HLA - E\\_KLRC1}} \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$\\end{document} The expression levels of four LR-pairs—CXCL12_CXCR4, PDGFRA_PDGFC, TNFSF9_TNFRSF9, and WNT2_SFRP4—showed significant correlation with poor prognosis in patients (Figure S5 S5 p GSE13507 p p 5 Simultaneously, the ROC curve demonstrated the excellent predictive capability of LR.Riskscore (Fig. 5 p S5 To further highlight the benefits of LR.Riskscore for patients, we employed a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model to analyze patient age, gender, clinical stage, T stage, N stage, and LR.Riskscore. The results demonstrated that LR.Riskscore had a significantly superior predictive ability for assessing patient prognosis compared to other clinical factors (HR = 35.82, p 5 5 5 S5 Lastly, considering that different molecular subtypes of bladder cancer are associated with unique treatments and prognoses, we conducted correlation analyses using seven molecular typing criteria (TCGA subtype [ 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 5 S6 Validation of key LR pairs in vitro and in vivo To further validate the results of key receptor-ligand pairs in bladder tumors, we conducted quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to compare their expression levels in normal bladder cells and the human bladder cancer cell line T24. We found that CXCL12_CXCR4, VEGFA_FLT1, PDGFC_PDGFRA, WNT2_SFRP4, and HLA-E_KLRC1 are significantly overexpressed in T24 cells (Figure S5 CXCR4, which is highly expressed in tumor epithelial cells, interacts with surrounding stromal cells and immune cells through the CXCR4-CXCL12 ligand-receptor pairs. To further investigate its role in bladder cancer, we performed immunohistochemistry analysis on specimens collected from Xiangya Hospital. The results showed markedly higher expression of CXCR4 in high-grade bladder cancer compared to low-grade bladder cancer (Fig. 6  Fig. 6 CXCR4 knockdown reduces migration and invasion of BCA cells in vitro. a c e f i p p Simultaneously, we aimed to elucidate the specific role of CXCR4 in bladder cancer cells by conducting CXCR4 knockout experiments in two bladder cancer cell lines (Figure S5 6 6 Immunoinfiltration of different subtypes and clinical correlation Finally, we evaluated Tumor Microenvironment (TME) immune cell infiltration based on LR-Riskscore grouping. Notably, a significant enrichment of immune cells was observed in the high-risk group (refer to Fig. 6 6 6 Finally, we assessed Tumor Microenvironment (TME) immune cell infiltration based on LR.Riskscore grouping. Importantly, we observed a significant enrichment of immune cells in the high-risk group (Fig. 7 7 7 36 37 p 7 7  Fig. 7 Immune and clinical application of LR.Riskscore (LRS). a p p p p b c d e f Discussion In recent years, surgical resection of tumors combined with postoperative intravesical perfusion has been the primary treatment for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). However, patients still face a high risk of recurrence and metastasis. Simultaneously, radical cystectomy combined with pelvic lymph node dissection for muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) has not yielded particularly satisfactory outcomes. Currently, emerging neoadjuvant immunotherapies have shown promising potential in urinary system tumors. For instance, the PD-1 monoclonal antibody Pembrolizumab has demonstrated efficacy in NMIBC, MIBC, and metastatic uroepithelial carcinoma [ 31 32 Gene sequencing technology allows us to better explore changes in protein expression of bladder tumors at the molecular level and identify relevant therapeutic targets [ 38 39 40 The development of single-cell sequencing technology has furthered research on the tumor microenvironment and elucidated interactions between different cell populations [ 41 33 34 37 35 We initially utilized single-cell data from public databases to investigate interactions between malignant tumor cells and other cell populations in the bladder tumor microenvironment. Our findings revealed that receptor ligands such as CXCL14-CXCR4 and CXCL8-ACKR1 play crucial roles in bladder tumor development. The CXCL8-ACKR1 axis has been reported to exert a dual role in promoting and inhibiting tumor progression. Studies have indicated that the CXCL8-ACKR1 axis promotes tumor cell proliferation and migration by up-regulating CXCL8/miR-17 clusters in the interaction between hepatocellular carcinoma and macrophages [ 42 43 44 To further validate our conjecture and enhance the clinical applicability of this prognostic model, we utilized LASSO Cox regression to identify five key acceptor-ligand pairs. These include HLA-E_KLRC1, VEGFA_FLT1, CXCL12_CXCR4, PDGFC_PDGFRA, and WNT2_SFRP4. Upon reviewing existing literature, we observed that these five key molecules all contribute to tumor development through distinct mechanisms. For instance, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, circulating tumor cells can promote immune evasion by upregulating the HLA-E molecule level and binding to the immunosuppressive receptor NKG2A on NK cells. Specific antibodies like Monalizumab or HLA-E knockdown have demonstrated efficacy in inhibiting the seeding and metastasis of circulating tumor cells [ 45 46 47 48 49 In a Phase I/II clinical trial involving glioblastoma, researchers indicated that the CXCL4 inhibitor Prexafol (Mozobil) effectively inhibits tumor angiogenesis and enhances the effectiveness of tumor radiotherapy [ 50 51 52 53 54 Based on the five key receptor-ligand pairs identified for bladder tumors, we constructed a bladder tumor risk assessment model using LASSO Cox regression analysis. Subsequently, we observed that LR.Riskscore significantly correlated with the survival prognosis of patients in the TCGA-BLCA, GSE13507 Simultaneously, to validate the accuracy of our data analysis, we assessed the expression levels of the 5 key acceptor-ligand pairs in bladder tumors using qPCR. Among these, CXCL12_CXCR4 exhibited the most significant intercellular interaction between tumor epithelial cell populations and other cell populations. Given the limited previous literature on this interaction, we sought to explore the cellular effects of the key receptor-ligand pair in bladder tumors, focusing on the tumor ligand CXCR4. CXCR4 is a crucial chemokine receptor known to be closely associated with various hematologic malignancies, including lymphocytic leukemia [ 55 56 57 We observed significant enrichment of immune cells in the LR.Riskscore high-risk group compared to the LR.Riskscore low-risk group, indicating a potential association between immune cell enrichment in bladder tumors and poor patient prognosis. Additionally, we noted a correlation between LR.Riskscore and the expression of multiple immune checkpoints, including CD274, PDCD1, PD-L2, HAVCR2, among others. This suggests that LR.Riskscore may serve as an effective predictor of the immune response in bladder tumors. To further investigate this, we analyzed the Atezolizumab immunotherapy bladder tumor dataset. Results revealed that immunotherapy responsiveness and prognosis were significantly better in the LR.Riskscore high-risk group compared to the LR.Riskscore low-risk group in this dataset. These findings collectively confirm that LR.Riskscore not only effectively evaluates poor prognosis in bladder tumor patients but also serves as a key indicator for predicting the response to immunotherapy in bladder tumors. In previous studies, Chen et al. used bulk-RNA sequencing to develop a prediction model for poor prognosis in bladder tumors based on the interaction of genes EFTUD2, GEMIN7, OAS1, APOBEC3H, TRIM71, DARS2, YTHDC1, and RBMS3 [ 58 59 There are some limitations in this study that warrant attention. Firstly, it is crucial to acknowledge that this study is a retrospective cohort study. Future prospective cohort studies should involve a larger cohort of bladder tumor patients to validate the efficacy of this model in predicting adverse prognosis and immune reactivity in clinical applications. Secondly, the pathological types of bladder tumors primarily comprised urothelial carcinoma in this study, while bladder tumors also encompass squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and other rare pathological types. Therefore, it is essential to assess the predictive ability of LR.Riskscore in rare bladder pathological types in future research. Rhirdly, despite identifying the 5 key receptor-ligand pairs for constructing LR.Riskscore in this study, further cytological and zoological experiments are necessary to elucidate the cellular functions of these pairs in bladder tumors and their impact on the immune microenvironment. Lastly, We selected only one cell line to verify the effect of CXCR4 on bladder cancer cells, and more bladder cancer cell lines will be needed to confirm our findings in the future. Conclusion Our risk prediction model significantly improved the prognosis assessment and immunotherapy responsiveness prediction of bladder cancer patients. This progress offers the possibility of precise and individualized treatment strategies for bladder cancer. Further verification is needed before clinical application.
