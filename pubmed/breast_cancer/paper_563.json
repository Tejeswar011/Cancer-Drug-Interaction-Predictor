Tumor-specific MHC-II (tsMHC-II) expression has been shown to be a predictive biomarker of pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy in early-stage TNBC. We performed biomarker analysis of the phase III NeoTRIP trial where patients were randomized to neoadjuvant carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel±atezolizumab. Imaging mass cytometry was used to assess tsMHC-II expression in tumor samples. TsMHC-II positivity was predefined as ≥5% of tumor cells expressing MHC-II, and at an 80th percentile exploratory cutoff. TsMHC-II positivity was associated with a higher pCR rate in the atezolizumab arm (OR:2.58; P P Subject terms Biomarkers Cancer Immunology Oncology pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Springer Nature Limited 2025 Introduction The anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), is approved for treatment of high-risk early triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) 1 2 3 4 Despite various promising biomarkers, none have been validated to demonstrate clinical utility in early stage TNBC 5 , 6 7 8 9 10 TsMHC-II has been independently identified as a predictor of molecular response to single-agent anti-PD-1 in a small window trial in the early breast cancer setting using a biomarker screening approach 11 12 13 14 15 Results Tumor-specific MHC-II expression predicts ICI benefit A total of 220 FFPE tissues at baseline were available for the present analysis: 109 in the chemotherapy arm and 111 in the chemotherapy plus immunotherapy arm. Using the predefined cutoff of 5% tumor-cell positivity, we found that 41% of all breast cancers assessed expressed ≥5% MHC-II, with no significant differences between treatment arms (42.2% in the chemotherapy alone group and 40.5% in the chemotherapy plus immunotherapy group, respectively; p 1 Table 1 Distribution of MHC-II-positive tumors according to 5% and 80% cutoffs MHC-II groups Treatment arm - no.

While the antibody used for MHC-II detection in situ is consistent with prior studies, the IMC method utilized herein is more sensitive that traditional IHC, immunofluorescence, and RPPA methodologies used in previous analyses 6 14 The results from this study, and prior validations of tsMHC-II, suggest its utility as a specific predictor of immunotherapy benefit in early-stage TNBC. This is in contrast to stromal TILs and PD-L1, which have instead shown clear prognostic value or predictive value to chemotherapy 16 23 1 , 24 25 As additional limitations, atezolizumab and the chemotherapy regimen used in the NeoTRIP trial are different from the current approved regimen, and EFS is not available yet for translational studies. However, the consistency of these results support this as a promising biomarker with potential clinical utility to be demonstrated in correlative analyses of ongoing clinical trials. TsMHC-II is currently under evaluation as a planned integrated biomarker on multiple prospective phase III clinical trials evaluating the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting for patients with TNBC (S1418; NCT02954874 NCT06058377 Methods Study design and prospective tissue collection Breast tumor samples were obtained from patients enrolled in the multi-center, randomized, open-label, phase III NeoTRIP trial 15 n Imaging mass cytometry Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) was used to profile the expression of 43 proteins at subcellular resolution in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor samples. Detailed protocols of IMC analysis have been reported elsewhere 26 Cell phenotypes were assigned by semi-supervised clustering. Cells were first classified as epithelial or tumor microenvironment (TME) cells using multiple classification methods. Thresholds were identified for assigning a cell as ‘positive’ for a given marker by inspecting a random selection of at least 50 images for which cells passing a quantile threshold (calculated using all data) were highlighted. This procedure was repeated at differing quantile thresholds until the value that most closely aligned with marker positivity was identified. For this study, MHC-II-positive tumor cells were identified as the cells expressing the HLA-DR antigen, detected by using the anti-mouse monoclonal antibody TAL1B5 (Abcam) at concentration of 0.5 μg/mL. Although TAL1B5 is labeled to recognize only HLA-DR, prior studies by our group have shown extremely high concordance across tumors with pan-MHC-II (HLA-DR/DP/DQ/DX) antibodies 6 27 Statistical analysis We aimed to evaluate whether the proportion of tumor cells with positive MHC-II status predicts the benefit of adding immunotherapy to NAC. We evaluated pCR rates 15 14 Supplementary information  Supplementary Information Publisher’s note These authors contributed equally: Luca Gianni, H. Raza Ali, Giampaolo Bianchini.
