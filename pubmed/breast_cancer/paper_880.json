In this context, ADH1A (Alcohol Dehydrogenase 1 A), a protein involved in tyrosine metabolism, was comprehensively examined to assess its expression and functional roles in TNBC. A combination of bioinformatics approaches and local tissue analyses was utilized to determine the expression levels of ADH1A in TNBC samples. Genetic manipulation techniques were employed to alter ADH1A expression, and the subsequent effects on TNBC cell behavior were systematically analyzed. This study is the first to report on the alterations of 14 genes related to tyrosine metabolism within the TCGA-TNBC cohorts. Notably, reduced expression of these enzymes is associated with poorer survival outcomes in patients with TNBC. An analysis of the TCGA database revealed reduced levels of ADH1A in human TNBC tissues. Furthermore, ADH1A protein expression was diminished in TNBC tissues of patients who received local treatment, in contrast to the elevated expression observed in adjacent normal tissues. In the MDA-MB-231 and SUM159PT cell lines, ADH1A knockdown significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. On the contrary, ADH1A overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inducing cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, the overexpression of ADH1A may attenuate the malignant characteristics of TNBC cells by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. In conclusion, ADH1A may be a useful biomarker for TNBC prognosis. This study is the first to reveal that ADH1A inhibits the malignant progression of TNBC via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Disruptions in tyrosine metabolism have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various cancers, such as gastroesophageal cancer 4 5 6 Building on these results, we further examined the expression of ADH1A and its potential role and mechanisms of action in TNBC, aiming to elucidate the functional significance and molecular underpinnings of this protein in the progression of TNBC. Materials and methods Data acquisition We obtained gene expression, prognostic, and clinicopathological data related to breast cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, utilizing 1,198 BRCA samples for subsequent analyses. RNA-seq data from normal breast tissues and TNBC samples were obtained from three independent data sets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database ( GSE38959 GSE45827 GSE65194 7 8 GSE76124 9 Clustering analysis An intersection of identified DEGs with the Gene set revealed 14 overlapping TRGs. These TRGs were clustered using the “Consensus Cluster Plus” R package with Euclidean distance and K-means, allowing up to five clusters for stable classification. This process identified two subtypes, and differential gene expression between them was analyzed, using criteria of absolute log2FC > 1 and P Functional enrichment analysis The DAVID Bioinformatics Resources ( https://david.ncifcrf.gov/ 10 P Identification the key genes of TRGs in TNBC Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression is a penalized regression technique employed for variable selection in high-dimensional datasets to construct prognostic models. In this study, we identified significant genes related to tyrosine metabolism from TNBC specimens and conducted optimal cutoff analysis utilizing the “surv_cutpoint” function from the “survminer” R package. Following this, we applied the LASSO method within a Cox regression framework to select the most informative prognostic genes, using the “glmnet” R package, based on the optimal cutoff risk score. TNBC Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups and then subjected to the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis. Analysis of ADH1A expression The expression of ADH1A was analyzed to compare its differential expression between triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissues and normal tissues utilizing the UALCAN platform ( https://ualcan.path.uab.edu/index.html https://kmplot.com/analysis Patients and tissue samples TNBC tissues and corresponding adjacent normal breast tissues were obtained from patients undergoing surgical procedures at the Breast Cancer Surgery Department of the Shanxi Provincial People’s Hospital. None of the patients had received any form of therapy prior to surgery. The tissue samples were collected immediately following tumor excision and preserved at −80 °C. All participants provided informed consent. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanxi Provincial People’s Hospital. Pathological staining To investigate the expression of ADH1A through immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, we employed a tissue microarray comprising 140 breast cancer tissue samples and 77 adjacent normal tissue samples. The IHC staining procedure adhered to established protocols, utilizing anti-ADH1A antibodies (Abcam; ab239875). The stained sections were subsequently mounted and examined using a Nikon microscope. Cell lines and culture The breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and SUM159PT were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Leibovitz’s L15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), whereas SUM159PT cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Both DMEM and RPMI-1640 media were procured from Hyclone. To study the effects of Wnt signaling on cell malignant behavior, cells were treated with 10 µM Laduviglusib (a potent Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway activator; HY-10182; MedChemExpress, China) for 24 h 11 Lentivirus packaging and infection Lentiviral vectors, specifically pGLV3/CMV/GFP-Puro, were procured from GenePharma, located in Shanghai, China. The production of the pLV3-ADH1A and control lentiviruses was carried out following established protocols. Subsequently, cells were transduced with the pLV3-vector and pLV3-ADH1A lentiviruses. Following thorough mixing, the cells were incubated for another 48 h, after which they were collected for western blot analysis. Silencing of the ADH1A gene by SiRNA in TNBC cells Specific siRNAs targeting ADH1A mRNA were designed and procured from GenePharma (Suzhou, China). A scrambled siRNA from GenePharma, which does not target any gene, was used as a negative control. The sequences of the siRNA were as follows: sense strand, 5’-CCGGAUGGACUAUUUCAAUTT-3’, and antisense strand, 5’-AAGUGCCAAUUACGUGUCATT-3’. siRNA transfection was conducted using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Following transfection, the cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis for subsequent evaluation. Cell proliferation assay Cell proliferation was assessed using a standardized assay. Cells were cultured in 96-well plates at a density of 5,000 cells per well for a predetermined period. After a 24-hour treatment, 10 µL of CCK-8 reagent (MedChemExpress, Shanghai, China) was introduced to each well, followed by a 2-hour incubation. Subsequently, the absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a microplate reader to quantify cell proliferation. Wound healing assay Cells were cultured until they reached 80–90% confluency. For the wound healing assay, confluent cells were subjected to serum starvation overnight and subsequently scraped using a sterile 200 µL pipette tip. Following a PBS wash, the cells were incubated in a medium supplemented with 2% FBS. Microscopic images (40× magnification) of the same areas were captured at the initial stage of wound formation and again at 24 h post-wound formation. Cell invasion assay An invasion assay was conducted utilizing Matrigel-coated Transwell membrane inserts with 8-µm pores, as provided by Corning and BD Biosciences Durham, following the manufacturer’s instructions. In summary, after an overnight period of serum starvation, 5 × 10^ 4 Flow cytometric analysis The apoptosis of TNBC cells was assessed using flow cytometry with the Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) Apoptosis Detection Kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Following incubation with FITC-Annexin V and PI, the rates of apoptosis were quantified using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Immunofluorescence staining Cells under the specified conditions were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, they were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS and incubated in a blocking buffer at room temperature for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with a Beta Catenin Polyclonal antibody (Proteintech, Cat.51067) overnight at 4 °C, followed by three washes with PBS. Thereafter, the samples were incubated with a secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. The nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (5 mg/mL, Sigma). Visualization of the cells was performed using a Zeiss AxioVision imaging system (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Measurement of Wnt activity TNBC cells were seeded at a density of 5,000 cells per well in white-bottomed 96-well plates. The cells underwent serum starvation overnight and were subsequently co-transfected with 0.2 µg of either TOPflash or FOPflash expression plasmids (Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA), along with 0.1 µg of the pRL-TK vector (Renilla-TK-luciferase, Promega) as a control, utilizing Lipofectamine 3000 for transfection. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to account for transfection efficiency by dividing it by the Renilla luciferase activity. The ratio of TOPflash to FOPflash (TOP/FOP ratio) served as an indicator of β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity. Average activity and standard deviations were derived from octopulate transfected samples. Western blot analysis Cells were lysed with the highly efficient RIPA buffer (Beyotime). Following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and blocked using TBST buffer with 5% non-fat dry milk. The membrane was incubated overnight with the primary antibody. Following this, the protein was incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for one hour, and visualization was accomplished using ECL chemiluminescence (MedChemExpress). The ADH1A antibody (ab108203) was obtained from Abcam (TX, USA). N-cadherin Polyclonal antibody (Cat.22018), E-cadherin Polyclonal antibody (Cat. 20874), Vimentin Polyclonal antibody (Cat. 22031), Beta Catenin Polyclonal antibody (Cat.51067), Beta actin Polyclonal antibody (Cat.66009) and HRP-labeled secondary antibodies were from Proteintech (Wuhan, China). Statistical analysis A Chi-Square test was conducted to analyze the differences between the two groups. The prognostic significance, specifically overall survival (OS), was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curve analysis in conjunction with a two-tailed log-rank test. Pearson’s correlation analysis was employed to determine the degree of correlation between ADH1A and β-catenin. All statistical analyses were executed using R software (version 4.3.2), with a significance threshold set at P Results Tyrosine metabolism was correlated with prognosis in TNBC Utilizing data from the TCGA-BRCA cohort, we identified a total of 2,794 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at the mRNA level, meeting the criteria of a false discovery rate < 0.05 and an absolute log fold change (|logFC|) ≥ 1 (Fig. 1 1 1 ADH1A ADH1B ADH1C ADH4 DCT DDC AOX1 MAOA AOC2 AOC3 IL4I1 PNMT TH TYRP1 1 p 1  Fig. 1 Identification of Tyrosine Metabolism Genes Influencing TNBC Prognosis.

Primarily, our investigation into the mechanism by which ADH1A influences the function of TNBC cells was confined at cellular level. While this study elucidates ADH1A’s tumor-suppressive mechanism at the cellular level, we acknowledge that validation in in vivo models is warranted to fully characterize its therapeutic potential. Constraints in animal facility capabilities for handling genetically modified TNBC cell lines currently preclude such experiments. Future studies utilizing patient-derived xenografts or alternative models are planned to address this gap. However, the inverse correlation between ADH1A and mesenchymal markers in TNBC cohort clinically mirrors our in vitro findings. This real-world evidence positions ADH1A as a gatekeeper of epithelial phenotype, potentially through β-catenin sequestration. It is noteworthy that genetic variation in ADH1A may lead to phenotypic diversity, including individual genetic variability in susceptibility to substance dependence 31 Conclusion In sum, this study explored TCGA-BRAC databases using bioinformatics methods, identifying TRGs that affect TNBC progression. Decreased AHD1A correlates with poor prognosis in TNBC. In vitro, ADH1A was found to suppress the malignant progression of TNBC through regulating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our findings provide a novel therapeutic target for TNBC. Supplementary Information Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
