We evaluated the added value of Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast density to a validated model combining questionnaire-based risk factors and a 313-variant polygenic risk score (PRS), using the Individualized Coherent Absolute Risk Estimator (iCARE) tool for risk model building and validation. Calibration and discrimination were assessed in three prospective cohorts of European-ancestry women (1468 cases, 19,104 controls): US-based Nurses’ Health Study (NHS I and II) and Mayo Mammography Health Study (MMHS); and Sweden-based Karolinska Mammography Project for Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer (KARMA) study. Analyses were stratified by age (<50, ≥50 years). Adding density modestly improved discrimination: among younger women, AUC increased from 65.6% (95% CI: 61.9–69.3%) to 67.0% (95% CI: 63.5–70.6%); among older women, from 65.5% (95% CI: 63.8–67.2%) to 66.1% (95% CI 64.4–67.8%). Among US women aged 50–70 years, 18.4% were identified at ≥3% 5-year risk with density included, capturing 42.4% of future cases; 7.9% were reclassified, identifying 2.8% more future cases. In Sweden, 10.3% were identified at elevated risk, capturing 29.4% of cases, with 5.3% reclassified and 4.4% more cases identified. Integrating density with established risk factors and PRS may enhance breast cancer risk stratification among European-ancestry women, supporting its potential for clinical utility.

Our risk projection and reclassification calculations in the populations of European-ancestry women aged 50–70 years from the US and Sweden show the improvements in risk stratification attainable by incorporating density to the current literature-based model with questionnaire-based risk factors and PRS. Results Model validation results For women younger than 50 years, the integrated model with questionnaire-based risk factors, PRS and density was generally well calibrated in terms of relative and absolute risk across the risk categories in NHS II and KARMA (Fig. 1 S1A, B 3a S6A Fig. 1 Calibration and discrimination of 5-year risk predictions of breast cancer for women aged younger than 50 years.

Women of European-ancestry aged 50–70 years in the general population of the USA expected to be identified at high risk of breast cancer according to two risk thresholds, and the incident cases of breast cancer expected to occur in these groups within a 5-year interval, comparing the (i) questionnaire-based risk factor and PRS model with (ii) the fully integrated model with questionnaire-based risk factors, PRS and density. The expected number of women is calculated using 2020 ( N 27 60 In the Swedish population, the integrated model identified 10.3% of women aged 50–70 years ≥3% predicted 5-year risk with 29.4% of future cases expected to occur in this group (Table S7 5 S8 5 S7 5 S8 5 Fig. 5 Reclassification of Swedish women at two high-risk thresholds. Women of European-ancestry aged 50–70 years in the general population of the USA expected to be identified at high risk of breast cancer according to two risk thresholds, and the incident cases of breast cancer expected to occur in these groups within a 5-year interval, comparing the (i) questionnaire-based risk factor and PRS model with (ii) the fully integrated model with questionnaire-based risk factors, PRS and density. The expected number of women is calculated using 2016 population estimates ( N 27 60 Discussion We investigated the added value of incorporating breast density to the iCARE-Lit questionnaire-based risk factor and PRS model to predict 5-year absolute risk of breast cancer among women of European-ancestry. The addition of density to the model resulted in a modest improvement in risk stratification and reclassification. For instance, incorporating density identified an additional 2.8 and 4.4% of future cases at and above a 3% predicted 5-year risk threshold and an additional 2.2 and 2.5% of future cases at and above a 6% predicted 5-year risk threshold in populations of European-ancestry in the USA and Sweden, respectively. The model’s ability to stratify more women above and below clinically relevant risk thresholds would lead to more women being rightfully allocated to high and low-risk categories and, therefore, able to qualify for risk-reducing strategies. Our model, with an AUC of 67.1% (Table S6A S6B The implementation of such risk-stratified screening and prevention strategies of breast cancer in the population is a key goal of risk prediction efforts. Currently, two non-inferiority trials, WISDOM 24 25 26 27 Our model incorporating density showed some signs of miscalibration at the extremes of the distribution. Since the model is literature-based with the relative risks derived using a literature review, it is subject to structural assumptions about the underlying model. For women younger than 50 years, we obtained an age-adjusted relative risk for density from ref. 19 28 29 4 7 30 33 34 35 Our validation was conducted using three relatively old prospective cohorts of women of European-ancestry in the USA and Sweden, which may not be fully representative of the general population. In particular, MMHS and KARMA cohorts consist of women participating in annual or biannual screening programs, respectively, and the NHS cohort is comprised of nurses, both of which are groups that tend to have higher educational attainment and healthier lifestyles compared with the general population. While this could influence the calibration of absolute risk, the calibration of relative risk estimates is less likely to be substantially affected. Importantly, since the primary application of our model is within breast cancer screening contexts, these cohorts remain highly relevant for our aims. Nevertheless, further validation is needed in more representative and contemporary populations, particularly those more closely aligned with the target settings of integrated healthcare systems, such as the CONNECT for Cancer Prevention Study 36 This paper has a notable strength in the breadth of the validation, as it assesses the model’s performance across three different studies with participants coming from two populations of European-ancestry women in the US and Sweden. Other validation studies either included a smaller number of participants or used combinations of a limited set of risk factors and polygenic risk scores (PRS) with fewer genetic variants (Table S9 16 20 37 39 37 35 38 40 43 16 22 21 40 44 45 46 48 In addition to incorporating additional mammographic features, future advancements in breast cancer risk prediction should aim to distinguish between less and more aggressive subtypes, in situ vs. invasive lesions, and ultimately, between cancers that are likely to be lethal and those that are not. Since subtypes of breast cancer differ in their risk-factor associations and preventive strategies are often tailored to specific subtypes (e.g., based on estrogen receptor status), subtype-specific risk models could improve the identification of women most likely to benefit from targeted interventions. In contrast, our current model—like many widely used tools—estimates the absolute risk of developing any breast cancer, irrespective of subtype or prognosis. While it does not predict breast cancer–specific mortality, it remains a valuable resource for guiding primary prevention and early detection. Although not all incident breast cancers are life-threatening, reducing overall incidence, including less aggressive forms, may help mitigate the burden of overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and associated morbidity. Ultimately, while models predicting the risk of lethal disease represent a critical future direction 49 To summarize, the incorporation of density to questionnaire-based risk factors and PRS results in modest improvements in the identification of European-ancestry women at elevated breast cancer risk. Additional prospective validation in diverse populations, in particular of non-European-ancestry women, are needed to ensure equitable clinical application. Methods Study populations Model validation analyses were performed in three case-control samples nested in prospective cohort studies of European-ancestry women: the US-based Nurses’ Health Study (NHS I and II) and Mayo Mammography Health Study (MMHS), and the Sweden-based Karolinska Mammography Project for Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer (KARMA) study. In total, analyses were carried out in 1468 cases and 19,104 controls and were done separately for women younger (NHS II, KARMA; 280 cases, 5037 controls) and older than 50 years (NHS I, MMHS, KARMA; 1188 cases, 14,067 controls). Women with a prior history of breast and other cancers, except for nonmelanoma skin cancer, were excluded from the study. Women consented to the use of their genetic material, mammogram with density and completed a risk-factor questionnaire. For women with multiple mammograms or multiple questionnaires, the data closest to the DNA collection were used. In MMHS, density was obtained from routine clinical examination by attending radiologists. All four mammogram views (craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique for ipsilateral and contralateral sides) contribute to the assessment of density 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 S1 S2 Breast cancer outcome was ascertained through linkage to SEER registries, state tumor registries, and pathology databases. A woman was considered a case when she developed incident primary breast cancer, either in situ or invasive, during the follow-up period. The follow-up for all subjects began one year after study entry. This was designed to reduce the impact of prevalent cancers, those already present at the time of screening, on the validation analyses. Follow-up ended at the last record of cancer registry linkage or 5 years, whichever came first. Risk model development We used iCARE 6 The questionnaire-based risk factors included were ages at menarche, first birth and menopause, parity, height, BMI, alcohol intake, family history (i.e., presence/absence of breast cancer in at least one first-degree relative), history of benign breast disease, oral contraceptive use, menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) use, and current MHT type. Our previous works 7 8 5 8 1 57 19 58 An individual-level reference dataset of risk factors, representative of the underlying country’s population, was used to estimate the joint distribution of risk factors and absolute risk projections in the respective population. For the US population, the majority of the risk factors were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2008, 2010, and 2012 as previously described 8 www.bcsc-research.org For the Swedish population, the reference dataset was generated using data on subjects with no diagnosis of breast cancer and with no missing information for the risk-factor variables from the prospective cohort KARMA. The sources for building the reference datasets for each country may be found in Table S4 Lastly, the marginal age-specific disease incidence rates are provided by the United States’ Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry, 2008–2012. Competing mortality rates due to causes other than breast cancer was obtained from the CDC WONDER database 2008–2012. Model validation We evaluated models predicting 5-year absolute breast cancer risk prospectively for calibration and discriminatory accuracy. We considered models with only questionnaire-based risk factors, questionnaire-based risk factors and density, questionnaire-based risk factors and PRS, a model with density and PRS, and lastly, a fully integrated model with questionnaire-based risk factors, PRS and density. Calibration refers to the model’s ability to accurately predict the absolute risk of breast cancer. We evaluate calibration by estimating the ratio of expected-to-observed (E/O) number of cases, the calibration slope and intercept. To assess calibration, the individual subjects were stratified in low to high-risk categories based on deciles of both predicted 5-year absolute risk and their relative risk score. For each category, the average predicted absolute risk and relative risk scores were computed. The E/O ratio was calculated overall (and within each category), first using the predicted absolute risk. The expected-to-observed ratio is defined as the ratio of the average expected absolute risk and the proportion of observed cases, overall and by category. We assessed model calibration using the Hosmer-Lemeshow (HL) goodness-of-fit test, where the HL statistic approximately follows a χ 2 The discriminatory accuracy of the model is assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) based on the 5-year absolute risk and relative risk scores. AUC is defined as the probability that the risk for a randomly selected case is higher than the risk for a randomly selected control. An AUC of 50% corresponds to a model with no discriminatory power, while 100% corresponds to perfect discrimination. The AUC was estimated empirically as the proportion of case-control pairs in which the risk of the case is higher than that of the control. The 95% Wald-based confidence intervals for AUC using the asymptotic variance formula were computed 59 Adjustment for nested sampling The fully integrated model incorporated a 313-SNP PRS and BI-RADS breast density. In all validation cohorts, BI-RADS density and the genotype data on SNPs used to calculate the PRS was available for a nested case-control study. To reflect the underlying full cohort, all calculations are adjusted using sampling weights using the inverse-probability weighted (IPW) approach. Weights are defined by the probability of selection of subjects to the nested case-control sample from the full cohort. The probability of selection is estimated by fitting a logistic regression model with age of study entry, follow-up time, the matching factors, and interactions of case/control status with age of study entry and follow-up time to the entire underlying cohort, where the outcome is defined as whether the individual is included or not. All standard errors and 95% Wald-based confidence intervals were calculated using influence function-based variance estimators that account for sampling weights. Risk reclassification Improvements in risk stratification resulting from the incorporation of density to a model with questionnaire-based risk factors and PRS were assessed among women of European-ancestry aged 50–70 years in the populations of the US and Sweden by calculating the number of women and future cases identified to be at high-risk based on pre-specified 5-year absolute risk thresholds. We used two high-risk thresholds: 3%, which corresponds to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation for risk-reducing interventions 60 24 25 All analyses were performed using R version 3.6.2 ( www.r-project.org Ethics declaration All contributing studies received approval from their respective local institutional review boards.
