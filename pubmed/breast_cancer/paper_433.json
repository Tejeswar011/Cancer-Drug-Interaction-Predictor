The primary objectives of our study were to understand the underlying mechanisms of primary resistance and to identify potential biomarkers. METHODS We selected more than 800 patients in 3 subcohorts (Discovery, n n n RESULTS TP53 CONCLUSION Our results highlight the potential of PERCI to guide personalized endocrine therapy and improve patient outcomes.

However, up to 40% of patients diagnosed with operable ER-positive and/or progesterone receptor–positive (PR-positive), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2–negative (HER2-negative) (i.e. luminal) tumors relapse during or after adjuvant ET ( 1 ESR1 2 4 5 8 Neoadjuvant therapy trials with short-term ET prior to surgery can help to study endocrine resistance. Effective ET inhibits tumor cell growth, as evidenced by a decrease in the Ki67 labeling index ( 9 11 The WSG-ADAPT trial, which has enrolled more than 5,600 patients with luminal BC to date, including 2,290 in the ET subtrial, provides a novel approach to investigating endocrine resistance ( 12 In this study, a discovery cohort and a validation cohort of ET-responsive and nonresponsive patients were subsampled from the WSG-ADAPT trial. We aimed to identify recurrent genomic and epigenomic aberrations associated with primary resistance using targeted NGS and DNA methylation analysis. We hypothesized that these aberrations could provide biomarkers for the aggressive subtype of HR-positive luminal BC and allow the development of predictive models for ET response. We validated our findings in a second validation cohort and the TCGA BRCA cohort and provide survival data for the combined WGS-ADAPT cohorts. Our results provide insight into the different mechanisms of resistance to TAM and AI and thus suggest a way to overcome resistance by starting with or switching to the drug that is not affected. Results Study design and patient selection. The WSG-ADAPT trial ( NCT01779206 12 13 Supplemental Table 1 https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI177813DS1 n n n Figure 1 Supplemental Tables 1 and 2 n n n Supplemental Tables 1 and 3 n n n 14 Supplemental Tables 1 and 4 Histologic grade changes correlate with Ki67 staining in response to pET. In the discovery cohort ( Supplemental Table 2 Figure 2A Supplemental Figure 1A Figure 2B Figure 2C Figure 2D Figure 2E Supplemental Figure 2A Supplemental Figure 3A Figure 2F Figure 2G Since cases in validation cohort 1 were not matched, we observed significant differences in several clinico-pathological parameters (age, histology type, pT, pN, grade, E-cadherin, Ki67, luminal subtype, RS groups) between the discovery cohort and validation cohort 1 at baseline ( Supplemental Table 5 P –4 P –3 Figure 2H Supplemental Figure 1B Figure 2I Figure 2J Figure 2K Figure 2L Supplemental Table 3 Supplemental Figure 2B Supplemental Figure 3B Supplemental Table 3 Figure 2M Figure 2N Supplemental Table 3 In summary, TAM cases had lower grade and RS scores than AI cases in both cohorts. PR staining inversely correlated with RS grouping. In cases receiving AI, PR staining was consistently lower after pET than at baseline. Recurrent TP53 mutations in luminal BC promote resistance to pET. We performed NGS panel sequencing to identify recurrent genomic alterations (RGA) indicating pET resistance ( Supplemental Table 6 PIK3CA GATA3 CCND1 FGF3, FGF19 Figure 3, A and B 15 18 CDH1 17 19 CDH1 CDH1 CDH1 Supplemental Figure 3 In the discovery cohort, point mutations in ABCA13 P CBFB P Figure 3C CBFB P Figure 3D We observed significantly more ESR1 P Figure 3D FGFR2 P Figure 3C TP53 Supplemental Figure 3A TP53 14 20 TP53 P P Figure 3C P P Figure 3D We analyzed the most prominent RGA separately by alteration type ( Figure 3E ESR1 TP53 TP53 P MAP3K1 P CCND1 GATA3 RYR2 P In conclusion, we found several significant differences in the incidence of RGA between responders and nonresponders. With a frequency of up to 32% in AI NR cases, TP53 Different alterations in the DNA methylome contribute to resistance to pET with TAM and AI. Previous studies have reported that ET resistance leads to adaptations in chromatin structure and DNA methylome ( 5 7 P Supplemental Figure 4A Supplemental Table 7 Supplemental Figure 4B We observed distinct patterns of methylation changes in the 2 treatment groups. In TAM-treated cases, 90% DMS were hypomethylated in nonresponders compared with responders ( Figure 4A Supplemental Figure 4C Figure 4A 21 Supplemental Figure 4D In the AI group, approximately 80% DMS were hypermethylated in NR versus R ( Figure 4B Supplemental Figure 4C Supplemental Table 7 Supplemental Figure 4D We used NanoString BC360 gene expression data to evaluate the effects of methylation on 3 genes linked to DMS ( Supplemental Table 8 EYA4 SPRY2 RAS MAPK SPRY2 Supplemental Figure 4E SPRY2 r P –12 Supplemental Table 7 CALML5 CALML5 Supplemental Figure 4F r r Supplemental Figure 4G In summary, we identified distinct methylation changes in the TAM versus AI cohorts. TAM DMS were mostly less methylated in the NR versus R group and were associated with PMDs. Conversely, AI DMS were more methylated in the NR versus R group, located in gene regulatory regions and associated with developmental transcription factors, hypoxia, and estrogen signaling. We identified several BC-related genes with significant inverse correlations between methylation and gene expression. pET resistance is associated with changes in composition of the tumor microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment (TME) may play a role in the development of ET resistance ( 22 Figure 4, C and D Supplemental Figure 5 Figure 2, E and L Supplemental Figure 5C 23 P –16 P –16 Developing the Predictive Endocrine ResistanCe Index. After identifying genomic and epigenomic differences between responders and nonresponders in the discovery cohort, we used lasso penalized logistic regression to train classifiers for TAM and AI resistance, which we named Predictive Endocrine ResistanCe Index (PERCI) ( Figure 5A ABCA13 Figure 5B Supplemental Table 1 Supplemental Table 1 Supplemental Table 7 ABCA13 Supplemental Figure 6 Figure 5C Table 1 Supplemental Table 9 Strong performance of PERCI TAM was confirmed in validation cohort 1, with a ROC-AUC of 83%, which outperformed clinico-pathological parameters (ROC-AUC in a range of 44.8% [ER% baseline] to 72.6% [RS group information], Supplemental Table 10 PERCI AI includes patient age, ESR1 FGFR2 TP53 Figure 5D HOXC4 HOXC4 r P –15 Supplemental Table 1 Supplemental Table 7 The DMS selected for PERCI AI achieved ROC-AUC values from 67.1% to 74.4% ( Supplemental Figure 7 Figure 5E Table 1 In validation cohort 1, we obtained a ROC-AUC of 76.9%, and PERCI AI was better at correctly predicting the responder group. Several clinico-pathological parameters with significant differences between responders and nonresponders in validation cohort 1 (PR% baseline, Ki67, RS group, Luminal subtype, Figure 2 Supplemental Table 10 In the discovery cohort, both PERCI TAM and PERCI AI effectively discriminated between R and NR, even when the cohort was split into RS groups, despite RS being used in the matched-pair design ( Figure 5, F and G Figure 5F Supplemental Figures 2 In summary, our novel predictors PERCI TAM and PERCI AI combine information on genomic alterations, patient age, TME composition, and differential methylation, with equal or better performance than existing predictors such as the Oncotype DX recurrence score. ROC-AUCs of 83% for TAM and 76.9% for AI confirmed the predictive performance of PERCI in validation cohort 1. Adapting PERCI to the Illumina 450k platform and validation in a second WGS-ADAPT trial validation cohort. The multi-criteria nature of PERCI may limit its applicability in clinical settings where not all data modalities are readily available. Therefore, we trained a streamlined version of PERCI, using only methylation data and age. We restricted CpG sites to those that overlapped between EPIC and the widely available Illumina 450k array, with mean methylation differences of greater than or equal to 5% and various significance thresholds (Methods). PERCI TAM 450k contains age and methylation information for 40 CpG sites mostly hypomethylated in TAM-NR ( Supplemental Figure 8A Supplemental Table 1 Supplemental Figure 8B Supplemental Table 1 Table 2 Supplemental Figure 8 P Supplemental Figure 8 To test PERCI 450k in an independent validation cohort, we selected patients from the WGS-ADAPT run-in period ( Supplemental Tables 1 and 4 Figure 6A Supplemental Table 4 Figure 6B Figure 6C Supplemental Tables 1–4 Figure 6, D and E Supplemental Table 11 Both simplified PERCI 450k scores demonstrated very good performance in stratifying the response groups, with ROC-AUC values of 88.9% for PERCI TAM 450k and 85% for PERCI AI 450k ( Figure 6, F and G Figure 6, F and G Figure 6, H and I P Figure 6J Figure 5F Figure 6K These data demonstrate the robustness of our newly developed classifiers and suggest that they could improve the effectiveness of existing patient stratification tools such as the Recurrence Score. External validation of PERCI 450k in the TCGA BRCA cohort. For further testing in an external cohort, we selected 269 cases from the TCGA BRCA cohort that met our selection criteria (Methods). Patients were stratified by menopausal status into a TAM-like cohort ( n n Supplemental Tables 12 and 13 PIK3CA, TP53, CDH1 RYR2, GATA2, FGFR1 Supplemental Figure 9 CBFB We divided the TCGA BRCA subcohort into PERCI 450k high and low groups, using progression-free survival within 10 years as a surrogate for ET response (PERCI TAM 450k high n n Figure 7A P Figure 7C P Figure 7F Figure 2I Supplemental Table 14 PERCI AI 450k high ( n Figure 7B n P Figure 7D P –3 P P Figure 7, E, G, and H Supplemental Tables 12 and 13 Supplemental Table 14 In conclusion, these results suggest that PERCI may not only be a predictor of primary endocrine resistance but may also have prognostic value. PERCI predicts survival outcomes in the combined discovery and validation cohorts. The recent availability of survival data in the WSG-ADAPT trial allowed us to investigate the prognostic value of PERCI. For PERCI, patients from the discovery and validation cohort 1 were combined; for PERCI 450k we also added patients from validation cohort 2. The median follow-up duration was 59.8 months, so the number of invasive and distant disease-free survival (IDFS, DDFS) events and deaths is still limited (combined TAM cohorts: 30 [8.2%], 27 [7.4%], 13 [3.5%]; combined AI cohorts: 35 [11.8%], 32 [10.7%], 17 [5.7%], Table 3 Table 3 We divided the patients into high and low PERCI 450k groups according to treatment-specific cutoffs (TAM: high group 41.6% of patients, low group 58.4% of patients; AI: high group 37.9% of patients, low group 62.1% of patients). Kaplan Meier analyses showed that for all survival outcomes, the risk of an event was significantly higher in the high groups than in the low groups (TAM: IDFS log rank P P P P P P Figure 8 Discussion The clinical definition of endocrine resistance in BC implies progression or relapse during ET over a period of 6 months to 2 years ( 24 Primary endocrine resistance can be assessed by a diminished or absent proliferative BC response to short-term pET, as evidenced by in situ detection of the proliferation-associated nuclear Ki67 antigen ( 9 12 25 26 27 16 26 Figure 2A Supplemental Table 2 The mechanisms underlying primary ET resistance can be diverse ( 28 29 Figure 5A ERS1, FGFR2, TP53 ABCA13 Somatic mutations associated with primary resistance are often detected by their prevalence in metastatic lesions when compared with primary BC ( 30 ESR1 ESR1 ESR1 31 ESR1 ERS1 ESR1 We found that FGFR2 FGFR2 32 TP53 30 TP53 Figure 3C Figure 3D Ki67 TP53 26 TP53 33 20 ABCA13 Figure 3C 34 ABCA13 26 In addition to genomic alterations and age, PERCI includes DNA methylation differences between responders and nonresponders and cell type composition ( Figures 4 5 21 EYA4, Supplemental Figure 4E EYA4 35 SPRY2 SPRY2 Supplemental Figure 4E Supplemental Table 7 SPRY2 36 SPRY2 37 Supplemental Figure 4D 28 38 39 The DNA methylome associated with AI resistance was characterized by a predominant gain in methylation. For a subset of the AI DMS, methylation correlated positively with gene expression. Many of these hypermethylated, upregulated genes belong to the developmental transcription factor family ( 40 41 GATA2 42 HOXC4 43 HOXB13 44 HOXC13 45 MNX1 46 OTX1 47 PAX7 SOX2 48 WT1 49 HOXC4 HOXC4 50 EPSTI1 EPSTI1 51 EPSTI1 Supplemental Table 7 Figure 7B CALML5 Supplemental Figure 4 CALML5 52 CALML5 53 AI DMS-associated genes were enriched in gene sets related to hypoxia ( 54 Supplemental Figure 4D HIF-1 55 55 ELOVL2 56 ELOV2 Supplemental Table 7 Previous research on epigenetic mechanisms in ET resistance have focused on cell culture models of acquired resistance to ER antagonists. Similar to our observations with TAM, early work by Fan et al. reported predominant hypomethylation rather than methylation gain in long-term cultured HR+ BC cell lines ( 5 PBX1 6 PBX1 Stone et al. postulated that hypermethylation of ER-responsive enhancers defines endocrine sensitivity in BC ( 7 DNA methylation is a stable epigenetic mark of cellular identity ( 57 Supplemental Figure 5 TP53 Limitations to the use of PERCI in clinical settings may include sample size, quality of DNA from FFPE tissue, or instrumentation and budget constraints that limit the generation of high-quality NGS data ( 58 Supplemental Figure 8 59 60 Figure 6 Table 2 Figure 7 Figure 8 The Oncotype DX Recurrence Score (RS) is a test that estimates the risk of distant recurrence based on the expression of 21 genes ( 61 Conclusions. This study provides evidence that the cellular pathways of endocrine resistance to TAM and AI are influenced by distinct genetic and epigenetic alterations. The delineation of differences between the mechanisms of primary endocrine resistance between the 2 mainstays of standard ET in BC opens the perspective of overcoming resistance by starting with the drug not affected by resistance markers or subsequently switching from one drug to the other. PERCI, as a validated biomarker of endocrine resistance, can be readily used for risk stratification in future therapeutic trials in BC. Methods Sex as a biological variable. BC in men is rare, with only 0.5%–1% of BC cases occurring in men ( 62 Participants in the WGS-ADAPT trial are predominantly white. Race was not considered as a biological variable. Clinico-patholocial data acquisition. FFPE specimens were prepared from baseline and post-pET tumor biopsies from all patients and were submitted for histologic rereview and immunohistochemistry to the ADAPT Study Central Reference pathology at Hannover Medical School. Expression of ER, PR, HER2, and Ki67 protein were assessed using standardized methods ( 12 63 The TCGA BRCA cohort was subsampled ( n Supplemental Table 12 n n 64 Next generation target sequencing and variant calling. After manual microdissection to enrich for invasive tumor cells, DNA was extracted using the Maxwell RSC DNA FFPE kit on a Maxwell RSC instrument (Promega), and quality control tested (post-QC, discovery cohort, n n ABCA13, CBFB, CDH1, ERBB2, ERCC2, ESR1, FAT1, FAT2, FAT3, GATA3, MAP3K1, MUTYH, PIK3CA, RUNX1, RYR2, TBX3, TP53 14 65 DNA methylation preprocessing and cell type deconvolution. DNA (range 84–1,400 ng) was submitted to the DKFZ Genome and Proteome core facility for methylation analysis using HumanMethylationEPIC (EPIC) BeadChips (Illumina), including a restore step for FFPE material. Validation cohort 2 was analyzed using Infinium MethylationEPIC v2.0 BeadChips. We downloaded reference datasets from GEO for 6 immune cell types ( GSE110554 GSE74877 66 GSE68379 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 https://github.com/gk-zhang/InfiniumEPICMethylation.hg19/tree/main 74 75 76 77 n 23 2 Building of the PERCI. Predictive indices of endocrine resistance were constructed from discovery cohort features using lasso penalized logistic regression with the R package glmnet (version 4.1–3). Internal cross validation was used to determine model hyperparameters ( 78 79 Supplemental Table 1 P Each model is composed of predictors and coefficients. PERCI TAM and AI scores were calculated as the weighted sum of the predictor values multiplied by the model coefficients. PERCI scores were scaled to a range (from 0 to 1) by dividing the original score by the difference between the theoretical maximum score and the theoretical minimum score, obtained by assigning a (beta) value of 1/0 to CpG sites or mutated genes with positive coefficients and 0/1 to those with negative coefficients. For patient age and cell type information, the median values of the discovery cohort data were used for the calculation of both theoretical maximum and minimum score. Accuracy, precision (equal to the positive predictive value), and recall from the pROC output were used to evaluate the performance of the prediction models. We defined the scaled PERCI score with the highest accuracy as a treatment-specific cut off for PERCI low and high groups. F1 score was calculated as 2 × precision × recall/(precision + recall) Constructing PERCI 450k. PERCI 450k models and scaled scores were constructed as described above, using only patient age and CpG sites covered on the 450k array, with a mean methylation difference ≥ 5% and P P P P Survival analyses of the WGS-ADAPT trial subcohorts. Survival analyses were conducted to predict invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS), and overall survival (OS). IDFS is defined as the time interval from randomization until invasive local and/or regional relapse, invasive contralateral BC, invasive second malignancy, distant relapse, or death by any cause; DDFS as the time interval from randomization until distant events comprise distant relapse or death by any cause and OS as the time interval from randomization until death by any cause. To estimate the relationship parameters between PERCI and survival outcomes, PERCI (original and scaled versions) was used as a continuous variable with univariate Cox Proportional Hazards models or as a dichotomized variable based on treatment-specific cut off values. As PERCI scores are treatment specific, the models considered the treatment-specific subcohorts, and analyses were stratified for the discovery and validation cohorts. Risk differences between groups with lower and higher PERCI score values were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier plots. Log-rank tests were performed for between-group significance tests. Significance levels for all statistical tests was 5% and no adjustments for multiple testing were performed. Statistics. In the discovery cohort with matched design, McNemar’s test for symmetry was used to compare R and NR patients for clinical variables. In the validation cohort, the chi-squared test for trends was used to compare Ki67 at baseline and Ki67 post-pET, and Fisher’s exact test was used for all other comparisons. The relationship between clinical variables and TAM and AI prediction scores was calculated using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare RGA frequencies between responders and nonresponders in each treatment group (minimum 7.5% RGA frequency in at least one of the subgroups (TAM, AI, NR, R) in the discovery or validation cohort 1), and to test the significant difference of clinico-pathological variables between the PERCI 450k score high and low groups ( Supplemental Table 12 P Study approval.
