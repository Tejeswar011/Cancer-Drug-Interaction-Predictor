The authors identify clinically relevant cellular interactions and recurrent cellular neighborhoods in the TME of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and characterize patient groups that could potentially benefit from TME-targeted therapies. Abstract Recent studies have explored the composition of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) However, cell-to-cell interactions, along with the spatial organization of DLBCL TME and their impact on patient outcomes, have remained poorly characterized. We applied multiplex immunofluorescence, cell phenotyping, and neighborhood analysis to investigate 1,218,756 single cells in 99 samples from patients with primary DLBCL. We identified 17 cell phenotypes and 10 recurrent cellular neighborhoods (RCN) across samples, subdividing DLBCLs into immune-poor areas and areas with diverse immune cell infiltrates.

Although anthracycline-based immunochemotherapy is curative in most patients ( 1 2 3 Based on the cell-of-origin (COO), DLBCL NOS is divided into germinal center B cell (GCB) and activated B cell–like (ABC) DLBCLs, and based on common genetic aberrations, genetic subtypes within the COO subtypes have been identified ( 4 7 8 9 10 11 10 12 13 21 Lymphomas with different TMEs also have different molecular characteristics, highlighting the diverse mechanisms they recruit to survive in distinct environments. For instance, overactivation of the NF-κB pathway is common in inflamed lymphomas, and evasion from the rich immune infiltrate can occur by downregulation of HLA I and II or by upregulation of immune checkpoint molecules, such as PD-1 and PD-L1 ( 11 22 28 29 31 The cellular contexture of different cancers, including DLBCLs, has recently been found not to be arranged randomly but rather in an organized manner, in which cells form distinct cellular neighborhoods that are shared among individuals ( 19 21 32 34 18 Materials and Methods Patients and samples The multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) cohort consisted of 99 patients diagnosed with primary DLBCL NOS between the years 2001 and 2013 ( Table 1 2 3 35 36 8 9 7 37 Table 1.

We detected PD-L1 and FOXP3 using primary antibodies produced in different species and Alexa Fluor 647 and Alexa Fluor 750 fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies and counterstained nuclei using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). We then mounted the slides and acquired whole-slide fluorescence images. After performing the first round of staining, we removed the coverslips by washing the slides in wash buffer at 4°C. Then to remove the Alexa Fluor signals from the previous round of staining, we bleached the slides by first soaking the slides in TBS buffer containing 25 mmol/L NaOH and 4.5% H 2 2 Due to weak IF signal, Tbet was excluded from further analyses. We used Ilastik v.1.3.3 (RRID: SCR_015246) software to filter out areas with staining artifacts. Data on cases with an inflamed and noninflamed TME was available from previous mIF analyses ( 18 2 17 Imaging We acquired all whole-slide fluorescence images at a resolution of 0.325 µm/pixel using Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 with Zeiss 20X (0.8 NA, M27) Plan-Apochromat objective, Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0 V2 Digital CMOS camera (16-bit), and Zeiss Colibri.7 LED Light Source. For fluorescence imaging, we used DAPI cube (Zeiss Filter Set 02), FITC cube (Zeiss Filter Set 38 HE), Cy3 cube (Chroma Technology Corp 49004 ET CY3/R), Cy5 cube (Chroma Technology Corp 49006 ET CY5), and Cy7 cube (Chroma Technology Corp 49007 ET CY7) filter sets. After image acquisition, we converted the images to JPEG2000 format at 100% quality and stored them as 8-bit greyscale images. Cell segmentation We segmented nuclei using NucleAIzer (RRID: SCR_026500), a pretrained deep learning segmentation model ( 39 40 Cell phenotyping For cell phenotyping, we first performed the Phenograph algorithm (100 neighbors) using the Rphenograph (RRID: SCR_022603) package in R v.4.3.1 (RRID: SCR_001905) to receive 33 different clusters ( 41 + + − + − + 32 Cell interaction analyses We performed cell–cell interaction analyses using the scimap package (Python V3.9; ref. 32 Identification of RCNs We identified RCNs by first constructing a neighborhood matrix using the defined cell phenotypes, followed by latent Dirichlet allocation with 10 motifs (default) using the sm.tl.spatial_lda function in the scimap package (Python v3.9; refs. 32 42 20 21 Statistical analyses We performed all statistical analyses with R v.4.3.1 and Python v3.9. For unsupervised hierarchical clustering analyses, we used Euclidean distance and Ward linkage in the pheatmap package. We estimated the prognostic significance of each variable using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models and the difference in survival between different patient groups using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were defined as the time from diagnosis to death from any cause and the time from diagnosis to progression or death from any cause, respectively. We sought the optimal cutoff for the distance between different RCNs using the maxstat R package (RRID: SCR_025679). We compared two or more groups using Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal–Wallis H tests, respectively. We corrected P P Data availability The mIF images, as well as the raw single-cell data extracted from the images, have been uploaded to Zenodo, https://zenodo.org/ Results The cellular composition of the TME in DLBCL NOS The study population consisted of 99 patients with primary DLBCL NOS treated with standard immunochemotherapy. Patient demographics are described in Table 1 First, we characterized the composition of the TME in DLBCL NOS. We identified 1,218,756 single cells with a median of 12,354 (range, 2,504–28,671) cells per sample. Based on phenotyping using the Phenograph algorithm and manual thresholding, we identified 17 different cell phenotypes, covering distinct B cells, T cells, and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM; Fig. 1A–D Fig. 1B Fig. 1E F + + + + P Figure 1. Cellular composition of DLBCL NOS ( n A, B, C, D, E, th th F, n Avoidance of B cells and PD-1 + Next, we sought to explore the spatial interactions of immune cells within DLBCL samples. First, we studied which cell types were attracted to each other and which cell types avoided each other ( Fig. 2A Fig. 2A + Figure 2.

We found great heterogeneity regarding which cell types were attracted and which cell types avoided each other across the samples. Especially interactions between immune cells and B cells and interactions between different T cells varied. To find out whether certain cell interaction patterns were associated with clinical characteristics and patient outcomes, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering on different T cell–B cell interactions. DLBCLs clustered into two groups based on the interactions between B cells and PD-1 + Fig. 2B C + + − + + + + + P P P + − P P + P P Fig. 2D E Identification of RCNs in DLBCL NOS To further uncover the spatial structures in the TME of DLBCL NOS, we investigated whether cells are regularly organized in cellular neighborhoods that are shared between samples. To identify RCNs, we first created a neighborhood matrix of all cells and cellular phenotypes with their 19 nearest neighbors and performed a latent Dirichlet allocation analysis ( 42 Fig. 3A B Fig. 3C Fig. 3D + Figure 3. Identification of RCNs in DLBCL NOS ( n A, B, Fig. 1A C, D, E F, E + F G H, G + H GCB and ABC DLBCLs also differed in their RCN composition. Specifically, GCB DLBCLs consisted of a larger proportion of the M1-like TAM-rich RCN8 (adj. P + P Fig. 3E F When we correlated the RCN compositions in DLBCLs with the expression of HLA and B2M, we found that B2M and HLA-ABC–positive lymphomas consisted of a smaller proportion of the B cell rich with immune cells RCN1 (adj.

Survival was better in patients in whose lymphomas CD8 + P Fig. 4C G Fig. 4D + + P Fig. 4E–G + + P + P P + + P P RCNs in different LME subtypes, lymphoma ecotypes, and genetic subtypes We next sought to identify whether the RCNs correlated with the subtypes determined by the composition of TME ( 8 9 Fig. 5A B + Fig. 5A C Figure 5.

Despite the poor efficacy of PD-1– and PD-L1–targeting immunotherapies in DLBCL ( 30 + Our results are consistent with the principal notion of immune-poor and immune cell–rich cellular neighborhoods ( 19 21 To conclude, we found translationally relevant interactions in the TME of DLBCL NOS that indicate a dependency on immune checkpoint molecules in the inhibition of the immune response against the lymphoma. Additionally, we found that DLBCL NOS is composed of 10 RCNs that vary in their frequency and spatial organization, which has clinical significance. The knowledge gained from this study increases our understanding of the spatial organization of DLBCL and may have translational potential in the selection of patients for immunotherapies.
