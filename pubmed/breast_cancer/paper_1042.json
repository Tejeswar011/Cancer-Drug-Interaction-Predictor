Materials and Methods 2.1. General Experimental Procedures Macroscopic and microscopic observation was performed on a stereomicroscope (S Apo, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and a microscope (DM1000, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) coupled with a camera (MC170HD, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Metabolite profiling and purity control were performed via UHPLC-PDA-ELSD-MS on an ACQUITY UPLC I-Class system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with an ACQUITY UPLC photodiode array detector (Waters, Milford, MA, USA), a SEDEX LT-ELSD 100LT evaporative light-scattering detector (Sedere, Alfortville, France), and a single-quadrupole detector (QDa) using heated electrospray ionization. Agilent Technologies 1260 HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a solvent degasser (G4225A), a binary pump (G1312B), a sample manager (G1329B), a column chamber (G1316A) coupled with a diode array detector (G4212B) and a Sedex 85 LT-evaporative light-scattering detector (Sedere, Alfortville, France) was used for optimized metabolite separation.

Biological Material and Strain Culture From the sponge Scopalina hapalia 17 Micromonospora The strains were all preserved in storage cryotubes and then reactivated before the preparation of pre-cultures [ 18 3 2 4 3 The solid culture of Micromonospora 2.3. Genomic Analysis, Observation, and Identification Petri dish cultures of Micromonospora The Petri dishes were also sent to the society Genoscreen for complete genome sequencing. Raw reads were obtained from the Illumina NovaSeq platform and Oxford Nanopore GridION platform. The Illumina paired-end reads were quality checked with FastQC v0.12.1 [ 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 Salinispora tropica 31 32 33 34 35 2.4. Extract Preparation and Purification After 21 days of incubation, 25 g of resin and the associated biomass were recovered and extracted together with 100 mL of ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (ref. 448252 grade RPE, CarloErba, Val de Reuil, France) for 4 h, in accordance with this protocol [ 19 2 2 The crude extract and purified metabolites were analyzed via UHPLC-PDA-ELSD-MS using an Acquity BEH (Bridget Ethylene Hybrid) C18 analytical column (50 × 2.1 mm; 1.7 μm) (Waters™, Milford, MA, USA). The analyses were conducted with a solvent system consisting of (A) water (Optima™ LC/MS Grade, Fisher Chemical™, Portsmouth, NH, USA) with 0.1% formic acid, employing a linear gradient from 5 to 100% B over 7 min followed by an isocratic step at 100% B for one minute, with a flow rate set at 600 μL/min. Instrument control, data acquisition, and processing were performed using Masslynx ® ® 36 ® 37 ® 2 ® This purification led to the isolation of 7 pure compounds, with a purity estimated by NMR to be above 85% and obtained in small quantities (ranging from 0.2 to 2 mg): 1.4 mg of compound 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2.5.

Evaluation of the Chemical Diversity and Biosynthetic Potential of Micromonospora The delipidated ethyl acetate extract and purified metabolites were analyzed via UHPLC-ESI + Micromonospora 38 41 40 Figure 5 m z 45 47 46 44 All these computational strategies combined with NMR structural elucidation of major compounds of the crude extract allowed us to propose different levels of annotation [ 68 Six of the seven isolated microbial metabolites isolated were found within the IIMN. Twenty-four nodes were annotated using bioinformatic tools as metabolites listed in natural product databases.

The challenges associated with isolating, conserving, and identifying these molecules highlight the necessity to produce larger quantities of extracts and improve analysis and purification techniques in order to isolate a greater number of novel microbial metabolites. This work as well as previous studies [ 18 19 Micromonospora Additionally, the identification of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) encoding molecules of interest, such as loseolamycin, but not detected in our extracts, suggests that some BGCs might be cryptic. Moreover, a significant number of PKS- and NRPS-type BGCs remain unassociated with known metabolites, highlighting the relevance of combining genomic, metabolomic, and molecular biology approaches to activate these genes [ 49 Micromonospora Streptomyces albus 71 Micromonospora 3.3. Biological Activity The ethyl acetate extract of Micromonospora 1 2 3 5 Table 4 The tested samples did not exhibit any cytotoxic activity on the MDA-MB-231 and HCT-116 cell lines. The difference in the cytotoxic activity of the crude extract compared to previous results could be due to the delipidation performed in this study [ 19 Despite the lack of activity of our molecules on cancerous cell lines, the literature has highlighted that various erythromycins, when used alone or in combination, have demonstrated chemopreventive and inhibitory activities on cancer cells [ 72 73 The microbial extracts and megalomicin C1 ( 3 Plasmodium falciparum 50 Table 5 The measured IC 50 56 Trypanosoma cruzi 56 3 Figure 8 Results from an isolated metabolite showed promising activity for megalomicin C1 ( 3 50 50 10 56 58 60 The chemical diversity observed in Micromonospora 74 Another important aspect lies in the spontaneous formation of erythromycin or erythronolide-like derivatives. Several reports in the literature show that semi-synthetic analogues of known macrolides, such as clarithromycin and azithromycin, exhibit improved stability and an expanded spectrum of activity compared to their parent compound [ 74 75 76 77 Moreover, several BGCs of the PKS and NRPS types remain unassigned to known metabolites, suggesting the presence of cryptic biosynthetic pathways. Integrated approaches combining genomics, metabolomics, and synthetic biology could allow for the activation of these silent BGCs and the discovery of novel chemical scaffolds [ 12 16 Beyond their pharmaceutical potential, marine actinomycetes such as Micromonospora represent valuable resources for biotechnology. They are known producers of thermostable enzymes (e.g., cellulases, lipases), antifungal agents, natural pigments, and bioactive metabolites with agricultural or environmental applications [ 78 79 4. Conclusions This study highlights the relevance of a multidisciplinary approach to explore a rare marine-derived actinobacterium, Micromonospora Scopalina hapalia This work led to the isolation and characterization of seven microbial metabolites belonging to the chemical families of erythronolides, erythromycins, and megalomicins. Among them, three potentially new structures were described, possessing atypical structural features such as double bonds or hemiacetal formation: 6,9-hemiacetal-9- O 5 6 O 7 3 Plasmodium falciparum 50 Despite technical challenges related to metabolite yield and structural elucidation, the chemical diversity observed and the genomic richness of Micromonospora Acknowledgments The following reagent was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: Plasmodium falciparum Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/microorganisms13092045/s1 Micromonospora Micromonospora Micromonospora Micromonospora Micromonospora 1 3 61 d 3 3 3 3 3 + 2 63 + 3 3 65 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 + 4 3 63 v v 3 3 3 3 3 3 + O 3 O 3 O 5 3 O 3 O 3 O 3 + O epi 3 epi 3 epi 3 epi 3 epi 3 + epi 3 3 3 3 3 3 + O 3 O 3 O 3 O 3 O 3 + O Micromonospora m z m z m z m z + m z 2 + 21 38 7 Micromonospora Micromonospora megalomicea Author Contributions Conceptualization, A.L.L., M.F.
