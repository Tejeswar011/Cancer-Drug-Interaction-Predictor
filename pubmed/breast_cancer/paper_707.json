The developed microarray chip with Au/SnO 2 1 INTRODUCTION Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers worldwide, with over 1.8 million new cases diagnosed annually and nearly 900,000 deaths each year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 Surface‐enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has a wide range of applications across various fields.  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19 2 2  10  11  12 2 Serum is rich in biomolecules, providing critical disease information, but air exposure can cause degrading samples and affect accuracy.  13  14  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29 In this study, we designed a detection platform combining ML and SERS technology for CRP, as shown in Figure 1 2 FIGURE 1 A detection platform combining ML and SERS technology for CRP. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Materials 5,5′‐Dithiobis (2‐nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) were sourced from Shanghai Aladdin Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd.; Tin (IV) chloride (SnCl4) and anhydrous ethanol were provided by China National Pharmaceutical Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.; and the polystyrene microsphere (PS) suspension (5 wt%) was procured from Zhongke LanYing (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd. All glassware used in the experiments was cleaned by immersion in aqua regia and thoroughly rinsed with deionized water, which had a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ throughout the experiments. 2.2 Instrumentation Magnetic stirring was carried out using a magnetic stirrer from Tianjin Top Instrument Co., Ltd. The high‐temperature annealing was performed in a box furnace from Changsha Keli Technology Co., Ltd. Electroplating was conducted with a constant current electroplating instrument from Nanjing Kehua Instrument Co., Ltd. Centrifugation was done using a 5810R centrifuge from Eppendorf (Germany). Field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging was performed using a JSM‐7800F field emission microscope from JEOL Ltd. (Japan). Raman spectroscopy was conducted with a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman spectrometer from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (USA), and UV–vis spectra were recorded with a Lambda 950 spectrophotometer from PerkinElmer, Inc. (USA). 2.3 Synthesis of Au/ SnO 2 First, the SnCl 4 2 2 2 2 2.4 Fabrication of microarray chips To achieve high sensitivity and high throughput in serum analysis, we initiated the process by designing and drafting the microwell chip layout using SolidWorks software. Subsequently, a mold was fabricated using soft lithography techniques. Following the etching process, a PDMS and curing agent mixture in a 12:1 ratio was poured into the mold and allowed to cure on a hot plate at 75°C for 2 h. After curing and cooling to room temperature, the PDMS was perforated and subjected to ultrasonic cleaning. Post‐cleaning and drying, both the PDMS and glass slides underwent plasma treatment. The SnO 2 2 2.5  SERS 2 μL serum was accurately dispensed into each microwell of the microarray chip. The SERS spectra were obtained using a Thermo Scientific DXR Raman microscope spectrometer equipped with a 785 nm HeNe laser and a 50× objective lens. The laser power was adjusted to 5 mW, with a spot size of 2 μm and an acquisition time of 10 s per measurement. Spectral data were recorded over a range of 600 to 1800 cm −1 2.6 Data preprocessing and multivariate analysis After collecting the original SERS spectra, they were preprocessed using Origin 2019. First, the Savitzky–Golay filter (window length of 11, polynomial order of 3) was applied to smooth the spectra and reduce noise. Then, the Asymmetric Least Squares Smoothing algorithm (smoothing parameter 1 × e 6 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1 Characterization of microarray chip Figure 2a 4 2b 2 2 2c 2d 2 2 2 2e 2 2f 2 2 2 8 SERS SERS Raman Raman 2g 2 2h −1 2i 2 2 −1 2j FIGURE 2 (a) SEM image of the PS microsphere template.

The study procedures conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki and received ethical approval from the Ethics Committee of Jiangdu People's Hospital Affiliated to Yangzhou University. Serum samples were collected from 30 HC subjects, 30 CRP patients, and 40 CRC patients. All subjects underwent Computed Tomography (CT), Histological Section (HE) staining, and colonoscopy (Figure 3 3a 3d 3g 3b 3e 3h 3c 3f 3i FIGURE 3 The CT scan of (a) HC, (b) CRP, and (c) CRC.

(b) Differential SERS Spectra of serum samples (CRC‐CRP and CRP‐HC). 3.4 Multivariate analysis Due to the high dimensionality and complexity of the SERS spectra, it was difficult for researchers to distinguish CRP by relying on visual inspection alone. By using PCA dimensionality reduction, the structure of the spectral data was simplified, retaining major information while reducing the number of features, thereby improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the classification process.  43  44 5a 5b FIGURE 5 (a) The PCA score plot for HC, CRP, and CRC classes.

OCDCO is an optimization method that enhances classifier accuracy and performance by maximizing inter‐class distance and minimizing intra‐class distance. The principal diagram of the OCDCO algorithm for multi‐class visualization is shown in Figure S2 S2 6a 6b 6c K 6d 6e 6f FIGURE 6 (a) PCA‐OCDCO model accuracy variation under different PCs.

This method leverages a specially designed microarray chip embedded with an Au/SnO 2 −1 AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS  Qunshan Zhu: Gaoyang Chen: Lei Fu: Dawei Cao: Zhenguang Wang: Yan Yang: Wei Wei: CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT The authors declare no competing interests.
