Objectives Significant psychological distress is prevalent among patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer, underscoring the need to investigate the roles of mindfulness and coping strategies in shaping emotional outcomes. However, this relationship has not yet been sufficiently explored. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the associations between mindfulness, coping styles, and emotional distress (anxiety and depression) in individuals with advanced gastrointestinal cancer. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 110 patients with stage IV gastrointestinal cancer who received palliative chemotherapy. Participants completed Turkish versions of the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, Mental Adjustment to Cancer scale, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using a patient information form. Data were analyzed using non-parametric tests and correlation analyses to examine group differences and associations among study variables. Results Our findings indicated significant associations between trait mindfulness, coping strategies, and emotional symptoms. Specifically, trait mindfulness was positively correlated with adaptive coping ( r p r p r p Conclusion These findings underscore the importance of contextualizing coping constructs, and suggest that mindfulness, despite its paradoxical relationship with anxiety, may mitigate reliance on maladaptive strategies. Routine psychological screening and personalized psychosocial support should be incorporated into oncological care to facilitate emotional adjustment. metastatic gastrointestinal cancer palliative care mindfulness coping mechanisms anxiety depression emotional regulation psychological distress The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Psycho-Oncology 1 Introduction Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers represent a significant global health concern owing to their high incidence and mortality rates, collectively contributing to a substantial proportion of cancer-related deaths worldwide ( Arnold et al., 2020 Wang et al., 2024 Koustas et al., 2022 Cheng et al., 2024 Advanced GI cancer exerts a significant psychological burden on patients, with elevated rates of anxiety and depression being documented within this population ( Zamani and Alizadeh-Tabari, 2023 Zamani and Alizadeh-Tabari, 2023 Dev et al., 2023 Cwik et al., 2021 Greer et al., 2008 Hansen et al., 2023 Ungvari et al., 2025 In recent years, mindfulness – the nonjudgmental, present-focused awareness of internal and external experiences – has emerged as a key psychological factor that may buffer against emotional distress in patients with serious illnesses ( Brown and Ryan, 2003 Cillessen et al., 2019 Heinen et al., 2024 Watson et al., 1988 Ghanem et al., 2020 Atreya et al., 2018 Dragomanovich et al., 2021 Atreya et al., 2024 Atreya et al., 2025 To this end, we assessed these variables using three validated instruments: the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS), Mental Adjustment to Cancer Scale (MAC), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Our goal was to explore how mindfulness and coping styles relate to anxiety and depression in patients undergoing palliative chemotherapy for stage IV GI cancer. By doing so, we aimed to inform psychosocial care models tailored to the psychological realities of advanced cancer. Based on prior literature and international psycho-oncology guidelines (e.g., SIO/ASCO), we hypothesized that higher mindfulness would be associated with lower anxiety and depression symptoms. At the same time, we recognized that the psychological burden of advanced-stage disease could complicate this relationship, potentially producing both protective and adverse associations depending on illness stage, trauma history, and severity of distress. By addressing this complex interplay, our study sought to provide evidence that may inform tailored psychosocial care models for advanced cancer populations, and current clinical practice guidelines from the Society for Integrative Oncology and ASCO recommend mindfulness-based interventions to reduce anxiety and depression in cancer patients. This study adds a complementary perspective by highlighting the role of trait mindfulness. Assessing baseline mindfulness may help identify patients at a higher risk of distress and could inform personalized psychosocial care in future guideline updates. The significance of this research question lies in the fact that unmanaged psychological distress can adversely affect treatment adherence and quality of life within this vulnerable population. Consequently, elucidating the roles of mindfulness and coping strategies may inform the development of targeted psychosocial interventions. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Patients This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Medical Oncology, Kocaeli University, between February and May 2025. All participants provided written informed consent prior to enrollment. The study protocol was approved by the Kocaeli University Clinical Research Ethics Committee (GOKAEK-2025/05/02) on January 30, 2025, and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. Patients were consecutively recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Medical Oncology at Kocaeli University between February and May 2025. All eligible patients who met the inclusion criteria were approached in person by a research assistant during their routine clinic visits and invited to participate. No financial or other forms of compensation were provided for participation, and the study was conducted on a purely voluntary basis. We have clarified this point in the methods section of the revised manuscript. The inclusion criteria were age ≥18 years, a histopathologically confirmed diagnosis of gastrointestinal cancer (gastric, colorectal, or pancreatic), having stage IV disease and receiving palliative chemotherapy within the first year of metastatic diagnosis, and voluntary agreement to participate. The exclusion criteria were early stage (I–III) disease, receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, history of psychiatric illness, significant cognitive or physical impairments precluding informed consent, or refusal to participate. The sample size required for this study was determined using the PASS 11 software, informed by previous data on factors influencing mental adjustment in cancer patients ( Królikowska et al., 2024 Karabekiroğlu et al., 2020 Çatak, 2012 Aydemir et al., 1997 A structured patient information form was used to gather sociodemographic data. Residence was classified into three categories based on patient self-reports: urban/metropolitan areas (provincial centers and large cities), district towns, and rural/village settings. Additionally, it incorporated an open-ended question on the perceived objective of treatment. Responses were categorized as either “aware” (e.g., “to manage symptoms” or “to prolong life”) or “unaware” (e.g., “to be cured of cancer” or “I do not know”) based on predefined coding criteria. This classification was informed by prior research that underscored the significance of distinguishing between curative and palliative intent in patient comprehension ( El-Jawahri et al., 2014 2.2 Measurement instruments The MAAS developed by Brown and Ryan (2003) Çatak, 2012 The MAC scale, developed by Watson et al., serves as a tool for evaluating patients’ cognitive and behavioral responses to cancer ( Greer et al., 1989 Karabekiroğlu et al., 2020 The HADS, originally developed by Zigmond and Snaith and subsequently validated in Turkish by Aydemir et al., was used to evaluate psychological distress ( Cwik et al., 2021 Çatak, 2012 Aydemir et al., 1997 2.3 Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS for Windows version 29.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States). Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk’s tests were used to assess the normality assumption. Continuous variables, including age, Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, MAC Positive Adaptation Scale, MAC Negative Adaptation Scale, HAD Anxiety Scale, and HAD Depression Scale, were summarized using the median and interquartile range (IQR), as the assumption of normality was not satisfied. Categorical variables, such as sex, marital status, occupation, educational level, and employment status, were presented as frequencies and percentages. Between-group comparisons of continuous variables were performed using the Mann–Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test, as appropriate. When significant differences were identified using the Kruskal–Wallis test, Dunn’s test was applied for post hoc p 3 Results The median age of the participants was 64 years (IQR: 55–69 years), and the median duration since diagnosis was 8 months (IQR: 3–19 months). The median MAAS was 66 (IQR: 54.25–78), indicating a moderate level of trait mindfulness. Tests of normality indicated that variables such as age, trait mindfulness (MAAS), MAC Positive Adjustment, HADS-A, HADS-D, and illness duration deviated significantly from a normal distribution (all p p Table 1 Table 1 Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the study population.

Our findings indicated significantly heightened levels of psychological distress within the cohort, as evidenced by the elevated median scores for anxiety (HADS-A: 13.0) and depression (HADS-D: 9.0). The mindfulness scores were positively correlated with positive coping strategies and negatively correlated with negative coping strategies. Notably, patients who employed positive coping strategies demonstrated higher levels of mindfulness and anxiety. From a sociodemographic perspective, depression was more prevalent among individuals who were unmarried, had lower educational attainment, and resided in rural areas. Mindfulness-based interventions have been explicitly endorsed in oncology guidelines as effective strategies to address psychological distress in cancer care. Recent joint guidelines from the Society for Integrative Oncology (SIO) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) strongly recommend meditation and mindfulness-based approaches for mitigating anxiety, depression, and mood disturbances in adults with cancer ( Carlson et al., 2023 In our study, depressive symptoms among patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer were significantly correlated with various sociodemographic factors including employment status and residential setting. Depression scores varied according to employment status, with unemployed individuals exhibiting higher mean scores. Additionally, participants residing in district towns demonstrated elevated depression scores compared to those living in urban or metropolitan areas. These findings suggest that environmental stressors such as limited access to healthcare services, reduced social support, and economic hardship may contribute to increased psychological vulnerability. Supporting this interpretation, prior evidence indicates that non-metropolitan residences (district towns and rural villages) are associated with greater psychosocial distress, and financial difficulties exacerbate the psychological burden in cancer populations ( Baye et al., 2023 Yu et al., 2022 Chen et al., 2024 Ikhile et al., 2024 Brink et al., 2024 Notably, these sociodemographic characteristics did not exhibit a significant association with anxiety symptoms or coping style. This suggests that depression and anxiety may follow distinct psychosocial trajectories. Depression appears to be more closely associated with external and social factors, such as social isolation or occupational disruption, whereas anxiety may be more responsive to internal and clinical variables, including disease severity, symptom burden, and uncertainty regarding prognosis. Supporting this distinction, an umbrella review identified unemployment and inadequate social support as reliable predictors of depression but not anxiety ( Getie et al., 2025 Tang et al., 2024 Teunissen et al., 2007 Arvanitou et al., 2023 Interestingly, our study identified that elevated mindfulness scores were associated with increased anxiety symptoms, despite also showing a positive correlation with adaptive coping strategies. This counterintuitive finding may reflect the heightened emotional awareness that accompanies advanced mindfulness, whereby individuals become more attuned to distressing thoughts and emotions. Alternatively, it is plausible that individuals with preexisting anxiety are more inclined to adopt mindfulness practices as a compensatory coping mechanism, which could temporarily exacerbate emotional discomfort. Such bidirectional interpretations are supported by prior literature, in which mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have demonstrated variable short-term effects, particularly in advanced cancer populations ( Rebegea et al., 2024 Oberoi et al., 2020 Rebegea et al., 2024 The psychological impact of mindfulness may be affected by coping strategies used by patients. In our study, those who used positive adjustment strategies exhibited significantly higher mindfulness scores, supporting prior evidence that acceptance- and mindfulness-based interventions, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), enhance psychological flexibility by fostering openness to negative emotions and reducing experiential avoidance ( Oberoi et al., 2020 Jiang et al., 2023 Jiang et al., 2023 Zhang et al., 2022 Czerw et al., 2016 The current findings emphasize the importance of incorporating psychological assessments and targeted interventions into standard oncology practices for patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer. Specifically, routine screening and personalized psychosocial support programs may enhance treatment adherence and improve the quality of life among high-risk individuals, such as those who are unemployed, have lower educational attainment, or reside in rural areas. Furthermore, the paradoxical associations observed in patients with higher levels of mindfulness or positive coping, such as increased anxiety, highlight the complexity of emotional adaptation and suggest that certain psychological traits may not invariably confer protection. In this context, the implementation of individualized psycho-oncological strategies, including mindfulness-based models integrated with ACT, cognitive-behavioral approaches, and structured psychiatric support, is clinically relevant for enhancing emotional resilience and promoting treatment compliance. This study had several limitations. First, its cross-sectional design precludes causal inference, and reliance on self-report instruments may have introduced a bias. Second, the sample was drawn from a single tertiary care center, which may restrict the generalizability of our results. Third, the Turkish version of the MAC group avoidance scale within positive adjustment potentially contributes to the paradoxical association between adaptive coping and higher anxiety. Moreover, multiple subgroup and correlational analyses were performed without formal correction, increasing the risk of Type I error; therefore, these results should be considered exploratory. Some subgroup analyses were further limited by small and uneven cell sizes, which reduced statistical power. Moreover, multivariate adjustments for potential confounders (e.g., age, sex, and education) were not systematically applied. Although exploratory regression suggested that the main findings remained robust, the limited sample size precluded comprehensive modeling. Finally, the study did not assess the amount of mindfulness practice undertaken by participants, which limits the interpretation of whether observed associations stem from dispositional traits or learned practices. Future studies should employ more comprehensive instruments, such as the FFMQ, to better capture the multidimensional nature of mindfulness, which indicates that the findings should be interpreted as preliminary and hypothesis-generating. Future studies using larger, more diverse samples and multivariate longitudinal designs are warranted to confirm and expand these results. 5 Future directions Future research should utilize longitudinal and mixed-method approaches to comprehensively elucidate the causal and experiential dynamics of mindfulness, coping strategies, and psychological distress in individuals with advanced cancer. Furthermore, interventional trials focusing on high-risk groups, such as those exhibiting low acceptance or high anxiety, despite employing adaptive coping mechanisms, may contribute to the refinement of psychosocial care in oncology. 6 Conclusion Patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer experience significant psychological distress, characterized by elevated levels of anxiety and depression. This is particularly prevalent among individuals who are unmarried, unemployed, have a lower educational attainment, or reside in rural areas. In addition to these sociodemographic factors, maladaptive coping strategies and low acceptance of illness contribute substantially to emotional suffering. Notably, higher mindfulness was associated with increased self-reported anxiety, potentially indicating a heightened emotional awareness. These findings highlight the necessity for early psychological assessment and integration of evidence-based psychosocial interventions, such as CBT, ACT, and mindfulness-based approaches, into routine cancer care. Proactive multidisciplinary support can enhance psychological resilience, treatment adherence, and overall quality of life.
