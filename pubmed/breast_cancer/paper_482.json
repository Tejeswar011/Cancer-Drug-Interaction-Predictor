This study addresses the need for culturally and regionally tailored psychosocial interventions by integrating insights from semi-structured interviews with selected stakeholders in Turkiye. Utilizing a qualitative research design, interviews were conducted with a patient association representative, psycho-oncologist, and oncologists with psychological expertise. These interviews, guided by literature-driven questions, lasted about three hours each and explored the challenges MBC patients face, the existing support structures, and the dynamics of patient-doctor interactions in Turkiye. Findings reveal that MBC patients experience significant psychological distress and QoL decline due to economic issues, fears of job loss, societal stigma, family dynamics, and limited psychological support. Effective doctor-patient communication, targeted psychological interventions, and comprehensive family support are essential. Experts advocate for a holistic, psycho-oncological approach, addressing both physical and psychological needs, with recommendations for multidisciplinary care, ongoing psychiatric support, and increased awareness. This study highlights the importance of tailored, patient-centered interventions to improve the QoL of MBC patients in Turkiye.

Introduction Breast cancer remains a major global health concern for women [ 1 2 3 Among these psychosocial challenges, body image concerns play a critical role, as treatment-related physical changes can negatively affect self-perception and emotional well-being. Research has demonstrated that cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)-based interventions are effective in addressing body dissatisfaction and enhancing psychological resilience in cancer patients [ 4 5 3 6 7 8 In light of this, our study integrates findings from a semi-structured qualitative interview conducted with a patient association representative, psychologists, and oncologists in Turkiye. This primary research is guided by the hypothesis that psychosocial support systems and communication practices significantly influence the quality of life (QoL) of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients. The study aims to provide a national perspective on the challenges faced by MBC patients and the adequacy of support structures available within the Turkish healthcare system. By combining global research insights with localized professional perspectives, we seek to explore how psychosocial needs are met—or unmet—in this setting. Through a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of MBC patients in Turkiye, the study emphasizes the need for holistic care models that address both physical and psychological dimensions of patient well-being. 2. Methodology 2.1. Study design and participants This study adopted a qualitative descriptive design to explore the quality of life (QoL) and psychosocial experiences of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients in Turkiye from the perspectives of healthcare providers and stakeholders involved in their care. A purposive sampling strategy was used to ensure diversity in professional roles and experience with MBC care. Participants included a patient association representative, a clinical psychologist with oncology experience, one oncologist with a subspecialty interest in psycho-oncology, and three additional senior medical oncologists. Participants were recruited through professional networks and snowball sampling. Inclusion criteria included direct professional involvement in MBC patient care or support in Turkiye and a willingness to participate in an extended interview. Data saturation was considered achieved when no new sub-categories or concepts emerged during the coding process, which occurred after the fifth interview. 2.2. Data collection Semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted in person in a private meeting setting. The interview guide was developed through a literature review and expert consultation, focusing on psychosocial needs, patient support systems, communication challenges, and perceived gaps in care. Open-ended questions allowed for flexibility and the emergence of rich narrative data. Each interview lasted approximately three hours and was audio-recorded with participant consent. Verbal prompts were used to ensure full exploration of key topics. Due to the length and depth of discussions, not all participants addressed every question; as a result, some perspectives may be absent under certain themes. 2.3. Data analysis Data were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis as outlined by Braun and Clarke (2006) [ 9 The analysis followed a structured process: Sub-categories were first generated from line-by-line coding. These were then grouped into broader categories that reflected shared meanings. Finally, themes were developed to capture overarching concepts relevant to the research aims. An iterative, collaborative process was used to review and refine themes for coherence and representativeness. Discrepancies were discussed until consensus was reached. NVivo software was used to assist with data organization and coding. 2.4. Ethical considerations All participants received and signed informed consent forms prior to data collection. They were informed of the study’s purpose, their right to withdraw at any time, and assured of the confidentiality of their responses. All identifying information was anonymized in transcripts and reporting. The study adhered to ethical standards for qualitative research and followed COREQ reporting guidelines. 3. Results 3.1. Concerns and challenges encountered by patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) throughout their disease trajectory 3.1.1. Questions asked under this topic  As individuals who directly interact with breast cancer patients, especially those with metastatic breast cancer, could you please summarize the concerns and challenges these patients face psychologically during this process? 3.1.2. Patient association representative’s perspective Upon diagnosis, MBC patients often grapple with multiple negative feelings and those affect not just the patient but their entire family. As one participant stated: Unfortunately, when patients are diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer, they often experience an intense fear of death, abandonment, and helplessness. This emotional burden extends beyond the patient to the entire family. 3.1.3. Psychologist perspective Patients with breast cancer face not only the challenges brought about by the disease itself but also social issues. For instance, patients who frequently come with their spouses as caregivers often switch to coming with their children or other relatives during the course of the disease. In some cases, they even face family problems that can lead to separation from their spouse. One psychologist explained: The nature of a couple’s relationship often intensifies after the diagnosis; that is, if the relationship was good before, it often becomes better—if it was bad, it tends to worsen. 3.2. Evaluating the impact of metastatic breast cancer on patients’ quality of life: clinical perspectives on work, social life, family dynamics, body image, and the role of physicians, associations, and communication dynamics 3.2.1. Questions asked under this topic  Based on your clinical experiences, how is the quality of life affected for metastatic breast cancer patients when considering various factors such as work life, social life, family, partners, and body image during their diagnosis and treatment process? What roles do physicians play in enhancing their quality of life? What recommendations can be made to patients and their families? What role does the association play in preserving and improving the patient’s quality of life? Additionally, how do you think the communication between the physician and the patient and their families, as well as the patient’s communication with their physician and surroundings, impacts their quality of life? 3.2.2. Oncologist perspective The quality of life (QoL) and psychological state of patients after a breast cancer diagnosis primarily depend on three factors: the stage of the disease, the patient’s age, and their psychological makeup. Regardless of these, difficulty in accessing medication also adds stress. For metastatic patients, intense anxiety, uncertainty about life expectancy, and fear of death are primary concerns affecting their psychology and QoL. Patients in the early stages focus on the efficacy of treatment and potential side effects, with the main concern being the recurrence of the disease post-treatment. The behavior of close relatives toward the patient is another significant factor influencing QoL. From diagnosis, patients undergo denial, rebellion, and acceptance phases. Previously, breast cancer studies primarily focused on primary and secondary endpoints, summarizing overall survival and progression-free survival. However, in recent phase 3 trials, patient-based QoL is gaining importance. The stage of the disease is crucial, especially in cases like triple-negative metastatic breast cancer, where survival might be limited to 1.5–2 years. If communication isn’t established correctly, patients might not adhere to treatments, leading to potential treatment discontinuation. Treating breast cancer as a chronic disease requires clear and accurate communication with both the patient and their relatives throughout the process. Patients should be adequately informed about the treatment process, potential side effects, and their severity. If sufficient time is dedicated to patients, their adherence and QoL improve directly.  One oncologist noted Effective communication initiated by the physician at the time of diagnosis sets the tone for the patient’s journey; without it, trust breaks down and adherence to treatment declines. Concerns about accessing medication exist, but in Turkiye, most treatments are accessible, except for monotherapies and the latest treatments. Managing this long and exhausting process in harmony with our patients can contribute to their QoL. During these phases, it’s crucial for relatives to provide informed psychological support. Associations can play a pivotal role by raising awareness about effective communication with patients. Establishing proper communication from the onset, coordinated with a psycho-oncologist, is vital. The role of associations is significant in raising awareness, emphasizing that the battle against cancer can be won with collective effort. 3.2.3. Oncologist (with sub interest in psychology) perspective From both psychological and oncological perspectives, the diagnosis of the disease brings about a sense of loss and grief for the patient. This diagnosis plunges the patient into a vast uncertainty, where they desire to learn certain aspects of their condition but might not always have the courage to face all the details. The extent of information a patient wishes to know becomes crucial in establishing communication. The initial approach, specifically how the bad news is delivered, plays a pivotal role. The manner in which this news is conveyed, whether insensitively, hastily, or without proper context, can leave a lasting impact on the patient. Especially if the news comes from a non-medical family member rather than a physician, it can have a different psychological effect. Therefore, the initiation of this communication is vital and influences the entire treatment process. The shape and tone of the initial bad news—whether delivered sensitively or abruptly—can fundamentally change how the patient experiences the disease process. Humans are inherently outcome-focused rather than process-oriented. Consequently, patients often fixate on the end result of their disease. This becomes problematic, especially in metastatic cases, as the hope instilled in early-stage breast cancer patients differs from that in metastatic breast cancer patients. In such situations, it’s essential to shift the patient’s focus to the process, which can enhance decision-making quality. The phrase “There’s no disease, only the patient” underscores the individualized nature of the experience. Factors like the type of treatment and its response significantly influence the QoL. For instance, treatments for hormone-positive patients differ from those for hormone-negative patients, affecting their QoL. By explaining treatment options in an understandable manner and informing about inaccessible medications, we can alleviate patient anxiety. Some studies have indicated that activities like mindfulness help patients distance themselves from complex thoughts, focusing on primary concerns, thereby reducing depression and anxiety and enhancing the QoL. Therefore, seeking support is crucial. However, in state institutions where even doctors might not have adequate time, psychologists or social workers also struggle to provide quality time. Hence, it’s imperative to utilize the available time with the patient efficiently and establish a trustworthy relationship. Once this trust is built, patients tend to engage more in the process, reducing their anxiety and subsequently improving their QoL. 3.2.4. Psychologist perspective Several factors play a pivotal role in the psychological well-being of breast cancer patients. Firstly, the location of the cancer is crucial, and when it is breast cancer, anxiety disorders are more prevalent in women. Secondly, treatments can lead to side effects, which can further deteriorate morale and escalate concerns. Thirdly, baseline psychological states, such as coping mechanisms and resilience levels, are significant. Previous coping strategies might not be effective in this context, leading to psychiatric disorders. The most common psychiatric disorders observed are adjustment disorders, followed by depression and anxiety disorders. Approximately 30% of metastatic breast cancer patients exhibit symptoms of depression or anxiety. Even though cancer isn’t contagious, it creates a contagious psychological atmosphere within the family—open communication is crucial to prevent emotional breakdowns. In such scenarios, providing psychological support and education to the entire family can enhance functional family dynamics. Open communication within the family is paramount; reduced communication can exacerbate the challenges. The perception of the disease, rather than the disease itself, is also vital. The manner in which physicians communicate the diagnosis, their level of empathy, and their portrayal of treatment and hope can significantly influence the patient’s subsequent journey. The grieving process is multifaceted. Patients who are newly diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer experience a different kind of shock compared to those who had a prior diagnosis and are confronted with a recurrence. Regardless of the perspective, attention and guidance on coping are the most sought-after needs. Throughout the journey, patients may undergo repeated phases of devastation, disappointment, and grief. Hence, continuous psychiatric support is essential. Programs that include coping techniques can be conducted in groups with breast cancer patients. Literature suggests that group sessions are most effective when participants share similar stages of the disease. However, even mixed groups are beneficial compared to no support at all. Such sessions have been shown to reduce depression and anxiety levels in patients. Thus, raising awareness about coping mechanisms is of paramount importance. 3.3. Understanding the concerns and barriers to seek psychiatric support for breast cancer patients: insights and recommendations for enhanced care in Turkiye 3.3.1. Questions asked under this topic  What concerns might deter breast cancer patients from seeking psychiatric help during their initial visits? What strategies can be implemented to encourage these patients to seek psychological support? When managing a patient’s treatment, what indicators help or hinder you in recognizing their need for psychological support? Which patients do you typically refer for such support? Are there any challenges faced in this regard in Turkiye? 3.3.2. Psychologist perspective In Turkiye, stigma and denial significantly affect patients’ willingness to seek psychiatric help. Many patients don’t even realize they need support, and when they do, social stigma or a lack of awareness prevents them from seeking it. Raising awareness about this issue among both patients and their families is crucial. Initiatives that enhance this awareness, along with informative campaigns about anxiety-reducing methods and sharing success stories, can increase the inclination toward seeking help. However, there’s a shortage of specialists and time in state institutions for psychological support. This pushes some patients toward private centers, but financial constraints often prevent them from accessing these services too. 3.3.3. Oncologist perspective All breast cancer patients should ideally receive psychiatric support. However, this ideal is often unattainable. Extreme emotional reactions often signal the need for urgent referral to psychiatric services. We prioritize patients who exhibit intense emotional responses—crying uncontrollably or shouting—because if we can’t stabilize them early on, their treatment compliance falls apart. Without stabilizing these patients psychiatrically, they might face challenges in adhering to treatments early on. The time allocated to them in public hospitals’ psychiatric departments often lacks quality and sufficiency. After a diagnosis, the barrage of tests can overshadow their psychological needs. Family dynamics also play a role; some families believe they can handle everything without psychological support, while others recognize the need but are constrained by finances or lack of knowledge on seeking help. Misinformation from the internet can exacerbate their psychological state, highlighting the importance of clear communication. The percentage of patients accessing psychiatric support varies based on factors like their institution, socioeconomic status, personal views, and religious beliefs. Some referred to psychiatrists feel inadequately addressed and are often just prescribed medication. The side effects of these psychiatric medications can be concerning. In Turkiye, only about 10–15% of centers can provide organized psychological support on-site. Raising awareness among both patients and oncologists is crucial, with public service announcements being a potential avenue. Two critical moments in a patient’s journey are the initial diagnosis and the transition to a metastatic phase. The initial phase involves mutual assessment between the doctor and the patient, with the latter contemplating the long journey ahead. The metastatic phase is challenging due to the potential incurability of the disease. Proper communication is essential, especially as the terminal phase approaches. Especially in metastatic cases, the uncertainty of a cure can lead to heightened anxiety. The initial reaction to a cancer diagnosis differs significantly from reactions to other chronic diseases like hypertension or diabetes. It’s vital to emphasize that while every disease can have adverse outcomes, the key is successful management. 3.3.4. Oncologist (with sub interest in psychology) perspective How an oncologist perceives death and accepts it as a part of life is crucial. Studies have shown that oncologists experience burnout mostly in their first year, but it decreases over time. Therefore, we should provide oncopsychology training to assistants. Whenever possible, it is important to refer patients to specialized psychologists familiar with the breast cancer journey. However, there’s a noticeable gap in this specialized field in Turkiye. Beyond clinical markers, recognizing where patients are emotionally—denial, anger, depression, or acceptance—guides referrals and timing. A patient who’s just heard their diagnosis should be allowed to feel—jumping straight to medication can block their emotional processing. 3.4. Addressing body image and self-esteem concerns in breast cancer patients: age-related differences and support strategies beyond psychiatry 3.4.1. Questions asked under this topic  How does a breast cancer diagnosis impact a woman’s body image and self-esteem, potentially adding emotional strain? Beyond psychiatric support, how can patients be assisted in addressing these concerns? How do perceptions of the disease and its psychological burden differ between younger and older women diagnosed with breast cancer? What factors contribute to these differences? Are there variations in the psychological support provided to these two age groups? 3.4.2. Oncologist perspective Patients have varied responses to their diagnosis and treatment. Reactions to treatment and surgery differ by life stage and personal values. Some women avoid surgery due to fears about body image or fertility, while others feel more empowered after reconstructive surgery—even during metastatic disease. Young married patients often prioritize concerns about their children, spouse, and family before their own well-being. Single young patients worry about overcoming the disease, future marriage, and childbearing. Older patients, on the other hand, prioritize their psychological well-being, not wanting to be a burden to their loved ones. Some patients display demanding, questioning, and even manipulative behaviors toward healthcare professionals, which I believe is their coping mechanism. There are also patients without close relatives or friends, who tend to be more accepting of their situation. Our societal and religious structures can sometimes facilitate acceptance at certain stages of the disease. Metastatic cancer is challenging, especially for young or premenopausal patients. Beyond the burden of cancer, they face concerns about fertility, body image, and sexuality. As doctors enter a challenging phase of treatment, striving to reduce anxiety and depression by maintaining good communication with the patient, their partner, and their family. Postmenopausal patients are more concerned about their families, asking questions about potential side effects of treatments, interactions with other medications, and the impact of their age on the treatment process. 3.4.3. Oncologist (with Sub interest in psychology) perspective Developmental age significantly influences patients’ perspectives and concerns. Young women are preoccupied with future plans—marriage, children, careers—while older patients focus on not burdening their families or managing other illnesses. For metastatic breast cancer patients, our primary focus is on helping them adapt to and accept changes in their bodies. We also work on fostering self-compassion and forgiveness for past regrets. Older patients often seek more social support, forming lasting friendships during treatments like chemotherapy. Despite having more coexisting health conditions, older patients often manage the psychological aspects of their disease better than younger patients. 3.5. Exploring group therapies as an alternative to individual psychological support in state institutions 3.5.1. Question asked under this topic  Given the challenges we discussed about providing quality and sufficient psychological support in state institutions due to the high patient load, could group therapies serve as an effective alternative to individual psychological support, reaching more patients while maintaining quality? 3.5.2. Psychologist perspective The structure of supportive group therapy is distinct, and sometimes it can be more beneficial for heterogeneous patient groups. Sharing about topics chosen from regular life processes, irrespective of the disease, can be more therapeutic. Supportive group therapies, cognitive therapies, and psychotherapies each have different objectives and processes, and the topics discussed vary. In summary, patient selection should be done correctly, and the appropriate supportive treatment should be administered by a psycho-oncologist. Support groups help epatients feel less alone and promote socialization during a long and exhausting treatment journey. 3.5.3. Patient association representative’s perspective As an association, we tried group therapies with psychologists in the past. As mentioned earlier, it’s essential to group patients based on age, diagnosis, and stages. However, they often can’t discuss profound issues. Patients prefer a system where they can talk face-to-face in individual therapy, which they find more beneficial. While individual face-to-face therapies are healthier for every patient, younger patients might be more receptive to online sessions, whereas older patients aren’t as satisfied. Support groups mainly help patients socialize and feel that they aren’t alone in this long and exhausting journey. In conclusion, while group therapies are beneficial for socializing, raising awareness, and combating feelings of loneliness, individual therapies provide support on more personal and profound issues. 3.5.4. Oncologist perspective In group therapies, there are patients who positively influence each other and those who negatively do so. Especially in patients with metastatic diseases, careful selection is crucial when forming groups. Unless you group patients by similar disease stages and emotional readiness, group therapy can do more harm than good. While everyone is together, information sessions or individual conversations with patients can be conducted. However, unless you place patients with similar psychological states, stages, and progressions side by side, group therapies aren’t beneficial. Two critical criteria emerge in this context: firstly, the ability to select and refer the appropriate patient, and secondly, the capability to manage group therapy effectively. In this scenario, you end up providing therapy to a selected group of patients. Collective psychological support and informational meetings can make physicians feel somewhat supportive of patients. However, in such settings, individual problems that might be crucial for the patient might not be addressed. Ultimately, if we’re talking about psychological support, it must be individualized. 3.6. The impact of digital information overload on patients and physicians: communication and explanation challenges 3.6.1. Questions asked under this topic  How does patients’ exposure to excessive information in the digital environment impact both you and the patients? To what extent should physicians provide information to patients, and do you believe it’s essential for physicians to explain certain clinical terms? As physicians working in different institutions, do you find adequate time to provide explanations? 3.6.2. Oncologist perspective Rather than focusing on clinical terminology, explaining the disease process to patients is more important. Patients often struggle to understand clinical jargon and overwhelming them with such terms can be counterproductive. Instead, dramatizing the relationship between the disease and its progression in a manner tailored to the patient’s understanding can be better. Patients sometimes come to us with information overload from various sources, activating their defence mechanisms. It’s more beneficial to explain the subsequent process in simple terms, emphasizing the various treatment alternatives available. Providing information tailored to the patient’s overall condition and clinical stage is crucial as there can be challenging patient profiles, with some constantly seeking definitive information, often influenced by what they read on social media. For instance, when explaining the concept of progression-free survival, using descriptive language that the patient can grasp may make more sense. For physicians, progression is the most challenging aspect, often feeling more burdensome than it does for the patient. For example, when treating a metastatic breast cancer patient, if after several rounds of treatment there’s no improvement and the disease progresses, deciding how to convey this becomes a meticulous task. While progression-free survival is crucial for physicians, patients might not fully grasp its significance, perhaps because physicians don’t always articulate it directly. Nowadays, almost everyone, regardless of their cultural level, uses the internet and social media. Digital misinformation often raises unrealistic expectations or unnecessary fears. Patients come in quoting survival rates from Google—some want confirmation, others fear what they already read. It’s hard to strike the right balance. We avoid discussing survival probabilities in detail early on, because every case is different, and numbers can erode hope. They hope to hear that their case is unique. Hearing a specific survival time from their oncologist can be daunting, sometimes leading them to consider discontinuing treatment. Patients often want to hear positive news, especially in the early stages, but they also bombard their doctors with questions. Therefore, we prefer not to discuss survival extensively at the beginning of treatment, emphasizing that every disease can manifest differently in each patient. However, it’s essential to realistically explain the current clinical situation using appropriate language, without focusing on numbers. 3.6.3. Psychologist perspective Given that patients often feel a profound sense of loss of control, I work on highlighting areas they can influence and how they can support their treatment process. By making patients aware of the impact of stress on the immune system, I focus on holistic development, including dietary and healthy living habits, social integration, and identifying and rectifying cognitive distortions. This approach aims to enhance their QoL and support their treatment. 3.7. Patient engagement in the treatment process: understanding, enhancing, and the role of quality-of-life surveys 3.7.1. Questions asked under this topic  How do the involvement processes of both doctors and patients in treatment differ? How can we gauge and enhance a patient’s willingness to participate in the treatment process? What are the benefits of patients actively participating in their treatment? Do you believe that quality of life surveys could be a method to increase patients’ desire to be involved in their treatment? 3.7.2. Oncologist perspective Physicians generally explain the disease, treatment options, and the process to each patient at a level they can understand. However, in Turkiye, the conversation often concludes with the patient saying, “Doctor, you know best.” This becomes challenging, especially when joint decision-making is required for treatment options. Even patients with a higher socio-cultural background exhibit this behavior. There are very few patients who genuinely understand what you’re saying, and this usually happens during chemotherapy. I have patients whom I monitor in this manner. Treating oncology patients isn’t easy. It requires the patient’s full trust and compliance. Some patients consult multiple doctors before making a decision, while others entrust their entire future to you. Even after outlining the entire process, providing information, and drawing a roadmap for potential negative outcomes, many patients still respond with “you know best.” This is emotionally challenging for a doctor because there’s no room for discussion, and the patient is entirely reliant on you. However, some patients consult multiple doctors, analyze the information, and choose their path. One of the fundamental aspects of achieving possible success in this process is the patient’s adherence to treatment. Surveys can be beneficial if they are designed to be practical, easily understandable, and reliable. Besides surveys, informational forms should also be written in simple language that the patient can understand, aiming to increase awareness. As the details in both surveys and informational forms increase, they can become more confusing and less practical. Especially in informational forms, great care should be taken regarding the content about treatment options and side effects. Even rare side effects can decrease a patient’s treatment compliance if they lead the patient to question the treatment too much. 3.7.3. Oncologist (with Sub interest in psychology) perspective Honesty is crucial for treatment compliance; otherwise, patients won’t trust and won’t adhere to the treatment. We can categorize patients affecting treatment compliance based on psychosocial personality types: expressive patients, communicative patients, and analytical patients. Expressive patients are manipulative, result-oriented, expect quick responses, and leave decisions to you but will hold you accountable if there’s an issue. Communicative patients thrive on relationships and will switch doctors if they can’t establish a connection. Analytical patients often gather information from the internet, have consulted multiple doctors, and want to discuss and debate based on the information they’ve acquired. If we communicate in a way that matches their personality and emotional readiness, their treatment compliance increases. 3.8. Perspectives on the fear of death and approaching End-of-life 3.8.1. Question asked under this topic  What insights can you share regarding the fear of death and one’s approach to it? 3.8.2. Psychologist perspective Fear of death is a complex emotion, and it’s essential not to make generalizations about it. The decision on its impact is determined by whether this fear disrupts various aspects of a patient’s life, such as work, family, social interactions, medical condition, and their relationship with the medical team. If this fear and anxiety lead to disturbances, it’s crucial for the patient to receive therapy. This disruption will signify a breaking point in the patient’s personal journey, pace, and denial mechanism. When asked about their thoughts during the terminal phase, discerning whether their fear revolves around the moments leading up to death, the moment of death itself, or the aftermath can provide valuable insights. We don’t treat fear of death as one thing—it’s about identifying which phase triggers anxiety and helping them work through that specifically. 4. Discussion Metastatic breast cancer presents complex challenges that extend beyond clinical management, deeply influencing patients’ psychological well-being and QoL. These challenges require a nuanced, multidimensional approach that encompasses medical, psychological, and social domains [ 2 Table 1 Table 1. Summary of obstacles and recommendations associated with the QoL and psychosocial issues encountered by MBC patients in Turkiye. Article Highlights (as also given in Table 1 Obstacles and recommendations associated with the QoL and psychosocial issues encountered by MBC patients in Turkiye. Obstacles  Varying reactions on the stage of the disease, the age and psychological structure of the patient. Economic disadvantages and financial concerns about accessing medication. Difficulties with work Increased psychological issues and burnout over time in patients and families. Reduced communication within the family Failure to deliver bad news in a professional way. Doctors, psychologists or social workers not having adequate time in the state healthcare providers in terms of assessing the need and providing psychological support. Societal stigma associated with seeking psychiatric help or consulting a psychiatrist in Turkiye. Differences in family dynamics about psychological support in Turkiye. Insufficient number of centers that can provide on-site organized psychological support. Insufficient referrals by oncologists for patients needing psychological support. Noticeable gap in psycho-oncologists field in Turkiye. Shortcomings in guiding patients toward group or individual therapies. Patients have difficulties understanding clinical jargon and become overwhelmed. Misinformation or information overload from various sources and social media. Most patients in Turkiye prefer to be dependent on their doctor while participating in treatment selection. Too much detail in surveys and information sheets, making patients more confused and making these tools less practical for clinicians Extreme fear of death Recommendations  It’s essential to consider the psychological burden brought by the disease process, treatments, surgeries, and their side effects holistically. The approach to the patient should be planned according to the age, perspectives and concerns of the patients. As doctors enter a challenging phase of treatment, can strive to reduce anxiety and depression by maintaining good communication with the patient, their partner, and their family. Continuous psychiatric support is essential. Providing psychological support and education to the entire family can enhance functional family dynamics. Sufficient time dedicated to patients and to utilize the available time with the patient efficiently. Raising awareness about seeking psychiatric help or consulting a psychiatrist among both patients and their families. Explaining treatment options in an understandable manner and informing about inaccessible medications. Explaining the idea to the patient that “There is no disease, only a patient” and ensuring that the patient focuses on the process rather than concepts such as life expectancy and side effects. Proper communication is essential, as the terminal phase approaches. Planning oncopsychology training for assistant doctors. It is important to refer patients to specialized psychologists. group therapies are beneficial for socializing, raising awareness, and combating feelings of loneliness, individual therapies provide support on more personal and profound issues. Patient selection should be done correctly, and the appropriate supportive treatment should be administered by a psycho-oncologist. Rather than focusing on clinical terminology, explaining the disease process to patients is more important. Dramatizing the relationship between the disease and its progression in a manner tailored to the patient’s understanding and it’s more beneficial to explain the subsequent process in simple terms, emphasizing the various treatment alternatives available. By making patients aware of the impact of stress on the immune system, should be focused on holistic development, including dietary and healthy living habits, social integration, and identifying and rectifying cognitive distortions. Providing information at the beginning of treatment about misinformation on the internet and social media. Surveys and informational forms should also be written in simple language that the patient can understand, aiming to increase awareness. Especially in informational forms, great care should be taken regarding the content about treatment options and side effects. It’s essential to communicate truths appropriately and make decisions collaboratively with the patient, considering their personality type. If this fear and anxiety lead to worsen the quality of life, it’s crucial for the patient to receive therapy. Increasing the number of associations that emphasizing that the battle against cancer. Global projects concerning focuses on how to care for, manage, and support breast cancer patients Programs that include coping techniques can be conducted in groups with breast cancer patients. Initiatives that enhance awareness, along with informative campaigns about anxiety-reducing methods and sharing success stories, can increase the inclination toward seeking help. Raising awareness among both patients and oncologists with public service announcements. The results from our qualitative survey resonate with the broader literature on this topic, highlighting the intricate interplay between disease stage, patient age, and individual psychological constitution in determining the QoL of MBC patients [ 2 10 11 11 12 13 14 10 In the Turkish context, three critical barriers related to accessing psychological support services have been identified. These include the persistent societal stigma surrounding the pursuit of psychiatric care, variations in family dynamics, and a limited number of healthcare centers offering on-site psychological support. While some families believe they can cope without professional assistance, others recognize the need for support but are hindered by financial constraints or a lack of awareness regarding how to access such services. A systematic review of ten quantitative studies examining the use of psychosocial services among adults with cancer identified the “lack of perceived need for psychosocial services and support” as the most frequently reported barrier. This was followed by insufficient information about the availability of such services. Negative perceptions and stigma ranked as the fifth most common barrier, with a reported prevalence of 10% [ 15 16 17 18 The dynamics of interactions between patients and doctors play a pivotal role in the overall well-being of MBC patients [ 19 20 19–24 8 22 23 24 Age-related differences in the concerns and priorities of MBC patients emerged clearly in our survey. Existing literature indicates that younger women often prioritize concerns such as fertility, body image, and intimate relationships. A recent study conducted in Turkiye examined the relationship between body image, sexual quality of life, and marital adjustment among women who underwent surgical interventions due to breast cancer. The findings emphasized that changes in body image following surgery may negatively affect both sexual well-being and marital harmony, highlighting the need for psychosocial support in these areas [ 25 3 11 12 In our manuscript, experts stated that patients’ responses exhibit variations based on individual circumstances, underscoring the pivotal role of family support. Particularly in the metastatic stage, they reported an escalation in psychological issues and burnout, impacting both the patient and their families and frequently resulting in diminished intra-family communication. Having a supportive partner and family is crucial for coping with the disease, yet MBC poses a substantial burden on partner relationships and spouses, often triggering depression and anxiety [ 10 12 26 21 27 28 29 In Turkiye, much like the global scenario, patients often find themselves inundated with an overwhelming amount of information. Drawing from their experiences, experts observed that patients occasionally approach healthcare professionals with a defensive mindset triggered by the plethora of information gathered from diverse digital sources. The influence of social media, particularly the fixation on survival rates found online, was noted as a common challenge. Experts also conveyed that patients grapple with comprehending clinical jargon, and an inundation of such terminology can prove counterproductive in their efforts to stay informed. As a proposed solution, the focus was placed on elucidating the disease process using straightforward language, emphasizing various treatment alternatives instead of fixating on clinical terminology. The recommendation is to realistically convey the current clinical situation without overly concentrating on numerical data, employing an appropriate language. Additionally, there was an emphasis on educating patients about the impact of stress on the immune system, advocating for healthy eating and lifestyle habits, fostering social integration. Recent literature underscores the potential of mobile health interventions in improving the quality of life among breast cancer patients. For instance, a systematic review found that mobile apps can enhance emotional well-being, physical activity, and treatment adherence in both patients and survivors of breast cancer [ 30 31 32 33 29 34 Group therapies play a valuable role in promoting socialization, raising awareness, and addressing feelings of loneliness, while individual therapies provide support for more personal and profound concerns [ 35 36 There is limited research on how patients actually engage in the process of making treatment decisions. A study addressing this topic revealed a substantial lack of concordance between physicians’ and patients’ perceptions. Cultural factors may influence whether patients adopt an active or passive role in decision-making processes [ 37 The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has issued guidelines for distress treatment in cancer patients, recommending regular administration of QoL surveys. According to the guidelines, this approach enhances the effectiveness of distress management, increases doctors’ awareness of their patients’ conditions, and has the potential to improve various parameters, including treatment participation [ 11 13 Finally, upon scrutinizing the recommendations provided by our experts involved in this study, a noteworthy barrier in our country pertains to the necessity for MoH and social associations to initiate awareness-raising efforts for providing psychological support to MBC patients. Potential areas of support in this context include expanding the number of associations emphasizing the collective effort against cancer, endorsing national and global projects dedicated to the comprehensive care, management, and support of breast cancer patients, facilitating group programs that incorporate coping techniques for individuals with breast cancer, and launching initiatives to heighten awareness. The World Health Organization launched the Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI) in 2021 with the goal of reducing global breast cancer mortality by 2.5% annually. This initiative focuses on strengthening health systems, promoting early detection, and expanding access to comprehensive care services [ 38 39 40 In conclusion, the psychosocial experiences of MBC patients are complex and multifaceted. A holistic, patient-centred, and multidisciplinary approach is crucial to address the myriad challenges they face. By integrating global research insights with localized perspectives, we can pave the way for more effective and compassionate care for MBC patients. 4.1. Strengths and limitations of the study While psychosocial challenges and quality of life (QoL) issues in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) have been explored in the international literature, our study provides a unique contribution by offering context-specific qualitative insights from Turkiye—a region largely underrepresented in psycho-oncology research. Below, we outline the key elements that highlight the originality and added value of our work: Local Sociocultural Context: Our findings illuminate how cultural, religious, and societal norms shape the experiences of MBC patients in Turkiye. Themes such as stigma around psychiatric care, family-centered coping mechanisms, and hierarchical physician-patient relationships emerge as culturally distinctive and are rarely addressed in the global literature. Multidisciplinary Stakeholder Perspectives: Unlike many qualitative MBC studies that focus solely on patients, our research integrates insights from oncologists, a psycho-oncologist, a psychologist, and a patient association representative. This approach offers a comprehensive, system-level view of psychosocial care provision in Turkiye. Practice-Oriented Findings: We identify actionable barriers—such as the gap between psychiatric referrals and available services, digital information overload, and the challenges of engaging patients in long-term care. These insights have practical relevance for healthcare professionals working in similar middle-income settings. Underrepresented Patient Population: The majority of QoL studies in MBC reflect the experiences of patients in high-income Western countries. By centering voices from Turkiye, our study helps fill this gap, shedding light on how local healthcare infrastructure, cultural expectations, and limited psychosocial resources impact patient well-being. In summary, our study offers novel and regionally grounded insights into the lived experiences and support needs of MBC patients in Turkiye. These findings not only complement the international literature but also broaden it by informing culturally responsive and system-aware models of care. Beside provided strengths, several limitations should also be acknowledged in the context of this study: Sample Diversity: The study primarily focused on a specific patient population in Turkiye. While this provides a localized perspective, the findings might not be generalizable to metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients in other cultural or socio-economic settings. Qualitative Approach: While the semi-structured qualitative interviews allowed for in-depth insights into the experiences of MBC patients, they are inherently subjective. The absence of quantitative measures means that the study lacks statistical generalizability. Limited interview time; Due to the limited interview time, not all questions could be answered by each participant. As a result, you might notice that some perspectives are absent under certain topics. Interview Participants: The study integrated findings from interviews with patient association representative, psychologist, and oncologists. The inclusion of a broader range of healthcare professionals or even patients themselves might have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced by MBC patients. Potential Bias: The semi-structured nature of the interviews might introduce interviewer bias, where the interviewer’s perceptions and beliefs could influence the questions posed or the interpretation of responses. Recall Bias: Participants’ recollections of their experiences and interactions with MBC patients might be influenced by recall bias, potentially affecting the accuracy of the information provided. Cultural Context: The study’s findings are deeply rooted in the Turkish cultural context. While this offers a unique perspective, it also means that certain cultural nuances and beliefs might not be applicable or understood in other settings. Lack of Longitudinal Data: The study captures a snapshot of the experiences and challenges faced by MBC patients at a particular point in time. A longitudinal approach, tracking the same patients over time, might have provided insights into the evolving nature of their challenges and needs. In light of these limitations, future research could benefit from a mixed-methods approach, incorporating both qualitative and quantitative data, and expanding the sample to include a more diverse range of participants and cultural contexts. 4.2. Future perspective In the next 5–10 years, the field of psychosocial support for metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients, particularly in regions like Turkiye, is poised for significant transformation. As the healthcare landscape evolves, a shift toward more comprehensive, culturally tailored, and patient-centered care models will likely emerge as the standard of practice. Given the findings highlighted in the article, several key developments are anticipated: Integration of Multidisciplinary Teams: The recognition of the need for a holistic, psycho-oncological approach will likely lead to the widespread adoption of multidisciplinary care teams that include oncologists, psychologists, social workers, and palliative care specialists. These teams will work collaboratively to address both the physical and psychological needs of MBC patients, ensuring that care is not only medically comprehensive but also emotionally supportive. Enhanced Doctor-Patient Communication: As communication between healthcare providers and patients becomes increasingly emphasized, training programs focusing on empathy, cultural sensitivity, and effective communication strategies will become a staple in oncology education. This will lead to stronger doctor-patient relationships, where patients feel more supported and understood, ultimately improving their overall quality of life (QoL). Expansion of Psychosocial Support Services: The current deficiencies in psychological support are likely to be addressed through the development of more accessible and regionally tailored interventions. This could include the establishment of specialized psycho-oncology centers that offer both individual and group therapies, as well as remote counseling services that leverage technology to reach patients in rural or underserved areas. Policy and Advocacy Advances: As awareness of the psychosocial challenges faced by MBC patients grows, there will likely be increased advocacy for policy changes that address these issues. This could include government initiatives to provide financial support for psychological services, workplace protections for MBC patients, and public health campaigns aimed at reducing societal stigma and promoting early intervention. Personalized Care and Technology Integration: Advances in technology will likely play a critical role in the future of MBC care. The use of AI and big data to tailor interventions based on individual patient profiles—considering factors such as genetic predispositions, psychological needs, and social circumstances—will enhance the effectiveness of treatments. Moreover, mobile health applications and telemedicine will provide continuous psychological support and monitoring, allowing for real-time adjustments to care plans. In summary, the evolution of psychosocial support for MBC patients in the coming years will likely be characterized by a more integrated, patient-centered, and technologically advanced approach. These changes will address the current gaps in care, significantly improving the QoL for MBC patients in Turkiye and beyond. The focus will shift from treating the disease in isolation to nurturing the whole patient, considering their physical, emotional, and social well-being as interconnected aspects of their overall health.
