Various experimental techniques were used to characterize the synthesized silymarin-based carbon quantum dots (SM-CQDs), to confirm their structure and investigate their potential applications in fluorescent sensors, photocatalysis and anticancer activity. The prepared SM-CQDs exhibited amorphous graphitic structure with a spherical shape and an average particle size of 4.6 ± 0.7 nm, as indicated by XRD, Raman, and TEM measurements. The FTIR results indicate the presence of diverse functionalities on the surface of the SM-CQDs, which were further confirmed by XPS analysis. Fluorescence characterization of the prepared SM-CQDs revealed blue emission with a fluorescence quantum yield (QY) value of 4.9%. Furthermore, the prepared dots exhibit temperature-sensitive photoluminescence (PL) behavior, which has been interestingly used to design economical, green, and highly sensitive fluorescent probes for the detection of Fe 3+ 2 2 − 1 50 Keywords SM-CQDs Silymarin Fluorescent sensors Photocatalysis Anticancer activity Subject terms Quantum dots Photonic devices Kafr El Shiekh University Open access funding provided by The Science, Technology & Innovation Funding Authority (STDF) in cooperation with The Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Springer Nature Limited 2025 Introduction Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are a new type of zero-dimensional carbon nanoparticles, consisting of quasi-spherical and discrete nanoparticles with dimensions less than 10 nm in diameter 1 2 3 2 3 4 Nowadays, many methods have been developed to synthesize fluorescent carbon quantum dots, such as hydrothermal/solvothermal treatment 5 6 7 8 5 9 10 11 12 Silybum marianum L. Gaertn 13 14 To our knowledge, the hydrothermal approach has not been previously used to synthesize CQDs from milk thistle (silymarin) seeds. Moreover, silymarin-based carbon quantum dots (SM-CQDs) have been applied in various applications such as fluorescent sensors for Fe 3+ 2 2 2+ 3+ 15 16 3+ 17 18 19 20 21 30 Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 2 31 2 2 32 2 2 33 2 2 34 35 2 2 36 37 2 2 Dyes are commonly used in various industries, including food, textiles, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, to enhance the color of products and make them more attractive to customers. However, depending on their chemical composition and use, some dyes can pose toxic risks to aquatic organisms. Industrial wastewater primarily from cosmetics, textiles, paper, and food industries can significantly pollute water sources. These pollutants can pose life-threatening risks to aquatic life, plants, and humans, even at low concentrations, due to harmful byproducts generated during their degradation, particularly through photolysis. In the textile industry, some azo dyes have been identified as degrading into toxic aromatic amines, which can lead to cancer and other health issues. Dyes cannot be eliminated from effluents using conventional processes due to their low biodegradability and complex structures 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 Furthermore, colorectal carcinoma is the most common type of primary colon cancer and is known as the third fatal cancer, after lung and breast cancer 46 47 48 49 33 50 51 52 53 Here, we report the preparation of CQDs from silymarin as the sole carbon source, and we systematically examine the fluorescence of SM-CQDs for their potential in sensing, photocatalysis and anticancer activity. The anticancer property of the SM-CQD was evaluated in the colorectal cancer cell line (Caco-2). Experimental details Materials Silymarin was purchased from Sigma Aldrich, quinine hemisulfate salt monohydrate (C 20 24 2 2 2 4 2 2 4 16 18 3 4 4 4 4 4 4 4, 4 3 3 3 3 2 4 Preparation and characterization of SM-CQDs Fluorescent silymarin-based carbon quantum dots (SM-CQDs) were prepared from silymarin through a simple hydrothermal treatment process, as shown in Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Scheme of the synthesis of silymarin-based carbon quantum dot (SM-CQDs) from milk thistle seeds by a simple hydrothermal method. An X-ray diffractometer (XRD-6100, Shimadzu, Japan) with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) was used to characterize the XRD pattern of the as-prepared SM-CQDs. The synthesized SM-CQDs were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-6800, JASCO, Japan) in the range of 500 to 4000 cm-1, Raman spectroscopy (WITec’s Raman microscopealpha300 R, Germany) with excitation wavelength (785 nm, Max. 133 mW), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100 F, JEOL). UV/Vis absorption spectrum of SM-CQDs was measured by a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (2600, Shimadzu, Japan) in the wavelength range of 200 to 1400 nm, and photoluminescence was examined by a spectrofluorometer (Jasco FP-8300 FL, Japan) in the wavelength range of 200 to 750 nm. The surface analysis of SM-CQDs was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) using a photoelectron spectrometer (Themo Fisher Scientific, USA) with Al Kα at 1350 eV. The surface charge of SM-CQDs was estimated by Zeta potential using the phase analysis light scattering (PALS) method (NanoBrook Zeta Potential Analyzer, USA) with a scattering angle of 15º and Zeta potential range (-500 to 500 mV). The charge carrier concentration of SM-CQDs film was estimated by Hall effect using an Ecopia system with a magnetic field about 0.53 T (model: HMS-3000, Korea). The cytotoxicity of the prepared SM-CQDs against Caco-2 cell lines was studied using the standard MTT assay as mentioned in “MTT assay”.

A graph showing the percentage of cell viability in the cancer cell line (Caco2) as a function of the SM-CQDs concentrations, as well as morphological images of Caco2 cells treated with different concentrations of SM-CQDs is shown in Fig. 13 13 50 13  Fig. 13 The percentage of cell viability as a function of SM-CQDs concentrations (a) and morphological images of treated Caco2 cells with the SM-CQDs concentration of zero, as a control (b), of 250 µg/mL (c) and of 1000 µg/mL (d). Images were taken at (100 μm) scale bar and 200x magnification. Conclusion Small-size (4.6 nm) water-soluble fluorescent carbon quantum dots (SM-CQDs) were synthesized using silymarin as the carbon source via a simple hydrothermal reaction. XRD study reveals the amorphous nature of SM-CQDs in good agreement with Raman and TEM results. Several functional groups, on the surface of SM-CQDs were confirmed by FTIR spectra as well as surface analysis via XPS spectroscopy. The results showed remarkable optical properties of the prepared SM-CQDs as they can emit blue fluorescence under UV light with a quantum yield of about (4.9%). It was found that Fe 3+ 2 2 50 Publisher’s note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.
