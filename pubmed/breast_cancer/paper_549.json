Although the importance of multivalency and protein disorder in driving these transitions is clear, there is limited knowledge concerning the structural basis of phase transitions or the conformational changes that accompany this process. In this work, we found that a small human protein, SERF2, is important for the formation of stress granules. We determined the solution NMR structure ensemble of SERF2. We show that SERF2 specifically interacts with non-canonical tetrahelical RNA structures called G-quadruplexes, structures linked to stress granule formation. The biophysical amenability of both SERF2 and RNA G4 quadruplexes have allowed us to characterize the multivalent protein-RNA interactions involved in liquid-liquid phase transitions, the role that protein disorder plays in these transitions, identify the specific contacts involved, and describe how these interactions impact the structural dynamics of the components enabling a detailed understanding of the structural transitions involved in early stages of ribonucleoprotein condensate formation. This study discovers human SERF2 as a key partner in stress granule formation by binding specific RNA G-quadruplexes. SERF2 and these RNAs provide a detailed structural model of protein-RNA interactions driving liquid-liquid phase separation in condensates.

Further, at low RNA to protein ratio, it yields small NMR signal broadening, enabling 1H-15N HSQC titration experiments. TERRA23 rG4-SERF2 interaction causes substantial chemical shift perturbations both in SERF2’s N- (3–21) and C-terminal (51–56) residues, as tracked by 1H-15N HSQC spectra (Fig. 3b 3c 3b 7a To further explore the impact of TERRA rG4 binding on SERF2 dynamics at residue level resolution, we compared the NMR relaxation data of SERF2 in its free and rG4-bound states. The relaxation measurement results showed that TERRA23 rG4 binding significantly increases R₂ values in both the N-terminal and C-terminal intrinsically disordered regions of SERF2, suggesting that SERF2 undergoes segmental slow-motion (Supplementary Fig. 7b 7c, d 7d, e 3d 7f 6 7g We next tested if SERF2 has preferential binding sites within the TERRA rG4 using the structurally well-characterized TERRA10 and TERRA12 rG4 sequences. These lengths were tested because they exhibit well-resolved guanine imino protons in comparison to TERRA23’s poorly resolved spectra. Binding of SERF2 caused chemical shift changes in the imino protons of G4, G5, G9, and G10 of TERRA12 and TERRA10 (Supplementary Fig. 8 8 9a 9b 3b 9c 9b, d SERF2 and RNA G-quadruplexes form multimeric complexes Since SERF2 forms multimeric protein-RNA assemblies and is involved in RNA-mediated phase transitions, we next investigated the mechanisms of SERF2-RNA complex formation and how multimerization occurs. To determine the stoichiometry of these complexes, we used analytical ultracentrifugation, which provides higher mass resolution as compared to size-exclusion chromatography. Analytical ultracentrifugation of TERRA12 rG4 in isolation shows two structures with sedimentation coefficients of 1.95 and 3.33, suggestive of globular, folded structures (Fig. 3e 3f 7g Structural dynamics and stability of the SERF2-RNA G-quadruplex complex The TERRA rG4 quadruplex binding sites in SERF2 we obtained from NMR measurements were used to build the TERRA-SERF2 complex structure and subjected to an all-atom molecular dynamic (MD) simulation study. The goal of this analysis was to characterize the structural changes and dynamic interactions that occur during the early stages of SERF2-rG4 complex formation and their potential involvement in liquid-liquid phase transitions. To model the complex, the TERRA rG4 sequence length was selected based on available high-resolution structures, TERRA12, which forms a dimeric quadruplex (PDB 2KBP), and TERRA10, which adopts a tetrameric rG4 conformation (PDB 2M18) 78 10a 79 3b 9 3g 10b Our analysis revealed that a hydrophilic core in the SERF2-rG4 complex is formed by residues in regions that are dynamic in monomeric SERF2 (Fig. 3g, h 3h 76 10c 3h 10b The hydrophilic core of the 1:2 rG4:SERF2 complex is larger than that present in the 1:1 complex due to charged C-terminal residues (R36, K50, K54, K55) that form hydrogen bonds with TERRA10 rG4. Over the atomic simulation timescale, SERF2 shifts from interacting with uracil in the 1:1 complex to guanine in the 1:2 complex (Supplementary Fig. 10d 8 10e + 10a + 80 + 78 81 Mutational study reveals the multivalent interactions that drive SERF2 phase transition MD simulations and NMR experiments provide the evidence that many of the evolutionary conserved lysine residues in SERF2 spanning the region 16–25 are important in rG4 binding. To further experimentally validate that these residues are involved in binding, we performed mutagenesis studies on the conserved K16, K17, K23, G24, and K25 residues that are predicted in our MD simulation to lie at the binding interfaces. Gel-shift assays show that single mutations (K23A or K25A) minimally affect rG4 binding, but the double K16-K17 mutation significantly impairs TERRA23 rG4 substrate binding (Fig. 3i 82 10f Structural insights into ribonucleoprotein condensate formation Biomolecular condensation underpins key cellular processes and diseases 83 84 Simulation results revealed a spectrum of assemblies, from unbound TERRA10 rG4 to SERF2-TERRA10 rG4 oligomers, culminating in a dominant ring-like higher-order structure enclosing a hydrated core (~6 nm) (Fig. 4a–c 11a 1 4c 3h 11b Fig. 4 All-atom MD simulation approach to study the structure of SERF2-TERRA rG4 phase-separated condensate. a - + b c b c c b d e f g \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$D=\\frac{{{{\\rm{MSD}}}}({{{\\rm{t}}}})}{6{{{\\rm{t}}}}}$$\\end{document} D = MSD ( t ) 6 t 2 The ring-structure emerges from electrostatically driven clustering (Supplementary Fig. 11c 4b, d 4b 85 The crowding molecule polyethylene glycol (PEG) plays an active but indirect role in this process. Initially distributed throughout the system, PEG molecules gradually become excluded from the dense core region of the condensate as it matures, likely due to steric hindrance and limited PEG permeability through the RNA-protein network (Fig. 4d, e 4e In the higher-order ring-like structure, SERF2 engages multiple TERRA10 rG4s via extensive charged interfaces (Fig. 4a–c 11d 4b 11b 4c 11e 12a 12b 12d 86 The structural stability of TERRA10 rG4 molecules in the condensates were next analyzed by calculating the formation of Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds within the rG4 molecules, with guanine N1, N2 and O2 serving as donor atoms and N7 and O6 serving as acceptor atoms, as a function of simulations time (Fig. 4f 87 4f Single-molecule tracking of SERF2-RNA G-quadruplex liquid-liquid phase transition droplets To validate our MD simulations, we compared the diffusion characteristics of SERF2 in SERF2-rG4s condensates obtained from MD with single-particle tracking using single-molecule fluorescence experiments (Fig. 5a 88 89 4g 2 2 2 12e 2 12e 2 5b 5c 90 91 Fig. 5 Single-molecule imaging and tracking of SERF2 interactions with TERRA rG4s. a b 2 c 2 90 91 d The slow diffusion of SERF2 in TERRA12 rG4 condensates may be due to strong electrostatic interactions of charged lysine and arginine residues with negatively charged nucleic acid bases, as has been observed for other nucleic acid-binding proteins 90 13a 90 88 89 13b 13c The end-to-end distance between the N- (T2C) and C- (A51C) termini of SERF2 was calculated using static fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements in both dilute and condensed phases. In the dilute phase, the mean distance between the N- and C-termini was 1.51 ± 0.5 nm (Fig. 5d 39 5d 13d 13d SERF2 regulates stress granule formation and liquid phase dynamics To further investigate SERF2’s involvement in RNA binding and in LLPT, we next explored SERF2’s cellular localization, function, and phase separation behavior in vivo. Immunofluorescence analysis in U2OS cells showed that under non-stress conditions, SERF2 is distributed in the cytoplasm but most intensely in the nucleolus as judged by its colocalization with the nucleolar marker protein fibrillarin (Fig. 6a, b 6c, d 14a 14b 6e, f 16 18 38 Fig. 6 SERF2 colocalizes with stress granules upon various stress conditions. a b a c d c e f e a c e The depletion of SERF2 using siRNA in U2OS and BJ fibroblast cells markedly reduced the number of stress granules observed, the number of stress granule-positive cells dropped from ~94% to 20% upon sodium arsenite treatment (Fig. 7a, b 15 1 7 15 92 93 15 7e 7f 2b 94 Fig. 7 SERF2 regulates stress granule formation and dynamics. a b a c a c d c b d P e f e f SERF2 and RNA G-quadruplexes modulate the G3BP1-RNA phase transitions Our earlier findings, which indicated SERF2 depletion could impact stress granule fluidity, motivated us to investigate whether SERF2 influences the phase behavior of the key stress granule protein G3BP1 95 8a, b 16a 8b, c 16b 8d, e 16c 2 8e 3g 7e, f Fig. 8 SERF2 facilitates the phase transition of the stress granule core protein G3BP1 and enhances G3BP1 fluidity. a b a b c d e d d Discussion There is a large range of liquid-liquid compartments in the cell. Though the precise function of this form of compartmentalization in health and diseases is unclear 65 96 100 101 97 88 89 3 4 Here we have obtained detailed structural information for two important components of stress granules, namely SERF2 and rG4, both separately and in combination, helping us to understand the process of LLPT and the interactions that likely take place within these membraneless compartments. We show that SERF2, 37 19 19 47 51 102 105 17 17 47 106 27 Despite the lack of direct intermolecular NOEs or side-chain-specific assignments, which remain a major technical challenge in NMR studies of ligand or dynamic protein-rG4 complexes 107 108 111 3 20 24 26 112 31 101 113 87 113 114 The pattern of charged residues in disordered proteins and the charge interactions have been demonstrated to play an important role in LLPT, as described in the simplified stickers and spacers model 86 4 99 Though the current work provided structural insights into SERF2 binding to TERRA rG4 and how it distorts the rG4 structure, future work will be necessary to probe if it interacts similarly or differently with in vivo rG4 binding partners, in stress granules or elsewhere. Determining if the ring-shaped structures we have observed are a common feature within condensates likely awaits the development of other protein-RNA pairs that can be analyzed in the same detail as our SERF2-rG4 system. A better understanding of the structure-function relationships present within quadruplexes will aid us in understanding rG4-linked biological functions such as gene regulation and stress granule formation. Methods Cell culture, treatment, and transfection U2OS cells (human) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Cat. no. 92022711-1VL), and HEK 293T/17 cells (ATCC® CRL-11268™) used in this study are derived from human embryonic kidney tissue. The HeLa Kyoto eGFP-FUS cells (human) were obtained from Dr. Antony Hyman at Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Germany. All cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Fisher Scientific, 11-995-073) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma, F4135) and 1X Penicillin-Streptomycin-Glutamine (Fisher Scientific, 10-378-016). Stress treatments were performed on cells with vehicles alone or with different stress inducers. Cells were then treated with a final concentration of 0.4 M sorbitol or 0.5 mM sodium arsenite to induce osmotic or oxidative stress, respectively. For ER stress, the cells were additionally treated with a final concentration of 2 mM dithiothreitol for 30 min in a culture medium at 37 °C. Cells were treated with 10 µM of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Cas No- 133407-82-6, Sigma) diluted in culture medium and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to inhibit protease function. For mitochondrial stress, cells were treated with 75 mM NaN 3 TM TM Immunofluorescence Cells were grown on coverslips with the conditions described above and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, 157-8-100) in 1X DPBS (Fisher Scientific, 14-190-144) at room temperature for 10 min. The fixed cells were washed three times with 1X DPBS and then permeabilized with 0.1 % Triton X-100 at room temperature for 30 min. The permeabilized cells were next blocked at room temperature for 1 h using UltraCruz TM TM TM TM Oligonucleotide synthesis High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purified unlabeled, TAMRA- and 6-FAM fluorescent labeled RNA nucleotides were either purchased from Integrated DNA Technology (IDT) or synthesized at the Slovenian NMR Center using previously described methods 115 116 Purification of recombinant proteins The plasmids, containing a codon-optimized human SERF2 gene, were synthesized commercially by GenScript and subcloned to a pER28a-SUMO vector as reported elsewhere 39 42 42 Escherichia coli 600 Isotope-labeled 15 N and 15N-13C SERF2 proteins for NMR studies were produced by growing cells in M-9 minimal media supplemented with 100% 15 N NH 4 4 6 g For the high-throughput RNA Bind-n-seq screening assay, SERF2 protein was prepared containing GST and streptavidin binding peptide (SBP) tags. SERF2 was cloned into a pGEX-6P-1 construct containing GST and SBP tags and transformed into Rosetta-competent cells. Cell cultures were grown in LB at 37 °C until OD 600 g 2 g Protein labeling Cy5 (Cytiva, PA25031) or Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488) (Invitrogen, A10254) labeling of protein was done by incubating 200 µM of SERF2 (T2C) or G3BP1 with a 10-molar excess of C 5 g High-throughput screening assays RNA bind-n-seq assay and analysis 48 48 The RNA bind-n-seq method was modified from a previous study as described below 48 2 48 48 We performed sequence enrichment analysis as previously described 48 117 k (3-6) (0-7) 4 48 FOREST assay— 49 + His-tagged SERF2 recombinant protein was used for the FOREST binding assay. For this purpose, the target protein (100 pmol of SERF2), 20 μL of TALON magnetic beads (Clontech), and 1 μg of the refolded RNA structure library were mixed in 1 mL of protein-binding buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 μg/μL BSA). A mixture containing no protein was also prepared as a control. The mixtures were incubated on a rotator at 4 °C for 30 min and washed three times with the protein-binding buffer. Then, 200 μL of elution buffer was added to the magnetic beads, and the mixture was heated at 95 °C for 3-min. The RNA was collected from the supernatant by removing the magnetic beads. The RNA structure library was extracted with phenol and chloroform, and an ethanol precipitation was conducted for RNA purification. The enriched RNA sample was hybridized for microarray analysis as detailed in the supporting methods. To determine the protein-binding intensities of each RNA probe, we subtracted the fluorescence intensities of the negative control sample (samples without protein) from those of the enriched protein samples. To account for any undesired interactions with the barcode region, we calculated the average fluorescence intensity of each structure by averaging the intensities of the RNA probes that had the same RNA structure but differing barcodes. NMR experiments Unless indicated, all NMR measurements were done with protein or protein-RNA mixture samples that had been suspended in 20 mM NaPi and 100 mM KCl (pH 7.4) containing D 2 3 2 72 3 Fluorescence polarization and anisotropy assay Fluorescently labeled 6-FAM RNA or AF488 labeled SERF2 probes were prepared in nuclease-free water containing 20 mM NaPi (pH 7.4) and 100 mM KCl. Fluorescence polarization assays were done either using 20 to 100 nM RNA 6-FAM rG4 or non-rG4 RNA probe mixed with increasing concentrations of SERF2, ranging from low nM to high µM, or using 200 nM AF488 labeled SERF2 with increasing concentration of structured or unstructured RNA. All fluorescence polarization (FP) assays were done in samples dissolved in 20 mM NaPi and 100 mM KCl (pH 7.4). In addition to unlabeled TAR RNA binding to AF488 SERF2, FP assay was also done using TAMRA-TAR RNA to reveal SERF2 binding specificity for rG4 structured RNA. FP or gel-shift EMSA binding assay was also carried out to test the binding specificity of SERF2 to two rG4 sequences derived from the 3’ UTR regions of Mark2 Stxbp5 D Circular dichroism spectroscopy The secondary structure of the G4s (15 µM) or SERF2 (50 µM), suspended in 20 mM NaPi and 100 mM KCl (pH 7.4), was studied by collecting circular dichroism (CD) spectra using a JASCO J-1500 spectropolarimeter. For folding analysis, the CD spectra of SERF2 were collected at different temperatures (4, 25, and 37 °C). CD titration was done for 20 µM TERRA23 rG4 against an increasing SERF2 concentration (10 to 100 µM) to monitor rG4 secondary structure change at 25 °C. The buffered CD spectrum was subtracted from the average CD spectrum obtained from 8 scans. The structural change in 40 µM SERF2 mixed with or without 20 µM TERRA12 rG4 was measured, which corresponds to 2:1 protein to RNA ratio used in NMR relaxation experiments. CD spectra of rG4 alone were used as a baseline and subtracted from the spectra of the SERF2-rG4 complex to monitor secondary structural change in SERF2. In vitro liquid-liquid phase transition assay 16-well Culture-Well chamber slips (Grace Bio-Labs) or 384-well plates (Cellvis, P384-1.5H-N), pre-treated with 5% (w/v) Pluronic™ F-127 (Sigma, P2443) overnight, were used to study in vitro phase separation. The well chambers were washed three times with 20 mM NaPi, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4 buffer and air dried. 50 or 20 µL aliquots of reaction sample mixtures were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in various conditions (varying protein, total RNA from HeLa cells, poly-ribonucleotides, and various rG4 concentrations) and a buffer with or without 10% of PEG8000 (Sigma, P5413). The effect of salt and PEG on LLPT was tested for 50 µM SERF2 mixed with equimolar TERRA12 or TERRA23. LLPT was measured in a non-crowding (20 mM NaPi, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4) or crowding condition (20 mM NaPi, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4 containing 2.5% or 5% w/v PEG8000) at varying G3BP1, HeLa cells extracted total RNA, SERF2, unstructured homo polyA RNA, structured HIV-1 TAR RNA and rG4 concentrations. For fluorescence imaging, 0.5% fluorescence-labeled (AF488, 6-FAM or Cy5) protein/rG4 samples were mixed into unlabeled sample mixtures. Sample imaging and FRAP measurements were done using a Nikon Ti2-E motorized, inverted microscope. This microscope is controlled by NIS Elements software and contains a SOLA 365 LED light source and a 100X oil immersion objective. Recovery half-life analysis was done using GraphPad Prism, and the image processing was done using Fiji ImageJ. Mutational analysis 5 µM of TERRA23 rG4s, dissolved in NaPi buffer, were mixed with equimolar concentrations of wild-type and different lysine-alanine mutant SERF2 and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Gel-shift mobility assays were next performed by loading a 5 µM TERRA rG4 sample mixture, containing SERF2 and 20% glycerol, onto a 4–20% TBE gel (Invitrogen, EC6225). For the LLPT assay, 50 µM of TERRA rG4s was dissolved in 20 mM NaPi, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4, containing 10% PEG8000 and mixed with different lysine-alanine SERF2 mutants at equimolar concentration. The samples were incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and DIC images were taken on a Nikon Ti2-E motorized, inverted microscope. Size-distribution analysis Size-exclusion chromatography— Analytical ultra-centrifugation (AUC) The AUC measurements were done for a SERF2 (9.4 μM) and TERRA12 rG4 (4.7 μM) sample mixture that was dissolved in 20 mM NaPi, 100 mM KCl (pH 7.4) at 22 °C. AUC measurements were done at 260 nm, where SERF2 has no absorption, and with an intensity mode of 42,000 rpm. 420 μL samples were loaded into a two-channel epon-charcoal centerpiece, with a 1.2 cm path length, in an An60Ti rotor of a Beckman Optima Xl-I AUC. The data were analyzed with Ultrascan III software (version 4) and the LIMS server using the computing clusters available at the University of Texas Health Science Center and XSEDE sites at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. Structure calculation and all-atom MD simulations SERF2 backbone assignments were done using standard 3D experiments, including HNCA, HNCACB, CBCAcoNH and HNCO experiments, along with the 2D HSQC collected at 4 °C. The side-chain assignment was carried out using a 3D 15 1 1 118 74 15 1 1 The MD simulations were performed using GPU nodes running in parallel. To gauge the intrinsic structural dynamics of these SERF2-TERRA rG4 systems, we performed all-atom MD simulations that were defined in a structure-based balanced forcefield, i.e., CHARMM36m 119 120 79 121 108 111 MD simulation of SERF2-TERRA RNA G4 quadruplex liquid-liquid phase separation We designed four densely packed, multi-component systems, containing 1:1 or 1:2 or 2:1 protein:RNA molecules, to study SERF2 and TERRA10 rG4 condensates using atomistic MD simulation. We designed two 1:1 MD systems, a large one comprising 30 protein and 30 rG4 molecules, and a small one that includes 6 protein and 6 rG4 molecules. The 1:2 and 2:1 system consists of 6 or 12 SERF2 or RNA molecules. The MD systems comprised randomly distributed multiple copies of SERF2, TERRA10, and 10% PEG8000 molecules solvated in a TIP3P water model in an orthorhombic water box with the dimensions of 20 × 20 × 20 nm. To mechanize the complex molecular assembly and preparation of the input files for the MD simulation under periodic boundary conditions, we used a Multicomponent Assembler in CHARMM-GUI 122 + - + - + - + - Post-dynamic analysis of molecular dynamic trajectories We employed the Gromos Clustering Algorithm method, with a cutoff of 0.2 nm, to obtain a representative conformation of the entire trajectory with maximum population. The hydrogen bond occupancy of each residue was computed using the hydrogen bonding analysis toolkit of Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD 1.9.4a53). An angle cutoff of 30° and donor-acceptor distance of 3.5 Å was set to compute hydrogen bonds between protein and nucleic acids. The residue pairs (amino acid and nucleic acid) having higher percentages of hydrogen-bond occupancy were used for the generation of interaction plots. Structural representations were created using PyMOL and the BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer. To probe the diffusion of SERF2 molecules in the small and large MD systems, the mean-square displacement of individual SERF2 molecules was calculated. The average end-to-end distance between the nitrogen atoms of T2 and A51 in SERF2 was computed using the 0.5 µs MD trajectory. The mean-square displacement analysis was carried out using gromacs gmx msd 123 Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and droplet fusion by optical tweezers Single particle tracking (SPT) and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments were conducted using a double cysteine SERF2 mutant (A2C and A51C) labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores. 200 µM of double-mutant SERF2 (A2C, A51C) was fluorescently labeled by incubating it with 5x molar excess of Cy3 and Cy5, applying the same protocol described above in the section ‘Protein labeling’. The occupancy of the Cy3 and Cy5 in each SERF2 molecule was not determined because the SPT and FRET measurements do not rely on a uniform 1:1 Cy3:Cy5 labeling for studying SERF2-TERRA12 rG4 condensates. For single-molecule experiments, droplets were prepared by mixing 100 µM unlabeled SERF2 and TERRA12 rG4 containing a picomolar concentration of Cy3-Cy5 SERF2 or diluted as needed to obtain a sparse concentration where single molecules are distinguishable for SPT. The sample chamber was prepared by mounting #1.5 coverslips on a standard glass microscope, using double-sided tape placed about 5 mm apart as spacers. The chamber was coated with ~15 µL of 0.1 mg BSA (5 min) followed by rinsing thrice with NaPi buffer containing 10% PEG8000. SERF2-TERRA12 rG4 droplets were then injected into the sample chamber, and droplets were allowed to settle for ~20 min. An O 2 The fusion of SERF2 and TERRA rG4 droplets was studied using a bespoke dual-trap optical tweezers instrument equipped with a bright-field camera and a 60X oil immersion objective (Nikon APO TIRF 60X). Two optical traps are generated by splitting a 10 W 1064 nm laser by polarity, with each polarized beam steered by an acousto-optic deflector (IntraAction DTD-274HD6). Each particle was trapped using approximately 250 mW laser power. 100 µM of SERF2 was mixed with equimolar TERRA23 or TERRA12 rG4s in 20 mM NaPi, 100 mM KCl, pH 7.4 buffer containing 10% PEG8000 (w/v). The glass slide chamber was prepared as described above and coated with 0.1 mg BSA (5 min), followed by rinsing. 15 µL of SERF2-rG4 droplet samples were passed into a glass slide chamber. Particle fusion was observed by trapping two condensate droplets in separate optical traps and steering the laser foci together until particle fusion was observed. Movies of fusion events were recorded within ~5 min at room temperature to avoid droplet settlement on the glass slide and droplet aging. The droplet fusion time was extracted using the ImageJ program.
