Design Systematic review and meta‐analysis. Data Sources PubMed, EMBASE, APA PsycInfo, Web of Science, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and WanFang were searched for eligible randomised controlled trials from inception to April 2024. Methods Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomised Trials 2.0. A random‐effects model was used for the meta‐analysis. Subgroup analyses and the meta‐regression aimed to investigate potential heterogeneity and identify characteristics that may be associated with more favourable acupressure outcomes. Results In total, 22 randomised controlled trials involving 2113 participants were included in this meta‐analysis. Compared with various control groups, acupressure exhibited a significant beneficial effect on sleep quality in cancer patients at post‐intervention (SMD = −1.38, 95% CI [−1.81, −0.95], p p p p Conclusions Acupressure appears to be a promising intervention for enhancing sleep quality among cancer patients. Future studies should elucidate the long‐term effects of acupressure on sleep quality, identify effective acupressure characteristics and determine which types of cancer patients benefit from this intervention. Impact This study provides a comprehensive summary of evidence supporting the use of acupressure to enhance sleep quality in cancer patients and demonstrates its effectiveness in clinical nursing practice.

Summary  What does this paper contribute to the wider global clinical community? ○ Acupressure can effectively improve sleep quality, and the effects can persist to a 4‐week follow‐up in cancer patients. ○ Auricular and somatic acupressure provided by healthcare professionals (including nurses) and self‐administered acupressure with different stimulation materials showed benefits for sleep quality in patients with various cancer types who underwent surgery, non‐surgery, or a combination of both, during treatment or post‐treatment survival. 1 Introduction Cancer poses a significant challenge to public health worldwide (Mao et al. 2022 2024 2022 2023 2022 2022 2020 2013 2021 2019 2021 2021 Poor sleep quality affects approximately 57.4% of cancer patients, and this prevalence is approximately two to three times higher than in the general population (Chen et al. 2024 2023 2020 2024 2020 2024 2020 2024 2023 2017 Pharmacological interventions such as benzodiazepines and antihistamines are commonly used to treat poor sleep quality in adults (Sateia et al. 2017 2015 2022 2018 2018 2024 2018 2024 2022 2021 2021 2022 2022 2024 qi 2022 qi 2021 qi 2018 2023 2022 2006 However, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of acupressure on sleep quality in cancer patients have yielded inconclusive findings. Some RCTs have demonstrated the benefits of acupressure (Li et al. 2023 2021 2023 2022 2023 2014 2022 2021 2 Methods 2.1 Protocol Registration The systematic review and meta‐analysis were preregistered under PROSPERO following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (Page et al. 2021 S1 2.2 Search Strategies A comprehensive literature search was conducted independently by two reviewers using the following databases: PubMed, Embase, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wan Fang. The search included results from the inception of the databases to 8 April 2024. The reference lists of relevant systematic reviews and grey literature were also checked for additional potentially eligible studies. The literature search process involved using combinations of keywords from the following categories: acupressure, sleep and cancer. The details of the search strategy can be found in Supplementary file S2 2.3 Eligibility Criteria The inclusion criteria were as follows. (1) Population: Adults aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with cancer, with no restriction on gender, cancer type, or treatment. (2) Intervention: Studies that assessed the effectiveness of acupressure, including auricular acupressure and somatic acupressure. (3) Comparison: Studies incorporating a control group that received either usual care, patient education, no intervention, or a placebo. (4) Outcomes: Studies that evaluated sleep quality as the primary outcome using any empirically validated scale. Secondary outcomes included sleep parameters such as total sleep time (TST), onset latency (OL), sleep efficiency (SE) and wake after sleep onset (WASO), assessed by actigraphy, Actiwatch or sleep diary. (5) Study design: RCTs. (6) Language: Studies published in either English or Chinese. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) the full text was not available, (2) the study included participants with psychiatric diseases, (3) the participants were taking medication for sleep problems and (4) the mean difference (standard deviation) from baseline to post‐intervention or follow‐up could not be calculated. 2.4 Study Selection and Data Extraction The retrieved studies were imported into EndNote 21 (Gotschall 2023 2.5 Quality Assessment of Included Studies The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for Randomized Trials 2.0 (RoB‐2) was used to assess the methodological quality of the eligible studies (Sterne et al. 2019 2.6 Data Synthesis and Statistical Analysis The meta‐analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4 (RevMan 2020 2012 2023 2007 p 2023 I 2 I 2 2003 p 2023 2002 2023 The subgroup analyses were conducted based on categorical characteristics: cancer type, cancer treatment type, treatment phase, acupressure type and acupressure provider. Univariate meta‐regression was performed on the continuous characteristics: sample size, number of acupoints, number of acupressure sessions, duration of each session, and duration of the acupressure intervention. Subgroup analyses and meta‐regression were conducted to explore the potential source of heterogeneity and the potential characteristics associated with improved sleep quality. These characteristics were identified from previous research (Waits et al. 2018 2021 2023 3 Results 3.1 Search Results Figure 1 FIGURE 1 PRISMA flow diagram.

The findings revealed that acupressure significantly improved sleep quality in overall cancer patients at post‐intervention (SMD = −1.38) and 4‐week follow‐up (SMD = −0.33) compared with various control groups. The adjusted results for publication bias indicated that it did not impact these findings. This result aligns with the meta‐analysis by Lu et al. ( 2022 2021 2019 2009 2008 2008 2003 2018 Regarding sleep measures, acupressure demonstrated significant improvements in SE (SMD = 0.77) and TST (SMD = 0.68), but not in WASO (SMD = −0.54). However, caution is warranted when interpreting the findings regarding TST and WASO due to the instability observed in the sensitivity analyses. The sensitivity analysis results for TST suggested that the heterogeneity potentially stemmed from the studies by Liu, Wang et al. ( 2022 2022 2021 2021 2017 2021 2016 2022 2016 2023 2021 2021 2022 This study also investigated the population‐level and intervention‐level characteristics that influenced the effectiveness of acupressure on sleep quality among cancer patients through subgroup analyses and meta‐regressions. First, it was found that acupressure had a large effect on patients with ovarian cancer (SMD = −3.11), breast cancer (SMD = −1.05), and lung cancer (SMD = −0.94). This implies that acupressure could be an effective intervention for a broad range of cancer patients. A previous meta‐analysis reported a similar finding of a large positive effect of acupressure on sleep quality in patients with lung cancer (SMD = 0.80) (Lu et al. 2022 2018 Second, the subgroup analysis revealed that acupressure significantly improved sleep quality across all treatment types: surgical treatments (SMD = −1.07), non‐surgical treatments (SMD = −1.28), and combined surgical and non‐surgical treatments (SMD = −0.93). This finding indicates the potential of acupressure to enhance sleep quality at any stage and with any type of cancer treatment. However, due to the lack of detailed information regarding the cancer treatments administered in the reported studies, the specific effects of acupressure on sleep quality among cancer patients undergoing specific non‐surgical treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy) remain uncertain (Miller et al. 2022 Third, the subgroup analysis found that acupressure had a large effect on sleep quality in cancer patients, whether they were undergoing treatment (SMD = −0.98) or were in post‐treatment survival (SMD = −0.96). The consistent effectiveness may be attributed to acupressure's ability to modulate the autonomic nervous system, promote relaxation, and potentially influence neurotransmitter levels (such as serotonin and melatonin), which collectively contribute to improved sleep regulation regardless of the treatment phase (Hmwe et al. 2019 2013 Fourth, the findings demonstrated that acupressure, whether delivered by healthcare professionals (SMD = −1.25) or self‐administered (SMD = −1.44), had a large effect on improved sleep quality. In clinical settings, the acupressure intervention protocol (e.g., identifying appropriate acupoints, sequencing and timing of acupressure application per acupoint, and the use of specific acupressure techniques) can be easily taught and is accepted by both nurses and patients (Harris 1997 2018 2020 2020 2022 Fifth, the subgroup analysis revealed that auricular acupressure (SMD = −1.75) and somatic acupressure (SMD = −1.11) significantly improved sleep quality, supporting previous systematic reviews on the benefits of these methods in cancer patients (Liu et al. 2020 2022 2021 2014 2015 qi qi 2016 2012 2015 2009 2021 2022 2002 2019 2016 2018 2010 2023 2014 2001 Sixth, the subgroup analysis found that the use of the hand (SMD = −1.11), semen vaccariae (SMD = −1.81) and magnetic beads (SMD = −1.04) significantly improved sleep quality in cancer patients. However, as there have been reported cases of allergies associated with the use of semen vaccariae (Sha et al. 2016 Seventh, the meta‐regression analysis did not identify any specific characteristics that could enhance the outcome of the intervention. Regarding the number of acupoints used, the majority of studies used between three and six acupoints, which is consistent with findings from previous meta‐analyses (Waits et al. 2018 2020 2023 In addition, significant heterogeneity was observed in the sleep outcomes, with I 2 2022 4.1 Limitations This meta‐analysis also has several limitations. First, the majority of the studies were conducted in China, and only studies published in English or Chinese were included. This may restrict the generalisability of the findings to other countries or regions. Second, the analysis was limited to examining the effectiveness of acupressure on sleep quality specifically in patients with breast or lung cancer because of a lack of sufficient data on other cancer types. This limitation may limit the generalisability of the results to patients with different types of cancer. Third, only three studies included a 4‐week follow‐up assessment, which constrained our ability to evaluate the long‐term effects of acupressure on poor sleep quality. Fourth, the lack of comprehensive details about the acupressure intervention protocol (e.g., specific acupressure techniques used, and the background of the healthcare professionals) in the included RCTs prevented a detailed exploration of the effective acupressure protocol for improving sleep quality. Fifth, there was considerable heterogeneity across the studies. Although a series of subgroup analyses and a meta‐regression were performed to explore the heterogeneity, the underlying sources remain unidentified. Lastly, the presence of a publication bias suggests that the results should be interpreted with caution. 5 Conclusion This meta‐analysis indicates that acupressure could be a more effective intervention for enhancing sleep quality in cancer patients than sham acupressure, patient education, usual care and no intervention. Nonetheless, there is a need for future high‐quality RCTs with longer follow‐up periods and detailed acupressure protocols across diverse geographical settings to further explore the effectiveness of acupressure on sleep quality among cancer patients.
