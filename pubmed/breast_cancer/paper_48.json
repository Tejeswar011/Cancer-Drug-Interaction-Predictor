Circadian rhythms are integral to maintaining metabolic health by temporally coordinating physiology across tissues.

The clock operates through a transcriptional-translational feedback loop, where core clock genes (with the essential component Bmal1 1 2 3 Circadian rhythms are synchronized by external cues ( Zeitgebers 4 5 Zeitgeber 6 7 8 We have begun to dissect the organization and communication between tissue clocks, and how this contributes to physiological regulation. Our recent findings suggest that the brain clock plays a crucial role in driving circadian rhythms in the periphery [ [9] [10] [11] [10] [11] [12] [13] 14 15 in vitro 2 Results and discussion 2.1 The hepatocyte clock is required for rhythmic expression of lipid metabolic genes in white adipose tissue To determine whether transcriptional rhythms in WAT depend on the hepatocyte clock, we used a hepatocyte-specific Bmal1 Figure 1 Fig. S1a Ad libitum 16 Fig. S1b-l Fig. S1k-l 17 Zeitgeber Figure 1 Hepatocyte-specific Bmal1 BioRender.com Bmal1 Figure 1 We first investigated the contribution of hepatocyte BMAL1 in coordinating WAT molecular clock rhythms. We found that rhythms of the core clock machinery in WAT were altered in LKO in comparison to WT ( Fig. S1m Bmal1 Nr1d1 Dbp Fig. S1m Per2 Fig. S1m Bmal1 16 Supplemental table S1 Fig. S1n Next, we explored the dependency of the hepatic-clock in regulating rhythms of global WAT transcription. Our results show that the hepatocyte clock is required to control the rhythmicity of 655 transcripts and supress the rhythms of 240 transcripts in the WAT ( Figure 1 Furthermore, only ten of these 341 transcripts displayed anti-phasic oscillations and 18 showed differences in mesor (mean expression level) between groups, suggesting that most hepatocyte clock-independent rhythms are conserved in their circadian parameters ( Supplementary table 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 2.2 The hepatocyte clock integrates feed-fasting cues to modulate transcriptional rhythms in white adipose tissue In the LKO model we found that the rhythmicity of the local WAT clock is tuned by the hepatocyte clock. Therefore, it is possible that global changes in WAT transcriptional rhythms, induced by the absence of the hepatocyte clock, could be mediated via the local WAT clock. To test for the sufficiency of the hepatic clock in integrating feeding cues to modulate WAT oscillations, we interrogated a previously described hepatocyte clock reconstituted (LRE) mouse model [ 18 Bmal1 Bmal1 Figure 2 ad libitum 13 18 13 13 Bmal1 Fig. S2a 19 Supplementary table 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Supplemental table S2 Supplemental table S2 Figure 2 20 Figure 2 Supplemental table S2 Figure 2 The liver clock is sufficient to integrate feed-fasting cues to modulate transcriptional rhythms in white adipose tissue BioRender.com Bmal1 Cebpa p Cebpa p Figure 2 To gain further insight into which pathways in WAT that are controlled by the hepatocyte clock, we performed pathway analyses of the network-dependent (requiring at least one other tissue clock), hepatocyte clock-dependent (restored rhythmicity by reconstituting the hepatocyte clock) and clock independent (rhythmic in the presence and absence of tissue clocks) ( Figure 2 Figure 2 21 Fig. S2b 22 SPAGA SPATA Fig. S2c Figure 2 Supplemental table S2 per se Adipor1 Apoe Ldlr Fig. S2d A closer look into the hepatocyte-clock dependent rhythmic genes involved in lipid metabolic process identified Cebpa 23 Cebpa Figure 2 Cebpa The data suggest that Cebpa Figure 2 Cebpa 16 Cebpa ad libitum Cebpa 2.3 In vitro characterization of circadian communication from hepatocytes to adipocytes Circadian inter-organ communication involves endocrine, metabolic, and neuronal signaling [ 7 24 in vitro Figure 3 25 Bmal1 Fig. S3a Fig. S3b Bmal1 Fig. S3c Fig. S3d in vitro Cebpa Cebpa Figure 3 Cebpa Figure 3 Bmal1 Figure 3 Cebpa Bmal1 Fig. S3e Figure 3 Circadian hepatocyte-to-adipocyte communication is mediated through BMAL1-controlled hepatokines. in vitro BioRender.com Cebpa Bmal1 p Bmal1 p Bmal1 p Cebpa p Bmal1 p Figure 3 Cas9-mediated engineering of 3T3-L1 cells led to a comparable downregulation of BMAL1 protein levels as observed in AML12 cells ( Fig. S3f in vivo Cebpa Fig. S3g Cebpa Bmal1 Bmal1 Fig. S3h Cebpa Fig. S3i Cebpa Cebpa 2.4 The hepatocyte clock controls adipocyte lipid accumulation and respiration We next aimed to investigate the role of the hepatocyte clock in regulating adipocyte physiology. Of note, LRE mice, subjected to night-time feeding, display similar respiration, body weights [ 13 12 in vitro The differential regulation of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism led us to investigate the role of clock-driven hepatokines on adipocyte lipid accumulation and respiration. To this end, we incubated 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes with conditioned media from the synchronized AML12 hepatocytes throughout the adipogenic differentiation process (daily media change over 7 days) and subsequently measured adipocyte lipid accumulation. Conditioned media from hepatocytes regulated rhythms (trend toward significant circadian rhythm) of lipid accumulation which were significantly higher in the group treated with WT conditioned media in comparison to adipocytes treated with media from Bmal1 Figure 3 S3j Fig. 3 We next assessed oxygen consumption in the 3T3-L1 cells treated with hepatocyte conditioned media for 6 h. The maximum over basal oxygen consumption ratio represents the spare respiratory capacity which, in our system, displayed circadian rhythmicity in adipocytes treated with WT conditioned media but not in adipocytes treated with conditioned media from Bmal1 Figure 3 Figure 3 Bmal1 Fig. S3k 2.5 Identification of clock-controlled hepatokines regulating adipocyte function The direct circadian communication from the liver to WAT may be facilitated through metabolite and/or protein signalling.

Hence, an enrichment of genes associated with cardiometabolic health parameters within a GRN, indicates that these are causally linked to cardiometabolic health. Using this unique human resource, we investigated the enriched GRNs for the hepatocyte-clock driven transcriptional rhythms extracted from our murine transgenic mouse models ( Supplementary table 4 Figure 5 Supplemental table S5 Figure 5 Figure 5 NPAS2 ARNTL Fig. S6c Previous research on the link between circadian rhythms and WAT homeostasis has primarily focused on the local clock in adipocytes and their progenitor cells [ 32 16 Collectively, our observations provide mechanistic insight into the circadian network, with YWHAH Ywhah Cebpa YWHAH 33 34 YWHAH Importantly, despite the significant associations of YWHAH 14 15 7 For instance, the downregulation of REV-ERBα, resulting in catabolism through hepatokine signalling, has been reported in cancer cachexia [ 15 7 24 35 36 in vitro in vivo 37 38 Dissecting the directionality in the circadian inter-organ network will advance our understanding of how circadian rhythms are controlled and advise novel therapeutic approaches targeting the detrimental effects of circadian misalignment on metabolic homeostasis [ 39 2.8 Limitations of the study Emerging evidence points to sex-specific differences in circadian rhythms [ 40 41 Ywhah Cebpa Our in vitro 7 Our in vitro in vivo The main limitation of this study is that we were unable to detect YWHAH in serum samples collected from mice. Although we confirmed its presence in extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from livers ex vivo Additionally, YWHAH is a ubiquitously expressed protein, and other tissues are likely involved in regulating its systemic levels. Despite this, we relied on QENIE analysis to identify liver-derived circadian factors potentially regulating WAT adipogenic gene expression. As a proof of principle, we focused on one of the predicted circadian liver genes, Ywhah in vitro Ywhah Cebpa in vivo in vivo Ywhah Cebpa Taken together, despite these limitations, our study provides robust evidence that the hepatocyte clock contributes to the regulation of transcriptional rhythms in WAT lipid metabolism. 3 Materials & methods 3.1 Animals Mice were bred and housed in the animal facilities at the University of California–Irvine vivarium, Barcelona Science Park, Spain and, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at UC-Irvine, European Union and Spanish regulations and, Stockholm South Ethical review board (Dnr:02936–2023) and the Karolinska Institute guidelines, respectively. Animal experiments were designed and conducted with consideration of the ARRIVE guidelines (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments).

To extract and identify the UMI-containing reads in zUMIs, find_pattern: ATTGCGCAATG was specified for file1 as well as base_definition: cDNA (23–75; single end), (23–150-bp, paired end) and UMI (12–19) in the YAML file. Mouse cDNA was mapped against mm10 genome with CAST SNPs masked with N to avoid mapping bias.

A total of 6uM of recombinant Streptococcus pyogenes Proliferating AML12 and 3T3-L1 cells were then transfected using Neon Transfection. System 100 μL Kit (Invitrogen) with the following conditions: 1700 V, 20 ms, 1 pulse. Validation of gene knockdown was assessed by qPCR and Western blot (as described below). 3.11 AML12 conditioned media stimulation of 3T3-L1 cells To study cross-cell communication in vitro AML12 Bmal1 Ywhah 5 To study the effect of the secreted hepatic factors on pre-adipocytes, 3T3-L1 cells were first cultured in 48-well plates and cells were differentiated for 3 days with standard medium containing DMI and BRL, as described in the previous section. Thereafter, cells were washed with PBS, then cultured for 6 h with the conditioned media collected from the AML12 cells. For experiments investigating the effects of hepatokines, media were treated with Proteinase K (20 mg/mL), then boiled at 50 °C for 45 min. To inactivate proteinase K, media was subsequently heated with 1 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) for 15 min at 80 °C. Control samples were also exposed to EDTA and heated to 80 °C. Total protein content was determined using silver staining (Pierce silver stain kit, Thermo Fisher, Cat. No. 24612) of the SDS PAGE gel as well as Ponceau S staining of the PVDF membrane after transfer. 3.12 Overexpression experiments Messenger RNA (mRNA) for Ywhah in vitro In vivo Ywhah in vivo 3.13 Western blot analyses Western blots were performed as previously described [ 45 Signalling, #14269; Albumin, Bethyl Laboratories, #A90-134 A; anti-TSG101, Abcam #EPR7130(B); anti-CD63, Abcam, #EPR5702, anti-CD81, Abcam, ab109201; antiP84, Genetex, GTX70220 and LAMIN A/C, Cell Signalling, #4777. After three washes in TBS-tween (10 min each), membranes were incubated in Anti-mouse IgG, HRP conjugate, EMD Millipore, AP160P or Anti rabbit IgG, HRP linked, Cell Signaling Technologies, 7074 S for 1 h at room temperature in 3% blocking solution. Membranes were incubated with ECL western-blotting substrate (Amersham International, GE Healthcare) and images were acquired using a Chemidoc XRS system or ChemiDOC (Bio-Rad Laboratories). 3.14 Western blot analyses for conditioned medium-derived EVs EVs were lysed using lysis buffer, and 50 μg of total protein was loaded onto a NuPAGE™ 4–12% Bis-Tris protein gel (1.5 mm, NP0335). Electrophoresis was performed at 200 V for 30 min, followed by transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane using iBlot™ 2 Transfer Stacks. The membrane was blocked with Intercept™ (TBS) Blocking Buffer for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: anti-Alix (EnkiLife, APRab00291, 1:500), anti-CD63 (EnkiLife, AMRe01577, 1:500), and anti-TSG101 (EnkiLife, AMRe02725, 1:500). After washing with TBST, the membrane was incubated with Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (IRDye® 680RD, 1:5000) for 2 h at room temperature. Imaging was performed using a BioRad gel documentation system. 3.15 Isolation of liver-derived small extracellular vesicles Eight-week-old C57/BL6J mice were anesthetized by isoflurane, the hepatic portal vein was clipped with scissors, and the inferior vena cava was cannulated using a butterfly needle for perfusion at 2 mL/min with PBS. Following perfusion, liver lobes were removed, placed in a 50 mL conical tube, and bubbled with carbogen in chemically defined, CHO media. Following a 45-minute incubation period, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 2,000 g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet cellular debris. This supernatant was then mixed with Thermo Exosome Isolation Reagent (Invitrogen Ref #4478359) following the manufacturer's protocol to precipitate extracellular vesicles. Briefly, following an overnight incubation at 4 °C, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by resuspension in PBS and re-centrifugation at 10,000 g for 1 h at 4 °C. Extracellular vesicles were then resuspended in an appropriate volume of RIPA buffer including protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail for downstream applications. Total protein content was determined using zinc staining (Pierce Zinc Reversible Stain Kit, Thermo Fisher, Cat. No. 24582) of the SDS PAGE gel. 3.16 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Three microliters of the sample were applied to glow-discharged, carbon-coated, formvar-stabilized 400 mesh copper grids (easiGlow™, Ted Pella) and incubated for approximately 30 s. The excess sample was then blotted off, followed by a MilliQ water wash. Grids were negatively stained with 1% ammonium molybdate and imaged using an HT7800-Xarosa transmission electron microscope (Hitachi HighTechnologies) operated at 80 kV, equipped with a 4 MP Veleta CCD camera (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions GmbH). 3.17 Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA) Nanoparticle tracking analysis was performed using the ZetaView PMX-220-12H-R5 instrument (Particle Metrix) in both scatter and fluorescence mode (488 nm). Calibration beads and biological samples were diluted in PBS to a final volume of 1 mL. For calibration, 100 nm polystyrene beads were diluted 1:250,000 (v/v). EV samples were captured with the following settings: sensitivity 80, shutter speed 100, and cell temperature maintained at 25 °C. Measurements were preceded by a PBS wash to prevent sample carryover. For EVs isolated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), two imaging cycles were performed by scanning 11 cell positions. Video capture was conducted at 30 frames per second. Data analysis was done using ZetaView software version 8.06.01, with the following parameters: minimum brightness 25, minimum area 10, and maximum area 200. 3.18 Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) AML12 conditioned media was first filtered through a 0.22 μm filter and then concentrated using a 10 KDa spin filter. The concentrated media was processed through 70 nm Izon qEV original Gen2® columns. After discarding the initial 3 mL void volume, EV fractions 4–5 were collected separately and concentrated with a 10 KDa spin filter. Fractions 7–12 were pooled, with 2 mL collected for each, to collect protein molecules. All fractions were analyzed using the Zeta View Nanoparticle Tracking Analyzer (Particle Metrix GmbH) and Pierce® BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Cat. No 23235) to quantify EVs and proteins. Absorbance was measured by CLARIOstar® Plus (BMG LabTech). 3.19 Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) EV's were sonicated at the ultra-low setting of the Diagenode Bioruptor three times for 10 s each in PBS for CryoEM preparations. 3 μL of the EV preparation was applied to lacey carbon grids (4–6 nm thick on 300 mesh Gold grid, Catalog No. 50193–1309, Electron Microscopy Sciences) that had been glow discharged at 20 mA for 30 s in a Quorum EMS glow discharger. Grids were vitrified with a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) maintained at 8 °C and 100% humidity. A blot force of 0 and blot time of 3 s was applied before plunge freezing into liquid ethane. The data were collected at 200 kV on a Glacios cryo-transmission electron microscope equipped with a Falcon IV camera and Selectris energy filter (slit width: 10 eV) at the University of Texas Health San Antonio Cryo-EM Facility. Imaging was acquired using Thermo Fisher Scientific's EPU software. The total dose was 53 e−/Ǻ2, with a −2 nm defocus. Micrographs were recorded at either 130,000X or 63,000x with a pixel size of 0.19 nm and 0.15 nm, respectively. In all, 100 non-overlapping micrographs were taken to confirm size and morphology of sEV preparation. 3.20 Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) To measure the diameter of sEV's, the Diagenode Bioruptor was used to gently sonicate for 10 s on the ultra-low setting three times to break up aggregates. The DynaPro NanoStar machine was turned on for at least 30 min prior to the beginning of the experiment. Cuvettes were cleaned using soapy water, followed by ethanol, and were thoroughly dried with compressed air to eliminate presence of dust particles. Extracellular vesicles were diluted by a factor of 1:10 in filtered (0.22 μm) PBS to allow for proper dispersion of particles. The laser wavelength was set to 663.87 μm, temperature was controlled to room temperature and the peak radius cutoff was set between 0.5 nm and 5,000 nm. The auto attenuation limit was set to 60s and the wait time was 5 min. Laser intensities were set to 25%. Prior to running sEV particles, 50 μL of a known standard, ubiquitin, was run as an internal control and peaks were observed at 1.6–1.8 nm. 50 μL of dilute sEV sample was run to measure diameter of EV particles. 3.21 Seahorse assay Oxygen consumption rates (OCR) were measured with XF96 Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer (Agilent) using Cell Mito Stress Test kits (Agilent Technologies, USA). To assess basal OCR, cells were pre - incubated in Sea Horse medium (Agilent Technologies, USA) supplemented with 1 mmol l −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 3.22 Assessment of lipid area 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes were plated in Corning® CellBIND® 96 well plates up to 90% confluence. Thereafter, medium was switched to AML12 conditioned media for the following 7 days of differentiation, with daily changes. Cells were then fixed on the plates using 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and stained with Hoechst and BODIPY for 20 min, then preserved in PBS. High – throughput quantification of nuclear (Hoechst) and lipids (BODIPY) staining were carried out using a CellInsightCX5 High Content Screening Platform at 10X magnification. 3.23 Bioinformatic analyses To identify oscillating transcripts, transcriptomic data for liver, WAT and AML12 cells were analyzed using the DryR package [ 19 For the WAT and liver tissues, raw count data were input into the dryseq For the AML12 RNA-seq data, raw counts were normalised by dividing each gene count by the mean count across all genes within each sample. While this approach differs from the DESeq2 normalization used for tissue data, it was selected to better preserve subtle temporal expression changes characteristic of in vitro For in vivo in vitro https://cosinor.online/app/cosinor.php For pathway analyses we used the online ToppFun tool ( https://toppgene.cchmc.org/enrichment.jsp 3.24 Quantitative endocrine network interaction estimation (QENIE) To quantify and predict the impact of Liver genes on global gene expression in WAT, we applied a bioinformatics framework named QENIE using data from the hybrid mouse diversity panel [ 27 46 47 bicorAndvalue 3.25 Statistics Data were analysed using Prism 10.1 (GraphPad) and RStudio. Graphs display mean values, and error bars represent the standard error of the mean. Significant circadian transcripts across all RNA-sequencing datasets were identified using the dryR method in RStudio (see Methods for details). The dryR output, including detailed statistics for each transcript's circadian rhythm, is provided in the supplementary table corresponding to each figure. For panels assessing rhythmicity of non-omics data, cosinor p-values are reported. The number of biological replicates for each experiment is indicated in the figure legends. Statistical comparisons between groups at individual time points were performed using unpaired Student's t-tests, ordinary one-way ANOVA, or two-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's LSD test.
