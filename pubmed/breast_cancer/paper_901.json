Pomegranate peel is rich in polyphenols (such as ellagic acid and gallic acid), triterpenoids (such as ursolic acid and oleanolic acid), flavonoids (such as quercetin and baicalein) and other active ingredients. These components can be self-assembled to form nanostructures without exogenous carriers through intermolecular synergy, including hydrogen bond network, π-π stacking and hydrophobic interaction. This technology not only effectively improves the water solubility, bioavailability and stability of the active ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine, but also significantly enhances pharmacological activities including anti-tumor, anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidation etc. Compared with the traditional nanocarrier system, this method adopts the design concept of ‘active ingredient is carrier’, showing significant advantages in avoiding potential toxicity and improving drug loading efficiency, while retaining the structural integrity and synergistic effect of natural components. The study further pointed out that in the future, the self-assembly mechanism should be further explored, its application in precision medicine and individualized treatment should be optimized, and preclinical and clinical studies should be promoted to verify its safety and effectiveness. Combined with modern pharmaceutical engineering technology, promoting the large-scale production and industrialization of such carrier-free self-assembled nanomedicines will bring important impetus to the modernization of traditional Chinese medicine and global health.

Although the nanosystem based on chitosan, liposomes and other carriers can improve the solubility of drugs and achieve sustained release effect, it still faces bottleneck problems such as potential toxicity of carrier materials, limited drug loading rate and complex production process [ 11 12 1 13 14 2 Fig. 1 Self-assembly mechanism, morphology and pharmacological pathway of nanoparticles. Taking berberine and chlorogenic acid as examples, the mechanism of carrier-free self-assembly of nanoparticles and intermolecular forces were explained. After the formation of nanoparticles, the pharmacological effects were verified by intragastric administration. Created on BioRender.com Fig. 2 Flow chart of research. Created on BioRender.com Active ingredients of pomegranate peel Pomegranate peel, as the dried peel of pomegranate ( Punica granatum 2 4 15 1 Tannins are a class of polyphenolic compounds with complex structure. According to the chemical structure characteristics, they can be divided into three categories: hydrolyzable tannins, condensed tannins and complex tannins [ 16 17 18 19 20 22 1 17 21 Flavonoids are an important class of plant secondary metabolites. The basic skeleton of flavonoids is composed of 2-phenylchromone, including two aromatic rings (A ring and B ring) through three carbon atoms of the connecting chain (C6–C3–C6) [ 23 15 24 26 27 25 26 In addition to polyphenols, pomegranate peel also contains a variety of other active ingredients: (1) Triterpenoids such as ursolic acid and oleanolic acid regulate inflammatory pathways through the synergistic effect of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups [ 4 28 3 15 1 21 2 5 29 21 30 32 21 33 36 Carrier-free self-assembly combination of active ingredients of pomegranate peel Ursolic acid Ursolic acid (UA), as a pentacyclic triterpenoid compound with self-assembly characteristics, has shown broad application potential in the field of nano-remediation due to its excellent biosafety and biological activity. Researchers have used a variety of methods to prepare a variety of ursolic acid-based nanoparticles for the treatment of different diseases. Near-spherical ursolic acid nanoparticles (UA NPs) with a diameter of about 150 nm were prepared by solvent exchange method. The self-assembly of UA NPs mainly depended on hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bond interaction, and hydrophobic interaction may be the main driving force [ 37 38 13 39 40 41 Oleanolic acid Oleanolic acid (OA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid that can self-assemble into hollow nanospheres (Wang et al., 2020b). Bag et al. self-assembled OA into biocompatible vesicles in 0.0025% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) aqueous solution, with a shape of 2.5–5.0 mm spherical aggregates [ 42 zeta 43 14 Gallic acid Gallic acid (GA) is a natural polyphenolic compound. The benzene ring, hydroxyl group and carboxyl group contained in the structure enable it to participate in self-assembly to form nanorods through non-covalent forces such as hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking [ 14 44 Chlorogenic acid Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a natural polyphenolic compound, and berberine (BBR) is an isoquinoline alkaloid. The supramolecular Chinese medicine nanocomposite BBR/CGA was prepared by dialysis precipitation method, and its formation mainly depended on hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking, electrostatic adsorption and hydrophobic interaction. Specifically, there may be electrostatic interactions between the quaternary amine structure (positively charged N) of BBR and the carboxylic acid part of CGA, while π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding also play an important role in the self-assembly process. The nanocomposite was spherical, with a particle size range of 358.6 ± 2.4 nm and a zeta 45 zeta 46 Tannic acid Tannic acid, also known as tannic acid, is a complex polyphenolic compound formed by the polymerization of multiple gallic acid units through ester bonds or glycosidic bonds. The results showed that tannic acid-berberine (TB) nanoparticles with uniform spherical structure were formed by self-assembly of berberine (BBR) and tannic acid at a molar ratio of 2:1. The particle size was 255.47 ± 12.23 nm, and the zeta zeta 47 Ellagic acid Ellagic acid (EA), as the main active ingredient in pomegranate peel, has limited utility due to the extremely low solubility of the symmetrical planar structure in pure water. However, EA, GA and CA form a sandwich-like ellagic acid-gallic acid-catechin (EA-GA-CA) ternary self-assembly solubilization system through hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking. The system is irregularly spherical and the particle size is mainly in the range of 3–7 μm. It can increase the solubility of EA from 0.95 μg·mL −1 −1 48 Quercetin Quercetin (QCT) is a natural flavonol compound. However, its poor water solubility and low stability limit its bioavailability. Quercetin solid nanoparticles (SNRs) are a kind of nano-scale solid granules prepared from quercetin. Under the condition of alkaline aqueous solution, quercetin can undergo oxidative coupling reaction to form oligomers composed of five monomers. These monomers are further stabilized by non-covalent interaction, and then form spherical colloidal aggregates with a particle size of 33 ± 5 nm and a zeta 49 zeta 50 1 Table 1 Physicochemical properties and acting forces of carrier-free self-assembly of active components of pomegranate peel Type Physicochemical property Acting force References Shape Grain size zeta Ursolic acid nanoparticles (UA NPs) sphere 150 nm − 7 mV hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction [ 37 Ursolic acid-paclitaxel nanoparticles(UA − PTX NP) Nanobubbles and nanofibers less than 200 nm − 12.11 ± 0.19 mV hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction [ 13 Ursolic acid-adriamycin nanoparticles (Ap/UD NPs) sphere Faith 110 nm – π-π stacking, hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic force [ 39 Ursolic acid-aspirin nanoparticles (Asp-UA NP) sphere 160.0 nm − 26.1 mV hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction [ 41 Ellagic acid-gallic acid-catechin nanoparticles (EA-GA-CA) Irregular small ball 3–7 μm – hydrogen bond and π-π stacking [ 48 Oleanolic acid nanoparticles (OA NPs) Spherical vesicles 99.8 nm ± 9 nm – hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction [ 42 Oleanolic acid nanoparticles (OA NPs) sphere 168 nm − 17.8 mV hydrogen bond and π-π stacking [ 43 Oleanolic acid-gallic acid nanoparticles (OA/GA NP) sphere – − 22.9 ± 1.6 mV hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction [ 14 Gallic acid-berberine nanoparticles (GA-BBR NPs) sphere 362 ± 0.43 nm − 28.1 mV π-π stacking, electrostatic force and hydrogen bond [ 44 Chlorogenic acid-berberine nanoparticles (BBR/CGA) sphere 358.6 ± 2.4 nm − 30.6 ± 0.26 mV hydrogen bond, π-π stacking, electrostatic force and hydrophobic interaction [ 45 Chlorogenic acid-berberine nanoparticles (BCS) sphere 98.3 ± 15.5 nm 16.3 mV electrostatic force, π-π stacking and hydrophobic interaction [ 46 Tannic acid-berberine nanoparticles (TB) sphere 255.47 ± 12.23 nm 46.70 ± 0.72 mV hydrogen bond, π-π stacking and electrostatic force [ 47 Quercetin nanoparticles (SNRs) strip The length is about 13.91 μm, the width is about 219 nm and the thickness is less than 40 nm − 18.5 mV hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interaction and π-π stacking [ 50 Pharmacological effects of carrier-free self-assembly of active components of pomegranate peel Anticancer The active ingredients in pomegranate peel have shown significant potential in the field of anti-tumor, mainly in inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis and anti-angiogenesis [ 51 52 + 37 53 55 13 38 14 36 2 39 Table 2 Data summary of pharmacological effects of carrier-free self-assembly of active components of pomegranate peel Nanoparticles Experimental model ( cell/animal model) Dosage Therapeutic indexes Action mechanism References Ursolic acid nanoparticles (UA NPs) A549, HeLa and normal cells HELF 20 μM, 12 h apoptosis ratio COX/VEGFA/VEGFR2;

Traditional carriers usually have low drug loading rate and need to rely on exogenous materials, which have potential toxic and side effects [ 95 13 Although carrier-free self-assembly technology has shown significant advantages in improving the solubility, stability and bioavailability of pomegranate peel active ingredients, its development still faces multiple challenges. First of all, the formation of carrier-free nanoparticles lacks clear definition criteria, and a recognized criterion has not been established to determine whether it reaches the category of nanoparticles. The prediction and determination of self-assembly behavior lacks systematic models and theoretical guidance. The characterization methods are not uniform, and there is a lack of systematic standards to comprehensively evaluate its physical and chemical properties, structural characteristics and biological behavior, which limits the structural design and experimental repeatability. In addition, it is not clear whether a self-assembled structure with specific functions is formed during the traditional decoction or preparation process, and its energy change, force evolution and pharmacological activity still need to be further analyzed. The current research focuses on a single or two-component system, which is difficult to restore the multi-target effect of traditional Chinese medicine compound. The multi-molecular co-assembly mechanism and its in vivo behavior need to be explored. At the same time, pharmacokinetic studies are weak, and there is a lack of systematic evaluation of its absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. In terms of biosafety, although the introduction of exogenous vectors is avoided, its long-term toxicity, immunogenicity and metabolic risk still need to be systematically evaluated. In the future, it is necessary to establish a standardized preparation process, introduce automated synthesis and high-throughput screening, and combine advanced imaging technology and multidimensional toxicological evaluation system to promote the clinical transformation of this technology.
