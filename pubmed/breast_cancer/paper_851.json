These processes range from apoptosis to intracellular signaling. Accordingly, mitochondrial dysfunction has been broadly described in the etiopathology of multiple human diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and all the main neurodegenerative disorders. Therapeutic interventions aimed at modulating this dysfunction are promising for preventing and/or delaying the development of these pathologies. Recent research has highlighted the potential of dietary interventions to modulate mitochondrial physiology. In this text, we critically review the scientific literature available regarding the effects of different dietary interventions (such as caloric restriction, ketogenic diets, increased omega-3 fatty acid consumption, etc.) on some key components of mitochondrial physiology. Despite the significant advancements in the field that we present in this review, critical gaps remain regarding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the effects of these dietary interventions on mitochondrial physiology, especially under pathological conditions. Future research in this field could underscore these mechanisms, paving the road for the use of dietary interventions against mitochondrial dysfunction as valid pharmacological strategies in human disease.

Introduction Mitochondria are ancient, aerobic organelles that became part of the mammalian cell through an endosymbiotic event approximately 1.5 billion years ago [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 20 Fig. 1 In recent decades, multiple research groups have sought for therapeutic approaches to counteract mitochondrial dysfunction, which is a complex and multifaceted process. Two examples include the use of mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants, such as MitoQ [ 21 22 23 24 26 27 28 20 29 31 32 33 In this bibliographical review, we critically discuss the field of dietary interventions and mitochondrial physiology. A better understanding of their intersection could pave the way for improving our knowledge of the physiology of the organelle, potentially contributing to underscoring new pharmacological strategies to prevent the onset and/or the progression of some of the most common human pathologies. 2. Effects of specific diets on mitochondrial function Dysregulated bioenergetics and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation are often closely interconnected and commonly present in human disease [ 34 in ex vivo in vitro PGC-1α UCP2 UCP3 NRF1 35 Another example can be found in the study conducted by Garcia-Roves et al. The authors showed that high-fat diet-fed rats receiving daily heparin injections to increase plasma-free fatty acids exhibited increased expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, the citrate cycle, and OXPHOS, along with a significantly increased mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number [ 36 37 38 Furthermore, Leduc-Gaudet et al., showed that young rats that were fed with a high-fat diet for 14 days did not display any major changes in body weight, energy expenditure, and muscle mass. However, this diet significantly enhanced the mitochondrial capacity to oxidize fatty acids in muscular regions of the animals, ultimately affecting mitochondrial respiration [ 39 40 41 42 45 39 42 45 46 The relationship between specific diets, and the oxidative status of mitochondria was further investigated by another group of authors. Ribeiro et al., demonstrated that a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet induces significant alterations in gut microbiota in mice. In the same model, increased short-chain fatty acids (such as propionate and butyrate) metabolism was also found. These changes are associated with increased cell death and oxidative stress in areas of the cortex and the hippo-campus in the brain of the animals, consequently inducing disrupted adult neurogenesis [ 47 Moreover, Gomes et al., explored the effects of berberine (a plant-derived compound known to regulate blood sugar levels and cholesterol) on another model of a high-fat diet in mice. Their study shows that berberine induces a significant reduction in fasting plasma insulin, which indicates improved high-fat diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and enhanced glucose tolerance, despite minimal changes in fasting plasma glucose levels [ 48 in vivo in vitro 48 Some authors have addressed the effects of KDs on mitochondrial physiology. KDs are based on carbohydrate and protein restriction, along with high-fat intake; they have been broadly used in weight loss diets [ 49 50 51 52 Using a similar model of KD (β-hydroxybutyrate diet supplementation), Xu et al., studied the effects of this diet on cardiac health and mitochondrial biogenesis. To conduct their experiments, the authors used isolated cardiac fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes from Sprague-Dawley rats as a model. In this case, the animals were fed a KD and intraperitoneally injected with β-hydroxybutyrate. The authors showed that β-hydroxybutyrate offers certain benefits under pathological conditions. However, long-term exposure to elevated levels of β-hydroxybutyrate led to impaired mitochondrial biogenesis, ultimately contributing to serious adverse cardiac outcomes, including fibrosis and increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that deleterious effects on mitochondrial biogenesis are mediated by the activation of Sirt7 as a consequence of increased β-hydroxybutyrate levels [ 27 53 Obesity is closely related to high-fat diet. Accordingly, the effects of obesity on mitochondrial physiology have also been investigated by some researchers. For example, Heinonen et al., examined the relationship between obesity and mitochondrial function, using subcutaneous adipose tissue obtained from human monozygotic twin pairs discordant for body weight. The authors demonstrated that obese twins exhibit downregulated mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolic pathways, compared to their lean co-twins. Specifically, obesity induced a significant reduction in both nuclear- and mtDNA-encoded transcripts, including those that code for essential components of the ETC. Accordingly, key cellular processes, including fatty acid oxidation, ketogenesis, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), are impaired in the obese individuals [ 54 54 Another example of the effects of obesity on mitochondrial physiology is found in a study conducted by Anderson et al. The authors show that mitochondrial free radical leak is significantly higher in skeletal muscle from obese subjects, compared to healthy individuals [ 55 2 2 2 2 55 Another example of a dietary intervention that has been employed in the context of mitochondrial physiology is caloric restriction (CR). CR is based on the reduction in overall caloric intake, while maintaining adequate nutrient intake to avoid malnutrition [ 56 57 6 58 59 60 58 Moreover, Bevilacqua et al., examined the effects of short- and medium-term CR on mitochondrial physiology of rat skeletal muscle. The authors showed that CR significantly decreases mitochondrial proton leak from early time points. CR also induces a shift towards increased phosphorylation reactions, promoting OXPHOS efficiency. These changes were associated with a drop in H 2 2 61 2 2 59 62 In a study conducted in humans, Civitarese et al., addressed the effects of CR (25 % decreased caloric intake, alone or combined with exercise) on mitochondrial function in human muscle from healthy, overweight but non-obese young individuals. Their results show decreased whole body 24-hours energy expenditure, independently of whether exercise was conducted or not. Moreover, in both cases (when exercise was performed and when it was not), significantly increased mitochondrial mass, indicated by elevated mtDNA levels, was present in the skeletal muscle of the individuals. Increased mitochondrial biogenesis, addressed by analyses of gene expression of PPARGC1A and TFAM; as well as reduction in mtDNA damage, was also observed in the same individuals [ 63 63 64 65 66 Dietary restriction is a type of diet in which specific nutrients are avoided, but which does not necessarily imply a decrease in caloric intake. The effects of such diets on mitochondrial physiology have also been investigated. For example, Berry et al., using Caenorhabditis elegans 67 68 68 Differences in specific substrate availability are known to sensitize cells to bioenergetics rewiring, thereby affecting mitochondrial physiology [ 69 70 Table 1 In fact, recent studies have reported that certain dietary strategies are linked to delayed neuronal aging and a reduced risk of developing age-related neurodegenerative disease, by maintaining mitochondrial health [ 71 72 73 74 76 77 The study of the effects of dietary interventions extends beyond neurodegenerative disease. In fact, some authors have also explored how these interventions impact the progression of cancer [ 78 79 80 81 83 73 78 3. Effects of specific nutrient supplementation (or restriction) on mitochondrial function Vitamins, trace elements, carbohydrates, and other bioactive substances are crucial for maintaining proper mammalian mitochondrial physiology. Accordingly, the effects of dietary supplementation with some of these specific nutrients on mitochondrial function have been investigated. For example, Lalia et al. demonstrated that supplementation with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFAs) significantly reduces mitochondrial ROS generation through a mechanism that is not well-understood but appears to be independent of mitochondrial oxidative capacity. The authors also demonstrated that n3-PUFAs supplementation enhances mitochondrial protein synthesis in muscle after exercise [ 84 85 Another example of a study addressing the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on mitochondrial physiology is provided by Vaughan et al. These authors investigated the impact of omega-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on the metabolism of human muscle cells. While omega-3 fatty acids are known to enhance fat metabolism, the role of CLA in this process remains unclear. In the study, human rhabdomyosarcoma cells were treated with omega-3 fatty acids or CLA for 24 or 48 h. The authors showed that treatment with omega-3 fatty acids increases glycolytic capacity and oxygen consumption, indicating enhanced oxidative metabolism and fatty acid oxidation, factors generally associated with improved mitochondrial physiology. Conversely, treatment with CLA reduces both glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, with higher concentrations shifting metabolism from OXPHOS toward glycolysis. Although both treatments increased mitochondrial content, they did not improve mitochondrial function. In fact, omega-3 fatty acids upregulated PGC-1α and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) expression, suggesting increased metabolic activity and glucose uptake [ 86 The effects of vitamin and co-factor supplementation on mitochondrial bioenergetics have also been addressed in recent years. For example, by Shen et al., show that supplementation with R-α-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, nicotinamide, and biotin improves glucose tolerance and mitochondrial function (including bioenergetic regulation and oxidative metabolism) in diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats, a well-known model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. These effects were comparable to those observed with the antidiabetic drug pioglitazone, but notably occurred without the associated weight gain [ 87 As previously mentioned, mitochondrial biogenesis is closely linked to both the bioenergetic status and the oxidative state of the cell under both physiological and pathological conditions [ 88 89 90 91 92 Furthermore, Caro et al., addressed the effects of methionine restriction on mitochondrial function, especially on the regulation of oxidative stress and biogenesis. Their results show that methionine restriction significantly decreases mitochondrial ROS generation and the consequent oxidative damage to mtDNA, compared to other amino acids restriction [ 93 6 53 94 95 The effects of supplementation with amino acids other than methionine on mitochondrial physiology have also been addressed. For example, Chen et al., studied whether diet supplementation with arginine for four weeks affects mitochondrial biogenesis. To do this, they used weaning piglets as models. Their results show that supplementation with 1 % arginine significantly enhances the activity of the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme, as well as mitochondrial biogenesis via upregulation of PGC-1α and Sirt1 expression, and enhanced mtDNA content. Interestingly, treatment with rotenone inhibited arginine-induced mitochondrial biogenesis. This suggests that the regulation of mitochondrial function is mechanistically involved in the positive effects of arginine supplementation [ 96 97 6 94 98 99 In another study conducted in mice, Davis et al., showed that treatment for seven days with quercetin, a natural polyphenolic flavonoid with well-described anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties [ 100 101 2 2 102 103 104 105 The role of other natural compounds, such as resveratrol (a polyphenolic compound found in various dietary sources), on mitochondrial bioenergetics has also been investigated. For example, Csiszar et al., demonstrate that resveratrol significantly increases mitochondrial mass, expression of ETC components, and mtDNA content, in cultured human coronary arterial endothelial cells. This effect is likely exerted through the upregulation of biogenesis factors, including PGC-1α, Nrf-1, and Tfam [ 106 In vivo 106 Overall, these studies highlight the potential for certain compounds as innovative approaches for preventing and/or delaying mitochondrial dysfunction in human diseases ( Table 2 4. Effects of genetic models affecting nutrients and mitochondrial function Genetic models are frequently employed in various fields of biomedical research, including studies on the effects of nutritional interventions on mitochondrial physiology. For example, Waldhart et al. investigated the impact of glucose excess on mitochondrial function using a thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) knockout mouse model. TXNIP is a crucial regulator of oxidative stress and glucose metabolism in mammals [ 107 108 109 109 To better understand the molecular mechanism that links mitochondrial biogenesis and diet, using Drosophila Drosophila 110 111 110 5. Conclusions Adequate mitochondrial function is crucial for the maintenance of mammalian metabolism. In fact, mitochondrial dysfunction has been demonstrated as a key contributor to the etiopathology of numerous diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and all the major neurodegenerative disorders [ 9 11 13 20 Table 3 112 113 While the efforts to address the effects of different dietary interventions on mitochondrial physiology have been fruitful, further investigation needs to be conducted to better determine the long-term effects of these interventions on the physiology of the organelle. Moreover, a more comprehensive, deeper, and mechanistic understanding of the interactions between mitochondrial physiology and dietary restrictions will be essential for the development of targeted, evidence-based dietary strategies to optimize mitochondrial health and prevent the onset and/or the progression of mitochondrial dysfunction in human pathologies.

Dietary interventions have various effects on metabolic stress levels; some dietary interventions decrease these levels (for example, CR), while others increase them (for example, high-fat diet). Metabolic stress affects the mammalian cell at different levels, some of which are closely related to mitochondrial dysfunction. The dysfunction of the organelle has been broadly described in the etiopathology of many human diseases. ΔΨm = mitochondrial membrane potential, typically around −180 mV. Table 1 Effects of different dietary interventions on mitochondrial physiology. The effects of the three main dietary interventions that are described in this review (that is, caloric restriction, ketogenic diet, and high-fat diet) on some of the main mitochondrial parameters are summarized in this table.

The effects of supplementation or restriction of specific nutrients on mitochondrial physiology that are described in this review are also included in this table. Bibliographical references to the studies where those specific effects were addressed are also included. Interventions Key Mitochondrial Effects Molecular Pathways References Omega–3 fatty acids (n3-PUFAs) supplementation. Decreased ROS generation, and increased mitochondrial protein synthesis in muscle postexercise. Unknown, independent of oxidative capacity. [ 85 Omega–3 supplementation. Enhanced OXPHOS efficiency, and decreased oxidative stress. Not specified. [ 85 Omega–3 vs. CLA supplementation. Omega–3: increased glycolytic capacity, and oxygen consumption. CLA: decreased glycolytic capacity, and oxidative metabolism. Higher concentrations shift metabolism from OXPHOS towards glycolysis. Omega–3: Upregulated PGC–1α, and GLUT4 expression. [ 86 R-α-lipoic acid, acetyl-L-carnitine, nicotinamide, and biotin. Improved glucose tolerance, and mitochondrial function. Not specified. [ 87 Partial replacement of glucose with galactose. Increased mitochondrial biogenesis, creating a stable mitochondrial network by decreasing both fission and fusion. Downregulated mitochondrial catabolism. Adipogenesis modulation. [ 89 Diet containing octanoic acid. Improved oxidative capacity, including increased AMPK activation, and higher expression of PGC–1α and TFAM in skeletal muscle. Enhanced fatty acid oxidation. [ 92 Methionine restriction. Decreased ROS generation, and consequent damage to mtDNA. Increased mitochondrial efficiency. Possibly by activating Sirt1. [ 93 Upregulated genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis in white adipose tissue in rats, resulting in increased mtDNA content and enhanced fatty acid oxidation. Likely driven by adrenergic stimulation. [ 95 Arginine supplementation. Enhanced activity of the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Upregulation of PGC–1α and Sirt1 expression, and enhanced mtDNA content. [ 96 Leucine supplementation. Enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis. Activation of Sirt1 and AMPK phosphorylation pathways. [ 97 Quercetin supplementation. Increased the expression of key biogenesis markers, and mtDNA content in both skeletal and brain tissue. Not specified. [ 101 Restored oxidative stress-induced decreased expression of critical mitochondrial biogenesis proteins. Downregulated BACE1, and increased disintegrin and ADAM10. Not specified. [ 102 Reduced carbohydrate availability. Increased mitochodnrial bioegenesis. Activation (via pshophorylation) of p53. [ 105 Resveratrol supplementation. Increased mitochondrial mass, and mtDNA content, upregulated expression of ETC components, and increased mitochondrial biogenesis in the aorta. Sirt–1 and nitric oxid-dependent.
