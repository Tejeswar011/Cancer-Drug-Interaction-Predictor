[Participants and Methods] We included 18 participants who had undergone rTSA and\nwere followed for at least one year postoperatively. Surface electromyography recorded\nmuscle activity of the deltoid and trapezius at 30° of shoulder flexion, approximately 8\nmonths after surgery. Muscle activity was normalized as % reference voluntary contraction\n(%RVC). Based on active flexion ROM, participants were categorized into a good group\n(≥120°) and a poor group (<120°). [Results] The good group included 14 participants (3\nmales, 11 females, mean age 75.4 ± 5.7 years), and the poor group included 4 participants\n(1 male, 3 females, mean age 74.5 ± 11.4 years). The good group showed greater anterior\ndeltoid activity, while the poor group exhibited higher activity in the posterior deltoid\nand lower trapezius. [Conclusion] We identified anterior deltoid activity as a positive\nfactor for achieving good shoulder flexion ROM after rTSA. In contrast, increased activity\nin the posterior deltoid and lower trapezius may reflect compensatory strategies that\ninhibit optimal flexion.

Risk factors for poor flexion ROM after rTSA include age 8 ) 9 ) 10 ) 11 12 ) 13 14 15 ) 16 ) 17 ) 18 ) 19 ) The deltoid muscle is reportedly the primary source of force for rTSA and that preoperative\nand postoperative deltoid strength and muscle activity were significantly correlated with\npostoperative flexion ROM 20 21 22 ) 23 ) 21 24 ) However, most of the studies compared healthy shoulders with rTSA shoulders with good\nflexion ROM, and no study has compared deltoid and trapezius muscle activity in rTSA\nshoulders with good flexion ROM and in a poor rTSA group with difficulty achieving gain in\nshoulder flexion ROM. Since the poor rTSA group reportedly shows shrug-like compensatory\nmovements from the beginning of flexion 25 ) This study aimed to evaluate how deltoid and trapezius muscle activity during shoulder\nflexion in postoperative rTSA patients is associated with the good and poor groups. Based on\nprevious reports of Pelletier-Roy et al. 21 ) 24 ) PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS A total of 42 patients underwent rTSA at the one facility between October 2020 and April\n2023. Among them, 24 patients were excluded based on predefined eligibility criteria:\nproximal humerus fractures (n=5), revision (n=4), refusal to provide consent (n=10), and\ninability to complete a minimum follow-up of one year (n=5). As a result, 18 patients (4\nmales, 14 females; mean age, 75.2 ± 7.3 years) who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled\nin the study. All patients had at least one year of postoperative follow-up by April 2024\nand were able to perform active shoulder flexion of at least 30°. The primary diseases were\nosteoarthritis of the shoulder in 10 patients, cuff tear arthropathy in 6 patients, and\nmassive rotator cuff tear in 2 patients. The following surgical models had all onlay\ndesigns: Stryker’s Ascend flex (Portage, MI, USA) in 10 patients, Exactech’s Equinoxe\n(Gainesville, FL, USA) in 6 patients, and Zimmer–Biomet’s Comprehensive Reverse (Warsaw, IN,\nUSA) in 2 patients. Surgery was performed by two senior surgeons (N, N or K, F). The rTSA\nwas placed with a posterior humeral torsion angle of 20° and with the center pin of the base\nplate at the intersection of the long and short axes of the glenoid fossa. The surgical\napproach was an anterosuperior (AS) approach in 4 patients and a deltopectoral (DP) approach\nin 14 patients. We explained the content of the study and the extent of data use to the participants in\nadvance and obtained written and verbal informed consent in accordance with the Declaration\nof Helsinki. Approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee for Research Involving Human\nSubjects of the Graduate School of Health Sciences, Showa University (Approval No. 534). For electromyography (EMG) measurements, the participant was first placed in a standing\nposition with the shoulder joint in the mid-position of internal and external rotation, the\nelbow joint in extension, and the wrist joint in the mid-position. Muscle activity was then\nmeasured using surface EMG while the shoulder joint was held at 30° of flexion for 7\nseconds. EMG activity was also measured for 7 seconds with the shoulder in the dropped\nposition for normalization. EMG analysis is commonly performed using the percentage of maximal voluntary contraction\n(MVC) of each muscle to the normalized muscle activity during each movement 26 ) 20 ) 27 ) 20 27 ) The six muscles tested were the AD, middle deltoid (MD), PD, UT, middle trapezius (MT), and\nlower trapezius (LT). The placement of the surface electrodes was based on the description\nof Delagi and Perotto 28 ) EMG analysis software is an Excel macro for TS-MYO analysis from Trunk Solution. The\noriginal waveform was filtered using bandpass filtering, which transmitted 50–450 Hz from\nthe sensor, it was smoothed using root mean square. From the resulting 7-second EMG\nwaveform, the average EMG (AEMG) amplitude was calculated using 1-second sampling data,\nexcluding the 3-second periods before and after the 7-second period. Next, %RVC was\ncalculated by dividing the AEMG amplitude with the shoulder flexed at 30° by the AEMG of\neach muscle in the dropped shoulder position ( Fig.\n1 Fig. 1. Modified method of calculating the %RVC value. The average electromyography (AEMG) value is calculated from the sampling data for 1\nsecond, excluding the 3 seconds before and after the 7 seconds 30°flexion. % reference\nvoluntary contraction (%RVC) is calculated by dividing the AEMG at 30° flexion by the\nAEMG at dropped shoulder position The primary outcome measure was %RVC during a 30° flexion hold for each muscle. Secondary\noutcomes were flexion ROM, Constant Score, visual analog scale (VAS) score, GHJ angle, STJ\nangle using postoperative Scapula-45° imaging, and preoperative deltoid volume index. Scapula-45° radiography, which is a technique used in our hospital to evaluate the function\nof the shoulder complex, including the GHJ and STJ, using simple radiographs 17 ) 29 ) Fig. 2 Fig. 2. Scapula-45°radiography imaging method. Both glenohumeral joint (GHJ) and scapulothoracic joint (STJ) are based on a line\nconnecting the upper and lower edges of the Glenosphere, with the former measuring the\nhumeral long axis and the latter the angle created by the vertical line. Preoperative deltoid muscle volume was measured as an objective measure of deltoid muscle\nfunction. The deltoid muscle was visualized in three-dimensional images from computed\ntomography (CT) scans using Fujifilm Synapse Vincent (Tokyo, Japan). The origin (AD: lateral\none-third of the clavicle, MD: lateral margin of the acromion, PD: scapular spine),\ninsertion (deltoid tuberosity), and direction of each fiber were identified and classified\nas AD, MD, and PD, respectively ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3. Image of deltoid segmentation on 3D. 23 ) Electromyographic measurements and simple radiographs were obtained at a mean of 8.2 months\n(range 6–12 months) postoperatively, and the Constant Score, VAS, and flexion ROM were\nmeasured preoperatively and simultaneously as above. Preoperative CT was performed for\ndeltoid volume index at a mean of 2.4 months (range 0.5–4) prior to surgery. Patient\ncharacteristics were obtained from preoperative medical records. In statistical analysis, patients were divided into two groups, with the good group defined\nas having an active flexion ROM of 120° or more, and the poor group defined as having an\nactive ROM of less than 120°, as described in the introduction 21 24 ) ® RESULTS The good group comprised 14 patients with 14 shoulders, and the poor group comprised 4\npatients with 4 shoulders. The patient characteristics of the two groups were as follows:\nage, sex, height, BMI, diagnosis, surgery side, surgical approach, surgical model, flexion\nROM, VAS, and Constant Score ( Table 1 Table 1.

Table 2 DISCUSSION The results of this study showed no obvious differences in the demographic data between the\ntwo groups. %RVC of AD showed a significant positive association with the good group;\npostoperative GHJ angle and preoperative AD volume index showed a positive association with\nthe good group. In contrast, %RVC of PD and LT showed a significantly negative association\nwith the good group, and the postoperative STJ angle showed a negative association with the\ngood group. The primary active muscle during shoulder flexion is the AD 30 ) 31 ) 20 ) 23 ) 16 ) 18 ) In contrast, PD and LT %RVC and postoperative STJ angle showed a negative association with\nthe good group. PD is primarily responsible for shoulder extension and external rotation and\nis the antagonist muscle in shoulder flexion movements 30 ) 32 ) 33 ) However, Nakano et al. 24 ) 34 ) 4 ) LT is primarily responsible for scapular subduction, adduction, and upward rotation, and is\nconsidered to contribute to GHJ stability by rotating the scapula upward in cooperation with\nthe serratus anterior muscle during shoulder joint flexion 35 36 ) 21 24 ) This study had several limitations. First, the number of patients was insufficient,\nespecially that in the poor group. The variation in the OR and CI resulting from the use of\nunivariate logistic regression analysis may be attributed to the insufficient sample size. A\npost-hoc power analysis was conducted with an assumed power (1-beta error probability) of\n0.8, an effect size of 0.3, and a significance level (alpha error probability) of 0.05,\nindicating that a total sample size of 88 participants would have been required to achieve\nadequate statistical power. However, the implant design in this study was all onlay, and the\ndiseases included in the study were only those caused by chronic or degenerative\ndisease 11 37 ) 38 ) 11 ) 39 ) 40 41 ) 42 ) 5 ) 5 ) 43 ) Conflict of interest The authors have no conflicts of interest directly relevant to the content of this\narticle.
