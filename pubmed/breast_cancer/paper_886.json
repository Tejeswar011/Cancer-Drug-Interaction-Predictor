For patients < 60 years old, according to the related previous studies, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate is less than 40%; for the majority of patients with AML (aged over 60 years old), the 5-year OS rate is only 10–20% 7 8 9 Eclipta prostrata 10 11 E. prostrata 12 E. prostrata 13 14 While the anti-cancer potential of E. prostrata E. prostrata Therefore, the present structural and systems biology study aims to elucidate the mechanism of action of E. prostrata in-silico 1 Fig. 1 The workflow of this study includes all utilized approaches.

Hence, the ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) properties of the candidate compounds were evaluated using a combination of in-silico https://www.swissadme.ch/ 18 https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/pkcsm/ 19 Calculation of quantum chemical properties Apart from the assessment of drug-likeness, physicochemical, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity profiling, evaluating the thermodynamic, electronic, reactivity, stability properties, and potential off-target possibilities of the compounds also provides valuable insights into the activity and inactivity of compounds. Higher reactive compounds tend to produce off-target effects and breakdown by body enzymes, and conversely, higher stable compounds are dormant to produce an effect 20 21 22 23 24 1 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{Gap }(\\Delta E) = (E}_{\\text{LUMO}}- {E}_{\\text{HOMO}})$$\\end{document} 2 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\text{Hardness},\\upeta =\\frac{{(E}_{\\text{LUMO}}- {E}_{\\text{HOMO}}) }{2}$$\\end{document} 3 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\text{Softness},\\text{ S}= \\frac{1}{2\\upeta }$$\\end{document} 4 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\text{Electronegativity},\\upchi = - \\frac{{(E}_{\\text{LUMO}}+ {E}_{\\text{HOMO}}) }{2}$$\\end{document} 5 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\text{Mean Energy},\\upmu =\\frac{{(E}_{\\text{LUMO}}+ {E}_{\\text{HOMO}}) }{2}$$\\end{document} 6 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\text{Electrophilicity},\\upomega = \\frac{{\\upmu }^{2}}{2\\upeta }$$\\end{document} The results of thermodynamics studies, electronic properties, and frontier molecular orbital analysis were visualized using GaussView 06, and the frequency and density of states of compounds were visualized using GaussSum Software. By integrating ADMET, thermodynamics, and electronic properties of compounds, we have prioritized the most favorable compounds for further studies. Compound-derived target prediction After the initial screening of compounds, potential targets of the candidate compounds were identified by employing the SwissTargetPrediction platform ( https://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/) 25 26 https://www.bindingdb.org/ 27 E. prostrata Acute myeloid leukaemia relevant target prediction Targets relevant to AML were identified from the MalaCards ( https://www.malacards.org/ https://disgenet.com/) 28 29 30 31 Identification of common targets To identify common targets among the compounds derived from E. prostrata https://www.interactivenn.net/ 32 33 GO and pathways enrichment analysis The biological functions and signaling pathways associated with the identified common target proteins were comprehensively analyzed utilizing a two-pronged approach. First, the DAVID (Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery) database ( https://david.ncifcrf.gov/ 34 35 https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn/en 36 http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/ 37 38 37 38 Protein–protein interaction network analysis Protein–protein analysis was performed to understand the specific interactions among proteins in a large complex protein–protein interaction network 39 https://string-db.org/ 40 41 Identification of hub proteins and protein clusters The identification of hub targets provides insights into the most significantly associated proteins, and the identification of protein clusters means the identification of functional modules from the whole network that perform specific functions together 42 43 44 45 43 Drug-target association studies Identification and validation of drug targets After identification of the significantly associated target proteins of AML, determination of and validation of potential drug targets for the treatment of AML are also crucial. Without blindly assuming any targets as drug or therapeutic targets, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) ( https://www.proteinatlas.org/ https://idrblab.net/ttd/ 46 47 Molecular docking verification of drug targets Molecular docking provides insight into the most suitable binding poses and binding affinities between targets and compounds. The ligands were collected from the PubChem database 16 48 49 50 51 Molecular dynamics simulation Molecular docking calculates only binding poses, and therefore, to identify the interaction properties between targets and compounds in dynamic situations, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies were applied. We have utilized the most promising and high-affinity drugs that are already available as controls. The MD simulations were conducted using the DESMOND package, a widely used tool of Schrodinger’s suite for conducting MD simulation analyses 52 53 3 54 Binding free energy calculation using MM-GBSA After analysis of different motion and dynamic properties, the binding free energy between targets and compounds was calculated to quantitatively assess the interaction strength between the target proteins and candidate compounds. To quantify the binding affinity, post-dynamic simulation MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area) calculations were performed using the Prime module within the Schrödinger software suite 53 Calculation of structure–activity relationship between compounds and targets Though strong interactions between targets and compounds indicate positive signs in the drug discovery process, it doesn’t provide any insights into the potency and biological effects of a compound, specifically the dose–response relationship between compound and target. A compound might have higher binding affinity and binding free energy with targets, but that does not indicate the compound is active. Even a compound with higher binding affinity can be inactive, which means it cannot produce a biological response at a safer concentration 55 56 57 https://www.bindingdb.org/rwd/bind/index.jsp) 27 50 50 50 50 Gene regulatory networks analysis The effects of targets and compounds can be significantly impacted by gene-regulatory elements such as microRNAs and Transcription Factors. These events occur after post-transcriptional modification periods and regulate the proper folding, maintenance, and activity of proteins. Therefore, a gene-regulatory network has been constructed to determine the key elements that might interfere with and impact the outcome of the target-compound interactions. To elucidate gene-regulatory networks (GRNs), the complex interactions of microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) with targets of AML were elucidated by employing NetworkAnalyst 3.0 ( https://www.networkanalyst.ca/) 58 59 Potential biomarker identifications Biomarkers indicate the presence or absence of a condition or disease, and hence, identifying biomarkers of AML is also crucial. Potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of AML were identified using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA 2) database ( http://gepia2.cancer-pku.cn/) 60 Biomarker validation and identification of novel biomarkers A three-pronged approach was employed to validate the identified biomarkers and explore the potential for novel biomarker discovery. First, the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) ( https://db.idrblab.net/ttd/ 61 Determination of cancer hallmarks After gaining insights into the significant molecular events and molecular elements responsible for AML development and indication, a cancer hallmark study was performed using those key elements by employing the Cancer Hallmark database ( https://cancerhallmarks.com/) 62 Statistical analysis For statistical analysis, the p-value and FDR (False Discovery Rate) were applied to calculate the significance of Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichments, respectively. PCA and DCCM were utilized for dimensionality reduction and correlation dynamics analysis of complex systems, respectively. The log-rank test was utilized to estimate the logrank p-value in Kaplan–Meier plots to compare survival curves. On the other hand, Spearman’s correlation was employed for gene expression analysis. Both the logrank test and Spearman’s correlation were utilized from the GEPIA2 platform 60 Results Selection of anti-cancer compounds We reported the identification and characterization of 12 promising anticancer compounds through a multi-step screening and evaluation process. At first, we identified 451 potential anticancer compounds from the IMPPAT, PubChem, and PubMed databases through a systematic literature mining approach. Following the removal of duplicates, 187 unique compounds remained for subsequent analysis. A stringent ADMET filter was applied, incorporating drug-likeness, gastrointestinal absorption, water and lipid solubility, bioavailability, and hepatotoxicity criteria to identify 16 compounds with optimal pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles.

( A B C D E F G H I Identification of common targets of compounds and AML Initially, the analysis of potential targets of anti-cancer compounds identified 953 targets. After removing redundant entries, this set was refined to 252 distinct targets. Separately, the study of AML targets was performed using the MalaCards and DisGeNet databases, resulting in an initial set of 3755 targets. Following the removal of duplicates, this set comprised 3262 unique targets. The intersection of these two target sets (anti-cancer compounds and AML) was then determined, revealing 121 common targets. The intersection shown in Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Venn diagrammatic analysis of common targets between the targets of AML and the targets of compounds. The intersection indicates the common targets. GO and KEGG pathways analysis Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to elucidate the functional roles of the identified 121 common targets. GO analysis revealed significant enrichment in biological processes crucial to cellular function and implicated in AML pathogenesis. The Biological Process terms revealed significant enrichment in fundamental cellular processes, such as phosphorylation, protein phosphorylation, negative regulation of apoptosis, and signal transduction. The Molecular Function terms further underscored the prevalence of kinase-related activities, including protein tyrosine kinase, serine/threonine kinase, and serine kinase functions. Additionally, the Cellular Component analysis indicated the localization of the target proteins within the cytoplasm, cytosol, receptor complexes, and nucleoplasm. KEGG pathway analysis further supported the therapeutic relevance of these targets in AML, showing significant enrichment in pathways associated with cancer, including the “AML” pathway. The enriched proteins in the AML pathway were FLT3, STAT3, KIT, PIM1, MAPK1, AKT1, PIM2, PIK3R1, MPO, RELA, NFKB1. The GO and KEGG pathway enrichment are presented in Fig. 5 Fig. 5 GO and KEGG Pathway analysis. ( A B Hub targets and protein clusters of protein–protein interaction networks At first, the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING 12 database with the highest confidence interaction score of 0.900, focusing on the 121 common proteins identified. The visualized network in Cytoscape identified several key hub targets and protein clusters within the common targets of the selected compounds and AML. Using multiple centrality measures, including degree, closeness, betweenness, maximum neighborhood component (MCC), and maximal clique centrality (MNC), the top 10 hub targets were evaluated. Degree centrality measures the number of direct connections a node has and indicates the immediate influence or activity of a node in the network. Closeness centrality measures how close a node is to all other nodes in the network. Betweenness centrality measures how often a node lies on the shortest path between two other nodes. On the other hand, Maximum neighborhood component (MCC) centrality identifies the largest group of nodes that are all connected to each other, revealing influential clusters in the network, while Maximal clique centrality (MNC) measures the size of the largest complete subgroup of nodes that are all connected to each other, highlighting the most densely connected regions. By combining these centrality measures, the top 10 most influential or “hub” nodes in the network were identified and ranked. The top-ranked shared protein across all methods was AKT1, followed by ALB, STAT3, BCL2, CASP3, EGFR, HSP90AA1, ESR1, NFKB1, and PTGS2 (Fig. 6 7 Fig. 6 Identification of Hub proteins in 5 distinct centralities: ( A B C D E Fig. 7 Determination of Protein Clusters represents functional units that may function together in a pathway or process. ( A B C D E Identification and validation of drug targets The analysis of proteins involved in AML pathways has revealed several promising drug targets for the management of this aggressive form of leukemia. The findings demonstrate in Table 5 Table 5 Current status of most influenced proteins as drug target potentials based on pathway involvement, hub proteins, and protein clusters.

On the other hand, TTD revealed that these two targets are already successfully approved drugs against colorectal and breast cancers. Interestingly, FLT3 is already an approved drug target against AML, and PIM1 has already been included in the clinical trial target for AML. Therefore, apart from the promising targets AKT1, KIT, STAT3, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3CD, PIK3R1, NFKB1, PIM2, and MAPK1, which are anti-apoptotic and help in the rapid proliferation of cancer cells in AML pathway, FLT3, and PIM1 have been considered as the most specific, relevant, promising, and significant therapeutic targets according to AML pathway, hub proteins and protein clusters. MPO has a role in the block of differentiation of cells, but lacks evidence of being a therapeutic target against cancer. The promising drug target pathway has been shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.

( A B C D E F Molecular dynamics simulation for target verification Molecular dynamics simulation revealed favorable dynamic properties of protein-compound complexes and also verified the potential of targets. Key properties like RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) and RMSF (Root Mean Square Fluctuation) are presented in Fig. 10 Fig. 10 Molecular Dynamics Simulation Analysis. ( A C B D PCA and DCCM analysis In a protein–ligand interaction, not the whole protein is favorable for the interactions between targets and compounds; instead, only a few percent of amino acids are responsible for these interactions. Identification of those percentages provides insights into the variance and stability during dynamic simulation. For the first 20 modes of motion, a graph of eigenvalues (protein) versus eigenvector index (eigenmode) in PCA plots is shown in Supplementary Fig. S7. The eigenvalues showed how the eigenvectors of hyperspace fluctuated. According to simulation analyses, the overall movement of the target protein is controlled by eigenvectors with larger eigenvalues. The highest proportion of variance observed in PC1 was 29.58%, 21.34%, and 21. 51% for PIM1 complexes with Diomestin, Tricetin, and SEL24 (Control). For PC3, the lowest variances observed were 7.41%, 9.23%, and 7.34%. On the other hand, the highest variance for PC1 was 34.3%, 38.2%, and 31.75% in FLT3 in complex with Kaempherol, Apigenin, and Pactrinib (Control), respectively. The lowest variances were 7.95%, 9.8%, and 7.07% for PC3. DCCM (Dynamic Cross-Correlation Matrix) of the 200 ns molecular dynamics trajectory revealed the dominant modes of motion and the correlations between the motions of different residues or atoms within the protein–ligand complex, respectively. Both FLT3 and PIM1 showed positive and negative correlations in their distribution, according to the residue index maps ( Supplementary Fig. S8) Binding free energy calculation using MMGBSA MM-GBSA calculations for FLT3 revealed that both Kaempferol (-73.75 kcal/mol) and Apigenin (-68.76 kcal/mol) exhibited significantly stronger binding affinity than the control Pacritinib (-51.27 kcal/mol). This difference is primarily attributed to more favorable electrostatic, hydrophobic, and van der Waals interactions for Kaempferol and Apigenin. On the other hand, MM-GBSA calculations for PIM1 revealed that Tricetin (-64.28 kcal/mol) displays stronger binding affinity than both Diosmetin (-52.2 kcal/mol) and the control SEL24 (-53.38 kcal/mol). This enhanced binding is largely driven by significantly more favorable electrostatic and van der Waals interactions in Tricetin, despite less favorable hydrophobic contributions compared to SEL24. The substantial difference in solvation energy between Tricetin and SEL24 also contributes to the observed binding affinity difference. SEL24 exhibits a binding affinity of -53.38 kcal/mol, characterized by strong electrostatic interactions (-51.59 kcal/mol) but hindered by unfavorable solvation energy (55.63 kcal/mol). All binding energies are shown in Fig. 11 Fig. 11 Binding Free Energy calculation using MM-GBSA.

Identification and validation of novel protein biomarkers Our study revealed two potential specific biomarkers, FLT3 and MPO, of AML. FLT3 is already an approved prognostic biomarker for AML. On the other hand, MPO exhibited significant upregulation in AML and was correlated with the overall survival difference. Notably, high expression levels of MPO were associated with increased overall survival in AML patients, underscoring its potential as a novel prognostic biomarker for AML. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that FLT3 was also significantly upregulated in AML and correlated with poor overall survival. The survival analysis revealed that high expression levels of FLT3 were associated with decreased overall survival in AML patients, reaffirming its prognostic significance in AML. In addition to their prognostic potential, both FLT3 and MPO may also possess diagnostic utility in AML. Our findings evaluate the diagnostic potential of FLT3, highlighting its ability to distinguish AML from other cancers. MPO, on the other hand, has been less extensively explored as a diagnostic biomarker for AML. However, our results suggest that MPO may also possess diagnostic potential, as its upregulation was specifically observed significantly in AML, while significantly downregulated in other cancers. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of FLT3 and MPO as specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for AML. Additionally, our analysis suggested that KIT, PIK3CD, PIK3R1, and NFKB1/RELA may possess general cancer biomarker potential, as they were significantly upregulated in AML as well as other cancers. However, their lack of specificity to AML may limit their diagnostic utility. MAPK1, PIM1, and PIM2, on the other hand, demonstrated downregulation in AML and were associated with poor overall survival, suggesting their potential as prognostic biomarkers. However, further investigation is needed to determine their diagnostic potential. PIK3CB, despite being upregulated in AML, showed a significant difference in overall survival between low and high-protein expression groups, suggesting further exploration of its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Conversely, STAT3, PIK3CA, and AKT1 did not exhibit significant regulation in AML, suggesting that they may not be suitable biomarkers for AML diagnosis or prognosis.

( A I J Cancer hallmarks for AML The cancer hallmark graph demonstrated the involvement of the identified proteins in cancer development. The involvement of all promising initially identified proteins of AML from hub proteins, protein clusters, and pathways is represented in Fig. 16 16 Fig. 16 Identification of Cancer Hallmarks. ( A B Discussion AML is an aggressive and often fatal hematological malignancy, and therefore, the development of more effective targeted therapies and the identification of robust biomarkers is crucial 95 96 E. prostrata E. prostrata 97 99 E. prostrata Our comprehensive analysis evaluated the 12 potential active anti-cancer compounds from E. prostrata The findings of our study are consistent with previous research demonstrating the anticancer properties of E. prostrata 98 99 At the beginning of our study, we determined the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG Pathway enrichment analysis with 121 initially identified proteins that were common between proteins predicted from the compounds and AML-associated proteins, revealing significant enrichment in pathways related to cancer, including the “AML” pathway. The most enriched proteins in the AML pathway were FLT3, STAT3, KIT, PIM1, MAPK1, AKT1, PIM2, PIK3R1, MPO, and NFKB1. In addition, the enrichment in kinase-related activities, such as protein tyrosine kinase, serine/threonine kinase, and serine kinase functions, suggests that the E. prostrata Moreover, we constructed a PPI network with the same 121 identified proteins which highlighted several key hub targets (Proteins) including AKT1, ALB, STAT3, BCL2, CASP3, EGFR, HSP90AA1, ESR1, NFKB1, and PTGS2 based on five topological properties: degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, Maximum neighborhood component (MCC), Maximum clique centrality (MNC). These hub targets are known to play pivotal roles in various cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and signal transduction, which are often dysregulated in AML. On the other hand, AKT1, STAT3, NFKB1, RELA, KIT, FLT3, MPO, and PIK3R1 were enriched in protein clusters that also resided in the AML pathway. Therefore, the identification of these hub proteins and protein clusters provided valuable insights into the potential mechanisms of action of the E. prostrata Furthermore, our analysis revealed that several of the identified targets, including KIT, FLT3, PIK3CA, PIK3CD, and AKT1, have already been successfully targeted by FDA-approved anti-cancer drugs. Apart from that, we identified several emerging targets, such as STAT3, PIK3CB, PIM1, and PIM2, which are also currently undergoing clinical trials for some cancer types 47 5 E. prostrata After unveiling and validating the therapeutic targets, we focused on the verification of the therapeutic potential of our initially identified 12 compounds against those targets by employing molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation approaches. Molecular docking scores revealed that Kaempferol and Apigenin exhibited strong binding affinities to FLT3, with values of -8.931 and -8.752 kcal/mol, respectively, significantly surpassing the control drug Pacritinib (-5.403 kcal/mol). Similarly, for PIM1, Tricetin (-8.634 kcal/mol) and Diosmetin (-7.780 kcal/mol) demonstrated enhanced binding compared to SEL24 (-6.385 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulations further strengthen these findings, showing lower average RMSD values for the compound complexes (PIM1-Diosmetin: 2.02 Å; PIM1-Tricetin: 2.16 Å) compared to SEL24 (2.32 Å), indicating greater stability. For FLT3, the averages were also favorable (FLT3-Kaempferol: 2.90 Å; FLT3-Apigenin: 2.91 Å) versus Pacritinib (3.18 Å). The binding free energy calculations using MMGBSA further confirmed these observations, with Kaempferol (-73.75 kcal/mol) and Apigenin (-68.76 kcal/mol) exhibiting significantly stronger binding affinities than Pacritinib (-51.27 kcal/mol). For PIM1, Tricetin (-64.28 kcal/mol) outperformed Diosmetin (-52.2 kcal/mol) and SEL24 (-53.38 kcal/mol). Collectively, these results suggest that both FLT3 and PIM1, when targeted by compounds Kaempferol, Apigenin, Tricetin, and Diosmetin, not only demonstrate favorable binding characteristics but also exhibit enhanced stability and interaction dynamics, making them compelling candidates for therapeutic interventions in AML. Controls are selected as FDA-approved drugs (e.g., Pacritinib for FLT3 and SEL24 for PIM1) to benchmark and compare the binding affinities of novel compounds against established standards. The comparison of docking results with controls shows a consistently higher value than the control drugs for all targeted proteins. This superior binding affinity and stability of natural flavonoids over approved drugs highlight their promising potential as safer, effective novel therapeutics for AML through targeted inhibition. In addition, our predictive models for both targets, PIM1 and FLT3, demonstrated robust performance, as evidenced by high R 2 2 2 2 2 2 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 100 50 50 50 101 50 50 The intricate interplay between microRNAs (miRNAs) and transcription factors (TFs) in regulating gene expression in AML also underscores their potential as pivotal biomarkers and therapeutic targets 58 Subsequently, the identification of FLT3 and MPO as potential biomarkers for AML further amplified the significance of our study. FLT3, a well-established prognostic biomarker for AML 91 60 Finally, the analysis of cancer hallmarks revealed that these specific biomarkers (FLT3 and MPO), along with PIM1 and MAPK1, are significantly implicated in pathways crucial for AML development, including sustained angiogenesis, programmed energy metabolism, resisting cell death, and tumor-promoting inflammation. The involvement of these biomarkers in multiple hallmarks established a particular AML-specific link between biomarkers and their therapeutic potential. Apart from FLT3 and MPO, other candidate biomarkers showed upregulation in both AML and other cancers, which limited their diagnostic utility. The AML-specific expression patterns of FLT3 and MPO, coupled with their association with key cancer hallmarks, strongly support further development as effective diagnostic and prognostic tools for improved AML patient stratification and targeted therapeutic interventions. Additionally, the development of a biomarker panel incorporating both FLT3 and MPO may enhance the accuracy of AML diagnosis and prognosis and may also enable the identification of high-risk AML patients, who may benefit from more aggressive treatment approaches, ultimately contributing to improved patient management and treatment strategies.

Our study is limited to in silico studies, and therefore, further in vitro and in vivo experimental validation, such as cell line assays and gene expression analysis, is necessary to confirm the biological activities of promising compounds to advance and clinical implications of this study. Furthermore, the discovery of novel biomarker potentials of FLT3 and MPO for both specific diagnostic and prognostic possibilities could enable the development of more accurate diagnostic and prognostic tools and facilitate personalized treatment approaches for AML needs further experimental validation.
