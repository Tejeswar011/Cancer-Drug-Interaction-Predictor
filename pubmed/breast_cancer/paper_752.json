Here, a 3D vascularized tumor‐on‐chip (vToC) model, generated with patient‐derived microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) that are freshly isolated from surgical lung cancer samples, is presented. The microvessel molecular identity, morphology, and functionality are assessed by transcriptomic, immunofluorescence, TNF‐α stimulation, and permeability assays. Lung cancer cells, cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and CD8+ tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes are embedded into the surrounding collagen matrix to partially recapitulate the lung tumor microenvironment (TME). The proof‐of‐concept of feasibility to generate personalized immunocompetent vToC composed of primary fully autologous cell types is provided. This vToC model is used to investigate the interplay between ECs and other TME cellular components by transcriptomic analysis. Using a rationally designed panel of endothelial genes, it is found that the presence of cancer cells and CAFs in the endothelial environment decreases expression by ECs of VCAM‐1 leukocyte adhesion protein, a crucial regulator of immune infiltration, and of many immunomodulatory chemokines, recapitulating endothelial cell anergy. This in vitro model will be a valuable clinically‐relevant tool to study the tumor‐CAF‐immune–endothelium interplay. Most in vitro cancer models lack cellular diversity, functional complexity, and clinical relevance. This work highlights the generation of an innovative dynamic tetraculture with autologous patient‐derived cells within a vascularized tumor‐on‐chip, as well as the recapitulation of endothelial anergy features induced by the tumor microenvironment. cancer models endothelium immunomodulation microfabrication tumor microenvironment tumor‐on‐chip Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer 10.13039/501100004097 PGA1RF20180206991 PGA12021010002992_3578 Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale (INSERM) ITMO_3R_N°19CR046‐00 ITMO_Equipment2016 ITMO_Equipment_N°22CQ036‐01 ProgrammeImpulsionMecaCell3D ITMO_PCSI_HTonChip_N°23CP060‐00 ITMO_MIC_DYNAMO_N°23CM020‐00 Fondation Chercher et Trouver European community (Horizon Europe program) Arturo‐project‐grant‐agreement_N°101136464 Agence Nationale de la Recherche (France 2030 program) PEPRMED‐OOC_TME‐On‐Chip_N°ANR‐24‐EXME‐0005 Fondation de France to MN No. 00149014/WB‐2023‐50799 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date September 26, 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:29.09.2025  C.

[  1 ] [  2  3  4 ] [  5 ] Endothelial cells (ECs), which form the inner lining of the blood vessels, are key components of the TME with important immunomodulatory functions. The tumor endothelium is a physical barrier that controls the recruitment of immune cells to the tumor bed. Immune recruitment is a multistep and active process finely orchestrated by physical cell–cell interactions between immune cells and ECs, as well as by complex cytokines/chemokines signaling interplay between immune, endothelial, and tumor compartments. [  6 ] [  7 ] [  8 ] [  9 ] [  10  11 ] [  12  13 ] The establishment of robust in vitro models is pivotal to further study endothelium immunomodulatory functions. Several approaches have been implemented to achieve the vascularization of tumor‐on‐chips. The first simplest vascularized ToC (vToC) models recreated tumor‐vascular interfaces inside 3D micro‐channels, using micro‐pillars [  14 ] [  15 ] [  16 ] [  17  18  19  20  21  22 ] One of the most appealing ambitions in ToC field is the development of reliable models for personalized medicine, in order to predict treatment efficacy for cancer patients and to contribute to the clinical decision‐making process. However, the current vToC models still lack several crucial properties to be clinically relevant, especially the right endothelial cell origin (i.e., microvascular cells of the organ of interest), the appropriate cellular microenvironment (i.e., co‐culture with autologous cells derived from the same patient), and the personalization (i.e., ECs specifically derived from each patient). In fact, a major limitation is the well‐known difficulty to work with primary ECs. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) are the most used source of ECs by far. According to a recent comprehensive review of ToC literature, about 75% of publications concerning vToC utilize HUVEC as endothelial cell model. [  5 ] Here, we describe a vessel on‐a‐chip platform where a single and perfusable endothelial microvessel is generated within a collagen extracellular matrix, using patient‐derived microvascular ECs that are freshly isolated from surgical lung cancer samples. Lung cancer cells (immortalized or primary), cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and CD8+ tumor‐infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are embedded in the collagen matrix to partially recapitulate the lung TME. We exploited this unique patient‐derived vascularized lung‐tumor‐on‐chip to investigate the immunomodulatory functions of the endothelium using a transcriptomic approach. Thanks to the controllability of the 3D co‐culture conditions, we were able to decipher how the TME cellular composition affects the differential expression of specific immunomodulatory genes by ECs. Finally, we provided the proof‐of‐concept of feasibility to generate personalized immunocompetent vToC composed of four autologous cell types, which is a major technological and conceptual milestone toward clinically relevant tumor‐on‐chip models. 2 Results 2.1 Implementation of Patient‐Derived Vascularized Lung Tumor‐on‐Chip For in vitro bioengineering of microvessels, we conceived a novel chip design that combines two microfabrication aspects: the needle‐molding technique to generate a tubular opening within a 3D matrix of collagen type I [  17  18  19  20  21  22 ] [  23 ] Figures  1 S1 Figure 1 In vitro bioengineering of lung microvessels.

C) Representative phase contrast image of the full‐length microvessel (upper picture) and fluorescence images (lower picture) showing the live (green) and dead (red) cells after 48 h culture. Commercial lung endothelial cells (ECs) were used. Scale bars = 200 µm. The microfluidic device comprised two lateral channels for cell culture medium and a central chamber containing a collagen I hydrogel. Two sliding walls were kept on closed position to allow confinement of the collagen solution and were retracted after polymerization to allow medium diffusion into the collagen gel and to obtain an obstacle‐free interface between the gel and the medium. In order to create the on chip‐vessel, a needle of 200 µm in diameter was introduced before filling the central chamber with the prepolymer solution of collagen type I (Figure 1B n n 1C We next developed a strategy to freshly isolate microvascular endothelial cells from surgical samples of non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Our attempts to isolate viable endothelial cells (ECs) from the tumor tissue failed because of the very low number of tumor ECs. As alternative, since lung surgery consists in removal of the entire lobe or segment, we succeeded in efficient EC isolation starting from the healthy lung portion (sample weight about 2–5g). The EC isolation procedure involves sequential magnetic‐activated cell sorting (MACS) using anti‐CD31 conjugated microbeads followed by culturing cells in appropriate endothelium medium on gelatin‐coated flasks ( Figure  2 2B S2 S3A Figure 2 Patient‐derived lung endothelial cells isolation and transcriptomic characterization.

C) Hierarchical clustering of bulk RNA‐Seq data of commercial (HMVEC‐L) and patient‐derived (patient #11) lung ECs, in standard 2D monolayer culture or 3D microvessel model ( n n [  9 ] [  9 ] Endothelial identity was ascertained by immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and transcriptomic analysis. Commercial lung ECs (HMVEC‐L) and fibroblasts were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Immunofluorescence images showed a homogeneous population for the freshly isolated ECs, with positive staining for two EC markers: VE‐cadherin at the cell–cell junctions and intracellular Willebrand factor (vWF) (Figure S3B S3C 2C [  9 ] 2D [  9 ] 2.2 Phenotypic and Functional Characterization of Engineered Lung Microvessels The integrity of the endothelial monolayer along the whole inner surface of the collagen tube was assessed by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy.

At quiescent or resting state, the ECs do not bind leukocytes. Under stimulation with pro‐inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF‐α, the expression of surface adhesion molecules is upregulated on the endothelium, promoting leukocyte adhesion. [  24 ] −1 3C 3D,E 2.3 Transcriptomic Approach in vToC to Assess Immunomodulation by the Endothelium With the aim to specifically and efficiently investigate the regulation of endothelial genes in the context of the in vitro reconstructed TME, we conceived an experimental strategy to isolate the RNA from the ECs lining the microvessels, without any RNA contamination from the non‐endothelial cells embedded in the collagen. ECs were dissociated with TryPLE enzyme which does not digest the collagen, then collected and immediately lysed in TRIzol ( Figure  4 S5 Figure 4 Impact of TME cell components on endothelium‐mediated immunomodulation. A) Isolation of endothelial RNA from vascularized tumor‐on‐chip. On‐chip microvessels are cultured alone or with other TME cells (cancer cells, CAFs) embedded in the collagen gel. ECs are specifically retrieved from the chip using TrypLE enzyme, followed by RNA extraction and RT‐qPCR analysis.

B) Description of the gene panel. 42 endothelial genes were selected for their reported contributions to immunomodulation and tumor progression. C) Analysis of 42‐gene panel expression in microvessels co‐cultured with cancer cells or CAFs. RT‐qPCR analysis was done on patient‐derived ECs (patients #3 and #4), or commercial HMVEC‐L, after 24 h co‐culture. Two cell lines, A549 and IGR‐Heu, were used as lung cancer cell models, and either autologous CAFs (patient #3) or commercial CAF07AD were used as CAF model. mRNA relative expression (2 −ΔΔ  C t n Next, based on an extensive literature search on the interplay between endothelium and immunity, we rationally constructed a panel of 42 genes (with six additional housekeeping genes) which are expressed by ECs and known to be involved in immunomodulation, more specifically in immune cell adhesion, transmigration, effector T cell apoptosis, Treg survival, and T cell functions (Figure 4B S6 In more details, our panel comprises genes coding for proteins directly involved in immune recruitment, such as adhesion molecules (E‐and P‐selectin, VCAM‐1, ICAM‐1), [  25  26  27 ] [  28 ] [  29  30 ] [  31 ] [  32 ] [  33 ] [  34 ] [  35 ] [  36 ] [  37 ] [  38 ] [  39 ] [  40 ] [  41 ] [  42  43 ] [  44 ] [  45 ] [  46 ] [  47 ] [  11 ] [  48 ] [  49 ] [  50 ] [  51 ] [  52 ] [  53 ] [  54 ] [  55 ] [  56 ] By RT‐qPCR analysis using custom‐made Taqman arrays, we first applied this gene panel to microvessels made of patient‐derived cells with or without TNF‐α treatment (Figure S7A Next, we compared the endothelium of 3D patient‐derived microvessels with the same ECs grown in gelatin‐coated 2D dishes (Figure S7B 2.4 Impact of TME Cell Components on Endothelium‐Mediated Immunomodulation We embedded TME cell populations in the collagen surrounding the microvessel. We first started with two immortalized human cell lines: A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells (from ATCC) and IGR‐Heu large cell carcinoma cells (established at Gustave Roussy Institute). [  57 ] [  58  59  60  61  62 ] In order to identify conserved TME modulations, independent of the specific cell models, we generated vascularized tumor‐on‐chip using three different types of lung ECs (patient #3, patient #4, HMVEC‐L), two different lung cancer cell lines (A549, IGR‐Heu), and two different primary types of lung CAF‐S1 (patient #3, commercial). After 24 h of on‐chip co‐culture and endothelium formation, ECs’ RNA were extracted and RT‐qPCR array analysis performed using the 42‐gene panel previously described. The Δ C t S8 The panel gene expression profiles of the endothelium in the various co‐culture conditions were reported relatively to the control condition with only the endothelium (Figure 4C [  36 ] Interestingly, VCAM‐1 expression was systematically and robustly downregulated in all three endothelial cell models and in all three co‐cultures conditions (0.44, 0.16, and 0.17‐fold changes, compared to ECs alone condition, for patient #3, upon co‐culture with IGR‐Heu, A549 and CAFs, respectively; 0.95, 0.37, and 0.49‐fold changes for patient #4; 0.10, 0.23, and‐0.24 fold changes for HMVEC‐L). The results of this array analysis on VCAM‐1 expression were confirmed by standard duplex RT‐qPCR analysis ( Figure  5 5B,C Figure 5 VCAM‐1 down‐regulation in lung microvessels.

A) Representative transmitted light microscopy images of the vToC from patient #14 showing the endothelial microvessel (left, see also Movie S2 S3 S4 3 Discussion The main aim of this study was to establish a clinically relevant in vitro model of vascularized TME by using patient‐derived ECs. Our initial ambition was to isolate ECs directly from the lung tumor tissues, at the same time as primary cancer cells, TILs and CAFs, [  63 ] [  64 ] [  9  65 ] We compared microvessels generated with patient‐derived ECs with microvessels generated with commercial lung primary microvascular ECs from healthy donors (HMVEC‐L). Overall, the phenotypic, functional, and transcriptomic analyses showed similar behaviors, indicating that our EC isolation/amplification protocols, and chip fabrication methodology, allow to efficiently generate functional microvessels with the expected endothelium properties. In this work we used a very small patients’ cohort (six patients), therefore we could not statistically evaluate inter‐patient differences. However, the personalization of our vToC with patient‐derived ECs opens the possibility to address new questions, such the impact of patient variability on endothelium properties, response to drugs, or interplay with other TME components. For renal cell carcinoma, in vitro microvessel models were generated with patient‐derived ECs and used for treatment testing, such as anti‐angiogenic drugs, [  65  66 ] Comparing to previous tumor‐on‐chip studies, [  5 ] [  67  68  69  70 ] [  71 ] [  72  73 ] [  74 ] [  75 ] [  15 ] In addition, we provide here the proof‐of‐concept generation of a fully autologous vToC which is an essential step toward tumor‐on‐chip models with real clinical relevance. In particular, the autologous nature of immune T‐cells is absolutely required to avoid any allogeneic reaction, since the ECs are able to present antigen through MHC class II molecules. [  76 ] In this work we exploited the vToC model to address the question of the impact of TME cell components on the expression of immunomodulatory genes by the endothelium. We found that cancer cells and CAFs decreased expression by ECs of VCAM‐1 leukocyte adhesion protein, which is crucial for immune infiltration. Moreover, when ECs were in co‐culture with cancer cells and CAFs, we observed a global down‐regulation in ECs of more than half of the immunomodulatory genes within our panel, including CCL2. These results are in line with the current concept that TME factors push the endothelium toward an immunosuppressive phenotype and favor blood vessel endothelial cell anergy. Indeed, inhibition of endothelial VCAM‐1 is a hallmark of endothelial anergy and was proposed to be driven in vivo by secretion of pro‐angiogenic factors within the TME. [  77  78 ] [  79 ] [  80 ] [  80 ] A significant limitation must be pointed out. Although the vToC model effectively integrates multiple cell types and recapitulates certain complex behaviors of the tumor ecosystem, it is still very far from capturing the full complexity of the TME. For example, as previously noted, upon ex vivo culture, both ECs and CAFs lose their cellular heterogeneity, as only specific cell subtypes are able to survive and proliferate outside the human body. Moreover, while CD8+ TILs have been incorporated on chip, the TME includes a much broader array of immune cells, with macrophages being the most abundant. Further research is needed to enhance the cellular complexity of tumor‐on‐chip models while ensuring that they remain controllable. In conclusion, the findings of this study demonstrate that our patient‐derived vToC is a robust ex vivo platform. When combined with advanced transcriptomic analyses, it provides valuable insights into the characteristics and functions of patient‐derived endothelia within the context of a reconstituted tumor ecosystem. vToC can serve as a powerful research tool to investigate TME‐dependent molecular mechanisms and to assess the effects of anti‐cancer treatments, including anti‐angiogenic drugs and immunotherapies. Finally, vToC can be personalized with primary autologous cells to study patient‐specific features and to prepare future applications in personalized medicine. 4 Experimental Section Lung Tissue Collection Tumor and healthy (i.e., same lobe) lung tissues were obtained from lung resections of NSCLC patients treated at Bichat–Claude Bernard Hospital (AP‐HP.Nord) in Paris. Ethical approval was obtained by the Comité d'Evaluation des Protocoles de Recherche Observationnelle (number 2020–051) from the French Speaking Respiratory Medicine Society. All patients were informed on admission that tissue samples or organs obtained during diagnostic or treatment procedures may also be used for research purposes. Through appropriate institutional informed forms, they could oppose to the use of their samples and/or clinical de‐identified associated data.

IGR‐Heu large cell carcinoma cells [  57 ] Microfluidic Device Design and Fabrication The microfluidic device design comprised a central chamber (3.75 mm length × 5 mm width × 0.6 mm height) containing a collagen I gel and two lateral medium compartments (5 mm cube with a 2.5 mm radius half‐cylinder on one side). A needle guide crosses completely the device to make a central channel of 200 µm in diameter. The central chamber was separated from the two lateral ones by sliding walls (20 mm length × 0.48 mm width × 0.63 mm height) which can be retracted once the collagen has polymerized.
