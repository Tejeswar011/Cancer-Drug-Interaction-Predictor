Here, we describe a tightly-regulated programmed cell revival process after exposure of cells to cell death-inducing lysosomotropic agents, such as L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe). In the initial stage of cell recovery, we observe increased chromatin accessibility and upregulation of genes and pathways associated with embryonic development, regeneration, stemness, and inflammation. Subsequently, vital pathways governing metabolism, organelle biogenesis, membrane trafficking, transport, and cytoskeleton remodeling are activated, resulting in the complete renewal of cells. Consistent with the links of this transcriptional profile to tissue repair and regeneration, we found LLOMe to enhance the healing of skin wounds and corneal alkali burns in mice, promote hematopoietic progenitor/stem cell production in Drosophila melanogaster Caenorhabditis elegans Synopsis  The ability of cells to recover after the initiation of cell death pathways is only little understood. This study challenges the dogma of irreversible cell death by characterizing a programmed cell revival process that reactivates developmental and regenerative pathways.  Cells exposed to sublethal concentrations of lysosomotropic agents can recover from near-death conditions through a tightly regulated process. Revival begins with enhanced chromatin accessibility and activation of gene networks related to embryonic development, stemness, and regeneration. Cells reconstruct organelles, including mitochondria and lysosomes, and form a novel mitochondrial–multivesicular body structure associated with metabolic reactivation. Treatment with the lysosomotropic agent LLOMe enhances wound healing, stem cell proliferation, and tissue/axon regeneration across multiple animal models. The NF-κB signaling pathway is indispensable for both cellular revival and tissue regeneration. Cells can recover from near-death states through a regulated process involving NF-κB signaling that enhances tissue regeneration in various organisms.

The LLOMe-induced cell death phase is characterized by extensive membrane blebbing, an annexin-positive plasma membrane, mitochondrial and other organelle fragmentation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, aberrant calcium flux, and the activation of molecular markers of cell death. The cell revival phase involves the biogenesis of all the cell organelles and also a reversal of all other cellular changes observed during the death phase. We observed the formation of a novel cellular compartment during revival, where highly polarized mitochondria tightly encircle large functional multivesicular bodies. The gene expression analysis suggests that the revival process is a meticulously programmed event, where multiple signaling and metabolic pathways required for survival and growth are induced in a well-synchronized manner. Interestingly, the program initiates the activation of pathways essential for embryonic development, growth, and differentiation. Additionally, chromatin remodeling enzymes and circadian rhythm genes were activated when cells initiated a new phase of life. This is followed by a stepwise upregulation of genes related to inflammatory and immune responses, metabolism, membrane trafficking, ion transport, extracellular matrix organization, and other pathways necessary for the full resuscitation of cells. We found that these massive transcriptome changes were not brought about by genome-wide alterations in methylation patterns, but by enhanced chromatin accessibility. Inhibitor screens and gene knockdown experiments suggest that multiple signaling mechanisms work in a concerted manner for cell resuscitation. Nevertheless, the NF-κB pathway was mainly found to be indispensable for cell revival. Given that the pathways triggered by LLOMe in a cell culture model recapitulate those necessary for effective embryonic development, tissue repair, regeneration, and stemness, we performed experiments to assess the effectiveness of LLOMe in inducing these processes in various animal models. Our findings revealed that LLOMe significantly improved skin and corneal wound healing in a mouse model, facilitated tadpole tail regeneration in a frog model, promoted axon regeneration in the Caenorhabditis elegans Drosophila melanogaster Results Cells revive from an early cell death state LLOMe at concentrations of ~2–8 mM causes lysosome membrane rupture in various cell types, resulting in floating cells that are considered dead in the literature (Droga-Mazovec et al, 2008 2020 2020 1A,B EV1A 1 3 1 C 1 3 1 3 Figure 1 Cells revive from apoptosis-like conditions. ( A 1 B C 2 D 5 E 6 F G H J H I J K L M L M Source data are available online for this figure To ensure that the trajectory of cell death is reversed, we collected LLOMe (4 mM) treated floating cells at the C3 stage, washed them with PBS, resuspended them in fresh media (without LLOMe), and replated. Within 6 h, all the cells were attached to the surface and started gaining morphology, and by 24 h, almost all cells regained typical fibroblast morphology and were dividing normally (Fig. EV1B C 4 Next, we investigated whether this phenomenon is specific to LLOMe treatment or is shared by other lysosome-disrupting agents. MEFs were exposed to various LMP-inducing agents such as alum (Hornung et al, 2008 2008 2008 l 1994 2015 2014 EV1D EV1D 1D,E EV1D 5 6 EV1D 1F 2+ 2015 2021 2020 Revival from LLOMe-induced early apoptotic conditions was observed in multiple cell types including BHK-21 (golden hamster kidney fibroblast cells), NIH/3T3 (mouse embryonic fibroblasts), MDA-MB-231 (Breast cancer epithelial cell line), HEK293T (kidney epithelial cells), and HeLa (cervical cancer epithelial cells) but not in, UM-UC3 (bladder cancer), HT-29 (colon cancer), and A549 cells (lung cancer) (Fig. EV1E,F EV1G EV2A,B EV2A,B Resurrection from plasma membrane damage Due to lysosome membrane permeabilization, LLOMe-treated cells lose the lysotracker staining within 5–10 min (C2 stage) of treatment (Fig. EV2C 7 7 1G 1G In confocal imaging of the live cell, the 4 mM LLOMe-treated C3 stage floating cells displayed distinct and scattered Annexin V-FITC-stained plasma membrane, indicating phosphatidylserine (PS) flipping to the outer leaflet of the membrane (Upper panels, Figs. 1H EV2D 1H 1I EV2D 1J EV2E,F 8 EV2G EV2H 9 1J EV2E G 7 9 MEF cells treated with 8 mM of LLOMe could also recover from severe apoptosis-like conditions, but no recovery was seen when cells were treated with 12 mM of LLOMe (Fig. EV2I 10 EV2J 1 J EV2D G 8 EV2G In conclusion, cells can recover from early apoptosis even with a compromised plasma membrane; however, once the nuclear membrane is compromised, there is no turning back from cell death. Revival from hallmarks of cell death Hallmarks of apoptosis initiation and lysosomal-dependent cell death include mitochondria fragmentation (or fission) (Arnoult, 2007 2+ 1999 2023 2009 2+ 1K EV2K 11 2+ 1K 2+ 2018 2023 2015 2020 2008 In Western blotting analysis with 4 mM LLOMe-treated cells, a weak cleavage of apoptosis markers (PARP-1 and caspase-3), a very weak cleavage of pyroptosis marker GSDMD (but not of Caspase-1), and a mild induction of necroptosis markers (p-RIPK3 and p-MLKL) was detected in C3, C4, and C5 stages (Figs. 1L,M EV2L,M 1L,M EV2L,M Next, we employed a ZipGFP-based caspase reporter, which constitutively expresses mCherry, and GFP is only produced upon caspase activation (To et al, 2016 12 12 Collectively, the data indicate that cells have the potential to resuscitate despite experiencing significant lysosomal disruption, mitochondrial fragmentation, phosphatidylserine exposure, and mild activation of proteins involved in cell death execution. We observed a weak activation of the caspase during the revival phase. We tested whether caspase activation directly contributes to the revival process by using pan-caspase inhibitors (zVAD). We used a range of zVAD concentrations (20, 40, and 80 µM), which were suggested in the literature to be effective in MEFs. We found that lower concentrations of zVAD (20 and 40 µM) did not affect the recovery of MEF cells from the death phase (Fig. EV2N EV2N S1 Organelle dynamics during revival from cell death-like conditions Next, we were interested in understanding how different cell organelles respond to this extensive lysosomal damage, leading to apoptosis-like conditions and the status of various organelles in the reviving cells (Fig. 2A 2A 2B EV3A 2B EV3A B Figure 2 Organelle dynamics during cell death and the resuscitation phase.

JC-1 dye displays membrane potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria, emitting green fluorescence at low membrane potential, and at higher membrane potential, it forms aggregates and emits red. Upon LLOMe treatment, the mitochondria depolarized rapidly, which is also a hallmark of cell death (Fig. 2H 2 I EV3K,L EV3K,L Programmed cell revival To comprehend the intricacies of the revival process, we performed RNA-sequencing analysis from cells taken at 6 stages ( n 3A 3B 3C Figure 3 Transcriptome analysis of programmed cell revival.

The Metascape analysis of cluster 3 showed multiple pathways related to embryonic development (muscle structure, connective tissue, blood vessels, and reproductive structure), differentiation (muscles, lymphocyte, myeloid, and fat cell), organ morphogenesis, anterior-posterior pattern specification, inflammatory/immune response (cytokine production and adaptive immunity) and circadian rhythm were induced (Fig. 3D 2 2018 3E 2016 2022a 1997 2000 1994 3E 2013 3F Cluster 1 genes (C5 stage) and cluster 2 genes (C6 stage) analysis showed the overrepresentation of pathways related to cholesterol, steroid, lipids, fatty acids, carbohydrates, nucleotides, vitamin metabolism, and ATP generation (Fig. 3G,H 2 2 3G,H 2 Taken together, the transcriptomic data indicate that resuscitation from cell death is a highly regulated, well-programmed process. Molecular pathways and gene networks of programmed cell revival Next, we performed pathway analysis to understand stepwise transcriptome changes with genes induced ( p adj p adj 3 EV4A 3 ATF3/4, EIF2AK1, PERK, HSF-1 FOXO, RUNX1, WNT, NOTCH1, p53, NRF2, TGF-β, ATF4, NPAS4, mTORC, NF-kB EV4B 3 2022 2009 2015 2023 2022 EV4C,D 4 Next, we attempted to understand whether the revival pathways genes were upregulated, concerted, or stepwise. To achieve this, we surveyed the transcription levels of genes in activated key pathways across all stages from C1 to C6 using heatmap analysis. We observed that a few pathway genes show concerted activation at the C4 stage. Noteworthy examples in this category included circadian rhythm genes (Fig. 3I 3J 3K KDM3A, 5B, 6A/B, 7A SET1B SETD2 BAF200, BAF250A, BAF250B KAT3A, KAT6A/B, EP300 KMT2A/2C/2E/2H, KMT5B 3J Per1, Per2, Cry2, Npas2, Bhlehe40 GSK-3β, Wee1, Myc, Fosb, E2f3 EV4E Many pathway genes were activated progressively during cell revival. Some examples of stepwise induction of pathways are depicted in heatmaps of genes related to WNT signaling (Fig. EV4F EV4G EV4H EV4I EV4J EV5A EV5B EV5C We also examined the changes in the transcriptome as the cells entered the death phase (C1 to C2 and C3). In comparison to the C1 stage, ~136 genes were upregulated, and 157 genes were downregulated in the C2 stage ( p 5 6 p 5 6 p 5 We noted that the gene expression patterns in the RNA-Seq at the C6 stage (16 h after LLOMe treatment) differed from those at the C1 stage (untreated cells), despite their morphological similarities. This discrepancy may indicate that the cells have not reached a basal state at the molecular level in the C6 stage. Consequently, we conducted another RNA-Seq experiment with untreated cells (C1 stage), cells treated with LLOMe for approximately 3 h (C4 stage), and fully revived cells treated with LLOMe for 30 h (extended-C6 stage) (see Fig. EV5D p 7 EV5E We found that primary BMDMs, when treated with LLOMe, do not exhibit the same morphological changes as non-immune dividing cells do. Next, we performed qRT-PCR using genes that represent major pathways upregulated during revival. We found that, except for one, none of these genes were induced during the revival process in BMDM; rather, their expression was reduced (Appendix Fig. S2 Cells undergoing apoptosis induced by ethanol have been shown to recover when the ethanol is removed (Sun et al, 2017 2017 S3 Activation of the master regulators of vital pathways during programmed cell revival Next, we examined the protein levels of some of the master regulators of vital pathways (Fig. 3L 3L Genome-wide DNA methylation changes during programmed cell revival We questioned what regulates massive transcriptional changes observed during PCR. DNA methylation is the epigenetic mechanism that drives transcriptional changes during embryonic development and multiple other physiological conditions. We profiled the distribution of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) using Oxford Nanopore sequencing (Sigurpalsdottir et al, 2024 S4A S4B 2012 S4B,C S4D Genome-wide changes in chromatin accessibility during programmed cell revival Chromatin accessibility allows the selective interaction of regulatory proteins/complexes to modulate the transcription of genes (Li et al, 2023 2012 2023 2012 4A 4B 4C 4C 4C 4C p adj EV5F Figure 4 The ATAC-seq analysis during cell death and resuscitation phase.

We compared and plotted the ATAC-seq signals at p65 (RelA) ChIP-seq peaks (Ngo et al, 2020 4G 4G Taken together, our results indicate that chromatin accessibility (epigenetic changes) leading to transcription factor binding and dynamic regulation of genes governs the programmed cell revival. Calcium signaling and mitochondrial functions are critical for programmed cell revival During the revival process, we observed dynamic changes in cell organelles, particularly in acidic organelles and mitochondria.

In MTT assays, the LLOMe-treated revived cells were not proliferating faster; rather, they were slightly slower in growth than untreated control cells (Fig. EV6A EV6B EV6C EV6D EV6E EV6F EV6G n EV6H EV6H We investigated whether repeated exposure to LLOMe might accelerate senescence, a key consideration for potential in vivo applications. Even after seven cycles of LLOMe treatment, we observed no significant increase in cellular senescence, as determined by β-gal staining (Fig. EV6I EV6I LLOMe enhances skin wound healing in a mouse model An effective wound-healing process consists of four key stages: homeostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and resolution/remodeling. The healing of wounds entails a sequence of clearly defined morphogenetic alterations that mirror embryonic development (Bielefeld et al, 2013 2021 2022 2007 2012 2013 2022 6A 6B 6B Figure 6 LLOMe accelerates wound healing and tadpole tail regeneration.

The frog tadpole tail regeneration model is a robust model for investigating the fundamental principles of tissue regeneration (Beck et al, 2009 2020 2008 We tested the efficacy of LLOMe in accelerating a tadpole tail regeneration in Polypedates maculatus 2018 2023 1994 2023 Polypedates maculatus 6F EV7C 2009 2018 EV7C EV7D–F 1974 2013 2019 2020 6F 6F,G NF-κB, mTOR, and calcium signaling are critical for frog tadpole tail regeneration Next, we tested whether the pathways that we found to be critical for the revival of LLOMe-treated cells, were also important for the regeneration of the tadpole tails.

Consequently, we coined the term programmed cell revival to describe it. The most significant outcome of this study is that the knowledge gained about the programmed cell revival process has been successfully leveraged to enhance wound healing, tissue regeneration, and stemness in animal models. We believe that there is significant potential to harness this process for therapeutic advances in regenerative medicine. Cell death versus cell death-like conditions We serendipitously found that many cell types can recover from cell death-like conditions when exposed to sublethal concentrations of LLOMe. Similarly, sphingosine and GPN, two other lysosomotropic agents, exhibited a comparable effect. Our findings indicate that cells can recover even when the integrity of the plasma membrane is compromised, but not after disruption of the nuclear membrane. Our live cell imaging data demonstrates that cells can survive and proliferate even after the cytoplasmic uptake of dead cell dyes like DAPI, ethidium homodimer-1, SYTOX, and PI. Thus, strong staining of the nucleus with nuclear impermeant dyes visualized by microscopy (not FACs) could be considered a definitive hallmark of cell death. Morphological changes, annexin/PI staining (by FACS), activation of molecular markers of cell death, or slight LDH release could be deceptive in marking cells to be dead. Cell biology of programmed cell revival The floating cells that were poised to re-initiate the program of life were found to be devoid of intact cell organelles (Fig. 2 Pathways and genes of programmed cell revival The activation of pathways associated with tissue development, morphogenesis, differentiation, pattern specification, chromatin modification/organization, circadian rhythms, and various signaling pathways such as TGFb, WNT, NOTCH, HOX, RUNX1, and AKT at the beginning of the revival process suggests that an embryonic developmental signaling program is reawakening cells. Bioinformatics analysis of gene signatures during the initial phase of cell revival indicates a resemblance to early-stage pluripotent stem cells. This leads to an intriguing hypothesis that dying cells may lose their original identity and undergo reprogramming, allowing them to restart their differentiation processes upon revival. Multiple inflammatory pathways were activated during PCR, with the IFN response being particularly notable. This response is crucial for antiviral defense, wound healing, and tissue regeneration (Carey et al, 2024 2023 2020 2021 2021 Many genes, such as Lipin1, Foxo3, Per1, Cxcl2, RelA Atf3 2015 2021 2019 2023 Epigenetic regulation of programmed cell revival At the onset of the revival phase, significant alterations were observed in the transcriptional landscape of the cells. There was an upregulation of numerous genes involved in various pathways. We hypothesized that the epigenetic modifications occurring during revival lead to these transcriptional changes. To investigate this, we conducted nanopore genomic sequencing to assess DNA methylation. However, our analysis revealed no significant changes in DNA methylation patterns across the different stages. Subsequently, we performed ATAC sequencing, which indicated that the initiation of PCR was associated with enhanced chromatin accessibility, suggesting a possible mechanism underlying the transcriptional changes. This study raises critical questions about the nature of epigenetic modifications that facilitate these transcriptional shifts and whether cells possess a form of genetic memory that enables them to transition back from a state of death to revival. Further exploration of these mechanisms could provide insights into cellular resilience and adaptability. Healing and regenerative capacity of LLOMe Cell death pathways and proteins are crucial components in tissue repair and regeneration across various model organisms such as Drosophila 2021 2010 2009 2017 2010 2014 2010 2009 2017 2010 2014 Cell death, encompassing both non-lytic apoptosis and various forms of lytic cell death (pyroptosis, necroptosis, and necrosis), plays a complex role in wound healing and regeneration (Artlett, 2013 2022b 2024 2022 2020 2022b 2022b 2015 It’s important to acknowledge that both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines are indispensable for successful wound healing (Mahmoud et al, 2024 2025 2013 2024 2019 2020 2024 It is reasonable to anticipate a close similarity in development and regeneration, considering that regenerative processes have to reconstruct structures that were previously formed during development. Indeed, multiple studies have shown that gene regulatory networks implicated in embryonic development are redeployed during regeneration (Johnston et al, 2021 2024 2011 2022 2020 Methods  Reagents and

The mice were housed in the animal facility at ILS. The chest was opened to expose the heart, which was then perfused using an ice-cold perfusion buffer (1X PBS + 2% FBS) by inserting a 25G needle into the left ventricle through the apex. The heart was excised and rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS. The whole heart was minced into small pieces using sterile scissors in ice-cold 1X PBS. The minced tissue was then transferred into a 15-ml centrifuge tube containing 2 ml of digestion buffer (2 mg/ml collagenase type-IV, 1% FBS + 1% penicillin-streptomycin) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, followed by manual trituration 10–12 times with a 5-ml serological pipette. The supernatant was passed through a 40-μm cell strainer into a 50-ml Falcon tube stored on ice. The cells were centrifuged, washed with ice-cold 1X PBS, resuspended in DMEM containing 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin, and cultured at 37 °C in a CO 2 Primary mouse embryo fibroblast isolation The primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from mouse fetuses aged 12.5 to 14.5 days (with the appearance of the copulation plug designated as 0.5 days) from time-mated C57BL/6J female mice. The pregnant female mouse was euthanized by cervical dislocation, and the uterus was harvested. The fetal tissues were finely minced with a scalpel in DPBS and then incubated in 200 µl of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution containing 0.1 µg/ml DNAse I per embryo for 10–15 min in a water bath with gentle agitation.

HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Novus (1:2000). Invitro scratch assay MEF cells were seeded in a six-well plate and exposed to LLOMe for specific time points. The control (untreated) and LLOMe-treated cells were then trypsinized and plated onto six-well plates to form a confluent monolayer. A micropipette tip was used to create a scratch across the width of the well. An EVOS 2000 inverted fluorescence microscope (cell imaging system) at 4X magnification was used to photograph the rate of cell migration in the same scratched region every 2 h until the entire scratch was closed entirely. Immunofluorescence assay The cells were cultured on glass coverslips and treated with LLOMe as desired. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with the specified primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After three 5-min washes with PBS, the cells were stained with Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS, once with dH 2 P36931 For immunofluorescence of floating cells, cells were collected 30 min post LLOMe treatment, centrifuged, resuspended in PBS, and immobilized on glass slides by Cytospin 4 (Thermo Scientific). The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and processed for staining as described above. For staining of lysosomes and mitochondria, the cells were stained with 50 nM LysoTracker TM TM 2 Primary Antibodies used in immunofluorescence assays with dilutions: ERp72 (D70D12) (CST; 1:100); EEA1 (C45B10) (CST; 1:200); Rab7 (D95F2) (CST; 1:200); RCAS1 (D2B6N) (CST; 1:200); Anti-beta Tubulin (Abcam; 1:500); p-Histone H2A.X (Ser 139) (Santa Cruz; 1:50); Tom20 (F-10) (Santa Cruz; 1:50) and LC3B (MBL; 1:500). Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen. Live cell imaging The cells were cultured on 6-well plates or 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes (ibidi) and treated with LLOMe as indicated in the figures. The cells were visualized using a ZEISS Celldiscoverer 7 live imaging microscope. To assess the revival of cells from cell death-like conditions induced by different lysosomotropic agents, the cells were seeded on a six-well plate and treated with the indicated concentration of the reagent. Images were acquired using an EVOS 2000 microscope at 10X and 40X magnifications at specified time points. For live cell microscopy using a confocal microscope, MEF cells were seeded in 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes (ibidi). The cells were treated with dyes such as 25 nM MitoTracker TM For a 6-h time point, MEF cells seeded in 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes (ibidi) were treated with a specified concentration of LLOMe. The cells were stained with the indicated dyes, such as 25 nM MitoTracker TM To perform live cell microscopy for Annexin-FITC using a confocal microscope, the cells were treated with the specified concentration of LLOMe. After 30 min, the floating cells collected by centrifugation were resuspended in 100 µL of binding buffer along with 5 μl Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (ebiosciences #88800574) and the indicated dyes such as 2 mg/mL Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen #H3570), 4 ng/μL Dil (Invitrogen #D282), 4 μM ethidium homodimer-1 (Invitrogen #L3224), 20 μg/ml PI (ebiosciences #88800574), 75 nM MitoTracker TM MTT assay The cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and treated with 4 mM LLOMe for 16 h. The control and LLOMe-treated cells were then trypsinized, and ~2000 cells were seeded in a 25 cm 2 High content microscopy imaging To quantify cell revival after inhibitor and/or LLOMe treatment, the cells were plated in a 96-well plate. The cells were then treated with 4 mM LLOMe and the specified inhibitors for the designated time points. Similarly, to quantify cell revival after siRNA transfection and/or LLOMe treatment, control and siRNA-transfected cells were plated at a density of 6000 cells per well in a 96-well plate. After 24 h of growth, the cells were stained with 2-μm Calcein-AM (Invitrogen #L3224) for 30 min and then imaged using the Cell Insight CX7 LZR high-content screening platform (Thermo Scientific). Automated image scanning and analysis were performed using HCS Studio and iDEV software, respectively. Images were acquired at 10X magnification, capturing 25 fields per well. The number of live cells per well was counted based on intensity and area. All data processing and analysis were computer-based. Annexin V/propidium iodide staining To assess the cell death, the Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining method was used (eBiosciences). The cells were seeded on a six-well plate and treated with the indicated concentrations of LLOMe. At specified time points, the cells were washed with PBS and trypsinized. Floating cells were collected by centrifugation of the culture supernatant 30 min after LLOMe treatment. The cells were then resuspended at a density of 1 × 10 5 JC-1 and CellRox staining MitoProbe™ JC-1 assay kit (Invitrogen) was used to assess mitochondrial membrane potential/polarization. Oxidative stress in live cells was measured using the CellROX™ reagent (Invitrogen # C10448 2 RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol TM −∆∆Ct Sample preparation for RNA sequencing The total RNA was isolated from cells for the indicated time points (three biological replicates) using the RNeasy mini kit. The quality and quantity of total RNA were assessed using agarose gel and Qubit 3.0, respectively. Following RNA quality assessment, 800–900 ng of total RNA was used for library preparation with the NEBNext Ultra™ directional RNA library prep kit, along with the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA magnetic isolation module. The library was quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Invitrogen), and its quality and fragment length distribution were evaluated using the high-sensitive tape station kit (Agilent 2200). Subsequently, the library was sequenced on the HiSeq 400 Illumina platform. RNA-seq data processing and gene expression analysis The paired‐end (PE) reads quality checks for each sample were conducted using FastQC v.0.11.5 ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ 2013 2014 p p https://www.bioconductor.org/ ATAC-seq chromatin assay To generate ATAC-seq libraries, 50,000 cells from both control and LLOMe-treated groups were used, and the libraries were constructed as previously described (Buenrostro et al, 2013 2 ATAC-seq data analysis ATAC-seq reads were processed using nfcore/atacseq v2.1.2 with standard settings. Reads were trimmed using trim-galore v0.6.7, aligned to the mm10 genome using BWA MEM v0.7.17, and duplicated reads were marked with Picard MarkDuplicates v3.0.0. Alignment was filtered using samtools v1.17, thereby removing multimapping and duplicated reads. Peaks were called from the filtered and sorted BAM using MACS2 v2.2.7.1 with parameters –Narrow–BAMPE–keep-dup all–nomodel. Consensus peaks were obtained by merging peak calls using bedtools v2.8. Heatmaps and metaplots were generated using deepTools version 3.5.6. DNA sequence motif analysis in ATAC-seq peaks was performed using HOMER version homer/v5.1, 7-16-2024. Nanopore library preparation and methylation sequencing Genomic DNA was isolated from the MEF cells. End repair and dA tailing were performed on gDNA, and libraries compatible with Oxford Nanopore sequencing were prepared using the ligation sequencing kit LSK114 following the manufacturer’s instructions. About 40 fmol of the library was loaded per flow cell on PRO-114M and run for ~72 h, targeting 80 Gb of data per sample. Data quality was assessed using NanoStat. Raw Oxford Nanopore signals in pod5 format were basecalled using dorado v0.4.2 in hac mode, passing the parameter “--modified-bases 5mCG_5hmCG” to enable methylation calling. The GRCm39 reference genome was also provided to dorado to enable alignment and produce a bam file containing reference alignments and read wise methylation information. Location-wise consensus methylation levels were derived from the bam files using modbam2bed. Only those cytosines which were covered by at least ten reads in all the four samples were considered for subsequent analysis. Genome-wide methylation analysis and data visualization were performed using custom Python scripts. Tail regeneration in Polypedates maculatus Indian tree frog Polypedates maculatus 2023 1994 For the tail regeneration experiment, amputated tadpoles ( n For inhibitor experiments, the tadpoles ( n CellRox, Lysotracker, and Rhod2AM staining in the cells isolated from tadpole tissue Posterior cells formed after the amputation were collected (5–7 tadpoles per group) and dissociated into single cells by washing with calcium-magnesium-free 1X PBS. The tissue samples were then incubated with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 5 min at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by diluting with 1X PBS. Physical dispersion was achieved by trituration with a pipette during and after trypsinization, followed by passing through a 70-μm cell strainer. The cells were then centrifuged at 300 × g Neural regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegan The experiments were conducted using the Caenorhabditis elegans 2021 2021 Wound healing in mice C57BL/6 J mice ( n 2013 ο Corneal regeneration in mice The institutional Animal Ethics Care Committee approved the study at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad, India. The experimental mice (C57BL/6J) of 6–8 weeks were divided into three groups: (A) Control group without injury. (B) Injured Control injured without LLOMe treatment. (C) 4 mM LLOMe-treated group. The eye of each animal, before surgery, or the right eye, served as a negative/normal control group. Briefly, the mice were anesthetized intramuscularly with a combination of Ketamine and Xylazine followed by 1–2 drops of sterile topical 0.5% Proparacaine Hydrochloride ophthalmic solution was applied to the eye in each animal to anesthetize the eye before the surgery. Corneal epithelium damage was achieved in the left eye of the mouse by gentle scraping of the corneal epithelium using a surgical scalpel No.15, and the alkali burn was made by topical, single drop application of 0.1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) for 30 s, and the eye was flushed with normal saline. Epithelial damage was identified by staining the eye with fluorescein sodium ophthalmic strips, blotting paper with orange color fluorescein stain (Care Group, Vadodara, India), and illuminated with cobalt-blue light. The positively stained area of the cornea was measured using ImageJ software (NIH, USA). LLOMe was administered topically two times a day with a 6-h gap for 7 days in the respective groups, and the follow-up continued for days 2, 5, and 7, respectively. MEF injection in C57BL/6J mice Female C57BL/6J mice aged 6 to 8 weeks were shaved and injected subcutaneously on the right and left flank with 1 × 10 6 n n IncuCyte analysis MEF cells were seeded into the six-well plate for overnight incubation. The cells were treated with LLOMe (at varying concentrations), d For measuring oxidative stress or lysosomes, MEF cells seeded in a six-well plate were incubated with 5 μM of CellRox reagent (Invitrogen # C10448 TM 2 For revival assays, MEF cells were seeded in a six-well plate with 2 µM ethidium homodimer-1 (Invitrogen #L3224) or 20 nM Sytox Green (Thermo Fisher Scientific, S7020) for 30 min at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 Drosophila All the Drosophila The early third instar larvae were collected and transferred to a vial containing distilled water and starved for 2 h. The larvae were then transferred to a vial containing the Whatman filter paper disk on which 150 µL of 8 mM final concentration of the LLOMe was added. The larvae were treated for 14 h with LLOMe. For control, 150 µL nuclease-free water (NFW) was added to the Whatman filter paper disk. LLOMe or control-treated third instar larvae were used for lymph gland (LG) dissections. The dissections were performed in phosphate buffer saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, followed by washes with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X (PBST). The samples were then blocked in 20% normal goat serum for 20 min at room temperature, followed by overnight primary antibody [rabbit anti-H3P (1:200, 06-570 – EMD Millipore)]. incubation at 4 °C. This was followed by PBST washes, blocking, and treatment with appropriate Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody incubation for two hours at room temperature. The LGs were then mounted in a Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, RRID: AB_2336790). Confocal images were captured using Zeiss LSM 780. The Z projection of the confocal images was used for estimating various lymph gland parameters using ImageJ/Fiji software. The Blood Progenitor Index was estimated by measuring the percentile of GFP-positive area divided by the total area of the primary lobe. A freehand selection tool was used for measuring the area of the Blood Progenitor Index. For the quantification of PH3, the positive signals for the marker were manually counted using the multipoint tool. The lymph gland quantifications were done for individual primary lymph gland lobes. MEF replating assay MEF cells were seeded in six-well plates. The next day, the cells were treated with 4 mM LLOMe and the floating cells were collected by centrifugation (30 min post treatment). The floating cells were plated in complete DMEM media, followed by image acquisition by EVOS 2000 microscope at 10X and 40X magnification at the indicated time points. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) ELISA was performed using the ELISA Max™ Deluxe Set Mouse (BioLegend) kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, supernatants from MEF cells treated with LLOMe (4 mM) were collected at 0 min, 30 min, 3 h, and 30 h post treatment. Polystyrene 96-well plates were precoated overnight at 4 °C with a specific capture antibody, followed by blocking with blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature (RT). Standard cytokine dilutions and cell culture supernatants were then added and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Plates were washed with PBS supplemented with 0.05% Tween-20, then incubated with biotinylated detection antibody for 1 h at RT. After washing, the plates were incubated with HRP-Avidin for 30 min at RT, followed by another wash. The signal was developed by adding TMB (3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine) until color appeared. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 M H 3 4 Comet assay MEF cells seeded in a six-well plate were treated with repeated cycles (7 cycles) of 4 mM LLOMe every 24 h. Control cells, trypsinized for six cycles, served as the control. The control and LLOMe-treated cells were trypsinized, and 1 × 10 5 β-Galactosidase (β-Gal) assay MEF cells seeded in a six-well plate were treated with repeated cycles (7 cycles) of 4 mM LLOMe every 24 h. Control cells, trypsinized for six cycles, served as the control. Following treatment, both control and LLOMe-treated cells were fixed and stained using the Senescence β-Galactosidase Staining Kit (Cell Signaling Technology, #9860) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Images were acquired using an EVOS 2000 microscope at 10× and 40× magnifications. Mouse bone marrow cells isolation and differentiation Bone marrow cells were isolated from mice and differentiated into macrophages using a standard procedure. Briefly, 6 to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Bone marrow cells were flushed from the tibiae and femurs into RPMI medium. Red blood cells were lysed using RBC lysis buffer containing 155 mM NH 4 3 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using the GraphPad Prism Version 9 software.
