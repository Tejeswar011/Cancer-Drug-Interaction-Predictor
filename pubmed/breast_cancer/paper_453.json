Iwamoto K. Ogi T. Nakagaki  Notch1 Cancer Reports 8 10 2025 e70345 10.1002/cnr2.70345  Funding: 1 Introduction Oral cancer is one of the predominant malignancies within the head and neck region. Current therapeutic modalities for oral cancer include surgical intervention, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted pharmacotherapy. The disease is characterized by high rates of recurrence and metastasis, resulting in a 5‐year survival rate of less than 50%. Additionally, there are currently no specific therapeutic targets for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) treatment. These challenges contribute to an overall 5‐year survival rate of approximately 50% in treated patients, highlighting the urgent need for improved treatment strategies. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising approach for recurrent or metastatic OSCC; however, response rates remain modest (14%–18%), with a 6‐month progression‐free survival rate of 23% and a 1‐year survival rate of 36% [ 1 2 3 The Notch family comprises four members, Notch1–Notch4, which are type I transmembrane receptors. Notch1 plays an important role in regulating the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of diverse cell types in various organisms [ 4 5 Notch1 TP53, CDKN2A, PIK3CA, and HRAS 6 Notch1 7 8 A decade ago, it was reported that inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway downregulates programmed death 1 (PD‐1) expression in activated tumor‐infiltrating CD8 + 9 10 Notch1 11 + + + 12 Recently, it was reported that the relationship between Notch signaling and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) expression is significant in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 13 14 15 16 17 In our previous study, a potential relationship was found between mutations in the Notch signaling pathway, tumor‐infiltrating CD8 + 18 + Notch1 + In this study, we analyzed Notch1 protein expression in normal oral fibroblasts and OSCC cell lines in vitro. To elucidate the role of Notch1 in OSCC, we conducted cell counting kit‐8 (CCK‐8) and wound healing assays. The relationship between aberrant Notch1 expression and PD‐L1 expression in OSCC cell lines was examined using a Notch signaling inhibitor or Notch1 Notch1 + Notch1 Notch1 + 2 Methods 2.1 Cell Lines and Human Tissues Samples The fibroblast cell line from the lip (KD) and human OSCC cell lines (HSC‐2, HSC‐3, HSC‐4, OSC‐19, OSC‐20, OSC‐30, OSC‐70, SAS, SAT, HO‐1‐u‐1, and KOSC‐3) were obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources Cell Bank (JCRB, Osaka, Japan). Additional human OSCC cell lines (HOC‐119, HOC‐621, MOT, and SCC‐25) were kindly provided by Prof. Nobuyuki Kamata (University of Tokushima, Japan). All cell lines were authenticated using short tandem repeat (STR) analysis and confirmed to be mycoplasma‐free through routine quality control. All the cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% (w/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Waltham, MA, USA) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S; Gibco). These cell lines were incubated at 37°C with 5% CO 2 Tumor tissue specimens from the 47 patients with OSCC were obtained from Sapporo Medical University as part of a previous study. All tissue samples were collected after obtaining written informed consent from patients before surgery, and OSCC was histologically confirmed by pathologists. This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of Sapporo Medical University (342‐3416). IHC staining of archival specimens was performed. OSCC stage and grade was not considered in the present study. 2.2  RNA cDNA qPCR Each cell line was seeded at 70%–80% confluence in 10 cm dishes. Diluted cell suspensions (5.0 × 10 5 NOTCH1 NOTCH2 NOTCH3 NOTCH4 GAPDH −ΔΔCT 2.3 Cell Proliferation Assay OSC‐20, HSC‐3, HO‐1‐u‐1, and SAS cells (5.0 × 10 3 2 2.4 Wound Healing Assay OSC‐20, HSC‐3, HO‐1‐u‐1, and SAS cells (1.0 × 10 5 2 2.5 Whole‐Exome Sequencing and Variant Calling Cell lines with disordered Notch1 expression were subjected to genomic analysis. One hundred nanograms of DNA were sheared to approximately 200 base pairs (bp) by sonication. The genomic regions of whole exons were captured by microarrays using synthesized oligonucleotide probes hybridized to fragmented genomic DNA samples. The libraries were sequenced using an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 with 2 × 150 bp paired‐end reads. Sequence exome enrichment was performed using SureSelect Human All Exon V6 kits according to the manufacturer's instructions and compared to the human reference genome b37 using an Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon V6 Kit (Agilent, USA). Briefly, raw sequencing data in FASTQ format were aligned against the reference human genome (b37) using SAMtools. The Genome Analysis Toolkit and Sentieon Genomics Tools were used for germline single‐nucleotide variants (SNV) and indel calling, and Sentieon Genomics Tools were used for somatic SNV and small indel calling. ANNOVAR was used to functionally annotate the genetic variants. 2.6 DAPT Administration and Notch1 siRNA Transfection To determine the optimal concentration of DAPT (cat. #ab120633, γ‐secretase inhibitor; Abcam Plc., Cambridge, GBR), cells were seeded in 96‐well plates, and DAPT was added in stepwise dilutions starting at 20 μM. A final concentration of 10 μM DAPT was found to be the most effective. After 24 h of culture at 37°C, inhibition efficiency was assessed by WB, and this concentration was used for subsequent experiments. Next, cells were seeded in six‐well low‐attachment plates (1 × 10 3 2 Notch1 2.7 Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis Total protein was extracted using RIPA buffer (Fujifilm Wako Junyaku Inc.) and a cell scraper on ice. The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) was used to determine the concentration of proteins. Each lane of 4%–12% Bis‐Tris gels (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) was loaded with 30 μg of protein, which was transferred onto 0.22‐μm polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (2322453, ATTO) after electrophoresis. The PVDF membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk/PBS containing 0.01% Tween‐20 (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4°C with the primary antibodies. The primary antibodies used in this study were Notch1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA, USA), cleaved Notch1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), Hes1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), PD‐L1 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), and β‐actin (1:10000, Cell Signaling Technology) with gentle shaking overnight. After three washes with PBST for 10 min each, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase‐conjugated sheep anti‐mouse IgG (1:10000) or goat anti‐rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation and three washes with PBST for 10 min each, protein bands were detected using ECL Prime Peroxide Solution (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA). Protein bands were visualized using an iBright 1500 imaging system (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific). 2.8 Flow Cytometry Analysis The cells were collected by trypsinization, followed by centrifugation at 500 × g 2.9 Evaluation of Immunohistochemical ( IHC PD L1 CD8 + A total of 47 samples were suitable for assessing PD‐L1 expression. PD‐L1 expression was assessed using PD‐L1 IHC (E1L3N XP Rabbit mAb #13684, Cell Signaling, 1:200) according to the manufacturer's instructions in paraffin‐embedded tumor samples obtained before treatment. Three expert pathologists from our institution assessed the expression of PD‐L1 based on the PD‐L1 combined positive score (CPS). CPS was scored as CPS ≤ 1%, 1% < CPS < 20%, and CPS ≥ 20%, based on the percentage of positively stained tumor cells in the sample. For the CD8 IHC test, 12 paraffin‐embedded tumor samples with PD‐L1 expression (CPS ≥ 1%) were assessed using an anti‐CD8 alpha antibody (C8/144B, ab17147, Abcam) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Secondary antibodies were incubated with a DAB detection kit (DAB; Abcam, Waltham, MA, USA). The samples were then counterstained with hematoxylin (Dako, Carpinteria, CA, USA).

Two mutations were located in the EGF‐like domain of the Notch1 extracellular region. One of the two, a mutation in exon 7, was commonly observed in SAS and HO‐1‐u‐1 cells. The other mutation was located in exon 13 of HO‐1‐u‐1. An amino acid sequence comparison of the mutation sites among species revealed that two Notch1 Notch1 1 TABLE 1 Mutational distribution of the exon functional domains of Notch1   Note: N C 3.4 Alteration of PD L1 We assessed whether DAPT treatment or Notch1 knockdown affected PD‐L1 expression. Notably, intrinsic PD‐L1 protein levels in OSCC depend on the cell line used. DAPT did not affect PD‐L1 expression in OSC‐20 cells with no mutation of Notch1 Notch1 3A FIGURE 3 DAPT or Notch1 Notch1 Notch1 We assessed whether Notch1 siRNA affects PD‐L1 expression. Notch1 siRNA did not affect PD‐L1 expression in OSC‐20 cells with no mutation of Notch1 3B 3.5 Alteration of PD L1 The fluorescence count of PD‐L1–positive cells in OSC‐20 cells, which lacked the Notch1 mutation, remained unchanged by Notch1 knockdown compared to that of empty PD‐L1 (Figure 4A 4B 4C 4D 4E 4F,H FIGURE 4 Flow cytometry histograms presenting the cell surface expression of PD‐L1. The histograms of OSC‐20 (A), HSC‐3 (C), HO‐1‐u‐1 (E), and SAS cells (G) were not changed following DAPT treatment. The histograms of OSC‐20 (B), HSC‐3 (D), HO‐1‐u‐1 (F), and SAS cells (H) were dynamically changed following Notch1 However, the fluorescence count of PD‐L1–positive cells in SAS cells was almost unchanged following Notch1 knockdown (Figure 4G 3.6 Clinical Parameter Analysis of Notch 1 To explore the role of Notch1 Notch1 2 + Notch1 + 3 + + + 5 TABLE 2 Clinicopathological parameters of 12 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) according to Notch1 Variables Number of cases NOTCH1 mutation Negative Positive Age Median 67.5 years Range 57–84 years Gender Male 9 (75.0%) 5 (41.7%) 4 (33.3%) Female 3 (25.0%) 0 (0.0%) 3 (25.0%) Clinical T‐stage T1 4 (33.3%) 1 (8.3%) 3 (25.0%) T2 6 (50.0%) 3 (25.0%) 3 (25.0%) T3 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) T4 2 (16.7%) 1 (8.3%) 1 (8.3%) Clinical N‐stage N0 8 (66.7%) 3 (25.0%) 5 (41.7%) N1 2 (16.7%) 1 (8.3%) 1 (8.3%) N2 2 (16.7%) 1 (8.3%) 1 (8.3%) Clinical stage I 2 (16.7%) 0 (0.0%) 2 (16.7%) II 5 (41.7%) 2 (16.7%) 3 (25.0%) III 2 (16.7%) 1 (8.3%) 1 (8.3%) IV 3 (25.0%) 2 (16.7%) 1 (8.3%) Lymph node metastasis Negative 8 (66.7%) 4 (33.3%) 4 (33.3%) Positive 4 (33.3%) 1 (8.3%) 3 (25.0%) Differentiation Well 6 (50.0%) 2 (16.7%) 4 (33.3%) Moderate 6 (50.0%) 3 (25.0%) 3 (25.0%) Poorly 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) 0 (0.0%) TABLE 3 Overview of clinicopathological parameters, somatic Notch1 +  FIGURE 5 The image of tumor‐infiltrating CD8 + + + In the present study, five of the 12 patients did not have Notch1 + 3 + Notch1 Notch1 + + Overall, tumor infiltration by CD8 + Notch1 Notch1 + 3.7  Notch1 We subsequently investigated whether Notch1 6A NOTCH1 FIGURE 6 Profiles of Notch1 + Notch1 + Notch1 Notch1 Notch1 + Notch1 + In HNSCC, mutated type (MT) Notch1 + + + 6B Notch1 + + Notch1 + Notch1 p 6B + p 6D 4 Discussion  Notch1 Notch1 TP53 19 20 Notch1 p 2A 2B Notch1 Interestingly, it was recently reported that Notch1 21 Notch1 Notch1 22 Notch1 21 23 In contrast, Wei et al. reported a significant negative correlation between Notch1 Notch1 24 The present study aimed to investigate the interaction between Notch1 Notch1 Notch1 Subsequently, we investigated the interaction between Notch1 25 26 27 28 We analyzed this interaction using clinical OSCC samples and online bioinformatics tools (TIMER2.0). In OSCC samples, we retrospectively examined IHC data with or without Notch1 + Notch1 + Notch1 + Next, we examined the interaction between Notch1 Notch1 + Notch1 p + p + Notch1 As a timely contribution, Shangkun et al. recently reported molecular evidence explaining changes in the immune microenvironment following the Notch signaling pathway. They focused on Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), which is linked to tumor cell cycle, drug resistance, and tumor immune escape, and reported that FOXM1 affected PD‐L1 levels through the Notch pathway, thereby promoting gastric cancer (GC) progression. They concluded that Notch inhibition led to PD‐L1 up‐regulation, attenuated the inhibitory impact of FOXM1 overexpression on CD8+ T‐cell activation, and enhanced CD8+ T‐cell cytotoxicity against GC cells. Additionally, they confirmed that all of these effects were significantly reversed after FOXM1 knockdown [ 29 + Due to the limited number of OSCC samples with Notch1 + In conclusion, our findings indicate that Notch1 Author Contributions All authors had full access to the data in the study and take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.
