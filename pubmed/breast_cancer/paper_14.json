In light of this property, a phase I clinical trial was conducted on fostriecin, but was soon halted due to issues with compound stability and purity. Numerous efforts in the past two decades have yielded 17 successful syntheses that proceed in 17 to 34 steps. Herein, we develop a modular chemoenzymatic approach that provides fostriecin and its analogs in a collective manner in 9 steps (longest linear sequence) from readily available ( R Graphical Abstract  pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript yes pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
