Methods We retrospectively reviewed data from 79 patients with newly diagnosed HNSCC aged 45 or younger without distant metastasis who underwent postoperative or definitive radio(chemo)therapy in either the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University Hospital of Erlangen or the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University Hospital of Mainz between September 2006 and December 2023. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate survival and recurrence rates. In univariate analysis, the log-rank test was used to correlate patient-/tumour- and treatment-related parameters to survival and recurrence rates. Results The overall survival rate was 79.7% at 2 years and 67.1% at 5 years. The DFS rate was 73.4% at 2 years and 67.1% at 5 years. Cumulatively, 14.6% of patients in the postoperative arm had locoregional recurrences at 2 years and 23.0% at 5 years, while 25.7% of patients in the definitive arm had local recurrences at 2 years and 33.1% at 5 years ( p p p p Conclusion Locoregional recurrences were the most common site of recurrence, regardless of tumour location and treatment modality. Therefore, future study designs in this patient cohort should potentially investigate intensified treatment approaches.

The primary treatment for patients diagnosed with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is either surgery followed by adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy or without any adjuvant treatment depending on T and N stages or primary radiochemotherapy. HNSCC is often associated with consumption of tobacco and alcohol. Another risk factor is chronic infection with subtypes of the human papillomavirus (HPV) [ 1 2 We were interested in the outcomes and risk factors of adults aged younger than 45 years because on the one hand, long-term exposure to tobacco and alcohol in this group is rare, and on the other, DFS rates seemed not to be better than in older patients [ 3 4 5 Understanding the prognostic factors that influence survival in this age group is crucial, as it can guide clinical decision-making and treatment strategies. Prior research has shown that younger patients may have different tumour biology, treatment responses, and psychosocial needs, which necessitates a tailored approach to their care [ 6 The aim of this retrospective analysis was to investigate survival data, recurrence patterns, treatments strategies and patient-related risk factors. Materials and methods In this retrospective analysis, we examined a cohort of 79 patients diagnosed with HNSCC who were treated with radio(chemo)therapy in two tertiary cancer centres in Germany, either in the Department of Radiation Oncology of the University Hospital of Erlangen or the Department of Radiation Oncology of the University Hospital of Mainz, between September 2006 and December 2023. By utilizing the Kaplan–Meier method for survival analysis, we aimed to identify correlations between patient and tumour characteristics, treatment modalities, tumour sites, and outcomes. The findings of this study will contribute to the understanding of HNSCC in younger patients and may inform future clinical practices to improve their prognosis. Patient characteristics We reviewed the clinical records of patients aged younger than 45 years with newly diagnosed HNSCC. Exclusion criterion was the presence of distant metastases.

Two patients were treated with brachytherapy alone (2.5%), 71 patients with teletherapy alone (89.9%) and six patients were treated with teletherapy followed by a boost with brachytherapy (7.6%). Teletherapy involved the application of different techniques, including 3D-CRT (Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy), IMRT (Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy) and VMAT (Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy). The median radiotherapy dose applied in the adjuvant setting by teletherapy alone was 64 Gy (Gray) (range: 54 to 70 Gy), with one patient cancelling treatment after 10 Gy. Radiotherapy was administered daily, five times a week, with a single fraction dose of 2 Gy. The patient who received 70 Gy developed a relapse during radiotherapy treatment. One patient treated with brachytherapy alone in the adjuvant setting received HDR (High Dose Rate) brachytherapy with a single fraction dose of 3.8 Gy and a cumulative dose of 38 Gy. Three patients were treated with teletherapy to a cumulative dose of 50 or 56 Gy combined with a PDR (Pulsed Dose Rate) brachytherapy boost consisting of a single pulse dose of 0.5–0.6 Gy to a cumulative dose of 10 to 12 Gy. The median radiotherapy dose in the definitive setting was 70 Gy in primary tumour regions and in involved lymph nodes (range: 60 to 73.4 Gy); 22 out of 29 patients (75.9%) received a dose of 70 Gy or higher. Three patients with laryngeal cancer UICC stage I received 64 or 66 Gy, and another three patients received 64 Gy as part of a clinical trial. The dose was either applied through daily radiotherapy, five times a week, with a single fraction dose of 2 Gy, or through bidaily radiotherapy, five days a week, with a single fraction dose of 1.4 Gy. In elective lymphatic drainage areas, 50 to 60 Gy was applied. One patient received PDR brachytherapy at the primary tumour site alone, with a single pulse dose of 0.57 Gy to a cumulative dose of 60 Gy. Three patients received teletherapy combined with a brachytherapy boost to the primary tumour site, with a cumulative dose of 70–73.4 Gy. Chemotherapy All patients undergoing definitive percutaneous radiotherapy received concomitant chemotherapy. In the postoperative group, 29 out of 48 patients (60.4%) received chemotherapy. The indication for postoperative chemotherapy was based on extracapsular spread (24.1%), close resection margins (13.8%), involvement of three or more lymph nodes (17.2%), or the individual decision of the treating physicians (65.5%). The following chemotherapy regimens were used in both definitive and adjuvant settings: 34 patients received platinum + 5-fluorouracil (61.8%), 11 received platinum monotherapy (20.0%) and 10 received platinum + paclitaxel (18.1%). Toxicity data In the group of patients who survived for 2 years after treatment, we evaluated long-term toxicity. This group included a total of 54 patients. Five patients were lost to follow-up, and no data could be obtained for them. Long-term toxicity was assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), versions 3 to 5, depending on the year of evaluation.

Disease-free survival was defined as the absence of locoregional or distant disease recurrence or death. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 28 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). The Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate overall survival, disease-free survival, and the cumulative incidence of local/locoregional control and distant metastases. In univariate analysis, the log-rank test was employed to correlate patient-, tumour-, and treatment-related parameters with overall survival, disease-free survival, and the incidence of local/locoregional recurrences and distant metastases. Results The median follow-up was 52.8 months (minimum 1 month; maximum 158 months). The patient with the minimum follow-up of 1 month developed both locoregional and distant progression after postoperative radiochemotherapy in UICC stage IVB. Patients receiving adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy began radiotherapy a median of 53.3 days (minimum 14 days; maximum 125 days) after tumour resection. Taking re-resected cases into account, the median time to start radiotherapy was 47.8 days (minimum 14 days; maximum 91 days) after the last resection. Overall survival The overall survival (OS) rate was 79.7% after 2 years and 67.1% after 5 years; 65.8% of the patients were still alive at the end of the follow-up period. The minimum overall survival was 4 months, and the maximum follow-up duration ended after 160 months (Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Overall survival ( OS Considering the UICC stage and divided into definitive and postoperative treatment cohorts, the OS rates were as follows: patients with UICC stage I and II disease showed survival rates of 75% after 2 and 5 years in the definitive treatment arm ( n n n n n n Disease-free survival The DFS rate was 73.4% after 2 years and 67.1% after 5 years; 65.8% of the patients did not develop a relapse by the end of follow-up (Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Disease-free survival ( DFS Patients receiving definitive radiochemotherapy showed a DFS of 64.2% after 2 years and 51.4% after 5 years. In the postoperative group, DFS was 76.6% after 2 years and 69.3% after 5 years. ( p p Few parameters were found to correlate significantly with DFS. Firstly, alcohol consumption was significantly correlated with DFS (Fig. 3 p Fig. 3 Alcohol consumption and disease-free survival ( DFS Considering the UICC stage, DFS rates were as follows (Fig. 4 p Fig. 4 Union for International Cancer Control ( UICC DFS In the cohort of patients treated with adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy, we observed slightly different values. In UICC I–II, DFS was also 83.3% after 5 years. Out of 12 patients, 2 suffered a relapse within the first year after treatment. One patient suffered a relapse 8 years after first diagnosis. In UICC III–IVA, 36 patients were included, with a DFS of 76.7% after 2 years and 66.9% after 5 years. In UICC IVB, 3 patients were included, resulting in a DFS of 0% after 2 years. We did not find significant results regarding DFS when considering other risk factors such as smoking, positive family history, a long time between surgery and adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy, or histopathologic characteristics (e.g. perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, grading). We also did not find significant results regarding DFS when considering different tumour sites. In the subgroup of oropharyngeal cancer, there were 24 patients (Fig. 5 p Fig. 5 Human papillomavirus ( HPV DFS Locoregional recurrence Cumulatively, 12.0% of patients in the postoperative arm had locoregional recurrences at 2 years and 23.0% at 5 years, while 25.7% of patients in the definitive arm had locoregional recurrences at 2 years and 33.1% at 5 years ( p p p Distant metastasis The rate of distant metastasis was 19.2% in the postoperative arm at 2 years and 21.6% at 5 years. In the definitive arm, the distant metastasis rate was 20.7% at 2 years and 28.6% at 5 years ( p Second cancer Four patients developed a second malignancy (5.1%). Three of them developed oesophageal cancer, and one developed lung cancer. One patient developed a second malignancy 3 years after the first diagnosis, two patients developed it 6 years after diagnosis, and one patient developed it 12 years after diagnosis. The cumulative incidence after 5 years was 1.9%, and after 10 years it was 9.2%. Discussion This study evaluated the outcomes of patients aged 45 years or younger with HNSCC. Because of the specific nature of this cohort, our study has several limitations. First, it is a retrospective analysis covering a period of 17 years. Despite this long period, only 79 patients could be included. Due to this extended timeframe, there is a lack of differentiation regarding HPV status, as HPV differentiation started only in 2015 in our cohort. Additionally, due to the retrospective nature of the study, toxicity data for some patients and follow-up information are partially inconsistent, and several treatment regimens and techniques were used. Furthermore, the small sample size in our analysis must be taken into account; as a result, some subgroups were so small that no statistically significant results could be expected. To summarize, the overall and disease-free survival rates were similar to those of the overall patient population suffering from HNSCC. In the KEYNOTE-412 trial, which considered patients with locally advanced HNSCC in definitive treatment, DFS after 24 months was 56% in the control group, and OS was 72% after 36 months in the control group [ 7 8 13 10 11 9 Despite the young age, alcohol consumption remains an important risk factor in our cohort. Other authors have suggested that patients under 40 years of age are unlikely to have a history of alcohol or tobacco abuse and that the duration of exposure would be too short for malignant transformation to occur [ 14 15 Other authors discuss an increased mutagen sensitivity in cancer development and the risk of developing a secondary malignancy in young patients [ 16 17 19 19 Unsurprisingly, we observed better DFS in patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. However, to achieve more significant results, a larger number of cases would be needed. Additionally, further molecular analysis of high- and low-risk HPV subtypes could lead to more personalized treatment recommendations [ 20 The outcome for patients receiving adjuvant radio(chemo)therapy in UICC stages I and II was similar to that in patients receiving definitive radiochemotherapy, with a DFS of 83.3% after 5 years. It remains unclear—also due to the small sample size—whether a treatment delay, such as one caused by wound healing complications, in adjuvant treatment after surgery has an impact on outcome. This potential effect has been discussed by several authors with contrasting results; however, most emphasize the importance of an appropriate adjuvant treatment. For example, Huang et al. [ 21 22 23 24 In the locally and nodally advanced stages (UICC III and IVA), we could not identify an optimal treatment strategy, although the cumulative DFS rates using the Kaplan–Meier method were slightly better in the postoperative treatment arm, with a DFS of 66.9% after 5 years compared to 58.0%. However, this difference is not considered statistically significant. The literature also presents an ongoing debate regarding the optimal treatment for these stages [ 25 Regarding recurrence patterns, most recurrences occur locoregionally. Locoregional recurrence rates of about 25% contribute to the poor outcomes. Therefore, in the future, optimized multimodal treatment options need to be established. Conclusion In this analysis, the prognosis of young patients with HNSCC is not worse than that of older patients in historical control groups. The specific risk factors for young patients remain unclear. Furthermore, classical risk factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and HPV infection may also contribute to cancer development in patients under the age of 45 years. Local recurrences were the most common site of recurrence, regardless of tumour location and treatment modality. Therefore, future study designs in this patient cohort should potentially investigate intensified treatment approaches. The Authors S. Drabke and M.
