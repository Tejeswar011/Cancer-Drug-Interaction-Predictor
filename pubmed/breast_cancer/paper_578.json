Although liver transplant recipients are aware of the importance of immunosuppressive drug regimens, treatment compliance may decrease over time due to low motivation, putting recipients at risk of organ rejection. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) appears to be an ideal solution for increasing motivation and, indirectly, treatment compliance. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ACT on adherence to immunosuppressive medication and motivation in liver transplant recipients. Methods This study was conducted at an organ transplant hospital with the participation of recipients who had completed at least 6 months post‐liver transplant. The sample included n n n Findings According to the homogeneity tests of this study, there was no statistically significant difference between the control and experimental groups in terms of individual characteristics (age, time since transplantation, immunosuppressive drugs, comorbidities, etc.). In the experimental group, the level of adherence to the immunosuppressive drug regimen after ACT was very close to the maximum AIDRS score. In the control group, the level of compliance with the immunosuppressive drug regimen was close to the mean value of the AIDRS. The differences mentioned in both groups were statistically significant ( p p Conclusion The importance of full compliance with the immunosuppressive drug regimen in improving graft function after liver transplantation is well known. The results of this study showed that liver transplant recipients who underwent ACT demonstrated higher adherence to the immunosuppressive drug regimen due to increased motivation and conscious awareness. We recommend the use of ACT to increase adherence to the immunosuppressive medication due to its effectiveness. A total of 140 liver transplant recipients were included in the experimental and control groups of this study. Recipients in the experimental group received eight sessions of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Adherence to immunosuppressive medication and motivation increased in the ACT‐treated experimental group, while medication adherence decreased in the control group, which received no intervention ( p acceptance and commitment therapy immunosuppressive liver transplant medication motivation transplantation treatment adherence Ulusal Metroloji Enstitüsü, Türkiye Bilimsel ve Teknolojik Araştirma Kurumu pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:30.09.2025  Saritas S.

During this process, it is very important for the patient to have high energy and motivation and to want to live more than anyone else. However, increased needs after liver transplantation, the economic burden caused by health problems, lack of social support, and physical limitations can lead to exhaustion in recipients (Bulbuloglu et al. 2023 2023 2023 2025 2021 2019 2019 2022 2022 2019 2005 2018 2018 2017 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Study Design and Sample In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of ACT in improving compliance with immunosuppressive drug regimens and motivation levels in liver transplant recipients. We followed the steps of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement in this study (Moher et al. 2024 1 1 FIGURE 1 Research flow chart. 2.2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The inclusion criteria for this study were (i) liver transplant recipients were offered participation in the study during routine outpatient follow‐up and accepted the offer (liver transplant recipients agreed to come to special consultation rooms at intervals requested by the researchers), (ii) having been on an immunosuppressive drug regimen for at least 6 months, (iii) being 18 years of age or older, with no communication issues, (iv) recipients who had undergone primary liver transplantation, and (v) not being a participant in another study where a similar initiative was being conducted at the same time. The opposite of these criteria was accepted as the exclusion criterion. 2.3 Data Collection Tools The data collection tools administered to liver transplant recipients included a personal characteristics form, the Immunosuppressive Drug Regimen Adherence Scale, the Mindfulness Awareness Scale, and the Adult Motivation Scale (AMS). Information regarding the data collection tools is provided below. 2.4 Personal Information Form The personal information form was developed by researchers based on the literature (Bulbuloglu et al. 2023 2021 2010 2023 2.5 Adherence to Immunosuppressive Drug Regimen Scale AIDRS was first used by Morisky and colleagues in 1986 to assess adherence to antihypertensive medications. Chisholm and colleagues adapted the same scale for organ transplant patients in 2004 (Chisholm 2002 2005 2016 2016 2016 2.6 Mindfulness Scale (MS) The MS was developed by Brown and Ryan ( 2003 2003 2011 2011 2.7 Adult Motivation Scale The AMS was developed by Tulunay‐Ateş and İhtiyaroğlu in 2019 (Ateş and İhtiyaroğlu 2019 2.8 Randomization Each liver transplant recipient was assigned to the experimental and control groups using a simple random sampling method, and a web‐based Random Assignment Software (RAS) was used for this purpose (Arslan et al. 2019 n 2.9 Experimental Group Prior to acceptance and commitment therapy, the recipients in the experimental group were administered a personal characteristics form, as well as the MS, AMS, and AIDRS as pre‐tests. The 70 liver transplant recipients in the experimental group were divided into seven groups of 10 people each. ACT was administered to each group on different days. Table 1 TABLE 1 Summary of the acceptance and commitment therapy protocol. Module Content 1 Introduction and Presentation of the ACT‐Based Program: The purpose of the study was explained, the ACT‐based program was introduced, and informed consent was obtained. ACT sessions were explained, and a therapist agreement was reached. 2 Values: Discussing past experiences and observations, principles of being a benchmark, developing creative despair, practicing understanding and accepting feelings and thoughts, doing healing exercises, measuring willingness to change, summarizing, and homework. 3 Creative Hopelessness, Control is a Problem: Recognition of overcontrol as a problem and presentation of willingness as a possible response, undertaking purposeful actions, attracting valued aspects, giving up anxiety control and accepting value‐based behavior, discussion of risks and difficulties in accepting illness and treatment, planning of exercises to be done in the next session, and homework. 4 Cognitive Defusion: Cognitive defusion techniques are used in this phase. Problematic language chains are broken down, the ties between the self and thoughts and emotions are weakened, awareness‐based acceptance of anxiety is learned, and the distinction between internal and external control is addressed, as well as the functioning of problematic metaphors and language chains. 5 Understanding, Connecting, and Accepting: Accepting oneself as a context and observing, stretching the conceptualized self‐construct and strengthening the observing self, drawing the context‐accepted self‐construct into oneself, and learning from anxious and fearful thoughts and feelings. 6 Contextual Self: Use of mindfulness techniques, modeling the “mind” as an independent entity, accepting that gaining experience is a process, understanding the importance of emotions and experiences in enriching life, identifying and focusing on life values, summarizing, and planning exercises and homework for the next session. 7 Behaviors Aligned with Values: Introducing and explaining the concept of value, understanding the disadvantages of focusing on results, revealing practical values in life, identifying the differences between values and goals and common mistakes, and identifying internal and external obstacles. 8 Closing: Understanding the nature of ACT involves knowing values‐based action patterns, developing values‐focused behavior plans, and making efforts to create commitment to them. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 2.10 Control Group The liver transplant recipients in the control group were administered the MS, AMS, and AIDRS as pre‐tests along with a personal information form. Each liver transplant recipient with questions was given the opportunity to discuss them comfortably with the researchers. No other interventions were made with the control group, and no follow‐up visits were conducted over the 12‐week period. At the end of 12 weeks, liver transplant recipients in the control group were invited to the outpatient clinic, and the MS, AMS, and AIDRS were administered as the final test during their outpatient visits. 2.11 Data Analysis The data from this study were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 27.0 IBM (Armonk, NY) program.

However, after liver transplantation, recipients begin a new process that must be managed. There is a strong relationship between the effectiveness of the care and treatment required for this process and graft survival. Adherence to immunosuppressive drug regimens represents an important phase in the post‐liver transplant period. The motivation level of liver transplant recipients affects their adherence to immunosuppressive drug regimens. This study demonstrated that the motivation level of post‐liver transplant recipients can be increased, thereby improving their adherence to immunosuppressive drug regimens. In this regard, the main strategy for increasing motivation and medication adherence was ACT. Thanks to ACT, the mindfulness levels of liver transplant recipients increased by almost 25%, while in the control group, where no intervention was made, mindfulness decreased over time. In previous studies, ACT has been used to increase adherence to treatment and disease management. In Pardede's ( 2019 2019 2017 2017 As'hab et al. 2022 Previously, the literature has mentioned that ACT provides high motivation to increase physical activity. Lev Arey and colleagues applied ACT to increase the willingness and motivation of healthy individuals who did not engage in sufficient physical activity to engage in physical activity. The study sample consisted of 94 Israeli university students with low physical activity levels. The same study reported an increase in exercise motivation and intensity at the end of a 12‐week intervention incorporating Self‐Determination Theory and ACT (Lev Arey et al. 2022 2013 Through ACT, individuals activate their internal motivation and challenge inconsistent thoughts. A previous study reported that ACT is the most effective mindfulness‐based intervention for promoting health behavior change (C. Q. Zhang et al. 2018 Forman and Butryn 2015 2015 2019 Liver transplant recipients must take immunosuppressive drugs regularly throughout their lives to avoid graft rejection. Regular medication use is of great importance in managing chronic conditions. Patients who do not take their medications regularly are forced to cope with the increasingly severe symptoms of their existing diseases. In a study conducted by Sadeghi et al. ( 2024 2024 2022 2012 2024 Bulbuloglu and Gunes conducted a study aimed at increasing immunosuppressive treatment compliance after liver transplantation using mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy. In the aforementioned study, the period after liver transplantation was approximately 3 months, and mindfulness‐based cognitive therapy was applied to the experimental group for 8 weeks. It was found that medication compliance had increased in the experimental group 1 month after the intervention. In contrast, liver transplant recipients in the control group, who did not undergo any intervention, showed a further deterioration in medication compliance by the ninth month after transplantation compared to measurements taken 3 months earlier (Bulbuloglu and Gunes 2024 2021 2021 2023 2022 2021 2022 5 Conclusion After liver transplantation, recipients enter a process that requires them to prioritize their health at all times. During this process, liver transplant recipients must make a significant effort to ensure that graft function improves and increases day by day. To this end, it is of great importance that they are motivated to adhere closely to their immunosuppressive drug regimen. Increasing the motivation of liver transplant recipients and improving their adherence to immunosuppressive drug regimens highlights the need for strategic approaches to maintaining graft function and survival. In this study, acceptance and commitment therapy applied to liver transplant recipients improved adherence to immunosuppressive drug regimens by increasing mindfulness and motivation. As adherence to immunosuppressive drug regimens decreases in liver transplant recipients, the risk of complications and death increases. The addition of acceptance and commitment therapy to the multi‐care practices taught to liver transplant recipients provides significant advantages in terms of being a non‐pharmacological intervention and supporting recipients in coping with their conditions. We recommend that liver transplant recipients undergo acceptance and commitment therapy to improve their adherence to immunosuppressive medication and increase their motivation to do so.
