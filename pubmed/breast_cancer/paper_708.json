Although most of these early disseminated cells are cleared, some survive and persist below clinical detection, acting as reservoirs for metastatic relapse. Metastatic tumor cells often rely on interactions with local stromal cells to support their colonization. In this study, we propose that pericyte-tumor cell interactions promote dormancy induction in the early metastatic lung, enhancing disseminated tumor cell (DTC) persistence. Extravital imaging demonstrated that DTCs interact with pericytes upon extravasation into the lung. Co-culture experiments were used to assess DTC fate after pericyte contact and revealed that transient contact with pericytes reduced the proliferation of metastatic 4T1 breast cancer cells but had no effect on non-metastatic 67NR cells.
