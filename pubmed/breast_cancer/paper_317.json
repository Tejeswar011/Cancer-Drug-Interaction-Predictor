Many of the mechanisms that support these processes are incompatible with proliferation. This study defines cellular transition states in breast epithelial cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) driven by ERK2 and TGF-β signaling. EMT triggers robust endolysosomal system upregulation and metabolic adaptations that balance proliferative and invasive states. Surprisingly, invasive cells rely on scavenging via lysosomes and macropinocytosis to acquire amino acids, rather than plasma membrane transport, even in nutrient-rich conditions. Macropinocytosis increases intracellular amino acid storage, promoting survival during amino acid deprivation. This metabolic shift depends on c-MYC downregulation, an early EMT event. Reintroducing c-MYC suppresses the metabolic switch, endolysosomal induction, macropinocytosis, and the proliferation-to-migration transition. These findings reveal how cells dynamically balance proliferation and invasion, offering insights into transition states difficult to capture in models of breast cancer metastasis. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version yes pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint yes pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
