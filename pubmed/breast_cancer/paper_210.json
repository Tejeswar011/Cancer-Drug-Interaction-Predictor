Background Mental health is closely linked to the development of various diseases and serves as a cornerstone of healthy aging. Empty nesters, who lack family support, are particularly vulnerable to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. Network analysis offers a novel methodological approach to uncovering associations between mental disorders. This study aimed to construct a network model of anxiety and depression symptoms among Chinese empty nesters, identify central and bridge symptoms, and explore their interrelationships to inform targeted interventions. Methods A total of 5,130 individuals aged 60 and above were selected from the China Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS 2017–2018). Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 (GAD-7). A symptom network was constructed using the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC) model and the Graphical Gaussian Model (GGM) with the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regularization. Central symptoms and bridge symptoms were identified using Expected Influence (EI) and bridge Expected Influence (bEI). The stability and accuracy of the network were evaluated through non-parametric bootstrap methods. Additionally, the Network Comparison Test (NCT) was employed to examine potential gender differences in network structure. Results Network analyses revealed that the central symptoms of anxiety-depression network were CESD-3 (I felt sadness), GAD-2 (Not being able to stop or control worrying) and GAD-4 (Trouble relaxing). CESD-1(I was bothered by things that do not usually bother me), GAD-1 (Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge) and GAD-3 (Worrying too much about different things) are critical bridge symptoms linking depression and anxiety. Furthermore, this study found that the anxiety-depression network among empty nesters did not exhibit gender differences. Conclusion This study identified CESD-3 (I felt sadness), GAD-2 (Not being able to stop or control worrying), and GAD-4 (Trouble relaxing) as central symptoms in the anxiety-depression network among empty nesters. These findings provide critical insights for developing precise interventions aimed at mitigating the progression of anxiety and depression, improving mental health in this population, and ultimately promoting healthy aging. empty nester anxiety depression network analysis China The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Psychology of Aging 1 Introduction Population aging has become a pressing global challenge, with China experiencing particularly rapid demographic shifts. The accelerated aging process, coupled with evolving family structures, has positioned China as the nation with the world’s largest elderly population ( Man et al., 2021 Yan et al., 2022 Zhang et al., 2019 Xu and Yang, 2023 Hou, 2025 A substantial body of research has demonstrated that empty nesters are at a higher risk of developing anxiety and depressive symptoms. Meta-analysis findings indicate that the prevalence of depression among older adults in China is 31.17% ( Wu et al., 2024 Song et al., 2023 Zheng et al., 2022 Zheng and Zhang, 2024 Ciuffreda et al., 2021 Hettema, 2008 Liu et al., 2022 Zhao et al., 2024 Among empty nesters, anxiety and depression rarely exist in isolation. They are more like a “symbiotic pair,” intertwining and mutually reinforcing each other, forming a more complex and persistent state of comorbidity compared to other age groups ( Sillero et al., 2023 Divers et al., 2022 Zhang Y. et al., 2023 Kryza-Lacombe et al., 2024 To effectively address these challenges, it is necessary to investigate the specific symptom-level interactions between anxiety and depression. Grounded in network analysis theory, this study provides a conceptual framework aimed at enhancing our understanding of the nature and mechanisms of mental disorders by modeling and analyzing the complex system of symptom relationships ( Borsboom, 2017 Borsboom and Cramer, 2013 Hofmann et al., 2016 Although network analysis has been successfully applied to various populations, including students, healthcare workers, and patients with chronic diseases ( Chen et al., 2023 Zheng et al., 2024 Yohannes et al., 2022 Schlechter et al., 2021 Soqia et al., 2022 To address this gap, the present study utilizes network analysis to examine the relationships between depression and anxiety symptoms in Chinese empty nesters. By identifying central and bridge symptoms within the network, this research aims to enhance our understanding of the complex interplay between anxiety and depression in this population, thereby providing clinicians with evidence-based insights to develop targeted intervention strategies. 2 Methods 2.1 Study setting and participants This study used data from the China Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS 2017–2018) ( Peking University Center for Healthy Aging and Development Studies, 2020 Inclusion criteria for this study were (1) age ≥60 years, and (2) empty nester: living alone or with spouse only. Exclusion criteria: (1) missing data such as anxiety and depression scales. A total of 5,130 study participants were finally included for analysis. The screening process is shown in Figure 1 Figure 1 Flow diagram of the selection of sample. Flowchart depicting a participant selection process from the CLHLS dataset in 2018 with an initial sample size of 15,874. Exclusions include 20 individuals under 60 years, 9,998 non-empty nesters, and 726 missing depression or anxiety data. Final analysis includes 5,130 participants. 2.2 Measurement 2.2.1 Empty nester Empty nester ( Yu-Ting et al., 2022 2.2.2 Anxiety In this study, we measured the severity of anxiety symptoms over a two-week period in older adults by means of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale-7 (GAD-7), which has been widely used among Chinese older adults ( He et al., 2010 Spitzer et al., 2006 2.2.3 Depression The CLHLS used the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10) to assess depression in older adults ( Chen and Mui, 2014 Boey, 1999 2.3 Network estimation 2.3.1 Network analysis This study used R for data analysis. A network of depression and anxiety symptoms was constructed using the extended Bayesian information criterion (EBIC) model and the graphical Gaussian model (GGM) with the visual least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) from the R packages “qgraph” and “bootnet.” Where EBIC is used to select the best fitting model, GGM is used to check the ordered or categorical data and LASSO is used for regularization ( Epskamp et al., 2018 Epskamp et al., 2012 2.3.2 Centrality and stability Centrality index is often used to measure the core symptoms of a network model. In this study, there is a negative correlation between the nodes, so we used Expected influence (EI) to quantify the central symptom, the higher the EI value of a node, the higher its influence ( Epskamp et al., 2012 Jones et al., 2021 Haslbeck and Waldorp, 2015 Epskamp et al., 2018 2.3.3 Web comparison Based on a previous study ( Jin et al., 2022 Van Borkulo et al., 2017 3 Results 3.1 Study sample A total of 5,130 empty nester were included in this study. There were 2,707 males and 2,423 females with a mean age of 80.01 years (SD = 9.34). The mean CESD-10 score for the entire sample was 7.35 (SD = 4.53) and the mean GAD-7 score was 1.38 (SD = 2.69) ( Table 1 Table 1 Sample characteristics ( n Characteristics n Age (years) 80.01 ± 9.34 Gender Men 2,707(52.77%) Women 2,423(47.23%) Anxiety symptoms 1.38 ± 2.69 Depressive symptoms 7.35 ± 4.53 3.2 Network structure The depression and anxiety symptom network for empty nester is shown in Figure 2 Supplementary Table S1 Table 2 Figure 2 Network structure of depression and anxiety symptoms in empty nester.

Black areas indicate no influence, with gray areas showing varying levels of influence. 3.4 Comparisons of network structure between the sexes Supplementary Figures S2 S3 p p Supplementary Figures S4 S5 4 Discussion In this study, the incidence rate of depression symptoms among empty nesters was 26.9%, which is higher than the incidence rate of anxiety symptoms (10%). The same result was also found in Hou B’s study ( Hou, 2025 Spitzer et al., 2006 This study represents the first application of network analysis to examine the relationships between depression and anxiety symptoms in empty nesters, offering novel insights into the complexity of their mental health conditions. Our findings reveal that CESD-3 (I felt sadness)emerged as the most central symptom in the network, followed by GAD-2 (Not being able to stop or control worrying) and GAD-4 (Trouble relaxing). Notably, the key bridge symptoms connecting anxiety and depression were GAD-1 (Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge), GAD-3 (Worrying too much about different things), and CESD-1 (I was bothered by things that do not usually bother me). The present study identified CESD-3 (I felt sadness) as the most central symptom in the anxiety-depression network among empty nesters, underscoring its critical role in the interplay between these conditions, making it an effective target for prevention, treatment, and intervention. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) (2013 edition) ( First, 2013 Zheng and Zhang, 2024 Ma et al., 2024 Zhang P. et al., 2023 This study identified GAD-2 (Not being able to stop or control worrying) and GAD-4 (Trouble relaxing) as additional central symptoms in the network structure. Notably, these findings contrast with previous research where GAD-1 (Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge) demonstrated the highest centrality value ( Bian et al., 2024 Zhang et al., 2024 Wang et al., 2025 Daneshvari et al., 2021 Dong et al., 2025 Bridge expected influence is a valuable tool for identifying dynamic relationships between symptoms, serving as key therapeutic targets. Precision interventions focusing on bridge symptoms may prove particularly effective in treating comorbid disorders. In the current study, GAD-1 (Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge) and GAD-3 (Worrying too much about different things) emerged as crucial bridge symptoms in the anxiety-depression network among empty nesters, aligning with previous findings in studies of older adults living alone ( Chang et al., 2025 Ventura-León et al., 2022 Previous research has suggested that excessive tension or anxiety may activate uncontrollable worry in the short term. Cho indicates that within traditional Chinese family structures, older adults often bear significant responsibilities for family decision-making and grandchild care, while the younger generation is expected to respect and care for their elders. This intergenerational dynamic leads many older adults in China to worry intensely about being unable to continue supporting their families due to declining health or financial difficulties, while also fearing that illness or lower socioeconomic status might make them a burden to their children ( Cho et al., 2021 Network analyses and exploratory factor analyses have consistently identified tension as a critical transdiagnostic symptom associated with both anxiety and depression ( Bian et al., 2024 Wang et al., 2022 The current study found no gender-based differences in the anxiety-depression network structure among empty-nester older adults, which contrasts with previous findings ( Sileo et al., 2022 Zubin and Spring, 1977 Mayerl et al., 2024 This study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, anxiety and depression among the elderly were assessed using self-reported screening tools (CESD-10 and GAD questionnaires), which may be subject to response bias. Future research should incorporate objective measures, such as biochemical markers, to complement self-reported data and enhance validity. Second, due to the cross-sectional design of this study, causal relationships between variables cannot be established. Longitudinal studies are needed to further explore the temporal dynamics and potential causal pathways underlying these associations. Finally, all data were collected through self-reports, which may introduce biases such as social desirability or recall bias. Future studies could benefit from incorporating multiple data sources (e.g., clinical evaluations, caregiver reports) to improve reliability and accuracy. In summary, this study is the first anxiety-depression network analysis of empty nester to identify CESD-3 (I felt sadness), GAD-2 (Not being able to stop or control worrying), and GAD-4 (Trouble relaxing) as the central symptoms, and GAD-1 (Feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge), GAD-3 (Worrying too much about different things), and CESD -1 (I was bothered by things that do not usually bother me) are the key bridge symptoms. Intervention strategies should start from the above central and bridge symptoms, consider the causes of sadness, tension, uncontrollable worry, and inability to relax in older adults, and develop multidimensional, targeted intervention strategies. For example, applying cognitive therapy based on positive thinking to reduce anxiety and enhance adaptive emotion regulation and mental health conditions. Considering the high dependency of Chinese elderly on their families, strategies should be formulated starting from the family roles. From a social perspective, strengthening community support networks, establishing community activity centers for the elderly, organizing regular social events, and developing neighborhood mutual aid projects to help the elderly relax both mentally and physically. Furthermore, establishing lifelong learning opportunities, offering courses at community senior universities, providing internet skills training, enhancing the elderly’s ability to solve common problems in life on their own, reducing their unnecessary worries, and increasing their sense of self-worth. In terms of family, promote the use of remote communication technologies, discuss future living arrangements, develop contingency plans, clarify medical and care preferences, and meet the emotional needs of the elderly. In summary, the direction of future interventions should start with the central and bridge symptoms, with the government, community and family working together to reduce the sadness of empty nester, enhance their mental health and improve their quality of life.
