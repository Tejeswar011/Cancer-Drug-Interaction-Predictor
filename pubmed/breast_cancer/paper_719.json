Background Recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is associated with a poor prognosis. Limited treatment options highlight the need for precision therapeutics. Patients and methods We investigated the correlation between diverse clinical features and genetic changes using next-generation sequencing data derived from our recent umbrella trial. We analyzed the targeted DNA and RNA sequencing data profiles of 419 patients with HNSCC enrolled in the recent genomic-based umbrella trial. Comprehensive analyses, including survival analysis, were conducted to assess the overall genetic landscape, mutational signature patterns, copy number variations, and their correlation with patient outcomes. Results Multiple genomic aberrations served as predictive factors in patients treated with targeted therapies. NOTCH1 mutations and MYC amplification were associated with worse prognosis ( P P Conclusion Genomic profiling plays a significant role in the management of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC and may help identify potential targets for precision therapeutics. Highlights • Targeted NGS of 419 recurrent/metastatic HNSCC cases in TRIUMPH reveals 102 pathway-linked mutation spectra. • NOTCH1 and MYC alterations may be associated with inferior outcomes on PIK3CA104 targeted therapy. • CDKN2A deletion versus SNV/indel shows differing trends in response to CDK4/6 106 inhibition. • Subgroup analysis indicated a possible association between p16 status and 108 immunotherapy response in HNSCC. • Young (patients aged <40 years) oral-cavity cancer exhibits a distinct mutational profile within HNSCC. • PIK3CA SNV/indels are enriched in HPV-positive oropharyngeal tumors.

The TRIUMPH study delineated its targeted therapeutic strategies and specific molecular targets as follows: arm 1 utilized alpelisib (BYL719), targeting PIK3CA; arm 2 employed poziotinib, aimed at EGFR/HER2; arm 3 involved nintedanib, an inhibitor of FGFR; and arm 4 used abemaciclib, directed against CDK4/6. The detailed information on the study design was described in our previous publication. 12 Sample and clinical data collection Samples were collected from patients who provided written informed consent to participate in the TRIUMPH trial. The study was approved by the institutional review boards of 35 Korean institutions. Tumor specimens and matched peripheral blood were collected either at the time of initial diagnosis or at the time of biopsy-confirmed recurrence or metastasis during clinical follow-up, depending on availability. There were no specific restrictions regarding the timing of tissue acquisition to allow for real-world applicability and inclusivity of diverse clinical scenarios. A total of 419 patients underwent molecular prescreening, among whom 180 had confirmed recurrent or metastatic (R/M) disease at the time of biopsy. Of these, 179 patients were subsequently enrolled into biomarker-driven therapeutic arms of the umbrella trial. The overall patient screening and enrollment process is illustrated in Supplementary Figure S1 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105772 Comprehensive clinicopathologic data—including age, sex, tumor location, cigarette and alcohol use, clinical stage, prior treatment history, and survival data—were also collected for integrated genomic and clinical analysis.Smoking status (cigarette smoking only) was classified as current (active use at enrolment), former (prior use, stopped before enrolment), or never (<100 cigarettes lifetime). A summary of patient sample availability across different analyses is presented in Supplementary Figure S2 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105772 DNA extraction, RNA extraction, and immunohistochemistry Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor sections (5 μm) were macro-dissected, and genomic DNA (gDNA; 0.2 μg per sample) was isolated using the QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany; Cat. # 56404). Libraries were prepared with the SureSelectXT HSQ Reagent Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA; Cat. # G9611C) following the ‘Low-Input’ protocol and enriched with the custom panel, which captures the complete coding exons of 244 cancer-relevant genes (1.12 Mb of non-redundant target, Supplementary Table S1 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105772 Peripheral blood was collected in EDTA tubes. Germline DNA (1 μg input) was purified using the Maxwell 16 LEV Blood DNA Kit (Promega, Madison, WI; Cat. # AS1290) and sequenced. Total RNA (typically >500 ng, adjusted according to extraction yield and RNA Integrity Number) was extracted from FFPE curls using the RNeasy FFPE Kit (QIAGEN; Cat. # 73504). Immunohistochemistry for p16 was performed with the CINtec® p16 Histology Kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany; Cat. # 825-4713) on Ventana Benchmark ULTRA instruments. Bioinformatics pipeline Data preprocessing and somatic and germline variant calling Trimming was performed using fastq with several standards, including poly G, length, complexity, and front tail. 13 https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890471 10.5281/zenodo.1185418 14 15 Copy number variant calling, mutational signature analysis, visualization, oncogenic pathway, and microsatellite instability analysis Copy number variants were analyzed using the CNVkit with the batch option. 16 Mutational signatures were inferred with SigMA (v 0.3.6), a supervised machine-learning tool tailored for targeted panels. 17 Visualization including ‘Oncoprint,’ ‘Heatmap,’ and ‘Lollipop plots’ were drawn using the ComplexHeatmap (Gu et al., 2016, iMeta; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/imt2.43 30341162 18 , 19 20 , 21 12 , 22 23 NanoString assay and analysis Extracted RNA was profiled on the nCounter Analysis System (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA) using a custom CodeSet (XT-GXA-P1CS-384; NanoString, supplied by PhilKorea, Seoul, Republic of Korea) that measures the expression of 93 immune- and cancer-related genes. Counts were filtered using a negative probe in nSolver software ver. 4.0 to remove outliers. The geometric mean of the positive probe and housekeeping genes were used for data normalization.

First, we characterized the overall frequency of these alterations across the cohort; next, we examined the survival data for patients who received the corresponding targeted therapy in the TRIUMPH trial. Although some individuals with the relevant genomic alteration did not ultimately enroll in that specific arm—and overlaps among pathways were also observed—this approach provides a broad overview of how certain coexisting mutations can significantly influence therapeutic outcomes.

Discussion This study presents the comprehensive genomic analysis of patients with HNSCC using NGS data. Our study, involving the genetic analysis of 419 patients with HNSCC recruited from our umbrella study, revealed clinically relevant targeted pathways and identified potential therapeutic candidates. In addition to the prespecified arms, recurrent alterations were observed in the AKT-mTOR, NOTCH, RAS-RAF, and TP53 pathways, which may represent candidate axes for future targeted strategies ( Supplementary Figure S7 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.105772 To determine the variables influencing patient outcomes, we examined both survival data and the molecular status. We identified a link between EGFR EGFR EGFR 32 We established a connection between the genomic landscape and clinical outcomes of patients receiving targeted therapies in our umbrella trial, revealing several significant findings. Notably, NOTCH1 MYC 33 , 34 By contrast, although CDKN2A CDKN2A HPV infection plays a pivotal role in HNSCC pathogenesis, particularly in oropharyngeal cancers. Genetic variations in HNSCC can be identified through TP53 TP53 PIK3CA TP53 IFNG, In our examination of germline variants, no distinct patterns or recurrent variants were observed according to the primary sites or within the subgroup of young patients. However, the prevalence of TP53 Our study had several limitations. First, the analysis was restricted to targeted gene sequencing and expression data, which may have limited the scope of our genomic landscape and mutational signature analysis compared with whole-exome or whole-genome approaches. Second, although most tumor specimens were obtained at the time of initial diagnosis, some patients may have received systemic therapy before enrollment, and comprehensive treatment histories were not uniformly available. Third, because sequencing was performed only once, it provided a single molecular snapshot, and subsequent tumor evolution may have gone undetected. Finally, the number of subgroups analyzed was relatively small, resulting in limited statistical power for certain comparisons. In conclusion, in this study, we conducted a large-scale genomic analysis of patients with HNSCC and identified several genetic traits associated with clinical features. Despite the challenges posed by HNSCC heterogeneity, our findings provide valuable insights into the treatment of real-world patients through detailed genomic profiling. References 1 Patterson R.H.
