Drug repurposing is regarded as the most effective strategy in developing drug candidates by using therapeutic characteristics of well-known drugs. A bibliometric analysis was conducted on drug repurposing in cancer research to assess the current state, focal points, and trends of research aimed at offering a comprehensive overview of research development and providing future research directions in the area. Utilizing the Bibliometrix R package and VOSviewer, this study examined 1166 documents indexed in the Scopus database covering the period from 2008 to 2024. The findings revealed that this field of research is steadily growing with an annual growth rate of 37.49%. The USA and China emerged as the leading contributors to research in this field, with the journals “Cancers” and “Oncotarget” emerging as the sources with the highest publications and impact, respectively. “Pantziarka P” stood out as the most prolific author, while “Bouche G” emerged as the most impactful author in drug repurposing in cancer research. Notably, subjects such as “antineoplastic activity” garnered considerable attention, highlighting critical research areas within the field. Whereas “pantoprazole” and “transwell assay” emerged as the latest trending topics in the field. Further investigations into antineoplastic agents, transwell assays, and candidate drugs such as pantoprazole are suggested for shaping the research landscape on cancer drug repurposing. The study offers valuable insights into the trajectory of drug repurposing in cancer research and provides researchers with useful guidance for future exploration of this domain.

Examples of such studies include bibliometric analysis of drug repurposing [ 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 31 32 The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate research output on drug repurposing in cancer research over the last two decades using bibliometric science mapping and visualization tools. We analyzed the distribution of publications retrieved from the Scopus database, categorized topics, and tracked progress over time. Additionally, we examined country contributions and author collaboration (co-authorship), with particular emphasis on research topics and emerging research areas. We also highlighted important future research directions in the area. Methods Bibliometric method and data collection We gathered and extracted the data for this study from the Scopus database on September 12, 2024 (Fig. 1 33 34 The following search initial string was utilized in the data retrieval: (“Cancer” OR “Tumour” OR “Tumor”) AND (“Drug repurposing” OR “Drug repositioning”). The study was streamlined to the last two decades (2005–2024) to give a clear insight into the recent research trends in the field. The search encompassed titles, abstracts, and keywords, resulting in an initial pool of 5,129 documents. Narrowing the search to research and review articles published in English gave a total of 4,586 documents. The final search string for the data retrieval was: [TITLE-ABS-KEY ((“Cancer” OR “Tumour” OR “Tumor”) AND (“Drug repurposing” OR “Drug repositioning”)) AND PUBYEAR > 2004 AND PUBYEAR < 2025 AND (LIMIT-TO (LANGUAGE, “English”)) AND (LIMIT-TO (DOCTYPE, “ar”) OR LIMIT-TO (DOCTYPE, “re”))]. Subsequently, a manual screening of the titles and abstracts was conducted to exclude publications lacking bibliometric data and those outside the subject area. The final selection of articles was meticulously curated to ensure alignment with the research scope, involving manual exclusion to achieve a focused and accurate representation of the literature relevant to the search criteria. A total of 1166 documents were manually selected and used for subsequent downstream analysis.  Fig. 1 Flow diagram of our search strategy Data analysis The dataset extracted from the Scopus search, consisting of 1166 documents, was saved in CSV format for further analysis. The authors utilized bibliometric software tools, specifically VOSviewer and the “Bibliometrix” R package software [ 35 37 38 Keywords are essential components of scholarly works, playing a crucial role in information retrieval and research endeavours [ 39 Though our interest was to evaluate the research on cancer drug repurposing over the past two decades (2005–2024), a number of our analyses in this study focused on the period 2012–2024. The year 2012 marks the beginning of a steady and progressive growth of publication in this field, which drew this focused attention.

Critical consideration was given to the field’s worldwide research trends, which included research hotspots, important contributors, conceptual development, and anticipated future research. The findings showed that knowledge in this area has advanced quickly during the past 16 years. This rate of increase (37.47%) indicates that the body of knowledge is growing gradually. The discipline is dynamic, as evidenced by the introduction of novel concepts, investigations, and deductions every year. Similarly, the international co-authorship percentage (30.62) highlights considerable global networking in generating scientific information on drug repurposing in cancer research. This figure indicates that international collaboration is responsible for at least one out of every three publications on drug repurposing in cancer research, thus increasing the variety of viewpoints, skills, and funding invested into its research. Due to their wide coverage and impact, research articles and reviews are the most common means of publishing scientific information, as reflected in the present findings. Similarly, Bali [ 27 Research interests on drug repurposing in cancer research have grown, resulting in an annual increase in publications. This increase in research is similar to what Bali [ 27 27 2 The United States and China dominated the research output and citations on drug repurposing in cancer. Likewise, the analysis by Bali [ 27 The nation of the corresponding author serves as an illustration for comprehending leadership and teamwork in the international research environment. In terms of the corresponding author’s country, the presence of China and the United States as the top countries aligns with the previous observation that China and the United States were the most cited and most productive countries. Articles fall into two categories: single-country publications (SCP), which are documents with all authors from the same nation and indicate intra-country partnership, and multiple-country publications (MCP), which are papers with contributors from various nations and symbolize inter-country exchanges [ 50 Apart from its use in analyzing worldwide networking and knowledge sharing, country co-authorship is also useful in estimating the impact and quality of research ventures. The elaborate interconnections among the countries reflect the extensive inter-country collaboration and are in line with the significant international co-authorship reported earlier. Another observation on the network map worthy of note is the size of the nodes, reflecting the total link strength. The United States and China were the dominant countries. It can be further inferred that these countries are key hubs for research linkages due to their numerous links and strong influence on drug repurposing in cancer research. Authors are usually affiliated with institutions or organizations from which they conduct their research. Thus, affiliations are useful in bibliometric analyses for evaluating research trends and institutional output in a given body of knowledge. Consequently, Sichuan University, Taipei Medical University, Wayne State University, the University of California, China Pharmaceutical University, the University of Chicago Medical Center, Yamagata University School of Medicine, and Zhengzhou University ranked high from this investigation. These affiliations are located in the countries that have significant output in drug repurposing for cancer research. This trend shows that these institutions are relevant centers for drug repurposing in cancer research funding, collaboration, and policymaking. Scientific information is usually published in sources such as journals and conference proceedings. The present study found that Cancers with a total of 46 publications was the most relevant source for drug repurposing in cancer research. 27 Cancers Cancers Cancers 51 many articles about drug repurposing in cancer research from Cancers may be due to its unique policy of accepting research with important but negative results which most journals do not allow. 52 The H-index is a metric designed to measure both the productivity and influence of sources and researchers’ academic contributions through the dual lens of publication quantity and citation impact. Specifically, a source or researcher has an H-index of h if they have published at least h papers, each of which has been cited at least h times. The relevance of influential journals in drug repurposing in cancer research varies in their number of publications and impact. Despite the large number of documents from Cancers Oncotarget Oncotarget 53 Among the most influential authors, Pantziarka P ranked high in number of publications. The study by Pantziarka P in 2021 focused on procedures for designing a functional and accessible database for cancer drug repurposing clinical trials [ 54 27 The H index compares publications and citations and uses it to analyze the performance and impact of an author [ 55 56 57 Interestingly, the significant authors have contributed to diverse aspects of research and correspondence on cancer drug repurposing within the period of their peak publication production. For instance, Bouche G [ 58 59 60 The majority of the highly cited documents were reviews, indicating an association between higher citations and review papers. We present a summary of the contributions of some of the most cited papers. To evaluate cancer drug development, Jordheim et al. [ 40 A revised picture of the tumor microenvironment was provided by Jin and Jin [ 41 The study by Corsello et al. [ 43 Furthermore, Roder and Thomson [ 44 61 Finally, Jahchan et al. [ 47 It can be deduced that the most cited studies focused on the potentials of repurposing drugs towards cancer therapy. Although these drugs might be indicated for diseases other than cancer, their mechanisms of action can be harnessed in treating cancer. This approach has the advantage of saving investments into new drug discovery, characterization, and trials, as these candidate drugs have been previously screened for efficacy and safety. Analyzing the keyword cluster is key to understanding the structure and components of knowledge in each field. The commonly appearing keywords, including drug repurposing drug repositioning antineoplastic activity drug screening drug mechanism drug delivery system antineoplastic activity antineoplastic agents human cell signal transduction metabolism drug effect Our study mapped the evolution of knowledge about drug repurposing in cancer research. The concepts noted in the basic theme included human cells apoptosis metabolism neoplasms breast cancer From 2012 to 2024, diverse topics have been the focus of research in the field of study. This diversity of research topics reflects a multidisciplinary perspective in which disciplines such as pharmacology, genetics, genomics, molecular biology, cell biology, toxicology, and biochemistry contribute to the evolution of knowledge on drug repurposing for cancer management. The presence of antineoplastic agents drug repositioning molecular dynamics molecular docking differential gene expression repurposing pantoprazole transcriptome 62 Future research directions Research advances on drug repurposing in cancer, particularly its potential to identify new effective therapeutic agents, present great prospects for expanding future investigations in this area. An important aspect of further research is the study of antineoplastic agents. Antineoplastic agents are used in cancer chemotherapy through diverse mechanisms such as targeting the impairments of signal transduction and DNA regulation [ 63 64 46 Another effort for advancing the frontiers of cancer drug repurposing research is the transwell assay. By detecting the chemotactic migration of cells via the transwell membrane, the transwell test is a proven in vitro technique for evaluating the ability of tumor cells to spread [ 65 66 68 69 Furthermore, one of the trend topics that we consider relevant for shaping the prospects of drug repurposing for cancer treatment is the use of the antacid pantoprazole. Pantoprazol which is a widely utilized proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for treatment of gastric acid-related disorders, have been demonstrated to be useful in cancer prevention by inducing cell death in a variety of tumor cell lines [ 70 71 72 73 74 Clinical safety remains a significant consideration in the practical application of pantoprazole, particularly in inpatient settings. Research has documented a low incidence of adverse effects in certain populations, yet concerns regarding potential complications such as acute interstitial nephritis, hypomagnesemia, and various gastrointestinal issues persist [ 75 76 77 78 74 79 Emerging research highlights pantoprazole’s implications in oncology, necessitating a comprehensive assessment of its pharmacokinetic characteristics, clinical safety, and interaction profiles. Future investigations should therefore be multifaceted, focusing on both the mechanistic and clinical implications of pantoprazole, paving the way for its effective utilization across a broader array of medical contexts. Further studies on pantoprazole’s repurposing in cancer treatment should examine the underlying mechanisms of its activity in relation to apoptosis and tumor microenvironment regulation, explore its use in combined treatment options, investigate its dosage and delivery routes, and assess its clinical effectiveness in treating various cancer types. Limitations Despite providing vital information about cancer drug repurposing research around the world, this study has some drawbacks. By focusing solely on the Scopus database, the study excluded many other important databases, such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, Dimensions, and Lens. While the exclusion may appear as a drawback, the Scopus database is widely considered the most reliable source for scholarly articles. However, this database might have limited access to a wider range of documents published in the subject area. This implies missing out on some relevant publication in the subject area. Moreover, the usage of English-language publications is another restriction. In light of this, the results may be skewed toward English-based authors and sources, omitting other pertinent ones. This limitation also implies that the study does not represent relevant research in this subject area from a non-English background. Future studies on cancer drug repurposing research development should address these shortcomings and lessen biases. Despite these limitations, the study’s validity and utility remain untouched, providing important information regarding the current and possible future directions of drug repurposing in cancer treatment and research globally. Conclusion Bibliometric analysis was employed to examine the yearly publications, prolific authors, prominent journals, contributing nations, popular keywords, general progress, and evolution in drug repurposing in cancer research from 2005 to 2024. This paper is the first to analyze the topic using a bibliometric approach based on the Scopus database, which provides a thorough assessment of research output in the field that includes analysis of authors, sources, documents, themes, research trends, and future research focus. 6323 authors from diverse institutions across the globe contributed to the publications analyzed in this study. With an annual rise of 37.49%, the body of knowledge is growing steadily. Furthermore, the international co-authorship percentage (30.62%) highlights significant global networking in generating scientific information on repurposing drugs for cancer treatment. The United States and China were the most productive and most cited countries, while the United States had the highest global collaboration.
