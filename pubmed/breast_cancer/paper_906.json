Unfortunately, the precise molecular mechanisms that confer resistance remain elusive so far. A remarkable feature in a multitude of breast cancers is the presence of clustered supernumerary centrosomes, which is a dysregulated condition that arises primarily through centrosome over-duplication. Normally, microtubule motor proteins (MiMos) maintain the integrity of centrosomes via Keywords Breast cancer Chemoresistance Centrosomal Dyshomeostasis Supernumerary Centrosomes Microtubule Motor Proteins Systematic Review https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001409 Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India YSS/2014/000139 YSS/2015/000025 Guha Gunjan Bhakta-Guha Dipita https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001407 Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology, India BT/PR22434/MED/30/1901/2017 BT/PR22434/MED/30/1901/2017 Guha Gunjan Bhakta-Guha Dipita pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025 Introduction Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women and, in 2020 alone, claimed around 0.685 million lives worldwide [ 1 2 3 4 7 prima facie 8 9 10 Akin to the etiology of cancer, rise of chemoresistance, in cancer cells, is a consequence of complex dysregulation of various cellular facets [ 11 12 13 15 Centrosome, present in a single copy in an non-dividing cell, is the microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) of animal cells, and is primarily responsible for cell division [ 16 17 18 1 19 NLP NEK2 PLK4 20 21 22 23 26 24 1 24 26 1  Fig. 1 Supernumerary centrosome-governed multipolar spindle formation and subsequent mitotic catastrophe are avoided by breast cancer cells via a b c An important class of regulators that maintain centrosome fidelity is the microtubule motor proteins (MiMos). Based on their directional movement, MiMos are classified into two large families: kinesins (plus end-directed) and dyneins (minus end-directed) [ 27 28 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 39 26 Proposed hypothesis MiMos play a central role in maintaining centrosome homeostasis [ 40 41 37 39 19 42 43 MiMos contribute to chemoresistance by modulating centrosomal homeostasis in breast cancers 26 Systematic review Search strategy The systematic review was conducted according to the guidelines of “preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses” (PRISMA) [ 44 45 2  ((name/alternate names of MiMo) AND (drug-resistant/drug resistance)) AND (breast cancer) ((name/alternate names of MiMo) AND (chemoresistant/chemoresistance)) AND (breast cancer) ((name/alternate names of MiMo) AND (drug sensitivity)) AND (breast cancer) Data and relevant information were extracted from the included publications, and were examined for qualitative integrity in the light of how that may affect the synthesis of results. Thereafter, results were narratively synthesized by summarizing the findings from each study in a clear and concise manner. The synthesized results were assessed to evaluate the strength of evidence relevant to this study, while acknowledging any limitations in these results. Fig. 2 Identification of relevant publications from online databases and registers for systematic review in agreement with the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Out of 39 results returned by applicable syntax search, we included 12 articles in the systematic review (after screening and elimination of duplicates and other irrelevant publications). All selection and screening criteria are enlisted Inclusion criteria Research articles with data pertinent to deregulation of MiMo expression in chemoresistant breast cancer cells and patient samples were selected for this study. Both qualitative and quantitative data on the expression profile of MiMos in chemoresistant breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer patient samples were assessed. Exclusion criteria The following results were excluded from the study: (i) Research articles about chemoresistance in other cancer types (i.e. apart from breast cancer) were excluded. (ii) Review articles commenting exclusively on MiMos, MiMo inhibitors and chemotherapy were rejected. (iii) Abstracts from conference proceedings were not included for this study. Results While CDSR did not yield any results, PubMed returned 39 hits. Following screening and exclusion (in accordance to the PRISMA criteria mentioned in Fig. 2 46 47 46 47 modus operandi Association of MiMos with chemoresistance in breast cancer In the systematic review, we determined sixteen MiMos that remain altered in chemoresistant breast cancers.

Furthermore, we established that a multitude of MiMos are directly accountable for centrosomal homeostasis. However, there is a significant dearth of knowledge regarding the connection between dysregulated MiMos and their simultaneous contribution to centrosomal anomalies and chemoresistance in breast cancers. This indicates a potential association of MiMo-governed centrosomal defects in facilitating development of resistance toward chemotherapeutics. Thus, our hypothesis that “ MiMos contribute to chemoresistance by modulating centrosomal homeostasis in breast cancers ” Publisher’s Note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.
