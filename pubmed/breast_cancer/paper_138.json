Summary Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer, associated with poor response to therapies and high mortality. We identify that phosphodiesterase 7A (PDE7A) is overexpressed in the majority of TNBCs, and a higher level of PDE7A associates with poor prognosis. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, via the transcription factor IRF1, stimulates the expression of PDE7A in TNBC cells. PDE7A inhibition attenuates TNBC growth in both cell culture and mouse models of TNBC. Inhibition of PDE7A suppresses de novo → → de novo Graphical abstract Highlights • PDE7A is overexpressed in TNBC by the PI3K/AKT→IRF1 pathway • PDE7A inhibition results in the suppression of TNBC tumor growth and metastasis • PDE7A regulates de novo • Combinatorial pharmacological targeting of PDE7A and DHODH potently inhibits TNBC Malvi et al. identify PDE7A as a driver of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tumor growth and metastasis.

Consistent with the observed overexpression of PDE7A mRNA in TNBC patients, significantly higher levels of PDE7A protein were observed in the majority of TNBC samples compared to adjacent normal breast tissues ( Figures 1 Table S1 Because our results showed PDE7A PDE7A 32 , 33 34 Figures 2 35 Figure S4 Figure S4 Figure S4 Figure 2 PI3K-AKT pathway stimulates the expression of PDE7A in TNBC cells via the transcription factor IRF1 (A) The indicated TNBC cell lines were treated with either DMSO or the PI3K inhibitor buparlisib at the indicated concentrations for 48 h.

We tested three major mechanisms by which mRNA and protein expression are typically regulated. These included transcriptional regulation, mRNA stability regulation, and protein stability regulation by ubiquitin-proteasome system. We treated TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) with DMSO or buparlisib and tested the enrichment of RNA polymerase II with Ser2-phosphorylated C-terminal domain (CTD). Recruitment of RNA pol II CTD phospho Ser2 to gene bodies reflects productive elongation and is indicative of regulation at the transcription level. 36 , 37 PDE7A Figure S4 PDE7A Figure S4 Figure S4 Therefore, we focused on transcription regulation as a primary mechanism for PDE7A overexpression in TNBC cells. We first analyzed the 1 kb promoter region of the PDE7A 38 , 39 PDE7A Figure 2 Figures 2 S5 Figures 2 S6 Figures 2 S7 IRF1 Figures 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 PDE7A inhibition blocks growth and metastatic attributes in cell culture models of TNBC We next asked if PDE7A plays a role in driving TNBC cell growth and metastatic attributes in cell culture models of TNBC. We first tested the impact of pharmacological inhibition of PDE7A on TNBC tumor and metastatic characteristics using cell culture-based assays. For this purpose, we used the PDE7A inhibitor BRL-50481. BRL-50481 is a selective, substrate-competitive PDE7 inhibitor with an half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 40 Figure S8 41 Figure S8 Figure S8 Figure S8 Figure S8 We next tested the effect of BRL-50481 treatment on the short-term survival of TNBC cells using a methylthiazole tetrazolium (MTT)-based cell viability assay. The results of the MTT assay showed that treatment with BRL-50481 significantly inhibited the viability of TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, BT-549, and MDA-MB-468) ( Figure S9 Figure S9 42 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Pharmacological PDE7A inhibition suppresses TNBC in cell culture and in mice (A) The indicated TNBC cell lines were treated with BRL-50481 (50 μM) or DMSO, and soft-agar assays were performed.

Following the treatment of TNBC cell lines with BRL-50481, we measured the invasiveness and migratory capacity using Matrigel-based invasion and wound-healing assays, respectively. BRL-50481 treatment significantly inhibited both the invasive ( Figures 3 Figures S9 Figure S10 Figures S10 Figure S10 To further strengthen these findings, we genetically knocked down the expression of PDE7A PDE7A Figure S11 Figure S11 Figures S11 PDE7A inhibition suppresses tumor growth in mouse models of TNBC Next, we assessed whether PDE7A inhibition could suppress tumor growth in vivo Figure 3 Figure 3 To further bolster the impact of our findings and increase the clinical relevance of therapeutically targeting PDE7A in TNBC, we tested the efficacy of BRL-50481 treatment in two patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of TNBC. Both TNBC PDX models (TM00096 and TM00098) expressed higher levels of PDE7A compared to hTERT-HME1 ( Figure S8 43 , 44 scid NOD ( Figure 3 PDE7A inhibition attenuates de novo We next performed experiments to determine the mechanism underlying the PDE7A inhibition-mediated suppression of TNBC cell growth. We first performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify changes in the transcriptional profiles of TNBC cells following treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with BRL-50481 and used DMSO-treated MDA-MB-231 cells as controls. RNA-seq analysis identified several differentially expressed genes ( Figure 4 Table S2 p Table S2 Figures 4 S12 Table S3 Figure 4 Pharmacological PDE7A inhibition suppresses multiple genes that encode enzymes regulating the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway in TNBC (A) Heatmap showing the top 30 upregulated and top 30 downregulated genes in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with BRL-50481 (50 μM) for 72 h compared with DMSO-treated cells ( n (B) Biological pathways that were altered in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with the PDE7A inhibitor BRL-50481 (50 μM) for 72 h compared with DMSO-treated cells based on the mRNA expression profiles identified from RNA sequencing results.

All quantitative data represent the mean ± SEM. ∗ p p Figures S12–S14 Tables S2 S3 S4 Because our RNA-seq analysis identified that PDE7A inhibition downregulated multiple genes involved in cellular biosynthetic pathways in TNBC cells, therefore, we performed a large-scale, unbiased metabolomics analysis of MDA-MB-231 cells treated with either BRL-50481 or DMSO as a control to identify metabolites that are downregulated concomitantly with the transcriptional repression of metabolic genes. Metabolomic analysis was performed using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry in two modes for cationic and anionic metabolites. We detected 287 metabolites (151 metabolites in cation mode and 136 metabolites in anion mode) ( Figures 4 S13 Table S4 Figure 4 de novo Figure 4 The de novo 45 , 46 47 , 48 , 49 . de novo DHODH CAD Figures 4 Figure S14 de novo de novo DHODH mediates the tumor-promoting effects of PDE7A in TNBC The de novo 50 51 ClinicalTrial.gov NCT03451084 NCT01992367 NCT03404726 52 , 53 , 54 Figure S14 Figures S14 Figure S14 We then asked how PDE7A promotes the expression of DHODH in TNBC cells. Since the effect was at the mRNA level, we focused on the transcription-based regulation of DHODH in TNBC cells. To identify potential regulators of DHODH downstream of PDE7A, we re-analyzed our RNA-seq data from BRL-50481-treated TNBC cells. We found that, similar to DHODH, transcription factor E2F1 was also downregulated following BRL-50481 treatment in the RNA-seq data ( Table S2 Figure S15 E2F1 E2F1 Figure S15 Figure S15 Figure S15 E2F1 E2F1 Figure S15 Figure S15 Next, we examined whether DHODH inhibition exerts similar tumor-suppressive effects on TNBC cells as those observed in response to PDE7A inhibition. We used a DHODH inhibitor BAY-2402234, which has an IC 50 55 56 Figure 5 Figures 5 Figure S16 Figure 5 Pharmacological inhibition of DHODH suppresses TNBC tumor growth (A) The indicated TNBC cell lines were treated with BAY-2402234 at the indicated concentrations for 72 h and analyzed for cell viability using the MTT assay.

Uridine supplementation rescues the effects of de novo Figure 5 We then asked whether DHODH is a downstream mediator of PDE7A function in TNBC. First, we generated a PDE7A knockout (PDE7A-KO) cell line using a CRISPR-based single guide RNA (sgRNA) in MDA-MB-231 cells ( Figure 6 Figures 6 Figure 6 Figures 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Genetic inhibition of PDE7A suppresses TNBC tumor growth in part via DHODH downregulation, and co-targeting PDE7A and DHODH potently inhibits TNBC (A) Immunoblotting for PDE7A protein expression in MDA-MB-231 cells expressing non-specific single guide RNA (NS sgRNA) or PDE7A (B) MDA-MB-231 cells expressing NS sgRNA or PDE7A-targeting sgRNA were analyzed by soft-agar assay.

Therefore, we ectopically expressed wild-type DHODH or a DHODH mutant, DHODH (R135C), that is catalytically inactive and, thus, lacks oxidoreductase activity in PDE7A-KO TNBC cells ( Figure S17 Figure S17 Figure S17 Figures S17 Figure S17 de novo Figure S17 Combinatorial targeting of PDE7A and DHODH potently suppresses TNBC tumor growth and metastasis As both BRL-50481 and BAY-2402234 inhibited TNBC in both cell culture and mouse models of TNBC, we tested whether combining BRL-50481 and BAY-2402234 could achieve even stronger suppression of TNBC tumor growth and metastasis. The rationale for combining both PDE7A and DHODH inhibitors is supported by previous studies in which targeting multiple nodes of the same cancer driver pathway has been shown to achieve better clinical outcomes. 57 , 58 , 59 , 60 Figures 6 Figure 6 61 , 62 , 63 Figure S18 Figure S18 Figures S18 We extended our studies with this combination in TNBC PDX mouse models.
