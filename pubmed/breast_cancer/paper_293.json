Recently, the role of improving thyroid-related functions through diet has been questioned. This systematic review investigates the relationship between food groups/dietary patterns and thyroid cancer. Methods We conducted a systematic search of the literature through April 2025 in the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase database following PRISMA guidelines. ORs, HRs or RRs with 95% CIs were extracted as effect sizes and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Additionally, we conducted mendelian randomization (MR) analysis by selecting dietary factors (including nutrients) associated with thyroid cancer as exposure data to complement the results of meta-analysis. Results We collected data from 16 cohort and 21 case-control studies that met the collection criteria. Meta-analysis found that high consumption of fish and alcohol-containing beverages was associated with a reduced risk of thyroid cancer, whereas consumption of high amounts of refined cereal and nitrates increased thyroid cancer risk ( P Conclusion This comprehensive study investigated the relationships between dietary factors and thyroid cancer risk, synthesizing findings from a meta-analysis of observational studies and MR analysis to estimate causal associations. Consistently, both the meta-analysis and MR analysis revealed that consumption of certain types of fish may be linked to a decreased risk of thyroid cancer.

However, in each clinical trial, various food items and different dietary patterns caused mixed effects. Meta-analysis needs to be updated for an overview of the current evidence on the association between diet factors (food groups and dietary patterns) and thyroid cancer. Besides, mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to estimate the causal effect of an exposure (diet) on an outcome (thyroid cancer) ( 10 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Search strategy This systematic review used the principles stated in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA; Supplementary File 1 11 ClinicalTrials.gov, 2.2 Eligibility criteria We included the studies that met the criteria: (1) Article assessing the relationship between food groups or dietary patterns and thyroid cancer. (2) Thyroid cancer incidence as the outcome. (3) Case-control, cohort studies or randomized controlled trials. The following exclusion criteria were applied: (1) Studies on cell-level, animal or model studies. (2) Letters, case reports, conference reports, laboratory studies, editorials and any review. 2.3 Data extraction A standardized data collection sheet was designed and created in Microsoft Excel. Two reviewers (YD and JL) performed the data extraction for all included articles. The detailed information collected from each included study was as follows: first author, year of publication, country, study design, sample sizes of cases/controls, duration of follow-up (this is appropriate for cohort studies), exposure intake of study/control groups, and potential adjustment factors ( Table 1 TABLE 1 Characteristics of the studies included in this review.

NOS evaluates the quality of the literature using the semi-quantitative principles, including selection, comparability, and exposure/outcome. Furthermore, study quality appraisal (out of 9 points) was divided into three groups: high-quality evidence (≥7 points), moderate-quality evidence (5–6 points), and low-quality evidence (4 points). If there was disagreement about the rating of a study, all authors researched the article and came to a consensus. 2.5 Statistical analysis for meta-analysis Odds ratios (ORs), hazard ratios (HRs) or risk ratios (RRs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted and merged using STATA software (v.17.0) and Review Manager (v.5.4). Random-effects model was used for all studies.

Thyroid cancer is a malignant tumor that originates from the follicular epithelial cells or parafollicular epithelial cells of the thyroid gland ( 13 Supplementary Tables 4 5 Figure 1 Supplementary File 2 FIGURE 1 Flow diagram for identification of studies and three fundamental assumptions of a MR analysis. Flowcharts depict meta-analysis and Mendelian randomization (MR) study processes. The meta-analysis flowchart shows identification, screening, and inclusion of studies. The MR flowchart outlines selection, harmonization, and analysis steps. A pyramid shows a hierarchy of foods and their effects. Another diagram illustrates the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), exposures, and thyroid-related outcomes. 2.7 SNP selection and strengthen IVs We identified SNPs closely related to exposure and outcome, to ensure that the number of SNPs shared between exposure and outcome is sufficient, with genome-wide significance ( P –6 2 Supplementary Table 6 2.8 Statistical analysis for MR analysis The inverse variance weighting (IVW), MR-Egger, and weighted median (WM) methods were used to examine a causal association, with IVW being the primary analytical method. Horizontal pleiotropy is a main source of bias in MR, whereby genetic variants influence the exposure and outcome via two separate biological pathways. The IVW method can achieve unbiased causal estimates without horizontal pleiotropy where the variants affect the direction and outcome through pathways that are not on the causal pathway of interest. Diets affect disease only when two or more statistical methods are in the same direction. If only the IVW approach yields support for the influence of a factor, and the other approaches are consistent in the direction of the beta, based on previous research. We consider this factor to be a potential influencing factor. Several sensitivity analysis were conducted to obtain stable MR estimates. The IVW and MR-Egger were utilized to quantify the heterogeneity effect among genetic instruments. Cochran’s Q test assessed heterogeneity in the IVW model. Cochran’s Q test P 3 Results 3.1 Meta-analysis 3.1.1 Search results The results of our initial screening by combining search records from all databases showed that 3 duplicate studies were removed.

The meta-analysis is based on case-control studies and cohort studies examining the relationship between specific food groups and dietary patterns and the risk of thyroid cancer. MR analysis further revealed the potential causal effects of specific foods. When assessing the causal relationship between thyroid cancer risk and dietary factors, this study emphasized temporality as a necessary condition for causal inference based on the Hill criterion. All the included studies conformed to the temporality of the Hill causal relationship. Meta-analysis shows that the intake of refined cereal (OR = 2.01) and nitrates (OR = 1.41) is significantly positively correlated with the risk of thyroid cancer. The mechanism involves hyperinsulinemia and elevated insulin-like growth factor I caused by refined carbohydrates ( 14 15 17 18 20 21 22 According to common perception, consuming fruits and vegetables is believed to have a protective effect against cancer. A previous study suggested that high consumption of raw vegetables, persimmons, and oranges may lower the risk of developing thyroid cancer and even help prevent early-stage thyroid cancer ( 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 A previous study stated that higher intake of milk and dairy products can prevent thyroid cancer ( 4 31 Nitrates inhibit the uptake of iodide by the thyroid gland, decreasing levels of T3 and T4, which increase thyroid-stimulating hormones ( 16 32 33 34 Previous researches found an increased risk of thyroid cancer has been shown to be associated with excessive intake of starch-rich foods such as refined grains, pasta or rice, bread, pastries and potatoes ( 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 Since different foods are often consumed in combination and interact with each other in complex situations in the daily diet, a more comprehensive dietary pattern provides a constructive tool for assessing the impact of diet on health ( 42 43 44 45 46 Our MR results indicated that oily fish consumption both decrease the risk of developing thyroid cancer. Prior research has shown that moderate fish consumption does not significantly elevate the risk of thyroid cancer, and may even have a beneficial effect in areas with iodine deficiency ( 47 22 48 This meta-analysis has some limitations, firstly the small number of studies pooled and combined in some food groups does not accurately reflect the true picture. Secondly, there was some variation in consumption categories among the included studies, and different exposure assessment methods can cause some bias. The data on fish research was included after a comprehensive search of published literature. However, only two studies included more than 1,000 people, while the rest were small-scale research results. More large-scale studies are needed in the future to confirm our findings. However, there are some advantages, firstly, we observed inconsistent results across different study designs, so different study designs were pooled and aggregated separately. Second, the literature search was conducted independently by other authors to minimize errors. We employed the MR design to reduce the risks of confounding and reverse causation, which are significant limitations of observational studies. However, there are some limitations associated with MR as well. Although we selected the largest sample size and the most recent GWAS datasets available for our MR analysis, the sample size and number of events in our study were relatively small compared to those in population-based studies. Due to the generally low heritability of dietary exposure, which may limit statistical efficacy, future studies need to combine high-precision metabolomics or proteomics data to improve the explanatory power of instrumental variables. This study mainly explores the long-term average effect of dietary exposure. In the future, potential threshold effects can be explored by stratified MR analysis (e.g., stratified by intake) or non-linear MR methods (e.g., quadratic model), which require a larger sample size to support. Additionally, our analysis was performed on populations with specific ancestries, which may introduce ascertainment bias. Consequently, these findings may not accurately reflect the broader population. Furthermore, the lack of demographic and detailed clinical information in the GWAS database hindered our ability to conduct subgroup analysis, limiting the depth of our insights. 5 Conclusion This study conducted a meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies to summarize the evidence for the association between specific food groups, dietary patterns, and thyroid cancer risk. We also conducted an MR analysis to investigate the relationship between specific foods and thyroid cancer. Both meta-analysis and MR analysis found that fish was associated with a reduced risk of thyroid cancer.
