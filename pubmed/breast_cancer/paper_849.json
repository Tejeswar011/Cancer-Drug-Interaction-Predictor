We aim to estimate how many children are affected by maternal cancer or cancer death and if this has changed in Finland. Patient/material and methods We used female cancers (Finnish Cancer Registry), cancer deaths, fertility rates in women and mortality rates in children (Statistics Finland) to calculate the model-based annual trend estimates of new and prevalent children under 18 years whose mother was diagnosed with cancer and new and prevalent orphans by maternal cancer type in Finland between 1968 and 2022. Results The estimated rate of children whose mother was diagnosed with cancer increased 1.3% annually since 1996. In 2022, the rates of new and prevalent children with maternal cancer were 218.4 and 1522.4 per 100,000, corresponding to 2,334 and 16,803 children. On the contrary, the estimated rate of new orphans due to maternal cancer mortality decreased 1.2% annually since 1998. In 2022, the age-standardised rates of new and prevalent orphans were 26.4 and 166.7 per 100,000 children, corresponding to 285 and 1,850 orphans due to maternal cancer mortality. Interpretation We estimated that the rate of new orphans due to maternal cancer mortality has declined over the past decades, which has benefited children. However, the increase in cancer incidence among mothers with minor children showed an opposite trend, indicating more intergenerational consequences due to cancer.

[ 8 In Finland, the age-standardised incidence of breast cancer increased 2.2% annually between 1990 and 1999. Since then, during the 2000s, this increase has begun to stabilise being 1.2% annually. Breast cancer mortality slowly increased until the early 1990s but has since declined [ 9 10 9 11 In Finland, fertility estimate statistics have been available for men only since the 1990s, so in the present study, we focus on the trends of the children with maternal cancer and not paternal cancers, also considering the overall significance of the maternal role in the childcare and development. In this study, using population-based registry rates, we aim to estimate model-based trends by cancer type in the number and rate of prevalent and new children under 18 years of age for mothers diagnosed at ages 15 to 66 and the number and rate of prevalent and new maternal orphans by cancer type for mothers who died of cancer in 1968–2022 in Finland. Material and methods The present observational study used national population-based registry rates to estimate indirect group-level model-based trends. Data for incident cancers between 1953 and 2022 were obtained from the Finnish Cancer Registry (FCR) [ 12 13 4 For estimation of the annual number of new orphans, prevalent number of orphans, the number of new children whose mother was diagnosed with cancer and prevalent number of children (aged 0–17 years) with mother ever diagnosed with cancer, we used an alternated version of the methodology introduced in Guida et al. [ 8 Supplementary File 1 8 Supplementary File 1 We reported the average number of new and prevalent children with maternal cancer and orphans due to maternal cancer and the respective average age-standardised rates per 100,000 children (using World Standard Population 2000 in 1-year age groups) for 5-year periods at the start and end of the study period for all cancers combined, in addition to 5-year periods around estimated changepoints ( Table 1 Table 2 Table 1 Estimated number of new (1968–2022) and prevalent (1970–2022) children whose mother was diagnosed with cancer or who were maternal orphans due to cancer and the corresponding age-standardised rates (World 2000, per 100.000), in 2022 and 5-year averages at the start and end of the study period and around estimated changepoints.

Maternal deaths from breast cancer were the single largest cause of new maternal orphans n n n n n Table 2 n n n Table 2 Figure 3A B Table 4 In 2022, we estimated 1,850 prevalent maternal orphans Table 1 Figure 1D prevalent annual number and rate of orphans Figure 3C D Discussion and conclusion We sought to estimate how many children in Finland are affected by maternal cancer or cancer death and if this has changed over the past decades. More specifically, we estimated the model-based trend in the number and rate of prevalent and new children whose mother was diagnosed with cancer and prevalent and new maternal orphans due to cancer mortality by cancer type in 1968–2022. The estimated rate of children whose mother was diagnosed with cancer increased 1.3% annually since 1996. On the contrary, the estimated rate of new orphans due to maternal cancer mortality decreased 1.2% annually since 1998. In Finland, the estimated number of new orphans due to maternal cancer mortality decreased almost to half during the past 50 years. Based on the FCR statistics, cancer cases among young adults remain relatively rare, but there is a noticeable increase in specific types such as skin melanoma and thyroid gland cancer in 20- to 29-year-old women since the 2000s. Women aged 30–49 years show a significant rise in breast cancer cases, the second most common cancer being skin melanoma and the third thyroid gland cancer [ 12 In our study in 2022, the rates of new and prevalent children with maternal cancer were 218 and 1,522 per 100,000, corresponding to 2,334 and 16,803 children. In 2022, the age-standardised rates of new and prevalent orphans were 26 and 167 per 100,000 children, corresponding to 285 and 1,850 orphans due to maternal cancer. The estimated rate of new orphans was comparable to earlier estimates for the year 2000 in the Northern Europe region (33 per 100,000 children) and, as expected, lower than the world estimate average (40 per 100,000 children) [ 8 Cancer incidence has increased in women by 0.8% on average per year between 1992 and 2019 in Finland. Approximately 17,600 women were diagnosed with cancer in 2022 [ 9 12 Early diagnosis and improved treatment increased 5-year age-standardised relative cancer survival of women in the 2020s compared to the 1970s in Finland, as in all Nordic Countries [ 11 Despite the increase in cancer cases among young adults, mortality rates have not risen. Advances in treatment have improved survival rates, but the treatments can be arduous and have both short-term and long-term impacts on quality of life. Cancer and cancer treatment affect working ability and income, physical functioning and sexuality and social relationships, for example marital relationship. Stressors in the family due to parental cancer may also affect children, who may not receive as much care and support due to diminished parental resources. For example, children may be obliged to be caretakers themselves in these circumstances. The estimates of this study are pertinent because parental illness and death have been shown to have long-term impacts on child’s well-being, also in high HDI countries, including Northern Europe [ 5 7 7 5 6 In Finland, population-based breast cancer screening started in 1987 for women aged 50–69 years [ 15 10 16 17 18 The future burden of cancer incidence is expected to rise in most countries over the coming decades [ 2 9 Our data have some limitations. Registries were not employed to trace actual familial relationships but served as a basis for deriving population rates employed in indirect, model-based estimation. The key advantage of this approach is the availability of pre-existing data from a long period (fertility and mortality rates from 1951 and cancer incidence and cancer mortality rates from 1953) that can be readily utilised. Population registry data in Finland has deficiencies related to individual-level familial information during the first decades of the registry, with complete registry data on parents of children available only since 1975. Therefore, our initial objective has been to examine overall long-term average time series trends from a methodological perspective. In subsequent stages, the aim is to enrich the dataset and refine the understanding of the association and interrelations of various factors using individual-level data. We did not have data on the fertility history of women with cancer, and the analyses were conducted using population data on fertility rates in Finland. We followed the methodology of Guida et al. [ 8 In conclusion, the estimated decreasing trend in cancer mortality among mothers with children under 18 years of age has benefited children and resulted in less orphans over the years. However, the increase in cancer incidence among mothers with minor children indicates the opposite trend, and more children have become affected by maternal cancer burden and its possible psychosocial consequences. This should be considered closely when applying strategies, aligned with the EU Mission for Cancer, for those affected by cancer, including their families, to live longer and better lives.
