These obstacles impede their physical, mental, and social development during adolescence, resulting in significant health vulnerabilities. Engaging in health-promoting behaviors (HPBs) can enhance their overall health and quality of life, potentially contributing to improved long-term well-being. Objective This study aimed to identify the HPBs of adolescents in child welfare institutions in Indonesia and explore the determinants influencing these behaviors using the health promotion model. Methods This study used a cross-sectional survey design. Adolescents living in welfare institutions were recruited from January 14, 2024, to February 3, 2024. After obtaining institutional review board approval, 6 research assistants visited 17 institutions in Malang and collected data from participants who provided their consent using tablet PCs that linked to the questionnaire. The variables studied included HPBs, health literacy, self-esteem, perceived barriers to action, perceived self-efficacy, and social support. Multivariate structural analysis was conducted using SPSS Statistics (version 26.0; IBM Corp) and SPSS Amos (version 26.0; IBM Corp). Results A total of 276 adolescents participated in this study. Adolescents’ HPBs differed significantly based on age group ( P P P P P P P P P P P P Conclusions To improve the HPBs of adolescents living in child welfare institutions, their self-esteem needs to be increased to further enhance their self-efficacy and social support. Careful attention and monitoring of HPBs among these adolescents may lead to better health outcomes and support their transition from child welfare institutions to the broader community. adolescents health-promoting behaviors child welfare institutions Indonesia health promotion model structural equation model pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf no pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Background Adolescents living in child welfare institutions—commonly referred to as orphanages or childcare institutions—face unique challenges that may adversely affect their overall health and well-being. These adolescents are more prone to experiencing physical, mental, and social difficulties than their peers living in family environments [ 1 2 Health-promoting behaviors (HPBs) refer to individuals’ actions and choices to improve their health and prevent the occurrence of diseases [ 3 4 5 Although HPBs have many advantages, barriers to their adoption exist for adolescents in child welfare institutions. Limited facility resources and a lack of caregiver support to fulfill adolescents’ physical and psychological needs can lead to low self-esteem and poor decision-making skills [ 6 7 This is especially true in the Indonesian context, which faces its own unique challenges. Because of family economic hardships, adolescents are placed in child welfare institutions with the expectation that they will receive better care and education than they did with their families [ 8 9 10 The health promotion model (HPM) developed by Pender and Murdaugh [ 3 Previous studies have established an explicit connection between various factors that are considered determinants of HPBs among adolescents [ 11 14 11 12 13 14 Social support also contributes to HPBs, with greater social support associated with higher levels of HPBs [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 Self-esteem as a key individual characteristic is a significant factor. Higher self-esteem reduces perceived barriers to action while simultaneously promoting greater perceived self-efficacy and social support [ 21 23 Objectives This study aimed to identify the HPBs of adolescents in child welfare institutions in Indonesia and explore the determinants influencing these behaviors using the HPM. Given the relationships between the variables reviewed, this study examined health literacy and self-esteem as components of the individual characteristic domain and perceived barriers to action, perceived self-efficacy, and social support as elements of the behavior-specific cognitions domain. The HPBs examined as behavioral outcomes in this study were health responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, positive life perspective, interpersonal relationships, stress management, and spiritual health [ 24 Methods Study Design and Setting This study used a cross-sectional design. Conducted in January 2024 and February 2024, this study took place in Malang, Indonesia. First, convenience sampling was used to select the child welfare institutions in Malang. A total of 17 child welfare institutions agreed to participate in this study. Inclusion criteria for this study were adolescents aged 13 to 18 years who had been living in child welfare institutions for at least 6 months and were willing to participate. Adolescents with developed mental or physical disabilities were excluded. The sample size estimation for SEM is flexible. Several rules of thumb are commonly used, such as 10 cases per variable, 5 or 10 observations per estimated parameter, and a minimum sample size of 100 to 200 [ 25 26 27 28 29 Six research assistants collected data from participants. These assistants were third- and fifth-semester undergraduate nursing students who had completed the pediatric nursing theory and clinical practicum courses. The principal investigator provided instructions on the study’s purpose and managed the link to the questionnaire and other relevant procedures. During data collection, research assistants visited the institutions and presented the questionnaire to participants using tablets or notebooks, allowing them to complete the survey via the KoboToolbox platform. In addition, when participants needed help understanding any question, research assistants provided individualized explanations. Participants were given sufficient time to provide their answers, and completing the questionnaires took approximately 45 minutes. Before the answers were submitted online, the research assistants verified that no responses were missing. Of the 280 adolescents who participated, 4 (1.4%) were excluded because they selected identical responses to every question. The final analysis included 276 participants. Ethical Considerations The institutional review board of the Institute of Technology, Science, and Health RS Dr Soepraoen in Malang, Indonesia, approved this study (approval KEPK-EC-10/XII/2023). As adolescents are a vulnerable group requiring guardian consent for participation, the heads of the child welfare institutions provided written consent for the study, and all participants were asked to provide assent before data collection. The researchers ensured the privacy and confidentiality of participant data by not recording personal identifiers and by storing data in password-protected web-based storage accessible only to the research team. Participants who completed the questionnaire received a souvenir and a lunch box with an equivalent value of approximately US $1.50. General Participant Demographics Demographic information about the participants included age (in years), sex (male or female), educational level (primary school, junior high school, senior high school, or undergraduate), orphan status (maternal orphan, paternal orphan, double orphan, or not orphan), and duration of residence in child welfare institutions (in years). In addition, the accreditation level of the child welfare institutions was recorded. Indonesian child welfare institutions receive accreditation ratings of A (excellent), B (good), or C (satisfactory) or are unaccredited, reflecting varying levels of compliance with national standards for child welfare services. Higher ratings indicate a greater capacity to provide quality care within an institution. HPB Measurement In this study, HPBs refer to actions taken by adolescents to maintain and improve their health within the environment of a child welfare institution. The Adolescent Lifestyle Profile–Revised 2 [ 30 never sometimes often always Health Literacy Measurement Health literacy refers to adolescents’ ability to seek, understand, evaluate, and use health information to make informed decisions about their health.

The Self-Rated Abilities for Health and Practices Scale–Adolescent Version [ 35 cannot do at all a little somewhat mostly certainly can do Social Support Measurement Social support refers to the emotional, instrumental, appraisal, and informational support that adolescents receive from caregivers, peers, and friends to help them engage in HPBs. The original Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale for Healthy Behaviors [ 36 never always not important very important Translation Process Among the instruments, the following 5 questionnaires—the Adolescent Lifestyle Profile–Revised 2, Health Literacy Assessment Scale for Adolescents, Barriers to Health-Promoting Activities Scale, Self-Rated Abilities for Health and Practices Scale–Adolescent Version, and Child and Adolescent Social Support Scale for Healthy Behaviors—were translated into Indonesian using forward and backward translation techniques before use [ 37 Statistical Analysis SPSS Statistics (version 26.0; IBM Corp) was used to conduct descriptive analyses of variables, internal consistency tests, independent 2-tailed t The determinants of HPBs among adolescents living in child welfare institutions were identified using SEM. In this study, 6 variables included in the model were observed variables with a single indicator. The 2 exogenous variables—health literacy and self-esteem—served as independent variables (predictors) of the other observed variables in the model. The 4 endogenous variables included perceived barriers to action, perceived self-efficacy, social support, and HPBs. HPBs were identified as the outcome of the model, whereas perceived barriers to action, perceived self-efficacy, and social support were identified as mediators between the exogenous variables and HPBs.

Most (155/276, 56.2%) were aged 13 to 15 years, with a mean age of 15.3 (SD 1.7) years. In addition, 43.1% (119/276) were in senior high school, whereas 42.8% (118/276) were in junior high school. Approximately half (141/276, 51.1%) of the participants were not orphans, and 60.9% (168/276) had been living in child welfare institutions for 1 to 3 years, with a mean duration of 3.4 (SD 2.5) years.

It primarily found significant differences in adolescents’ HPBs based on age group, educational level, duration of stay in child welfare institutions, and the accreditation level of the institutions. Older adolescents and those with higher educational levels demonstrated better HPBs, which may be attributed to greater responsibility and autonomy [ 39 Through the SEM analysis, this study found that perceived self-efficacy and social support together accounted for 47.9% of adolescents’ HPBs. HPBs are key to happiness and a good quality of life, and self-efficacy increases HPBs at every stage of life [ 40 4 This study challenges existing frameworks by highlighting that perceived barriers to action were not significant to HPBs in this context, providing insights into the unique needs of these adolescents. This finding aligns with findings from Thailand [ 41 Interestingly, health literacy did not correlate with perceived self-efficacy in this study. This finding differs from those of studies conducted in Australia, China, Turkey, and Germany, which found a positive correlation between health literacy and adolescent self-efficacy [ 18 42 In addition, this study identified the link between self-esteem, social support, and perceived self-efficacy and HPBs, a connection that has emerged in recent literature on this unique population. It may provide a foundation for health professionals to develop interventions that address HPBs by improving self-esteem and enhancing social support for targeted adolescents such as those in this study. Comparison With Prior Work No previous studies—to our knowledge—have examined HPBs among adolescents living in child welfare institutions. Much of the existing research has focused on healthy adolescent populations, with studies conducted in Turkey [ 43 44 45 46 This study found that self-esteem had a significant indirect effect on HPBs through perceived self-efficacy and social support. This supports previous studies indicating that higher self-esteem improves perceived self-efficacy, which is crucial for problem-solving and adopting HPBs [ 47 48 49 50 This study also found that only self-esteem showed a significant positive correlation with social support and self-efficacy and indirectly affected HPBs. Higher self-esteem leads to more active social engagement, thereby increasing perceived social support [ 51 52 Furthermore, self-esteem was found to be moderate in this study, which is consistent with previous research indicating that adolescents living in child welfare institutions generally exhibit low to moderate levels of self-esteem [ 53 This study also confirmed that social support is positively correlated with perceived self-efficacy, which helps reduce perceived barriers to action. These findings align with those of a study from the United States that showed that higher perceived self-efficacy reduces perceived barriers to physical activity—a component of HPBs [ 54 The key finding of this study was the nuanced relationship between health literacy and HPBs among adolescents in child welfare institutions. Surprisingly, health literacy did not significantly influence perceived self-efficacy or social support, suggesting that the structured environment of these institutions provided consistent information and support, reducing reliance on individual health literacy. In addition, adolescents are still in the process of developing their health-related knowledge, and the lack of health education interventions within child welfare institutions may limit the impact of health literacy on their ability to benefit from social support. However, lower health literacy significantly increased perceived barriers to action, indicating that, even within a supportive environment, understanding health information is crucial for overcoming challenges. The structured environment of the institutions mitigated the negative impact of these perceived barriers to HPBs, suggesting that consistent support and resources can buffer the effects of perceived obstacles. These findings underscore the need for interventions that enhance health literacy, empowering adolescents to overcome barriers while leveraging the supportive nature of structured environments in child welfare institutions to promote healthier behaviors and improve adolescents’ overall well-being. Clinical and Policy Implications The findings of this study highlight the need for policies specific to the improvement of HPBs in adolescents living in child welfare institutions in Indonesia. The large number of unrecorded child welfare institutions hinders the provision of nursing interventions to these children and adolescents. Coordination between the Ministry of Social Affairs and Ministry of Health is essential, starting with data collection from child welfare institutions and regular monitoring of the health and welfare of children in these institutions. This will enable health professionals to provide optimal health services and interventions for these adolescents. While school-based interventions are often considered effective, a review found that these interventions were insufficient for improving HPBs [ 55 It has also been suggested to extend interventions beyond the school setting into the home [ 55 poskestren Study Limitations Despite our best efforts, a few limitations exist in this study. First, convenience sampling methods were used in a single city, so generalizing the findings should be done with caution. Second, this study had a cross-sectional design, which requires careful interpretation of causality as bidirectional relationships between variables may exist. Therefore, we encourage future studies to use a longitudinal design to gain a deeper understanding of HPBs among adolescents living in child welfare institutions over time. Third, because half of the participants had at least one parent, social support from parents—which was not assessed—may have influenced the level of social support they received. Therefore, we suggest that future studies assess social support from parents and its potential impact on HPBs. Fourth, exploratory factor analysis was conducted; however, no confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on the translated instruments, which may have impacted the validity of the measures. Finally, although the research assistants were trained to ensure consistent interpretation of the instruments, periodic meetings were not held to calibrate interpretations or address issues that arose during data collection. This may have affected the reliability and accuracy of the data collection process. Conclusions On the basis of the HPM and testing using SEM analysis, both perceived self-efficacy and social support directly affected HPBs, whereas self-esteem indirectly affected HPBs among adolescents in child welfare institutions in Indonesia. In addition, health literacy only influenced perceived barriers to action, but these perceived barriers to action did not contribute to HPBs. The key findings of our study contribute to the development of health interventions aimed at improving self-efficacy and social support by enhancing self-esteem, ultimately leading to increased HPBs among adolescents living in child welfare institutions in Indonesia. We hope that these interventions will lead to improved health outcomes and quality of life for these individuals as they transition into adulthood and move from child welfare institutions to the broader community.
