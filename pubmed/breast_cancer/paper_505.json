In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of published data to systematically assess the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy for stage III NSCLC. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted on the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases from January, 2000 to September, 2024 to identify studies concentrated on neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy followed by surgery for treating stage III NSCLC. The effectiveness and safety data were collected for meta-analysis. Study endpoints included resection rate, major pathological response (MPR), pathological complete response (pCR), objective response rate (ORR), treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), severe adverse events (SAEs). Data analysis was conducted using R 4.1.3 software, and P Results A total of 1043 patients from 22 studies were included in this meta-analysis, of whom 892 cases underwent surgery. The pooled MPR rate, pCR rate, and ORR rate were 65%, 38%, and 73%, respectively. The pooled incidence of TRAEs was 84% and the pooled incidence of SAEs was 13%. The results of the subgroup analysis showed that nivolumab- and pembrolizumab-based neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy showed a higher MPR rate (nivolumab 69%, pembrolizumab 68%) and pCR rate (nivolumab 51%, pembrolizumab 38%) than other immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Conclusion Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy demonstrates clinical benefits for patients with stage III NSCLC.

The number of deaths from lung cancer surpasses the combined fatalities from breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers [ 1 2 3 Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 30% of the entire lung cancer patients, including stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC. It is a heterogeneous disease that includes lymph node nonmetastatic disease (T4N0), supraclavicular lymph node metastatic disease (N3), and multifocal primary disease (T3, T4), and 5-year overall survival (OS) rate is only 13–36% [ 4 5 6 7 In recent years, the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized the treatment landscape of advanced NSCLC, increasing the 5-year OS rate of advanced NSCLC from less than 5% to about 20% [ 8 9 Several studies have already attempted to use neoadjuvant immunotherapy in resectable NSCLC patients to reduce the risk of postoperative recurrence and improve overall survival (OS). In 2018, Forde et al. [ 10 11 10 12 The benefit of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in resectable NSCLC patients stems from the fact that this approach promotes the release of neoantigens before the primary tumor is surgically removed. This addresses the issue of intrinsic resistance to single-agent immunotherapy and ultimately can lead to the clearance of micrometastatic lesions. Furthermore, postoperative adjuvant immunotherapy helps to eliminate residual micro-metastases after surgery. This strategy holds promise for reducing recurrence and extending survival, thereby increasing the cure rate and benefiting resectable NSCLC patients. Based on the aforementioned principles, neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy holds promise for benefiting patients with locally advanced NSCLC. A real-world study conducted by Deng et al. [ 13 14 P P Although previous meta-analyses comparing neoadjuvant immunotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer have been published [ 15 16 Methods Protocol and registration This study was registered in PROSPERO with the registration number CRD42023409633, and was conducted in adherence to the registered protocol (Version 2.0; updated 14 July 2025). This review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) statement, made of 27 items based on the Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Review (MECIR) standards. Literature search The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched to include the research literature on neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy followed by surgery treating stage III NSCLCs from January 1, 2000 to September 1, 2024. The English search terms were as follows: (“Lung cancer”) And (“surgery” or “peroperative procedures\"or “resectable” or “unresectable”) And (“neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy” or “neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy” or “ICIs plus chemotherapy\"or “ICIs” or “chemotherapy”). Literature screening Criteria for inclusion: according to PICOS criteria: (a) participants: patients diagnosed with stage III NSCLC; (b) interventions: neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy before surgery; (c) controls: there was no restriction on whether to establish a control group; (d) outcomes: baseline characteristics and primary endpoints of the enrolled population, such as MPR rate, pCR rate, surgical resection rate, and adverse event (AE); (e) Study design: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs), cohort studies, and meeting abstracts of clinical trials with clearly described primary endpoint; (f) Relevant articles may also be enrolled if they contain I-IV stage NSCLCs, but full-text data are available for independent pCR and MPR data in stage III NSCLCs. Criteria for exclusion: (a) Studies in which patients treated with immunotherapy alone or dual immunotherapy, chemotherapy alone, concurrent or sequential radiotherapy and other therapies other than chemoimmunotherapy; (b) Studies not reporting effectiveness and safety data; (c) Duplicate studies. Literature search and data extraction were performed by two evaluators, and any disagreement was resolved by consensus. Data extraction Two evaluators extracted primary data from the selected studies and checked for consistency. Data were extracted using standard forms: (I) Study characteristics: study origin (authors and year), study design (NCT number and study phase); (II) Patient characteristics: study population, median age and range, percentage of males; (III) Neoadjuvant strategy (neoadjuvant specific regimen and treatment cycles); (IV) Study endpoints: (a) Pathological and radiological endpoints: MPR, pCR, objective response rate (ORR). According to the RECIST criteria, radiological responses include complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD). The ORR is defined as the proportion of patients achieving CR or PR among the total number of evaluable cases. (b) Treatment-related adverse effects: treatment-related adverse events(TRAEs)and severe adverse events (SAEs); (c) Down-staging rate, R0 resection rate. Quality assessment The quality of the selected studies was assessed using the MINOR tool, which including the following: (a) A clearly stated aim; (b) Inclusion of consecutive patients; (c) Endpoint appropriate to the study aim; (d) Unbiased assessments of endpoints; (e) Follow-up period appropriate to the major endpoints; (f) Loss to follow up not exceeding 5%; (g) Prospective calculation of the study size. Quality control and consensus views were also performed by two independent evaluators. Statistical analysis Single group rate meta-analysis requires extraction of sample size and number of events from the original study. Meta-analysis was performed using the Metaprop package in R-4.1.3 software. The effect size was the 95% confidence interval (CI) for all combined incidence rates. The test of homogenous was considered significant when the I 2 P Results Study selection The initial search strategy retrieved 5107 records from the above mentioned four databases. After removing of duplicates, 3934 records were left for deep review. Subsequently, 41 studies underwent full-text review according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, 22 studies compromising 1,043 patients were selected for further analyses [ 12 14 17 35 1 S1 Fig. 1 Flow chart of literature search and study selection Study characteristics Of all studies, 10 studies were prospective phase 2 non-randomized controlled trials [ 12 17 25 14 26 13 19 27 34 19 30 13 27 29 31 34 35 1  Table 1 Characteristics of included studies Study Study characteristics Patient characteristics Tumor characteristics Year Study design NCT number Phase Median age [range](years) Male No.[%] stage Neoadjuvant regimen Neoadjuvant cycle Tianxiang Chen[ 27 2022 Retrospective study NR NR 61[55.25–66.75] 9[75] IIIA-IIIB Carboplatin + Paclitaxel + Pembrolizumab/Nivolumab 4 Hongsheng Deng[ 13 2022 Retrospective study NR NR 58.1[± 6.5] 29[57] IIIB Paclitaxel + platin-based chemotherapy + Sintilimab NR Hongyan Xu[ 32 2022 Retrospective study NR NR 68[NR] 14[100] IIIA-IIIB Nab-PTX + nedplatin + PD-1 inhibirors 2–4 Zerui Zhao[ 23 2021 Prospective clinical trial NCT04304248 2 61[56–66] 27[81.8] IIIA-IIIB Carboplatin + nab-Paclitaxel/pemetrexed + Toripalimab 3 Yulong Chen[ 28 2021 Retrospective study NR NR 62.17[43–72] 29[83] IIIA/IIIB Cisplatin + paclitaxel/pemetrexed + Pembrolizumab 2 ChaoSun[ 20 2023 Prospective clinical trial NCT04326153 2 56.85[± 8.85] 18[90] IIIA/IIIB Nab-paclitaxel + carboplatin + Sintilimab 2–3 HengyanZhai[ 33 2022 Retrospective study NR NR 63[56–73] 26[56.5] IIIA/IIIB Paclitaxel + carboplatin + Nivolumab 3 Guangyin Zhao[ 34 2023 Retrospective study NR NR 65[42–74] 22[88] III carboplatin/cisplatin + pemetrexed/nab-paclitaxel + Pembrolizumab 2–3 Mariano Provencio[ 12 2020 Prospective clinical trial NCT03081689 2 63[58–70] 34[74] IIIA Carboplatin + paclitaxel + Nivolumab 3 DIjian Shen[ 19 2021 Prospective study NR NR NR 32[94] IIB-IIIB Nab-paclitaxel + carboplatin + Pembrolizumab 2 Liang Shi[ 29 2022 Retrospective study NR NR NR 39[85] IIA-IIIB Platin-based chemotherapy + PD-L1inhibitors 2–4 Sacha I Rothschild[ 18 2021 Prospective clinical trial NCT02572843 2 61[41–74] 35[52] IIIA Cisplatin + docetaxel + Durvalumab 3 Jiangfeng Wang[ 30 2021 Prospective study NR NR 62.2[42–76] 66[91.7] IIIA Nab-paclitaxel + Carboplatin + PD-1 inhibitos 2 Peng Zhang[ 21 2022 Prospective clinical trial ChiCTR1900023758 2 64.84[± 9.61] 44[88] IIIA Carboplatin + gemcitabine/pemetrexed + Sintilimab 2–4 Xinsheng Zhu[ 24 2022 Prospective clinical trial ChiCTR1900024014 2 NR 39[85] II-III Carboplatin + pemetrexed/gecitabine + paclitaxel + Toripalimab 2 Y.Zhang[ 22 2021 Prospective clinical trial NCT04144608 2 57[41–70] 13[86.7] IIIA-IIIB Carboplatin/cisplatin + nab-paclitaxel/pemetrexed + Toripalimab 2–4 ShunLu[ 14 2024 Randomized clinical trial NCT04158440 NR 62[56–65] 181[89.6] III Toripalimab + chemotherapy 3 Mariano Provencio[ 17 2022 Prospective clinical trial NCT03838159 2 65[58–70] 36[63] IIIA-IIIB Nivolumab + chemotherapy NR J.Lei[ 26 2023 Randomized clinical trial NCT04338620 2 61[54–65] 74[84.1] IIIA-IIIB Camrelizumab + albumin-bound paclitaxel and cisplatin 3 Ying Wang[ 31 2023 Retrospective study NR NR 67[62–71] 65[100] IIIA-IIIB Immunotherapy + platinum + paclitaxel 2–4 Jianzhen Shan[ 25 2024 Prospective clinical trial NCT05024266 2 65[48–70] 35[100] IIIA-IIIB Tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy (albumin-bound paclitaxel and carboplatin) 2–4 SihaoZhou[ 35 2023 A real-world cohort study NR NR NR 24[92.4] IIIA-IIIB PD-1 monoclonal antibody + platinum-based doublet chemotherapy 2–4 NR NCT The efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy This meta-analysis enrolled 1043 patients with stage III NSCLC, 892 of whom underwent surgery.

( A B Sensitivity analysis The subgroup analyses data suggested that different ICI types were one of the main sources of heterogeneity. Subsequently, to ensure that the combined results were not severely swayed by certain trials, we performed sensitivity analyses for studies within subgroups of different ICI types. As shown in Fig. S3 17 2 2 S4 34 2 Discussion Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers, with incidence and mortality rate ranking first among malignant tumors [ 1 2 3 36 The mechanism of immunotherapy lies in increasing the presentation of tumor antigens before surgery, thereby promoting T-cell expansion and activating the immune system to clear micrometastases. Post-surgery, it enhances the clearance of residual tumor cells, improving recurrence-free survival. Based on this, numerous studies have shown that neoadjuvant immunotherapy can significantly increase the pCR rate and MPR rate in both resectable and unresectable NSCLC patients. Building on the aforementioned studies, this study conducted a meta-analysis and clinical data validation of the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy in locally advanced stage III NSCLC. The meta-analysis included a total of 22 studies, which showed that for stage III NSCLC patients who underwent surgery after downstaging with neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, the MPR rate and pCR rate were 65% and 38%, respectively. These rates are higher than those found in Jiang’s meta-analysis [ 15 37 Furthermore, regarding the safety of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, the pooled incidence of surgical complications in this meta-analysis was 17%, which is lower than 18.9% reported by Sa Ge [ 16 15 15 However, heterogeneity cannot be ignored in this meta-analysis. Therefore, we further conducted a subgroup analysis. The results demonstrated that different ICI types are a main source of heterogeneity. Nivolumab- and pembrolizumab-based neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy showed a higher MPR rate, pCR rate and resection rate than other ICIs, similar to Jiang’s [ 15 PD-L1 TPS is a well-recognized biomarker for response to ICIs based on abundant clinical research data [ 38 P n n This meta-analysis still has some limitations. Firstly, the included studies comprise single-arm clinical trials and retrospective studies, with a relatively low level of evidence. Furthermore, since only 2 of the 22 included studies were RCTs and the follow - up period was relatively short, data on survival outcomes were limited. The pooled PFS and OS data were not available. Updated OS data would be valuable for further evaluation of patient benefits. Conclusions Locally advanced stage III NSCLC patients can achieve greater pathological responses and clinical benefits through neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy, with an acceptable safety profile. Therefore, neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy holds promise for offering the possibility of curative surgery and prolonging survival in patients with locally advanced stage III NSCLC.
