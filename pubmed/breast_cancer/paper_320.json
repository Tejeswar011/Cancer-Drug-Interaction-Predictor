Cancer Science https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ This is an open access article under the terms of the http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/ ABSTRACT The nucleolus, a prominent membrane‐less nuclear compartment, is organized around ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene (rDNA) clusters, known as nucleolar organizing regions (NORs), located on the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes. It serves as the primary site for ribosome biogenesis, an energy‐intensive process crucial for cell growth and proliferation. This involves RNA polymerase I (Pol I)‐mediated transcription of 47S precursor rRNA (pre‐rRNA), pre‐rRNA processing, and ribosomal subunit assembly, reflected in its tripartite structure maintained by liquid–liquid phase separation. Recent evidence indicates that only about 30% of nucleolar proteins are exclusively involved in ribosome production. The remaining proteome participates in diverse cellular functions, establishing the nucleolus as a multifunctional organelle. It functions as a critical stress sensor and signaling hub, responding to various intracellular insults such as nutrient starvation, DNA damage, and viral infection. Many chemotherapeutic agents also induce the response called nucleolar stress via disruption of the nucleolar structure or function, potentially leading to rDNA instability. Nucleolar stress frequently leads to dynamic transition of nucleolar proteins, inducing nucleolar reorganization. Of these, the stress induced by transcriptional changes leads to the unique nucleolar structures termed nucleolar caps and nucleolar necklaces. In this review, we summarize the recent findings about the molecular mechanism of nucleolar changes upon stresses and discuss the possible relationship between rDNA instability and cancer. In this review, we provide an overview of the research field on nucleolar regulation, mainly focusing on nucleolar organization under transcriptional stress. We also highlight the importance of ribosomal DNA stability, particularly in disease prevention, including cancer. cancer liquid–liquid phase separation nucleolus rDNA stability transcriptional stress Japan Society for the Promotion of Science 10.13039/501100001691 23H04274 25H00990 Sumitomo Foundation 10.13039/100008608 Naito Foundation 10.13039/100007428 Nakajima Foundation Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development 10.13039/100009619 JP25gm6710010 Astellas Foundation for Research on Metabolic Disorders 10.13039/501100007263 Asian Young Scientist Fellowship pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  Funding: Abbreviations 53BP1 p53‐binding protein 1 AMD Actinomycin D ATM ataxia telangiectasia mutated ATR activating ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3‐related protein BRCA1 breast cancer gene 1 CHK1 check point kinase 1 CHK2 check point kinase 2 CITI Condensates Induced by Transcription Inhibition CtIP carboxy‐terminal binding protein (CtBP) interacting protein DDR DNA damage response DFC dense fibrillar component DJ distal junction DRB 5,6‐Dichlorobenzimidazole 1‐β‐D‐Ribofuranoside DSB double‐strand break DYRK1B dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 1B ETS external transcribed spacer FBL fibrillarin FC fibrillar center GC granular component HR homologous recombination IGS intergenic spacer ITS internal transcribed spacer LLPS liquid–liquid phase separation MRE11 meiotic recombination 11 homolog 1 MST2 mammalian sterile‐20‐like kinase 2 NBS1 Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein 1 NCL nucleolin ncRNA non‐coding RNA n‐DDR nucleolar‐DNA damage response NEAT1 nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 NHEJ non‐homologous end joining NONO non‐POU domain containing octamer binding NOR nucleolar organizing region NPM1 nucleophosmin PH perinucleolar heterochromatin PJ proximal junction Pol I RNA polymerase I Pol II RNA polymerase II RAD51 radiation sensitive protein 51 rDNA ribosomal DNA RPA2 Replication protein A2 rRNA ribosomal RNA SETX senataxin SFPQ splicing factor proline and glutamine rich snoRNA small nucleolar RNA snoRNP small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein TAF15 TATA‐box binding protein associated factor 15 TCOF1 treacle biogenesis factor1 TOPBP1 DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1 UBF upstream binding factor UFL1 UFM1 specific ligase 1 XRCC4 X‐ray repair cross complementing 4 1 Introduction: rDNA The foundation of the nucleolus lies in the nucleolar organizing regions (NORs), which are clusters of tandemly repeated rRNA genes [ 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 3 1 3 8 1 3 4 1 2 5 8 FIGURE 1 Schematic representation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in human. The rRNA gene array is located at the nucleolar organizer regions (NORs). It is positioned between telomeres and centromeres on the short arms (p‐arms) of the acrocentric chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 in humans. They are flanked by heterochromatic distal and proximal junctions (DJ and PJ, respectively). Each ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeat unit consists of an intergenic spacer (IGS) and a transcribed region encoding the 47S pre‐rRNA, which is further processed into the mature 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs. The coding region is flanked by external transcribed spacers (5′ ETS and 3′ ETS), and rDNA genes are separated by internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2). The IGS includes the promoter for rDNA transcription. The nucleolus is considered a biomolecular condensate formed through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), creating distinct, immiscible sub‐compartments without a membrane [ 9 10 2 1 5 11 12 1 5 12 2 13 14 15 2 1 11 10 16 17 2 11 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 FIGURE 2 Nucleolar organization and its function. The overall structure of the mammalian nucleolus consists of the internal fibrillar center (FC), dense fibrillar component (DFC), and granular component (GC), all of which are surrounded by condensed perinucleolar heterochromatin (PH). RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcribes the rRNA genes to form 47S pre‐rRNA at the FC‐DFC border. The transcription factor upstream binding factor (UBF) and Treacle (TCOF1) are required for rDNA transcription. In the DFC, pre‐rRNA is further processed and modified to produce the mature 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs. The DFC contains small nucleolar ribonucleoproteins (snoRNPs), Fibrillarin (FBL), and Nucleolin (NCL). In the GC, pre‐40S and pre‐60S are assembled and exported to the nucleoplasm. The GC harbors nucleophosmin (NPM1). 2 Nucleolar Reorganization and Dynamics in Response to Transcriptional Stress The nucleolus has been emerging as a critical sensor and integrator of cellular stress, frequently targeted by various classes of chemotherapeutic agents [ 5 8 28 29 30 3 5 26 27 FIGURE 3 Nucleolar reorganization upon transcriptional stress. Upon Pol I inhibition, rDNA together with proteins of the FC and DFC sub‐compartments moves to the nucleolar periphery, forming nucleolar caps. Upon Pol II inhibition, the GC is disrupted and the FC and DFC modules are unraveled, forming CITIs and/or nucleolar necklaces. 2.1 Pol I Inhibition The response observed upon inhibition of Pol I using compounds like Actinomycin D (AMD), CX‐5461, or BMH‐21 is a profound spatial reorganization categorized as nucleolar segregation [ 5 31 3 5 3 32 33 34 35 36 Single molecule tracking experiments showed that RPA194, a component of Pol I, which forms relatively immobile clusters with UBF in the FCs likely through engagement with rDNA during transcription under unperturbed conditions, dissociates from the rDNA chromatin and transitions to rapid, liquid‐like diffusion within the newly formed nucleolar cap droplet upon Pol I inhibition [ 37 38 39 40 2.2 Pol II The inhibition of Pol II transcription by chemicals, such as α‐amanitin or CDK7/9 inhibitors including DRB, THZ1, and AZD4573, induces nucleolar reorganization patterns that differ markedly from the nucleolar caps formed upon Pol I inhibition [ 5 41 42 41 42 43 3 5 42 42 A mechanism of the nucleolar reorganization upon Pol II inhibition was thought to be based on the downregulation of the snoRNAs, which are essential for 3′ rRNA processing [ 44 45 46 45 Another key discovery associated with Pol II inhibition is the formation of novel nucleolar condensates termed CITIs (Condensates Induced by Transcription Inhibition) [ 47 42 3 The Molecular Mechanism of rDNA In a decade, numerous studies using CRISPR/Cas9 and restriction enzymes I‐ Ppo Asi 48 49 4 FIGURE 4 The nucleolar DNA damage response (n‐DDR). In the left panel, upon the presence of persistent rDNA double‐strand breaks (DSBs) in the nucleolus, the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase is activated and phosphorylates TCOF1. The MRN complex, consisting of Nijmegen breakage syndrome protein 1 (NBS1), meiotic recombination 11 homolog 1 (MRE11), and the DNA repair protein RAD50, is recruited to the nucleolus through the interaction between NBS1 and phospho‐TCOF1. Phosphorylated TCOF1 recruits DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1 (TOPBP1), activating the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3‐related protein (ATR) kinase to elicit transcription silencing. UFL1 involves transcription silencing via TCOF1 modifications. In the right panel, transcription silencing elicits the nucleolar cap formation. The nucleolar caps include the homologous recombination (HR) factors: Breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1), replication protein A2 (RPA2), carboxy‐terminal binding protein interacting protein (CtIP), and radiation sensitive protein 51 (RAD51). ATM, ATR, the MRN complex, the phosphorylated form of the histone variant H2AX (γH2AX), and p53‐binding protein 1 (53BP1) are clustered at nucleolar caps. The n‐DDR pathway is initiated by activating the ATM kinase upon DSB induction in rDNA, where ATM phosphorylates TCOF1 [ 50 51 52 50 51 52 53 50 54 55 52 53 53 56 57 Transcriptional silencing by n‐DDR often leads to the nucleolar cap formation similar to the treatment with the Pol I inhibitors. This process also requires the ATM/ATR signaling and is mediated by factors including TCOF1 and TOPBP1 (Figure 4 52 53 52 53 54 As with DSBs in the nucleoplasm in human cells, DSBs in rDNA are also repaired by NHEJ or HR, but the pathway choice is potentially influenced by the rDNA damage persistence and nucleolar structure [ 48 49 Ppo 58 Ppo 4 36 52 53 58 59 36 53 Asi 36 52 53 60 59 4  rDNA rDNA loci represent genomic instability in oncogenesis, exhibiting a high frequency of structural alterations [ 61 62 63 64 65 39 66 5 8 Furthermore, compromised DNA repair capabilities, a frequent hallmark of neoplastic cells, exert a considerable influence on rDNA integrity. This is explained in monogenic disorders such as Bloom Syndrome and Ataxia‐telangiectasia, where mutations in the BLM and ATM, respectively, lead to a profound cancer predisposition accompanied by the marked rDNA instability [ 67 68 These underline that the rDNA instability exhibited in cancer cells provides an attractive target for cancer therapy [ 8 30 30 69 70 8 71 2 47 5 Conclusion The nucleolus and its constituent rDNA are far more than mere ribosome factories; they represent a highly dynamic nexus for sensing and responding to cellular stress, orchestrating intricate reorganizations and specialized DNA damage responses. These responses mediated by nucleoli are crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing diseases. However, this field is still in its infancy. The mechanisms of each nucleolar stress response remain poorly understood. We expect that future research will elucidate these mechanisms and hope that the findings will 1 day contribute to the development of therapies for diseases associated with nucleolar stress and the creation of anticancer drugs targeting the nucleolar stress pathways.
