By examining the brain penetration and spatial distribution of drug candidates in animal models, we can gain valuable insights into their potential for clinical success. In this study, we used multimodal imaging alongside complementary analytical methods to assess the brain distribution of two clinically advanced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors—niraparib and olaparib—across three preclinical models: healthy brain (nonhuman primates (NHPs)), primary brain tumors (mouse glioblastoma), and metastatic brain tumors (mouse breast cancer metastasis). The results suggest that niraparib has a superior ability (relative to olaparib) to penetrate the BBB, distribute widely throughout the brain, and accumulate in brain tumor lesions. These findings support further studies of niraparib as a potential treatment for tumors in the human brain.

Survival outcomes in patients with glioblastoma - the most common primary malignant brain tumor - are poor, with a 5-year relative survival rate of only 6.8% 1 2 3 4 5 To assess brain drug distribution, the unbound brain-to-plasma partition coefficient (K p, uu, brain 6 7 8 p, uu, brain 6 7 Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is a stress sensor that plays a key role in DNA repair by responding to damage including single-strand breaks (SSBs) and activating the DNA repair machinery. In tumor cells with defects in the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway – most notably those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations – inhibition/disruption of PARP-mediated repair of SSBs results in the accumulation of DNA damage and ultimately cancer cell death 9 10 12 13 14 BRCA 15 BRCA- 16 BRCA 17 BRCA 18 19 20 PARP inhibitors such as rucaparib and olaparib have been shown to have poor penetration across the BBB 21 22 22 23 24 27 In this study, we investigated the brain penetration and spatial distribution of niraparib and olaparib in three preclinical settings: healthy nonhuman primates (NHPs), a mouse model of glioblastoma, and a mouse model of metastatic brain tumors (using a human breast cancer cell line). We employed multimodal imaging and quantitative analysis to compare the extent of BBB penetration and tumor accumulation for the two PARP inhibitors across these models.

Quantitative MALDI MSI analysis of coronal brain tissue sections revealed niraparib distributed across all examined brain regions, whereas olaparib was not detected (i.e. < LOD) in any of the examined brain sections (Fig. 1 N 1  Fig. 1 Brain penetration in healthy rhesus macaques.

Niraparib also achieved localized high concentrations in brain tumors (when present) relative to the surrounding brain regions. In healthy rhesus macaque NHPs (an intact BBB model), niraparib showed extensive brain penetration, with a mean K p, brain of p, uu, brain 50 26 In the mouse models, the estimated K p, tumor u p, uu, tumor Efforts to better understand the mechanism of niraparib’s extensive brain penetration have focused on the role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp; MDR1; ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; ABCG2), which are key efflux transporters expressed in the luminal membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells. These transporters are important contributors to the functional integrity of the BBB and regulate brain exposure to drugs that are substrates. Sun et al. reported in vitro experiments measuring the net efflux ratios of niraparib and olaparib using MDCKII cells overexpressing human P-gp or BCRP transporters 23 23 29 p, brain p, brain p, brain 29 23 30 Niraparib’s K p, uu, brain p, uu, brain p, uu, brain p, uu, brain 31 33 34 35 The translational relevance of these nonclinical findings is supported by clinical data. In a recent phase 0/2 trial, where a PK ‘trigger’ determined the eligibility for the therapeutic expansion phase, niraparib was administered once daily (200 or 300 mg) for 4 days before surgical tumor resection at either 3–5 or 8–12 h after the last dose 26 50 p, tumor 27 One limitation of these studies is the relatively small sample sizes and reliance on a single terminal timepoint for tissue collection in both the NHP and mouse brain metastases models. While tissue collection at steady-state (5 days oral dosing) aimed to mitigate variability associated with PK fluctuations, the use of a single timepoint limits the ability to fully characterize temporal kinetics including region- and time-dependent differences in drug distribution. These constraints must be balanced against resource availability and ethical considerations regarding animal use, especially in higher-order species, where minimizing the number of animals is essential. It should be noted that the high concentrations of niraparib observed in tumor tissue could be influenced by locally compromised BBB in the tumor microenvironment. The BBB integrity was not directly assessed in the glioblastoma or brain metastasis models, but brain tumors often exhibit leaky vasculature and disrupted BBB regions, which can enhance drug extravasation into tumor tissue 36 37 In summary, these results suggest that niraparib can achieve higher brain penetration than olaparib in the NHP healthy brain and mouse brain tumor models. These data provide evidence that niraparib may offer a better PK exposure profile than olaparib in primary and secondary brain tumors. Moreover, niraparib’s ability to penetrate healthy NHP brain tissue warrant further investigation into the potential for prevention of brain metastasis for some tumor types. Methods Materials The luciferase-transfected human breast cancer cell line (MDA231-BrM2-831) was purchased from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY). Niraparib, deuterated niraparib (niraparib-d7), and olaparib were synthesized internally. Deuterated olaparib (olaparib-d8) was purchased from Alsachim (Illkirch Graffenstaden, France).

Animals were housed in a facility accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care at GSK (Collegeville, PA) or at Charles River Laboratories (Worcester, MA) throughout the study. Animals were appropriately acclimated to handling procedures and restraint devices before study initiation and were handled and housed according to current GSK standard operating procedures. For studies conducted on behalf of GSK at an external laboratory, animals were housed and maintained according to the standard operating procedures of the testing facility. Studies are reported in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines 38 NCr nude mice were group housed (5 per cage) in individually ventilated cages, maintained on a 12:12-hour light: dark cycle, fed a purified mouse diet ad libitum (AIN-93G Rodent Diet, Irradiated; Inotiv, Madison, WI), and had unrestricted access to water from sterile prefilled bottles. The mice were provided with nesting material and huts for structural enrichment. NCr nude mice were single housed for the 5-day oral dosing regimen at the end of the study. C57BL/6 mice were group housed (5 per cage) in individually ventilated cages, maintained on a 12:12-hour light: dark cycle, fed a standard mouse diet (Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet, Irradiated; Inotiv) that was supplemented with diet gels and fruit crunchie treats based on needs to encourage eating, and had unrestricted access to water from sterile prefilled bottles. The mice were provided with sterile paper diamond twists and huts for structural enrichment. Rhesus macaques were housed indoors, maintained on a 12:12-hour light: dark cycle, fed a standard primate diet (Monkey Diet 5038; LabDiet, Richmond, IN) that was supplemented daily with a variety of fresh foods and forage items and had unrestricted access to water. The macaques were provided with toys and auditory or visual enrichment daily. Niraparib and Olaparib biodistribution in nonhuman primates Four healthy male rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta n n Before each dose, animals were lightly sedated with an intramuscular injection of ketamine (5–10 mg/kg), and a blood sample was drawn. On day 5, animals administered niraparib were euthanized at 4 h after dose, and animals administered olaparib were euthanized at 2–2.5 h after dose. NHPs were euthanized by administering an overdose of injected sodium pentobarbital IV (150–200 mg/kg) and confirmed by thoracotomy and exsanguination. Terminal plasma, cerebrospinal fluid, and brain tissue were collected at necropsy. The timing of tissue collection was selected at the approximate plasma time to peak drug concentration (T max max 39 40 43 Niraparib and Olaparib biodistribution in metastatic tumor mouse model A luciferase-transfected human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MDA 231-BRM2-831) was used to generate a metastatic brain tumor model in female athymic nude mice. This triple-negative breast cancer cell line was derived from the parental MDA231-TGL cell line after 2 passages in nude mice and is known to specifically metastasize to brain tissue. NCr nude mice (strain: CrTac: NCr-Foxn1 nu n 5 n Once BMs were confirmed by BLI, those mice were randomly assigned to a treatment group using the GSK Randomization App 2.0 to receive either niraparib ( n n n n n 2 Cryosections of brain tissue were collected from 5 distinct horizontal planes across all animals. From each plane, serial tissue sections were collected for MALDI MSI and for H&E staining, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. Tissue trimmings from between each plane were collected, homogenized, and submitted for bioanalysis in addition to the terminal plasma samples. Niraparib and Olaparib biodistribution in an orthotopic glioblastoma (GL261) model Female C57BL/6 mice were inoculated intracranially on the right side of the brain in the right frontal lobe with mouse glioblastoma (GL261) tumor cells (≈ 2 × 10 5 Intracranial tumor growth was not monitored during the in-life phase of the study but prior experience with the GL261 model’s growth kinetics showed that tumors are typically established by roughly two weeks after inoculation. Thus, thirteen days after tumor inoculation, mice were randomized by animal ID number into treatment groups to receive either niraparib (35 mg/kg; 2 h ( n n n n 2 Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) For both the nonhuman primate (NHP) and mouse metastases model studies, brain tissue sections of 6-µm thickness were prepared on a Leica CM1950 cryostat (Leica Biosystems, Danvers, MA). For the NHP study, tissue sections were collected from four of the coronal brain segments from each animal. From each coronal segment, three tissue sections were collected for MALDI MSI, one section for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and roughly 30 sections were collected into a pre-weighed vial for homogenization and liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) bioanalysis. The three sections for MALDI MSI were thaw-mounted onto double-width indium tin oxide–coated slides (BigSlides; Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) that had been pretreated with a poly- l For the mouse metastases study, tissue sections were collected from five horizontal tissue planes starting from roughly 1 mm from the top of the tissue, and each subsequent tissue plane was separated by roughly 1 mm. At each tissue plane, three tissue sections were collected for MALDI MSI, one section for H&E staining, and one to five sections for immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining (five sections from animals that had brain metastases and one section from animals in the control group that did not receive a cell injection). For MALDI MSI analysis, sections were thaw-mounted onto indium tin oxide–coated slides (Delta Technologies, Ltd, Loveland, CO). For H&E and IHC analyses, tissue sections were collected onto superfrost glass slides (Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Brain tissue trimmings from between each of the horizontal planes were pooled and collected into a pre-weighed vial for homogenization and LC-MS/MS bioanalysis (described in detail later). To perform quantitative MALDI MSI, a mimetic tissue model was constructed for niraparib and olaparib using a procedure modified from that previously published 42 43 Slides for MSI were coated with a matrix solution consisting of 25-mg/mL 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid dissolved in methanol: water: DMSO: TFA (50:50:0.5:0.1) and also contained 0.1 µg/mL of internal standard (either deuterated niraparib [niraparib-d7] or deuterated olaparib [olaparib-d8]). Slides were coated with a TM Sprayer (HTX Technologies, Chapel Hill, NC) using the following parameters: 0.1-mL/min flowrate, 70 °C, 3-mm track spacing with CC pattern, and 8 passes. This process results in a tissue concentration of the internal standard of roughly 3 µg/g. MALDI MSI was performed on either a Bruker ScimaX (7T) or a Bruker SolariX (7T) FT-ICR mass spectrometer. Data were acquired at a spatial resolution of 75 μm in positive polarity using narrowband (65k data size with a 40 m/z window) and continuous accumulation of selected ion (CASI; 15 m/z window) methods that were optimized for either niraparib or olaparib. Both narrowband and CASI windows were centered between parent and internal standard m/z. The small laser focus was used with 200 laser shots per position, and the laser power was adjusted in accordance with a quality control sample acquired just before initiating the imaging sequence. After MALDI MSI acquisition, slides were immersed in 100% ethanol for 5 min to remove the MALDI matrix. Slides were then stained with H&E and digitally scanned. Ion images were loaded into flexImaging (Bruker Daltonics), the post–MALDI H&E image was coregistered, and key regions of interest (ROIs) for the tissue and mimetic model were drawn. Ion intensities from these ROIs were exported using a 2-ppm window for all relevant ions (niraparib, niraparib-d7, olaparib, and olaparib-d8). A pixel-by-pixel normalization to the internal standard was performed if the whole-tissue ROI was deemed to be significantly different from the blank ROI in the mimetic model. This stipulation was implemented to avoid internal standard normalization of noise, which can introduce artifactual distributions. The intensity ratio of analyte to internal standard from each level of the mimetic model was used to build a standard curve to convert the ion intensity in the tissue ROIs into concentration. All ion images shown are scaled from the limit of blank to 2 µg/g of drug. All quantification calculations were completed using the methods and spreadsheet workflow described by Barry et al. 43 p Supplementary statistical analyses were conducted on the MALDI MSI data for both the murine brain metastasis and NHP brain studies by fitting a mixed-effects model with the response variable log10(concentration [in ng/g] + 0.001) and an animal/plane as nested random effects. For the mouse brain metastasis model, we included the following fixed effects: (1) treatment, (2) region, (3) metastasis group, and (4) all two-way and three-way interactions of (1) to (3). For the NHP model, we included the following as fixed-effects: (1) treatment, (2) region, and (3) two-way interaction of (1) and (2). The median concentration from each ROI was used in these analyses. All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 4.2.1(R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) 44 45 47 48 LC-MS/MS bioanalysis methods for NHP and mouse BM studies Brain tissue was weighed in polypropylene tubes, then phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was added to the tissue sample before homogenization (1:4 wt: vol). Matrix-matched standard curves were prepared for plasma, brain homogenate, and CSF (NHP study only) samples, then samples were analyzed for niraparib or olaparib concentration using specific and sensitive high-performance LC-MS/MS methods using protein precipitation with acetonitrile containing an internal standard. The LC-MS/MS system includes an API-6500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex, Framingham, MA) and an ExionLC system (ExionLC Controller, ExionLC AD Column Oven, ExionLC AD Pump, and ExionLC AD Multiplate Sampler; all from Sciex). Data were acquired and processed using Analyst ® For niraparib, the LC-MS/MS method lowest limit of quantification (LLQ) was 2.00 ng/mL and highest limit of quantification (HLQ) was 10,000 ng/mL for all matrices (plasma, brain homogenates, and CSF). For olaparib, the LLQ was 1.00 ng/mL and HLQ was 10,000 ng/mL for all matrices (plasma, brain homogenates, and CSF). LC-MS/MS bioanalysis methods for orthotopic glioblastoma mouse model study Brain tissue was weighed in polypropylene tubes, then PBS was added to the tissue sample before homogenization (1:4 wt: vol). Matrix-matched standard curves were prepared for plasma and brain homogenate, then samples were analyzed for niraparib or olaparib concentration using specific and sensitive LC-MS/MS methods using protein precipitation with acetonitrile containing an internal standard. The LC-MS/MS system included an API-6500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Sciex). Data were acquired and processed using Analyst ® For niraparib, the method had LLQ of 5.00 ng/mL and HLQ of 1000 ng/mL. For olaparib, the LLQ was 5.00 ng/mL, and the HLQ was 1000 ng/mL. In vitro determination of the plasma and tissue protein binding The unbound fractions (F u Cytochrome C oxidase subunit 4 (COXIV) IHC methods—mouse BM study Mouse brain sections were IHC stained with the rabbit (Rb) monoclonal primary antibody for COXIV (3E11;cat #4850; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) on the Roche Ventana Discovery Ultra automated staining platform using the Discovery ChromoMap 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) detection kit (cat #05266645001; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Briefly, the COX IV IHC assay was optimized and performed with the following steps. Slide sections were baked and deparaffinized onboard the instrument. Afterwards, any nonspecific staining was blocked with normal goat serum. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed with CC1 Tris-based buffer for 40 min, followed by COXIV primary antibody incubation for 32 min (per the automated stainer’s protocol). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked, and nonspecific binding of secondary antibody was blocked with Antibody Block (cat #05268869001; Roche Diagnostics), followed by the application of OmniMap anti-Rb horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (cat #05269679001; Roche Diagnostics). After washing, slides were stained with DAB chromogen and subsequently counterstained with hematoxylin and then treated with Ventana HE 600 Bluing Reagent (Roche Diagnostics) to blue the hematoxylin.
