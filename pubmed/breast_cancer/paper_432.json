Daratumumab is an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody (mAb) approved for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory and newly diagnosed MM. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Results from trogocytosis and ADCC experiments show that neutrophils from healthy donors (n = 5) exert significant trogocytosis and cytotoxicity against the MOLP-8 cell line in the presence of daratumumab, with similar effects in the range of 0.1 to 20 μg/mL ( Figure 1 supplemental Figure 1 Figure 1 supplemental Figure 2 Figure 1 supplemental Figure 3 8 Figure 1 supplemental Figure 4 supplemental Videos 1 2 Figure 1. Analysis of trogocytosis and ADCC in cocultures of neutrophils and myeloma cells with different CD38 expression in presence of daratumumab. + – + + + + – P P Following these results, we carried out similar experiments with healthy donors’ neutrophils using other MM cell lines with lower CD38 surface expression, as compared to MOLP-8 ( supplemental Figure 5 Figure 1 Figure 1 supplemental Figure 6 Figure 1 To further investigate the factors implicated in these processes, we performed the same type of studies in cocultures of healthy donors’ neutrophils and MOLP-8, while blocking surface molecules involved in neutrophil functionality. In this way, based on their function, 3 functionally different groups of molecules were blocked: Fc receptors CD16, CD32, and CD64; integrin subunits CD18 and CD11b, separately and in combination; and Signal Regulatory Protein Alpha (SIRPα), involved in the don’t-eat-me signal Figure 2 9 10 11 12 supplemental Figure 7 13 14 Figure 2. Effect of blocking neutrophil surface molecules on the mechanisms of trogocytosis and ADCC. don’t-eat-me signal t P P Results on blocking CD11b/CD18 subunits indicate that this integrin does not seem to play a role in neutrophil-mediated daratumumab myeloma cell killing ( Figure 2 5 15 5 supplemental Figure 8 Figure 2 In brief, we propose neutrophil-mediated ADCC as a novel mechanism of action of daratumumab, partially influenced by CD38 expression levels on myeloma cells, and dependent on CD16b mediated trogocytosis by effector neutrophils. Our results provide rationale for further studying MM cell–neutrophil dynamics and open the door to potentially enhancing this interaction through drug combinations.
