Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of standardized, sensitive, robust, and commonly available screening and diagnostic tools for detecting the earliest signals of neoplastic pathology progression. Recently, a new paradigm of cancer control, known as multi-cancer detection (MCD), evolved, which measures the composition of cancer-related molecular analytes in the patient’s fluids using minimally invasive techniques. In this respect, the “Holy Grail” of cancer researchers and bioengineers for decades has been composing a repertoire or molecular sensing probes that would allow for the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of cancer diseases via their interaction with cell-secreted and cell-associated cancer antigens and biomarkers. Therefore, the current trend in screening and detection of cancer-related pathologies is the development of portable biosensors for mobile laboratories and individual use. Phage display, since its conception by George Smith 40 years ago, has emerged as a premier tool for molecular evolution in molecular biology with widespread applications including identification and screening of cancer biomarkers, such as Circulating Cellular Communication Network Factor 1 (CCN1), an extracellular matrix-associated signaling protein responsible for a variety of cellular functions and has been shown to be overexpressed as part of the response to various pathologies including cancer. We hypothesize that CCN1 protein can be used as a soluble marker for the early detection of breast cancer in a multi-cancer detection (MCD) platform. However, validated probes have not been identified to date. Here, we screened the multi-billion clone landscape phage display library for phages interacting specifically with immobilized CCN1 protein. Through our study, we discovered a panel of 26 different phage-fused peptides interacting selectively with CCN1 protein that can serve for development of a novel phage-based diagnostic platform to monitor changes in CCN1 serum concentration by liquid biopsy.

Introduction Breast cancer remains a significant global health concern requiring continued development of improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to enhance overall patient quality of life. Early-stage detection of malignant phenotypes is critical for improving patient outcomes and increasing overall survival rates. Circulating Cellular Communication Network Factor 1 (CCN1) also known as the Cysteine-rich Angiogenic Inducer 61 (CYR61) protein ( Figure 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 14 15 15 Molecular probes commonly used to discriminate between analytes in a complex diagnostic sample include antibodies [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Alternatively, display of short 8 or 9 amino acid peptide fragments fused to the N-terminus of the mature p8 coat protein, represented by ~4000 identical copies, produces phage particles with structurally unique molecular surfaces [ 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Figure 1 30 31 32 We hypothesized that the structurally unique landscape phage display libraries would be a rich source of peptide ligands that could bind soluble human CCN1 protein and could ultimately be used as capture probes for a variety of diagnostic assay platforms. To test this hypothesis and generate a panel of unique materials for future study, we screened a multibillion-clone landscape phage display library against a purified, recombinant human CCN1 protein in 96-well microplate format and identified a panel of candidate phages that could be used to develop a bacteriophage-based diagnostic assay. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Landscape Phage Display Library The multibillion-clone f8/9 phage display library was constructed and described in detail previously [ 33 34 9 34 2 XXXXXXXXX 35 36 2.2. Selection of CCN1 Binding Phages A schematic overview of the selection procedure is presented in Figure 1 (A) Depletion and First Round Selection—A freshly prepared aliquot of full-length, non-glycosylated, recombinant human CCN1/CYR61 protein (#cyt-164; Prospec, Ness Ziona, Israel) was diluted to 10 µg/mL in 1X Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS), pH 7.5 coating buffer. Eight wells of a high-binding capacity 96-well microplate (#9018; Corning, Corning, NY, USA) were coated with 50 µL of recombinant CCN1 protein (~500 ng/well). An additional eight wells were coated with 50 µL Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) protein (~500 µg/well) diluted in coating buffer (1X TBS, pH 7.5). Proteins were adsorbed to the wells at 4 °C overnight. Unbound proteins were removed and wells blocked with blocking buffer (1X TBS, pH 7.5/1.0% BSA) at room temperature (20 °C) for 1 h. Wells were thoroughly rinsed three times with 200 µL wash buffer (1X TBS, pH 7.5/0.5% Tween 20). A 20 µL aliquot of the multibillion-clone f8/9 phage display library containing ~5.5 × 10 11 (B) Washing and Sublibrary Propagation—Unbound phages were removed from each well and combined into a single 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube for titering. Each well was washed ten times with 200 µL wash buffer (1X TBS, pH 7.5/0.5% Tween 20) for 5 min before removing and collecting the washes from each well into a single 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tube per wash for titering. Following extensive washing, 100 µL elution buffer (200 mM Glycine-HCl, pH 2.2/1.0 mg/mL BSA) was added to each well and incubated with gentle rocking at room temperature for 10 min to elute bound phage clones. Eluted phages were collected into a single 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube and neutralized by addition of 120 µL neutralization buffer (1.0 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.1). Eluted phages were concentrated in pre-rinsed 100 kDa MWCO Amicon Ultra-0.5 centrifugal filters (#UFC510008; MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA, USA) by centrifuging at 14,000× g g g Eluted phages (~100 µL) were amplified in 25 mL NZY/20 µg/mL tetracycline medium following infection into starved K91BluKan E. coli E. coli E. coli (C) Subsequent Rounds of Selection—For each additional round of selection, an aliquot containing ~2.0 × 10 11 2.3. Screening Candidate CCN1-Binding Phages by Phage ELISA Individual phage clones identified following bioinformatics analysis were propagated and purified as described above. Phage clones were screened for binding to recombinant CCN1 protein using a phage ELISA, as illustrated in Figure 2 Briefly, each unique clone was diluted to a final concentration of ~5.0 × 10 11 Results are presented as the mean sample absorbance ± sample standard deviation of duplicate measurements. A Student’s t p 450 450 (1) σ =  ∑ σ r 2 n − 1 r 2.4. Molecular Modeling To develop structural protein models of phage displayed peptides on the filamentous bacteriophage fd-tet we used homology modeling with Modeller (v 10.6) [ 37 38 NP_001545.2 39 + − −1 −1 To perform protein-protein molecular docking we used HADDOCK web server (v. 2.5-2024.12) [ 40 41 42 43 3. Results 3.1. Isolation of CCN1-Binding Landscape Phages To discover novel phage proteins that interact with purified CCN1 protein, we screened a multibillion clone f8/9 phage display library that has been thoroughly examined to identify peptide ligands against various targets of interest to biomedical researchers including isolated proteins [ 24 28 44 45 46 47 48 49 Figure 1 26 50 51 52 Figure 3 E. coli Figure 3 We suspect that during the first round of selection, a highly diverse population of CCN1-binding phages were captured and amplified, but only those with strong binding were recovered in the second round which caused a significant drop in the percent yield ( Figure 3 During the fourth round of selection with the BSA-depleted library, we tested the effect of adsorbed CCN1 protein concentration to further enrich the phage population for higher affinity clones. Based on the yield following each round of selection, the overall yield was significantly higher when 10 µg CCN1 protein was adsorbed to each of the wells as compared to wells treated with 1 µg CCN1 protein. As expected, more total clones were recovered when using a higher mass of CCN1 protein in each of the wells. However, it is expected that when less protein is used, clones that remain bound to CCN1 will demonstrate increased specificity or affinity towards the target protein. 3.2. Discovery and Analysis of CCN1-Binding Phages At the completion of the final round of selection, one hundred phage clones were sequenced to identify the most prominent clones enriched during the selection process and identify peptide families representing peptide motifs. Overall, 26 structurally unique peptide sequences ( Table 1 We performed a manual clustering of phages into families based on the identification of trimer consensus motifs found within each of the displayed peptide sequences ( Table 2 53 54 55 5 3 56 57 6 1 58 We similarly compared the diversity of families discovered following a fourth round of selection and hypothesized that a lower concentration of CCN1 protein would enhance the enrichment of lower binding affinity motifs. Overall, we observed no significant change in population diversity or change in proportions of specific amino acid residues between 10 µg and 1 µg CCN1 protein. Increasing the selection stringency for enhanced binding to CCN1 in round 4 resulted in an increased length of the motif from DXXSXFPD in round 3 to [D/S]XXS[D/E]FPD in round 4 and resulted in increased diversity of clones identified in the GS[D/E]SV[D/E]MPA family. It remains to be seen if the identified family would have an increased affinity towards CCN1. 3.3. Specificity of CCN1-Binding Phage Clones To determine the relative binding capacity of phages to CCN1 protein and determine the capability of phages to capture soluble CCN1 from a liquid medium, as would be used in a diagnostic liquid biopsy, we performed a phage ELISA to screen candidate phage clones. Here, we adsorbed a panel of candidate phages into the wells of a 96-well microplate and incubated each isolated phage with a solution containing a known concentration of CCN1. Bound CCN1 was then quantified by indirect ELISA using a commercial anti-CCN1 antibody [ 59 Figure 4 Each identified phage had increased Phage ELISA signals compared to an unrelated BSA protein ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 1 Table 1 3.4. Identification of Putative CCN1-Binding Sites by Molecular Docking We next sought to determine a potential model for phage binding with recombinant CCN1 protein using homology modeling and protein-protein docking methods ( Figure 5 60 61 38 62 63 64 65 Molecular docking of the recombinant phage model with the mature CCN1 protein structure resulted in 39 different clusters of docked structures. Interacting contacts between CCN1 and the fusion peptide from the top 2 structure clusters were identified using the PRODIGY webserver to predict residues involved in binding. Binding contacts with GSESVDMPA peptide were predicted in the N-terminal Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein (IGFBP) domain of CCN1, with some additional supporting interactions found in the Von Willebrand Factor Type C domain (VWFC) as visualized in Figure 5 D −8 4. Discussion and Conclusions CCN1 has been implicated as an important regulator of cell proliferation and serves as a mediator of metastatic disease progression. Development of therapeutic interventions that target CCN1 with monoclonal antibodies binding the VWC domain, as identified through epitope mapping with phage display, have been used to inhibit cell growth and prevent metastases in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo [ 66 67 Irrespective of depletion method, we were successfully able to identify several peptide sequences that interact specifically with the immobilized CCN1 protein and not an unrelated target. We screened a panel of these peptide sequences in a phage ELISA, an assay format that could be further used for development of diagnostic assays, and demonstrated that the binding for several of the identified sequences clustered into similar families. We conclude that these families of peptides are likely binding to similar binding sites located on the CCN1 protein. Additional modeling and experimental assays would be necessary to identify the specific binding site of each phage clone. One limitation of our study is the use of a non-glycosylated form of CCN1 protein during selection. CCN1 contains several glycosylation sites and post translational modifications that serve in critical roles for its secretion [ 68 69 70 We demonstrate that phage-displayed 9-mer peptides can be identified from a landscape phage display library and those selected phages can be used as a stable capture probe for use in a diagnostic assay format, here a phage ELISA. Here we identified a panel of CCN1-binding phages that can be used to validate an ELISA-based diagnostic assay for the early detection of breast cancer from a liquid biopsy for quantification of soluble serum biomarkers.
