Background Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play crucial roles in the progression of breast cancer (BC). The lncRNA small nuclear RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16), represents a lncRNA associated with tumor development. This study focuses on SNHG16 and its regulatory role in BC progression, validated through microarray analysis and in vitro experiments. Method The GEO datasets GSE65194 GSE61304 GSE41922 GSE45666 GSE29431 GSE42568 Results Our study found that elevated expression levels of SNHG16 were associated with BC cell proliferation and poor prognosis. According to an in vitro knockdown assay, SNHG16 silencing inhibits the progression of BC. SNHG16 was found to positively regulate AURKA levels as a competitive sponge for hsa-let-7b-5p. Conclusion The activity of the lncRNA SNHG16 can be triggered via the hsa-let-7b-5p/AURKA axes. These findings shed light on the novel molecular mechanisms underlying BC progression. Highlights • SNHG16 is significantly differentially expressed in breast cancer through TCGA and GEO databases. • The lncRNA SNHG16 is involved in the ceRNA regulatory network. • qRT-PCR showed that SNHG16 was highly expressed in breast cancer cell lines. • Knockdown of SNHG16 decreased the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer cells.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are found in the nucleus or cytoplasm, they regulate gene expression via competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanisms. Dysregulated expression of lncRNAs contributes to disease progression through ceRNA regulatory networks [ [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] 13 14 Recent studies have shown that lncRNA SNHG16 negatively regulates miR-218-5p expression in pancreatic cancer, thereby inhibiting cancer cell invasion and metastasis [ 15 16 17 18 19 [20] [21] [22] [23] This study uses the TCGA and GEO databases to identify differentially expressed RNAs related to breast cancer prognosis, constructing a ceRNA expression network. Experimental validation of this ceRNA network's impact on breast cancer proliferation and invasion provides new biomarkers and theoretical foundations for understanding disease progression. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Microarray analysis The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is the largest sequencing database dedicated to breast cancer research [ 24 Homo sapiens 25 GSE65194 GSE61304 GSE41922 GSE45666 GSE29431 GSE42568 Table S1 2.2 Identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) We conducted RNA sequencing analysis using the limma package in R to group, deduplicate, and analyze RNA samples. DEGs were defined based on log 2 2 2 Visualization of DEGs was achieved using ggplot2 for volcano plots and pheatmap for heatmaps. Upregulated genes were marked in red, while downregulated genes were marked in green. We performed an intersection analysis of DEG results across various databases and gene chips. 2.3 Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs Functional characterization and enrichment analysis of DEGs were conducted using Gene Ontology (GO) terms, categorizing biological processes (BP), molecular functions (MF), and cellular components (CC). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis identified significant pathways enriched with DEGs compared to the whole genome background. Visualization of enrichment results was performed using ggplot2 in R (4.2.0). 2.4 Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of DEGs PPI networks illustrate interactions between proteins, providing insights into downstream protein expression regulation. DEGs were analyzed using the STRING database, and the resulting PPI network was visualized using Cytoscape. The CytoHubba plugin identified key proteins based on their degree of interaction. Additionally, core subnetworks were extracted using the MCODE plugin with specific parameters. 2.5 Prediction of target genes of DEGs We utilized TargetScan (TargetScan: http://targetscan.org http://microrna.org/microrna/ https://starbase.sysu.edu.cn/ 2.6 Construction of ceRNA regulatory network We utilized Targetscan and miRanda to predict target binding relationships between miRNA, mRNA, and lncRNA. Specifically, we selected DEGs with Targetscan scores ≥50, and miRanda energy 0.1. According to the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis, DElncRNAs and DEmRNAs within DEGs are expected to exhibit similar expression trends, while DEmiRNAs should show opposite trends [ 26 27 2.7 Survival and expression analysis of DEGs We performed survival analysis using the Kaplan-Meier Plotter database ( http://kmplot.com 28 29 30 2.8 Cell culture and transfection The MCF-7 (SCSP-531) and MDA-MB-231 (SCSP-5043) cell lines, representing two prevalent and highly proliferative breast cancer subtypes, along with the MCF-10A (SCSP-575) cell line, which serves as a model for normal breast epithelial cells, were obtained from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China). Cells were cultured in high-glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum (JYK-FBS-301, Jin Yuan Kang Biotechnology) at 37 °C with 5 % CO 2 Table S2 2.9 Validation of DEG expression by real-time quantitative PCR Total RNA was extracted from MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell samples using the TRIzol method, and RNA concentration and purity were assessed using NanoDrop 2000. RNA with concentrations ranging from 200 to 2000 ng/μl and an OD260/OD230 ratio of 1.8–2.2 was considered suitable. RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA according to kit instructions. SYBR Green Mix (QP031, GeneCopoeia), primers, and gene templates were combined for amplification, with GAPDH as the reference gene for normalization. Data were analyzed using the 2 -ΔΔCT Table S3 2.10 Western blotting experiment Cells were rinsed with PBS to remove the culture medium. RIPA lysis buffer (20 μl) was added per culture dish to achieve complete cell digestion. Additionally, 2 μl of protease inhibitor and 2 μl of phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific) were included. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA method. Samples were prepared with 1x loading buffer, boiled, and stored at −20 °C. SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis was performed to separate proteins by size. Proteins were then transferred to PVDF membranes. A 5 % BSA solution incubation blocked nonspecific binding sites. Specific monoclonal antibodies were used for β-actin (1:1500) and AURKA (1:1000, EM1706-71, HUABIO), followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies (Beyotime) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase-linked rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:5000) were used, followed by exposure and imaging using the Epizyme Omni-ECL chromogenic reagent. ImageJ software was employed for film scanning to quantify density and determine the relative expression of target genes compared to β-actin. 2.11 Scratch assay Cells were enzymatically digested and seeded in 6-well plates until reaching 80 %–90 % confluency. Using a sterile, enzyme-free 10 μl pipette tip, scratches were made on the cell culture surface, ensuring uniform width and placement under a microscope. The old medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM and incubated for 24 h before observation and photography under low magnification. Cell migration rates were analyzed using ImageJ software. 2.12 CCK-8 assay Absorbance readings measured cell viability at 24, 48, and 72 h. Cells were digested with trypsin, washed with PBS, and seeded uniformly in 96-well plates (200 μl medium and 10 μl CCK-8 solution per well, NEST Biotechnology). After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader to calculate cell proliferation rates. 2.13 Statistical analysis Sequencing data were analyzed and visualized using R 4.13. All other data were analyzed using SPSS 25.0, and graphs were drawn using GraphPad Prism 8.0.2. Quantitative data are presented as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical analysis employed ANOVA with a significance level set at α = 0.05 (two-tailed). 3 Results 3.1 Differential gene expression analysis We selected six breast cancer whole-genome expression datasets from the GEO database (lncRNA: GSE65194 GSE61304 GSE41922 GSE45666 GSE29431 GSE42568 Fig. 1 2 2 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Screening for differentially expressed genes.

Fig. 1 3.2 Functional enrichment analysis of differential gene expression Functional enrichment analysis of DElncRNA-targeted genes revealed significant enrichment in protein binding, cell division, and cytoplasmic processes in GO analysis. KEGG pathway analysis highlighted enrichment in ECM receptor interaction, oocyte meiosis, Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and cell cycle. For DEmiRNAs, GO analysis indicated enrichment in extracellular vesicle and membrane components, while KEGG pathways enriched in tyrosine metabolism, PPAR, and AMPK signaling pathways were noted. DEmRNA analysis showed GO enrichment in negative regulation of gene expression, positive regulation of cell cycle, and negative regulation of hematopoietic stem cells, with KEGG pathways enriched in Wnt/β-catenin signaling and immune system development ( Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Functional enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG for differential genes and their target genes.

Fig. 2 3.3 Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis Using the STRING database, we constructed PPI networks for DEmRNAs, filtering out isolated nodes. Separate networks were built for upregulated (47 nodes, 987 edges) and downregulated genes (50 nodes, 132 edges). Further analysis using Cytoscape software plugins MCODE and cytoHubba identified top-scoring core proteins in each network. Key genes included AURKA, HMMR, FN1, RUNX2, CDK1, CCNB1, CENPA, UHRF1, COL1A1, NUSAP1 for upregulated genes, and FABP4, LEP, SFRP1, FMO2, OGN, ADH1B, GPIHBP1, ADAMTS5, TGFBR3, ZBTB16 for downregulated genes. Notably, AURKA was central in the PPI network, and the top 20 genes by score were selected for further analysis ( Fig. 3 Fig. 3 PPI network and key sub-network of differentially expressed mRNAs.

Fig. 3 3.4 Interaction network and ceRNA network construction Using TargetScan and miRanda software, we predicted target genes for DElncRNAs and DEmiRNAs, intersecting these results with differentially expressed genes. This approach yielded 13 DElncRNAs, 3 DEmiRNAs, and 3 DEmRNAs. According to the ceRNA hypothesis, these lncRNAs should exhibit a negative correlation with miRNAs and a positive correlation with mRNAs. Constructing a breast cancer ceRNA regulatory network, we identified 29 interaction pairs, including 13 lncRNA-miRNA pairs, 13 lncRNA-mRNA pairs, and 3 miRNA-mRNA pairs ( Fig. 3 Table S4 3.5 Differential gene interactions in ceRNA regulatory networks Using RNA chip technology, we identified complementary binding sites between lncRNA SNHG16 and miRNA hsa-let-7b-5p ( Fig. 3 3.6 Expression of differential genes in ceRNA networks in breast cancer To validate ceRNA differential gene expression in breast cancer, we evaluated the prognostic value of SNHG16 and AURKA and hsa-let-7b-5p using the Kaplan-Meier database, and we assessed their expression using the UALCAN database ( Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Differential gene expression.

Fig. 4 3.7 qRT-PCR experimental results 3.7.1 qRT-PCR validation of differential gene expression in breast cancer cells We performed qRT-PCR to detect SNHG16, hsa-let-7b-5p, and AURKA expression in two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A). As shown in Fig. 4 3.7.2 Knockdown of SNHG16 and qRT-PCR validation of gene knockdown efficiency To further investigate the role of lncRNA in ceRNA regulation, we designed si-SNHG16 interference fragments to knock down SNHG16 expression in cells. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed transfection efficiency above 90 %, indicating successful transfection for subsequent experiments. qRT-PCR revealed a significant reduction in SNHG16 expression post-transfection in MCF-7 cells, accompanied by decreased AURKA expression and increased hsa-let-7b-5p expression. Similar trends were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells, with notably increased hsa-let-7b-5p expression ( Fig. 5 Fig. 5 Effect of knockdown SNHG16 expression on ceRNA.

Fig. 6 3.9 Verification of AURKA protein expression by western blotting To validate the expression of AURKA protein following the knockdown of lncRNA SNHG16 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, Western blot experiments were conducted. The results indicated a significant decrease in AURKA protein expression upon SNHG16 knockdown in both cell lines ( Fig. 6 4 Discussion Breast cancer is the most prevalent tumor among women globally and ranks as the second most common cancer worldwide. Incidence and mortality rates are increasing annually [ 1 31 SNHG16 was initially detected to be highly expressed in invasive neuroblastomas [ 32 [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] 44 [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] 51 52 53 Prognostic analysis of DEGs within the ceRNA network in breast cancer revealed high expression levels of SNHG16 and AURKA correlating with poor prognosis, whereas low hsa-let-7b-5p expression indicated unfavorable outcomes. There have been experimental validations have confirmed AURKA's overexpression in ER-positive and triple-negative breast cancers, which is similar to our experimental results [ 54 55 56 57 58 59 We experimentally confirmed the impact of SNHG16 downregulation on cell proliferation and migration. Our findings revealed varying inhibition in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, consistent with previous studies [ 59 60 5 Conclusion In conclusion, we successfully constructed a prognostically relevant ceRNA regulatory network in breast cancer through differential gene screening. Experimental validation confirmed SNHG16-hsa-let-7b-5p-AURKA in breast cancer cells and affirmed that SNHG16 promotes cell proliferation and migration.
