In this study, we investigated the antitumor efficacy and immunomodulatory potential of AB-329, a selective AXL kinase inhibitor, in preclinical models of TNBC. Transcriptome analysis and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets revealed elevated AXL expression in mesenchymal TNBC subtypes and a negative association with immune cell infiltration. While AB-329 demonstrated moderate antiproliferative effects as a monotherapy, its combination with paclitaxel led to substantially enhanced antiproliferative and anti-metastatic effects compared to gemcitabine, DXd, and SN-38. In murine TNBC allograft models, the combination of AB-329 and paclitaxel significantly reduced tumor growth, and AB-329 increased activated natural killer (NK) cell infiltration in humanized mouse models. Analysis of human breast cancer tissue further confirmed that low AXL expression is associated with a higher presence of NK cells in the tumor. These findings suggest that AB-329 not only augments chemotherapy efficacy but also reshapes the tumor immune microenvironment, supporting its further development as a dual-action therapeutic strategy for AXL-positive TNBC. triple-negative breast cancer AXL AB-329 chemotherapy tumor immuno-microenvironment natural killer cells The University of Hawaii Cancer Center P30CA071789 MD Anderson’s Cancer Center P30CA016672 Daiichi Sankyo Inc.

Introduction Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer characterized by the lack of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. Representing approximately 15–20% of all breast cancer cases, TNBC disproportionately affects premenopausal women under the age of 40 [ 1 2 3 4 5 Advancements in molecular profiling have shown that TNBC is a highly diverse disease. Initial work by Lehmann et al. identified six molecular subtypes—basal-like 1 (BL1), basal-like 2 (BL2), mesenchymal (M), mesenchymal stem-like (MSL), immunomodulatory (IM), and luminal androgen receptor (LAR) [ 6 7 8 9 One such driver is AXL, a receptor tyrosine kinase of the TAM family (TYRO3, AXL, MERTK), which has emerged as a critical regulator of tumor progression and immune evasion. AXL can be activated by its ligand GAS6 or through ligand-independent mechanisms, leading to the promotion of oncogenic processes, including proliferation, invasion, metastasis, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, stemness, and therapy resistance [ 10 11 12 13 14 In light of AXL’s central role in TNBC progression, immune evasion, and chemoresistance, pharmacologic AXL inhibition represents a promising therapeutic strategy. AB-329 (formerly DS-1205b), a selective small-molecule AXL inhibitor, has demonstrated safety and preliminary efficacy in combination with EGFR inhibitors in clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [ 15 16 2. Results 2.1. AXL Expression Is Elevated in TNBC and Targetable by an AXL-Specific Inhibitor, AB-329 Dysregulated AXL expression has been linked to increased tumor progression and metastasis and impaired tumor immunogenicity. To assess the prognostic significance of AXL, we analyzed 3911 breast cancer and 267 TNBC patients using the Kaplan–Meier plotter. The result showed that high AXL expression is associated with poorer distant-metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in both breast cancer ( p p Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 The antiproliferative activity of AB-329 was assessed in vitro across TNBC cell lines with varying AXL expression using a sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. AB-329 exhibited moderate growth-inhibitory effects in AXL-positive human (SUM149, HCC1937) and murine (4T1, E0771-LMB) TNBC cells, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) exceeding 5 μM ( Figure 1 Figure 1 p Figure 1 p p p p Figure 1 2.2. AB-329 Combined with Paclitaxel Synergistically Inhibited the Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion of TNBC Cells Given the moderate antiproliferative activity of AB-329 and its dependency on AXL expression, we next explored whether combining AB-329 with chemotherapy could enhance its antitumor effects in AXL-positive TNBC models. We screened various chemotherapy agents like paclitaxel ( Figure 2 Figure S1 Figure S2 p p p Figure 2 p p p Figure 2 Figure 2 p p p Figure 2 p p p Figure 2 2.3. AB-329 Combined with Paclitaxel Synergistically Reduced Tumor Growth in Murine TNBC Models Building on the observed in vitro synergy between AB-329 and paclitaxel, we next assessed their combined antitumor effectiveness in vivo using murine TNBC xenograft models. In vitro, AXL inhibition boosted the growth-suppressive effect of paclitaxel, which was further confirmed in 3D soft agar assays (4T1 cells ( p p Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure S3A p p p p Figure 3 2.4. AXL Inhibition Enhances Activated NK Cell Infiltration in Breast Cancer Tissues Beyond its established role in driving tumor proliferation, migration, and metastasis, AXL also promotes immune evasion by modulating the tumor microenvironment. Thus, we next sought to determine whether AXL inhibition could modulate the tumor immune microenvironment (TME). Specifically focusing on innate immune responses, we analyzed the immune cell fraction in 1200 patients with breast cancer in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The data showed that low AXL expression was associated with highly activated NK cells ( p Figure 4 Figure 4 3. Discussion Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains a major clinical challenge due to its aggressive behavior, molecular heterogeneity, and limited treatment options. In this study, we present preclinical evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of AB-329, a selective AXL kinase inhibitor, in AXL-expressing TNBC. Our data show that among all breast cancer subtypes, TNBC exhibits the highest levels of AXL expression and a strong association between AXL overexpression and the mesenchymal subtype of TNBC, which is known for its increased metastatic potential and resistance to chemotherapy [ 17 18 19 AB-329 monotherapy inhibited the proliferation and migration of TNBC cells, consistent with AXL’s known role in promoting epithelial–mesenchymal transition and stem-like phenotypes. Western blot analysis confirmed the effective inhibition of downstream AKT signaling ( Figure S3A Figure 3 Figure S3C To optimize combination strategies, we tested several chemotherapeutic agents, including paclitaxel, gemcitabine, DXd, and SN-38, with AB-329 using both 2D ( Figure 2 Figure S2A Figure 3 Figure S2B At the molecular level, our data suggest that AB-329, when combined with paclitaxel, disrupts pro-survival signaling by downregulating phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT), a critical mediator of cell survival and proliferation. This was accompanied by elevated levels of cleaved PARP, indicating enhanced apoptosis and chemosensitivity. Functionally, the combination produced synergistic antitumor effects in murine models, with greater tumor regression and increased infiltration of activated NK cells compared to either agent alone. Supporting this mechanism, TCGA analysis revealed that low AXL expression correlates with higher levels of activated NK cells, highlighting an inverse relationship between AXL signaling and antitumor immunity. This synergy is mechanistically plausible, as paclitaxel-induced immunogenic cell death increases tumor visibility to the immune system, while AXL inhibition relieves immune suppression and promotes NK cell activation. Given that metastasis accounts for approximately 90% of cancer-related deaths [ 20 In the context of AXL-targeted therapies, several inhibitors have advanced into clinical trials, including Bemcentinib (BGB324) [ 21 22 23 While these findings support the further development of AB-329, several questions remain. The precise mechanisms through which AXL inhibition enhances NK cell activity are not fully understood. Future studies should investigate changes in cytokines and chemokines, AXL’s role in myeloid cells, and combination strategies with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Additionally, preclinical studies are necessary to confirm whether AXL expression or immune contexture can act as predictive biomarkers of AB-329’s response. In summary, our study provides strong preclinical evidence that AB-329 is a promising candidate for combination therapy in AXL-positive TNBC. By targeting both intrinsic tumor cell pathways and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, AB-329 may overcome chemotherapy resistance and enhance antitumor immunity. These findings support the rationale for evaluating AB-329 in clinical trials for advanced TNBC. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Lines and Reagents Murine TNBC cell lines included 4T1 (purchased from the American Type Culture Collection [ATCC], Manassas, VA, USA), E0771 and E0771-LMB (obtained from a collaborator), and T11 (Baylor College of Medicine). Human TNBC cell lines included SUM149 and SUM185 (BIOIVT, Westbury, NY, USA), HCC1937, HCC1806, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, and MDA-MB-453 (ATCC), as well as HCC2185, CAL51, and CAL120 (obtained from collaborators). 4T1, T11, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-157, and MDA-MB-453 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium/F12 (DMEM/F12; #D8062; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). E0771-LMB, HCC1937, HCC1806, HCC2185, CAL51, and CAL120 cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (#R8758; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Both DMEM/F12 and RPMI media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; #F0600-050; Gen-DEPOT, Katy, TX, USA) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic (#A5955; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). SUM149 and SUM185 cells were cultured in Ham’s F-12 medium (#11765054; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic, insulin (5 µg/mL; #12-585-014; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), and hydrocortisone (1 µg/mL; #H0888; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). All cell lines were authenticated by the Characterized Cell Line Core Facility at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center using short tandem repeat (STR) profiling and confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination using the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (#LT07-710; Lonza, Morristown, NJ, USA). AB-329 was kindly provided by AnHeart Therapeutics (New York, NY, USA). 4.2. Clonogenic Assay Clonogenic assay was used to evaluate the effects of drug treatments on cancer cell growth. First, 2–5 × 10 4 4.3. Soft Agar Assay The effect of drug treatment on the anchorage-independent growth of 4T1 and T11 cells was assessed using a soft agar assay. Cells (5 × 10 3 4.4.

TNBC Mouse Model All animals were housed and handled following the guidelines of the MD Anderson Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 4T1 (2 × 10 4 5 4.8. Immune Cell Fraction in SUM149 Humanized Mice Model Myeloablated NSG-SGM3 mice were engrafted with CD34+ human hematopoietic stem cells to generate CD34+ humanized mice. Successful human immune cell engraftment was confirmed by detecting >25% human CD45+ (hCD45+) cells in peripheral blood via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). SUM149 cells (4 × 10 6 3 4.9. Human Breast Cancer TCGA Data Gene expression data for TCGA breast cancer (BRCA) samples were obtained from the UCSC Xena platform, and immune infiltration estimates for these tumors were retrieved from the TIMER2.0 database. BRCA samples were stratified into two groups based on the median expression of the AXL gene. Differences in immune cell proportions between the high-AXL and low-AXL groups were assessed across all immune cell types from CIBERSORT using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Student’s t 4.10. Statistical Analysis Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion rates were summarized as mean ± standard deviation. Statistical comparisons for in vitro experiments were performed using a two-tailed unpaired Student’s t t p Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms26188896/s1 Author Contributions Conceptualization, D.R.R., J.L., and N.T.U.; methodology, D.R.R. and J.L.; investigation, D.R.R., J.L., J.A.F., and H.L.; formal analysis, D.R.R., J.L., and Y.Q.; resources, J.L., M.P., Y.D., and N.T.U.; writing—original draft preparation, D.R.R., J.L., and N.T.U.; writing—review and editing, D.R.R., J.L., Y.D., M.P., and N.T.U.; visualization, D.R.R. and J.L.; supervision, J.L. and N.T.U.; project administration, J.L., M.P., and N.T.U.; funding acquisition, J.L., M.P., and N.T.U.
