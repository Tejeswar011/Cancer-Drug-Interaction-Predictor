In addition to well-characterized genetic and hormonal drivers, there is increasing recognition that oxidative stress plays a pivotal role in breast cancer biology ( 1  Figure 1 2 3 Figure 1 The oxidative stress process in breast cancer. A balance scale illustration shows oxidative stress. On the left, high reactive oxygen species (ROS) increases pro-oxidant levels, leading to lipid, protein, DNA damage, disrupted functions, and cancer cell death. On the right, moderate ROS increases antioxidants, causing genomic instability, immune evasion, enhanced metabolism, drug resistance, angiogenesis, metastasis, and cancer progression. Oxidative stress may be considered to play a “double-edged sword role”; while chronic ROS exposure can promote malignancy in cancers, acute or high ROS bursts can be cytotoxic to cancer cells and are exploited by many therapies. This Research Topic’s five papers illustrate diverse facets of oxidative stress in breast cancer ―from immune modulation and drug resistance to therapy side effects and biomarkers―and are summarized below. A review, entitled From Immunogenic Cell Death to Immunogenic Modulation: Select Chemotherapy Regimens Induce a Spectrum of Immune-enhancing Activities in the Tumor Microenvironment Fabian et al. The study Integrative Dissection of 5-hydroxytryptamine Receptors (5-HTRs; HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR2A, HTR2B, HTR2C, HTR4, and HTR7)-related Signature in the Prognosis and Immune Microenvironment of Breast Cancer  Zhan et al. Clinically, this implies that treating depression or modulating 5-HT pathways could benefit breast cancer patients by preserving an effective anti-tumor immune environment. The mini review Targeting Ferroptosis: A Promising Strategy to Overcome Drug Resistance in Breast Cancer Peng et al. The study Effect of Fangxia-Dihuang Decoction on Doxorubicin-induced Cognitive Impairment in Breast Cancer Animal Model Wang et al. FXDH boosted antioxidant defenses (e.g. GSH, SOD) and reduced neuroinflammation in the hippocampus, preventing DOX-induced neuronal damage. Oxidative stress and inflammation are key drivers of chemo brain and counteracting them can preserve cognitive function. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory supplements (like components of FXDH) could mitigate cognitive side effects of chemotherapy. Such interventions might improve patients’ quality of life and treatment tolerance by reducing oxidative damage in the nervous system. The study Association between Neutrophil-lymphocyte Ratio and Female Breast Cancer: An observational study from the NHANES 2001–2018 Xiong et al. This comprehensive body of research demonstrates that oxidative stress plays a dual role in the development of breast cancer. While excess ROS and inflammation can drive tumor growth and spread and treatment resistance, these pathways can also be targeted for therapy. Strategies to mitigate oxidative stress and inflammation, such as stress relief and tissue preservation, can improve outcomes and quality of life. Strategies to augment oxidative stress within tumors, such as inducing ferroptosis or leveraging immunogenic cell stress, have the potential to enhance cell killing. The potential for reducing oxidative damage while exploiting tumor-specific vulnerabilities is significant. Future therapeutic interventions will integrate antioxidant and pro-oxidant strategies to boost treatment efficacy while minimizing damage to normal cells.
