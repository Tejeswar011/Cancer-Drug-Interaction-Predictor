This population engages in low levels of physical activity. The current report describes the rationale and protocol for two harmonious studies (“Examining the Effect of High-Intensity Exercise to Attenuate Cognitive Function Limitations and Train Exercise Habits in Older People Living with HIV” (HEALTHCOG) and “A Pilot Trial of High-Intensity to Combat Vascular and Cognitive Dysfunction in Older Adults with HIV” (VASCOG) which are adopting and implementing the methods of a parent randomized clinical trial (“High-Intensity Exercise Study to Attenuate Limitations and Train Habits in Older Adults with HIV” [HEALTH]) to compare 4 months of supervised high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or continuous moderate exercise (CME) on cognitive outcomes and underlying correlates. VASCOG and HEALTHCOG are poised to: 1) compare cognitive changes following HIIT vs. CME and the vascular impacts; 2) examine safety, feasibility, and acceptability of this approach in the Deep South; and 3) explore predictors of habitual physical activity, and association of sustained physical activity with training. Results will have implications for prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment among older PLWH. arterial stiffness cognition harmonization protocol pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf yes pmc-prop-manuscript yes pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
