Methods A prediction model was built using data from 252 sepsis patients in a single institution (January 2022 to December 2023). Severe anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level <60 g/L. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was used to identify key predictors, and multivariable logistic regression was used to construct the nomogram. Model performance was assessed via the receiver operating characteristic curve (C-index), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. Internal validation was performed using bootstrapping. Results Predictors included age, length of intensive care unit stay, nutritional method, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score. The model demonstrated good discrimination (C-index: 0.8848) and calibration, with high internal validation performance. Decision curve analysis indicated optimal clinical utility at risk thresholds between 5% and 75%. Conclusions The constructed nomogram, incorporating age, length of intensive care unit stay, nutritional method, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, provides a practical tool for early individualized care in sepsis patients.

Sepsis has a high mortality rate of 30%–50% even in industrialized countries,  1  2 3 4  5 Sepsis-associated severe anemia is mainly associated with inflammatory anemia–related parameters, such as erythropoietin (EPO), hepcidin, and ferritin, markers that have been shown to be associated with 28-day mortality in sepsis patients.  6  7  8  9  10 The purpose of this study was to develop a simple nomogram to predict sepsis-associated severe anemia and internally validate its clinical applicability in a small, single-site study. This nomogram could not only provide intensive care physicians with a tool that can predict the appearance of severe anemia in patients upon admission, even before blood tests are completed, but may also effectively predict anemia in patients with normal hemoglobin levels throughout the duration of hospitalization. Patients and methods Patients Research approval was obtained from Tongji Hospital affiliated to Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Medical records were retrospectively analyzed from patients admitted to the institution from all over China between 1 April 2022 and 31 March 2023. Participants were included if they met the Sepsis 3.0 (2016) diagnostic criteria. Organ dysfunction was identified as a change in the Sequential (sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment score of >2 points. Patient demographic, mortality, and related treatments were extracted from our extensive electronic medical record system. The clinical indicators selected in our research focused on anemia-related factors, including age, sex, presence of infections, use of antibiotics, continuous renal replacement treatment (CRRT), and mechanical ventilation, all of which may influence the human hematopoietic system to varying degrees. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, personal information was kept confidential, and all patient details were deidentified so that they could not be identified in any way. This retrospective study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2024, and the reporting of this study conforms to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines.  11 Outcome measurements Severe anemia in our cohort was defined according to the international anemia risk degree (i.e. if hemoglobin level <60 g/L).  12 2 2  2 2 2 Clinical variables associated with sepsis included age, sex, 30-day mortality, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Among these variables, MAP and blood oxygen saturation (SaO 2 Statistical analysis Demographic characteristics were categorized as continuous or categorical variables. Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation, whereas categorical variables were expressed as percentages (%). Comparisons between the severe and nonsevere anemia groups were performed using Student’s unpaired t-test for continuous variables and chi-squared test for categorical variables. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method was used to select the optimal predictive features for severe anemia risk. Variables with nonzero coefficients in the LASSO regression model were selected.  13 The LASSO regression model aims to minimize a loss function incorporating L1 regularization, as defined by the following objective function formula: Objective  function = min ⁡ β ( 1 n ∑ i = 1 n ( y i − β 0 − ∑ j = 1 p β j x i j ) 2 + λ ∑ j = 1 p | β j | ) x ij y i j β 1 j−1 j+1 p p n Regarding optimization algorithm, we used the coordinate descent method to solve the LASSO regression. This iterative approach involves fixing all coefficients except one and updating that single coefficient in each step. The process is repeated in a loop until convergence is reached. For instance, holding β 1 j−1 j+1 p j Then, multivariable logistic regression analysis was applied to construct a predictive model by incorporating the features selected in the LASSO regression model. Risk was expressed as an odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) and p-values. Independent variables with p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant and included in the model. Calibration curves were plotted to assess the accuracy of this nomogram. A significant statistical test implied that the model did not calibrate perfectly.  14  15 NB = true  positive  ( % ) × benefit  value  ( intervention ) − false  positive  ( % ) × loss  value  ( intervention )  ( i . e .  NB = TB – FL ) All statistical analyses were performed using R software (version 4.1.0) and IBM SPSS 22. Results Demographic characteristics In accordance with the prevalence of sepsis-associated severe anemia in our hospital over the past 3 years, our model required at least 200 cases to ensure robustness of the nomogram. A total of 252 patients were enrolled from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 in this study at our hospital, of which 106 patients were categorized into the severe anemia group and 146 into the nonsevere anemia group. Clinical and demographic characteristics of our study participants are presented in Table 1 Table 1. Demographic and clinical characteristics between severe and nonsevere anemia groups.

The mean age of the severe anemia group was significantly higher than that of the nonsevere anemia group (58.8 ± 2.0 vs. 50.7 ± 1.9 years; p = 0.007). The sex ratio was similar between the two groups. Mortality at 30 days was 60% for the overall cohort, and mortality was significantly higher in the severe anemia group (73.6% vs. 50.7%, p = 0.013). After standardized treatments, 41% of all patients in the cohort responded with a positive outcome, and the nonsevere anemia group responded positively to a greater extent than the severe anemia group (49.3% vs. 30.2%, p = 0.039). The average length of ICU stay was 8 days, ranging from 1 to 29 days. Participants in the severe anemia group had a significantly longer ICU stay than those in the nonsevere anemia group (10.1 ± 0.9 vs. 6.6 ± 0.5 days, p = 0.003). The average mechanical ventilation time for all patients was 51 h, ranging from none to 718 h. The duration of mechanical ventilation in the severe anemia group was significantly longer than that in the nonsevere anemia group (73.7 ± 17.2 vs. 34.8 ± 4.8 h, p = 0.047), despite comparable mechanical ventilation use in the overall cohort. Additionally, the duration of CRRT was significantly longer in the severe anemia group than in the nonsevere anemia group (55.1 ± 8.0 vs. 33.1 ± 3.9 h, p = 0.027). The overall average CRRT duration for all participants was 42 h, ranging from 0 to 295 h. Moreover, the use of vasopressors was comparable between the two groups (p = 0.985). The two nutritional methods provided for all patients included liquid food and parenteral or enteral nutrition. There was significantly greater use of liquid food in the nonsevere anemia group than in the severe anemia group (58.9% vs. 28.3%, p = 0.001). The detection of positive bacteriological cultures of the blood, sputum, and secretions was significantly higher in the severe anemia group than in the nonsevere anemia group (56.6% vs. 35.6%, p = 0.007). Finally, the APACHE II score on admission, which ranged from 4 to 40, was significantly higher in the severe anemia group than in the nonsevere anemia group (26.0 ± 0.9 vs. 15.5 ± 0.8, p < 0.001). Model feature selection Among all clinical and demographic characteristics, 25 potential predictor features were reduced to 9 based on univariable analysis. The features included age, 30-day mortality, outcomes, length of ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, duration of CRRT, nutritional method, bacteriological culture, and APACHE II score. These nine features were then included in the multiple regression analysis. All 25 features were included in the LASSO regression model (∼5:1 ratio, Figure 1(a) and (b) Figure 1.

Performance and clinical applicability of the predictive nomogram The calibration curve of the risk nomogram demonstrated a good agreement for predicting severe anemia in this cohort of sepsis patients, regardless of the absolute ideal or bias-corrected model ( Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 3.

Decision curve analysis of the nomogram is shown in Figure 5 Figure 5. Decision curve analysis for sepsis-associated severe anemia. The Y-axis represents the net benefit. The red line represents the sepsis-associated severe anemia risk nomogram. The gray line represents the assumption that all severe anemia patients have been diagnosed. The black line represents the assumption that there are no patients with sepsis-associated severe anemia. The decision curve showed that if the threshold probability of a patient’s risk of severe anemia was >5% and <75%, using this new nomogram to predict sepsis-associated severe anemia added more benefit than the diagnosed-all-patients scheme or the diagnosed-none scheme. Discussion Nomograms have previously been demonstrated to be useful diagnostic and prognostic tools for predicting patient outcomes in various diseases, and they have been widely applied in many hospitals and clinics. Nomograms are associated with rapid computation through user-friendly digital interfaces, increased accuracy, and more intuitive presentation compared with conventional staging, which promote a better clinical decision-making environment for providers.  16  17  18  19 Sepsis induces a wide range of effects in RBCs, including a massive release of hemoglobin and changes in cell volume, metabolism, morphology, antioxidant status, and membrane protein composition. 3 5  20  20 Of the 252 sepsis patients included in the study, 42% developed severe anemia. Globally, sepsis continues to pose a major challenge, with substantial mortality despite advances in critical care. Historically, mortality rates have ranged from 30% to 50% or higher. Although improvements in early diagnosis and timely interventions have contributed to a decline in mortality rates, our study revealed a 30-day mortality rate of approximately 60%, which significantly exceeds the global averages. 1 21 Klebsiella pneumoniae Acinetobacter baumannii Staphylococcus aureus All patients underwent routine blood tests daily; some patients already had severe anemia upon admission, while others progressively developed this complication during hospitalization. In the risk factor analysis, age, length of ICU stay, nutritional method, and APACHE II score were independently associated with severe anemia. The nomogram suggests that these four factors are keys to determining severe anemia risk in sepsis patients. It is well known that age plays an important role in sepsis-associated anemia. In older adults, anemia can be attributed to nutritional deficiency, bleeding, or unexplained causes. Unexplained anemia might be explained by various factors, including reduced EPO activity and deteriorating hematopoietic function of bone marrow.  22  23 Nutritional method also seems to play a significant role in the development of anemia during sepsis. All participants in our study were divided into two groups based on nutritional support type: liquid food or fasting and water deprivation. The latter group was supported with parenteral or enteral nutrition to guarantee their daily dietary requirements. A majority of patients in the severe anemia group required absolute fasting and water deprivation and were supported by parenteral nutrition, and this proportion was significantly higher than that in the nonsevere anemia group. Although parenteral or enteral nutrition provides most of the essential daily energy and protein needs, these preparations cannot fully supply the nutrients required for hematopoiesis compared with liquid food. For example, iron, as an essential nutrient to promote the synthesis of RBCs, was previously shown as insufficient for those with total nutritional support.  24  25 Previous studies have shown that nonsurvivors present with significantly more severe anemia and higher APACHE II scores in sepsis. Sepsis patients with APACHE II scores above 14 were previously shown to be associated with higher risk of death.  26  20 Sepsis patients with severe anemia had worse outcomes than those without, demonstrating that an individualized tool to predict anemia risk might improve patient outcomes through more personalized interventions.  27  28  29 Having a reliable and accurate prognostic tool will assist physicians in determining the risk of severe anemia in sepsis, allowing more time for appropriate therapeutic strategies in each patient, precluding testing in low-risk situations, and promoting additional supportive treatments when there is a high probability of a favorable NB. In our cohort, a small subset of sepsis patients presented with severe anemia upon admission, while others developed severe anemia progressively during hospitalization.  30  31 Our study has several limitations. First, as a retrospective study, it may be less reliable for drawing definitive conclusions. Additionally, the relatively small sample size (252 patients) limits the generalizability of our findings, which may only represent a subset of sepsis patients. Second, although univariable analysis identified nine clinical and demographic factors related to sepsis-associated severe anemia, only four remained independently predictive in the multivariable analysis after adjusting for confounders. Whether any of the remaining variables (e.g. duration of mechanical ventilation, CRRT) are significantly associated with anemia remains unclear and requires further investigation in larger patient cohorts. Finally, although the robustness of our nomogram was extensively evaluated through internal validation using bootstrapping, external validation was not performed. Therefore, the generalizability of these findings to the broader global sepsis population remains uncertain. Conclusion This study developed and tested a nomogram to assist clinicians in predicting the risk of severe anemia in sepsis patients at the time of admission to the hospital and at the onset of sepsis therapy. The nomogram offers a straightforward presentation, incorporating four readily available clinical indicators—age, length of ICU stay, nutritional method, and APACHE II score—which were identified as independent predictors of this complication. By having an estimate of individual risk for this complication in each patient, clinicians can take a more personalized approach in high-risk patients, either through more intensive monitoring or prophylactic therapies, to prevent severe anemia and thereby minimize the need for blood transfusions. External validation is needed to assess the sensitivity and specificity of this nomogram in future studies.
