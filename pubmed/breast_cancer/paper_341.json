The comprehensive dissection of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells redefined cell subsets with different regulations, tissue preferences, and functional potentials and provided an atlas as a rich resource with promising applications. Abstract Dendritic cells (DC) are pivotal orchestrators of antitumor immunity. DC-based antitumor treatments are being actively developed, but effective clinical responses have not yet been achieved. Further exploration of DC heterogeneity in the tumor microenvironment and across cancer types could provide insights for developing DC-based immunotherapies. In this study, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data of DCs from more than 2,500 samples across 33 cancer types and established a comprehensive blueprint of human DCs.

We identified 10 major DC subpopulations, among which, cDC2s were subsequently divided into seven subsets. We revealed the varied yet widespread presence of rare DC subsets, such as AS DCs and Langerhans cell (LC)–like DCs, in all cancer types and discussed their different functional potentials marked with distinct transcriptomic characteristics. We also showed the two application directions of the DC atlas: developing a DC classifier to guide subsequent DC single-cell analysis and prioritizing DC-based immunotherapy targets. Overall, this DC atlas provides the blueprint of tumor-infiltrating DCs and could serve as a valuable resource in the field of tumor immunology. Materials and Methods scRNA-seq datasets collected in this study We collected 158 datasets generated with the 10x Genomics (RRID: SCR_023672) platform from published studies (Supplementary Table S1; see Data availability), which covered 33 cancer types and included samples of tumors, adjacent normal tissues, premalignant and metastatic lesions, healthy tissues, and healthy and patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as normal and metastatic lymph nodes. After quality controls and three rounds of unsupervised clustering, we removed cells of low quality and potential doublets (as described below), and finally, we obtained scRNA-seq data of DCs in 2,516 samples from 1,507 donors (Supplementary Table S1). To evaluate the differences and similarities between LCs from tumors and healthy skin tissues, we collected seven additional datasets ( GSE183047 GSE173706 GSE153760 GSE186476 GSE179633 GSE138669 GSE236581 GSE243013 DCTypist scRNA-seq data processing, dimension reduction, and unsupervised clustering For most of the datasets, we downloaded processed count matrixes. For other datasets, we downloaded fastq files and then they were aligned to the GRCh38 human reference genome and quantified using the CellRanger (RRID: SCR_017344) Single-Cell Software Suite (v7.2.0) to acquire the count matrixes. Further quality control was applied to cells: cells expressing less than 200 genes and more than 20% mitochondrial gene count were filtered out. Next, we removed potential doublets predicted by Scrublet (v0.2.3, RRID: SCR_018098; ref. 25 26 scanpy normalize_total scanpy.pp.log1p scanpy.pp.highly_variable_genes sc.pp.scale scanpy.tl.pca svd_solver = ‘arpack n_comps = 50 harmony 27 sc.pp.neighbors n_neighbors = 10 n_pcs = 30. scanpy.tl.umap Leiden scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups Totally, we performed three rounds of unsupervised clustering following the above-described workflow to characterize myeloid cells, DCs, and DC subpopulations, respectively.

Hyperparameter selection To optimize model performance, we conducted a structured hyperparameter search: Step 1: initial screening. Candidate hyperparameters (e.g., balanced cell-type sampling, mini-batch size, stochastic gradient descent settings, highly variable gene thresholds, epochs, and regularization strength α) were preselected based on established CellTypist benchmarks. Step 2: train–test split. The dataset was split into 70% training and 30% test subsets. Hyperparameters were optimized exclusively on the training set. Step 3: evaluation and final selection. For each hyperparameter combination, a model was trained on the training subset and evaluated on the test subset using adjusted Rand index, normalized mutual information, and accuracy. The combination with the highest average metric score on the test set was selected as optimal. ii. Model training with robust sampling To enhance generalizability, we implemented a strict holdout validation strategy: Random splits without replacement. We generated 40 distinct train–test splits (70:30 ratio) using unique random seeds, ensuring no overlap between training and test subsets. Model diversity. For each split, a separate model was trained using the preselected optimal hyperparameters. All 40 models retained their weights for downstream ensemble prediction. iii. Model ensemble prediction Aggregation. During inference, predictions from all 40 models were aggregated via model averaging to produce the final prediction. This approach reduces variance and enhances generalizability. External validation.

These samples covered 33 cancer types and included tumors, adjacent normal tissues, premalignant and metastatic lesions, healthy tissues, and healthy and patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as normal and metastatic lymph nodes ( Fig. 1A Figure 1.

Based on the expression pattern of the immune cell marker CD45 ( PTPRC CD68 CD14 LYZ ITGAM ITGAX To characterize the transcriptional heterogeneity of DCs, we further carried out unsupervised clustering and identified 10 DC subsets with distinct signatures ( Fig. 1B Fig. 1C 2 LAMP3 + 21 22 24 39 MKI67 CD207 40 AXL CD5 SIGLEC6 19 41 We also identified three rare subsets, delineated by the high expression of transcription factors TRIM33 GTF2IRD1 RUNX3, 42 43 Fig. 1D RUNX1, SEMA4D, RBPJ, ZEB2, RUNX2, FLT3, NFIL3 TCF7 Fig. 1E 19 31 44 45 46 19 31 Unlike macrophages, which exhibit distinct subsets across different cancer types ( 2 Fig. 1F LAMP3 + LAMP3 + Altogether, our comprehensive DC characterization illustrated rare DC subsets that were less characterized within tumors cDC2s exhibited diverse states with different functional potentials in the TME In line with the previous report ( 2 23 Fig. 2A 28 Fig. 2B C FCN1 VCAN C1QC C1QA C1QC + 19 23 47 CXCL9/10 ISG15 IFIT1 2 CCR7 HSP1A1 STR 4 Figure 2. cDC2 subsets exhibited diverse functional potentials in the TME.

In contrast to adjacent normal tissues, cDC2_C1QC, cDC2_ISG15, and cDC2_CXCL9 were enriched in tumor tissues at both pan-cancer level ( Fig. 2D Fig. 2E Fig. 2F AS DC was a rare but widely presented tumor-enriched DC subset As mentioned above, we identified a rare DC subset, representing the previously identified AS DC ( 19 41 Fig. 3A Fig. 3B Figure 3. DC atlas revealed a rare AS DC subset enriched in the TME. A, n P B, n C, D, E, AS DC was reported as a transitional state between cDC2 and pDC, characterized by the expression of a spectrum of both cDC2 and pDC signatures ( 19 19 48 Fig. 3C CD5 48 Fig. 3D CD80 Next, we investigated the intracellular transcriptional regulation of AS DC in tumors by applying the SCENIC approach ( Fig. 3E 33 , 49 52 53 54 42 55 56 57 An LC-like DC subset in the TME exhibited immunosuppressive phenotypes LCs were commonly considered enriched in stratified squamous epithelia ( 58 59 32 60 CD207 CD1A Fig. 4A Fig. 4B Figure 4. An LC-like DC subset in the TME exhibited immunosuppressive phenotypes. A, n P B, n n C, D, P E, F, HLA-DQA2 HLA-DQB2 n LAMP3 + G, n H, To better decipher the tumor-specific transcriptomic characteristics of this DC subset, we additionally collected seven single-cell transcriptomic datasets of skin from healthy donors (Supplementary Fig. S4G; Supplementary Table S1) and integrated these data with the data of LC-like cells from both cutaneous and noncutaneous tumors. Through comparative analysis, we identified different gene expression patterns in tumor-associated LC-like cells and LCs from normal skin, whereas LC-like cells from cutaneous tumors share both phenotypes ( Fig. 4C Fig. 4D 32 32 Fig. 4E HLA-DQA2 HLA-DQB2 Fig. 4F 61 in vitro 32 Fig. 4G Considering the distinct transcriptomic characteristics of tumor-associated LC-like cells and the skin-resident LCs, we reasoned that the tumor-associated LC-like cells may be derived from other DCs in noncutaneous tissues, thus inspiring us to assess their similarity with other DC subsets. Among all DC subsets, cDC2 was predicted as one of the main origins of the LC-like subset ( Fig. 4H 62 Distinct cellular origins were associated with the pleiotropic functional potentials of LAMP3 + Previous studies from us and others have demonstrated the enrichment of LAMP3 + 2 21 22 24 39 2 LAMP3 + LAMP3 + Fig. 2A 35 36 LAMP3 + LAMP3 + LAMP3 + Fig. 5A LAMP3 + LAMP3 + LAMP3 + LAMP3 + Figure 5.

By comparing DCs in tumors with their counterparts from adjacent normal tissues ( Fig. 6E LAMP3 + TAP1 TAP2 CD40 TMEM176A TMEM176B 68 TMEM176B 69 70 First, we overexpressed TMEM176A and TMEM176B along with ZsGreen on the mouse DC2.4 cell line via a lentiviral vector. ZsGreen-high single clones from TMEM176A or TMEM176B overexpressing (OE) and empty vector (EV)–transduced DC2.4 groups were sorted, cultured, and re-tested by flow cytometry ( Fig. 6F OE OE OE OE Fig. 6G Discussion We established an integrative DC atlas containing 217,557 DCs from different tissues to systematically characterize the tissue distribution and gene expression heterogeneities of DCs. We identified three rare DC subsets, two highly expressed genes reported as pre-DC signatures. Several studies have depicted the transcriptomic characteristics of DC precursors in human bone marrow and peripheral blood, reporting both common and unique gene regulatory networks ( 19 31 41 71 Taking advantage of our DC atlas, we redefined the subsets of cDC2s and investigated their distinct functional potentials in tumors. It is commonly recognized that the terminal differentiated cells have limited phenotypic plasticity. Our observation highlighted the remodeling of cDC2s in pathologic states. Interestingly, we discovered that certain genes, which were highly expressed in some other cell types, were also expressed in the subclusters of cDC2s. To be exact, complement component genes, such as C1QC C1QA 2 39 72 CXCL9, AS DC has been reported as pre-cDC2 in human blood ( 41 57 67 73 RUNX2 FLT3 Furthermore, we have identified an LC-like subpopulation that was prevalent across various cancer types, underscoring the important roles that this subset may play in oncology. LC, as a skin-resident cell type, has been extensively studied in cutaneous tissues ( 58 32  LAMP3 + 74 LAMP3 + LAMP3 + 21 22 LAMP3 + 65 63 65 IL15 CCL19 CXCL9 LAMP3 + LAMP3 + LAMP3 + + LAMP3 + Additionally, our study demonstrated the pivotal application potentials of our DC atlas, which serves as a precise reference for annotating DC subsets and identifying prospective targets for DC-based immunotherapies. To further extend the application of our DC atlas, we developed an interactive web browser (118.190.148.166:8925) for analyzing and visualizing our integrative single-cell data. In summary, our comprehensive dissection of tumor-infiltrating DCs redefined DC subsets with different regulations, tissue preferences, and functional potentials. In addition to these uncovered cellular insights in DC immunology, our DC atlas also serves as a rich resource with promising application perspectives. Limitations of the study Our study has several limitations. First, distinguishing proliferating DCs from macrophages proved challenging because of their high transcriptional similarity, particularly for cDC2s.
