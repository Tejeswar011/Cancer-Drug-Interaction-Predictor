This study aimed to combine multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) radiomic features with clinical characteristics to construct a machine learning model for accurately predicting the risk of recurrence within 2 years postoperatively in NMIBC patients. Retrospectively including 183 NMIBC patients (57 in the recurrence group, 126 in the non-recurrence group), radiomic features from mp-MRI imaging (T2W, ADC, and enhancement sequences) were extracted. Through LASSO selection, 4 key imaging features (MajorAxisLength, SZNN, S/V, Skewness) and 6 clinical features based on the EAU 2021 risk stratification were identified to constitute the clinical-imaging dataset. Through comparison with 10 machine learning models, Support Vector Machine (SVM) performed the best (training set AUC = 0.973, validation set AUC = 0.891), with external independent validation (108 cases) showing AUCs of 0.88 and 0.87, demonstrating good generalization ability. A bar chart integrating radiomics score (Rad-Score) with clinical features provides an intuitive prognostic tool. The study indicates that the clinical-imaging radiomics model based on SVM significantly enhances the efficacy of NMIBC recurrence prediction, addressing the shortcomings of traditional risk assessment and offering a reliable basis for personalized postoperative management. Study limitations include the retrospective design and the absence of molecular biomarkers, necessitating future multicenter prospective validation.

Globally, more than 500,000 new diagnoses and approximately 200,000 deaths are reported annually [ 1 2 3 5 6 8 9 12 13 14 The concept of radiomics was first proposed by Lambin et al. in 2012. The main process includes five key steps: obtaining imaging data, delineating tumor regions, segmenting tumor areas, extracting and quantifying features, and classifying and predicting [ 15 16 Method Clinical data A total of 183 BCa patients from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University, retrospectively collected from January 2017 to January 2023. Patients who were pathologically confirmed to have bladder cancer with local recurrence within 2 years (excluding distant metastasis) were defined as the recurrence group, while the rest were defined as the non-recurrence group. Clinical characteristics of the patients were collected, including age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and risk factors based on the EAU 2021 risk stratification table: histological grade, tumor stage, maximum tumor diameter, solitary/multiple tumors, and risk stratification (Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Clinical characteristics of NMIBC patients between recurrence and non-recurrence groups. Bar and box plots display significant differences in key clinical variables (age, T stage, tumor grade, size, and multiplicity) between patients with and without recurrence ( n Imaging image collection The following parameter settings were used to obtain high quality images and accurately assess tumor staging during BCa scanning using a GE Premier 3.0T MRI device.1. MRI device: Device model: GE Premier 3.0T, Coil: Multi-Channel Phased Array Abdominal Coil.2. Scanning sequences and parameters: ① T2 weighted imaging (T2WI), 2D Fast Spin Echo (2D FSE/TSE), layer thickness: 3-4 mm, echo time (TE): 80-100 ms, ② Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), Spin Echo Plane Echo Imaging (EPI), b-value: 0, 1000 s/mm 2 Tumor region of interest (ROI) outlining and feature extraction ROIs of bladder tumors were obtained by outlining mpMRI images of all patients using 3D-Slicer software using a manual approach, with the following sequences selected: early and late stages of T2W, ADC, and enhancement sequences. Images were resampled to a voxel size of 1 × 1 × 1mm 3 Construction of clinical-imaging dataset and construction and evaluation of models The features with statistically significant differences between the 2 sets of comparisons were included (repeated validation of the EAU risk assessment table), and the influencing factors of the joint clinical and imaging features, a total of 10 features, were used to construct the clinical-imaging histology dataset. Predictive models were constructed using this dataset integrated into machine learning algorithms, and the 10 machine learning models included Decision Tree (DT), K-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN), LinearSupport Vector Machine Classification. Linear SVC), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) Support Vector Machine (SVM), GradientBoosting algorithm (GDB), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). Perceptron (MLP), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), AdaptiveBoosting (AdaBoost), and Logistic Regression Model (LR). Additional imaging features alone were used to form a Rad-Score score in conjunction with the five clinical features of the EAU2021 risk stratification to construct a column-line graph. The predictive effects of all models were expressed in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, and the efficacy was expressed in terms of ROC, which was supplemented by clinical decision curves and calibration curves for evaluation. The final screening was done to select an optimal machine learning model from it. Data processing was performed using SPSS 27.0 and Python 3.11. Validation of the optimal model across different departments To evaluate the generalizability of the model within a single-center setting, internal validation was conducted using data collected from different inpatient wards of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University. Although MRI examinations were performed using the same GE Premier 3.0T system across all wards, the imaging process was carried out by different technical teams. Patient inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical to those used in the training cohort. Each ward contributed data equivalent to 30% of the original sample size (n1 = 54, n2 = 54), and the optimal model was applied without modifying its parameters. The clinical-imaging datasets from these different wards were used to validate the robustness and stability of the model (Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Workflow of model development and validation.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the SVM model applied to external dataset 1 ( n Fig. 9 External validation ROC curve – Yunnan Cancer Hospital. ROC curve from external validation dataset 2 ( n Discussion Our model was carefully checked and validated with external data, and had relatively good results. The training set AUC of our SVM is 0.9653 (95% Cl,0.9513–0.9793) and the validation set AUC is 0.8905 (95% Cl,0.8569–0.9241), and the performance in external validation is also stable. We chose the ADC sequence to be added to our outlined sequence, which can be used to describe the speed and extent of molecular diffusion movement in different directions in DWI sequences, and has advantages in showing tumors with tightly packed cells and little interstitial water. It has been suggested that ADC features are more expressive of changes in healthy regional tissues than T2W features, and have a higher sensitivity to malignant changes in healthy tissues [ 17 18 20 21 22 23 24 25 Four image features were filtered in our model. shape_MajorAxisLength (3D) image feature contributes the highest, it belongs to shape Features (3D), which is essentially a shape feature. One study used selection of clinical parameters from nasopharyngeal and head and neck cancer patient datasets to select image biomarkers (IBMs) from the nasopharyngeal cancer dataset, and multivariate Cox regression analyses identified 3 independent IBMs containing MajorAxisLength. majorAXisLength of lymph nodes (> 55 mm) was associated with an increased risk of death. This feature was significantly smaller for N1 than for N2 and N3 in TNM staging of metastatic patients, and when IBMs were added to the clinical model, the c index increased from 0.72 to 0.75 (95% CI: 0.68–0.82, p p 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 In addition to the imaging features, the clinical features included in our model were derived from repeated validation based on the EAU risk scale. It was found that almost all T1 tumors were able to be included in the high-risk and very high-risk groups. The lamina propria (LP) of the bladder, located between the epithelial mucosa and the lamina propria of the urothelium, consists of extracellular matrix, several cell types, and collagen fibers types i and iii, and is a determinant of Ta progression to T1. It has been concluded that T1 tumors have a significantly higher risk of recurrence than Ta tumors, and the poor prognosis and high recurrence rate of T1G3 patients have been mentioned in several publications [ 34 35 36 37 38 P 39 P P P P 40 41 42 Conclusion This study has some limitations, and as a retrospective study, there may be some selection bias. Despite the standard processing we adopted for MRI images, there is still subjective bias of operation during the acquisition of raw images. Also manual outlining of ROIs may have human error because of subjectivity. Our study did not use molecular biomarkers and lacked comprehensiveness. Although external validation was done and surgeries were performed by an experienced team, there are potential surgical and management differences such as personal habits of physicians. The lack of data on immunoperfusion and in situ cancer patients is also lacking. In summary, the SVM clinical-imaging feature model can well predict the recurrence of NMIBC within 2 years after TURBT + chemoperfusion therapy, which strengthens the clinical application of EAU risk stratification, and provides a novel and efficient tool for individualized recurrence risk assessment in NMIBC patients.
