Our aim was to evaluate plasma Gal1/9 differences between IMID patients and healthy donors (HD). We analyzed 980 plasma samples divided into two analytical cohorts (600 discovery group and 380 validation group). Generalized linear models estimated Gal1/9 levels, adjusting for sex, age, storage time, and plate variability. In the overall IMID group, plasma Gal1 levels were comparable to those of HD, while Gal9 levels were significantly elevated. Levels varied across individual diseases: SLE patients consistently showed the highest Gal1/9 levels compared to both HD and other IMIDs, and RA patients had elevated Gal9 levels versus HD. Both Gal1 and Gal9 plasma levels correlated positively with higher disease activity, and Gal1 was higher in patients with longer disease duration. After adjustment for these confounders, SLE and RA patients maintained the highest Gal9 levels compared to HD. Our study demonstrates that Gal1 and Gal9 are differentially expressed across IMIDs, with particularly elevated levels in SLE, and both galectins are associated with disease activity. immune-mediated inflammatory diseases Galectin-1 Galectin-9 biomarkers Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (Instituto de Salud Carlos III, ISCIII) European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) RD24/0007/0006 PI21/00526 PI24/00138 Horizon Europe program 101080711 This work was supported by grants RD24/0007/0006, PI21/00526, and PI24/00138 to IG-A from Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (Instituto de Salud Carlos III, ISCIII), co-funded by European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) “A way to make Europe” and the project SPIDeRR funded by the Horizon Europe program under grant agreement 101080711. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are a broad group of disorders characterized by abnormal immune responses that lead to inflammation, tissue damage, and, in many cases, long-term complications. Examples of IMIDs are rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis (PS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), spondyloarthritis (SpA), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The prevalence of IMIDs in Western society is around 5–7% [ 1 2 Although multiple factors may interact to promote the development of IMIDs, it is generally believed that most of these disorders arise due to a deficiency in immune tolerance or an imbalance between activation and termination of the immune response [ 3 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 Galectins are β-galactoside-binding animal lectins expressed in many tissues and organs, which show their highest expression in the immune system, where they regulate its homeostasis [ 10 11 10 12 13 14 15 16 Galectin 1 (Gal1) acts as a dual regulator of the immune system, playing protective or anti-inflammatory roles in some contexts (autoimmune diseases, allergies, atherosclerosis) while exacerbating pathological processes in others (cancer, infections, osteoarthritis) [ 12 16 17 13 16 17 Galectin-9 (Gal9), as Gal1, acts as an immunomodulator that regulates both adaptive and innate immune responses. In T cells, Gal9 binds to receptors such as TIM-3, promoting apoptosis of pathogenic Th1/Th17 pathways, expanding Tregs, and therefore limiting effector T cell responses [ 18 Beyond T cells, Gal9 also inhibits TLR7/TLR9-mediated activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and B cells, thereby reducing type I interferon secretion and autoantibody production [ 19 20 Both galectins are differentially expressed depending on the inflammatory milieu, thereby influencing leukocyte recruitment, activation, and polarization toward pro- or anti-inflammatory phenotypes [ 21 13 21 22 22 21 2. Results 2.1. Study Population We analyzed a total of 980 plasma samples divided into two analytical cohorts: 600 samples in the discovery group (group 1) and 380 in the validation group (group 2). Of these, 150 were from healthy donors (HD) and 830 from patients with IMIDs, including 150 with RA, 165 with PsA, 165 with PS, 150 with SLE, 100 with UC, and 100 with CD. The main characteristics of these populations are presented in Table 1 n n n n 2.2. Gal1 and Gal9 Plasma Levels in Different IMIDs Plasma Gal1 levels in the overall IMID group were comparable to those of HD, both in group 1 (22.6 [17.2–31.05] vs. 23.5 [18.9–28.2]; p p Figure 1 p p Supplementary Table S1 p p Unlike Gal1, plasma Gal9 levels were significantly higher in the overall IMID group compared to HD in both cohorts (group 1 (5.3 [3.6–7.5] vs. 3.8 [2.9–4.8]; p p p Figure 1 Supplementary Table S2 On the other hand, PsA patients showed only a trend toward increased levels vs. HD ( p p p p p 2.3. Association of Gal1 and Gal9 Plasma Levels with Disease Activity and Disease Duration Given the broad variability in Gal1 and Gal9 levels across IMIDs, we hypothesized that disease duration or DA could contribute to this heterogeneity. To assess this contribution, DA was standardized into a common categorical variable using disease-specific activity indices to define the categories in each disease, as described in the Methods section. When analyzing DA in the overall population, we observed a significant positive trend toward higher plasma levels of Gal1 ( p p Figure 2 p p Supplementary Figure S1 p p p Supplementary Figure S2 Additionally, we compared patients with early-stage (<5 years) and late-stage (≥5 years) IMIDs ( Figure 2 p Figure 3 Figure 3 Supplementary Table S3 p p Figure 3 Supplementary Table S4 p p After adjusting for DA and stratifying by disease duration, patients with PsA showed significantly lower Gal1 plasma levels ( p p p Figure 3 Supplementary Table S3 Figure 3 Supplementary Table S4 3. Discussion The main strength of this study lies in demonstrating that plasma levels of Gal1 and Gal9 are dysregulated in patients with IMIDs, through an assessment within the same population and across two independent cohorts. Our findings suggest that plasma levels of Gal1 and particularly Gal9 are generally elevated in IMIDs compared to HD, with galectin levels influenced by disease activity in both cases and by disease duration in the case of Gal1. These results reinforce a potential role for galectins in the pathophysiology of IMIDs as key regulators of immune and inflammatory responses [ 13 14 It is worth noting that SLE was the only IMID in which both Gal1 and Gal9 levels were consistently elevated compared to HD across both cohorts. Furthermore, these results remained significant after adjustment by disease duration and disease activity. Gal9 was also increased in RA, whereas findings for other IMIDs versus HD were inconsistent between the two study populations. However, after adjustment by disease activity level, all IMIDs except PS showed increased Gal9 plasma levels. The differential levels of Gal9 and Gal1 observed across IMIDs can be interpreted in light of their dual immunoregulatory roles and the predominant immune pathways in each condition [ 21 12 13 16 17 19 12 13 16 17 19 21 23 24 25 26 To the best of our knowledge, our study provides the first description in the literature of plasma galectin levels across all these IMIDs within the same population. Previous studies focused on individual IMIDs had already reported increased plasma levels of Gal1 in patients compared to controls in RA [ 21 22 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 Once it was established that these galectins could be elevated in certain IMIDs, our study aimed to identify differences between some of them. Remarkably, the highest levels of both Gal1 and, especially, Gal9 were observed in SLE patients compared to those with other IMIDs, a finding that was replicated in both cohorts. Interestingly, PsA patients exhibited significantly lower Gal9 levels compared to RA patients in both cohorts; however, lower Gal1 levels were observed in the discovery cohort, but this result was not replicated in the validation cohort. Previous evidence from our group had suggested that Gal1 levels in both serum and synovial fluid were higher in early RA compared to SpA [ 36 37 34 Although we cannot draw firm conclusions at this stage, these findings may be useful in distinguishing certain clinical patterns in some IMIDS—for example, in cases of undifferentiated arthritis, where SLE, RA, PsA, and osteoarthritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis. In our analysis in IBD, we were also unable to establish consistent differences in Gal1 or Gal9 levels between CD and UC. Previous studies in IBD have reported no differences in Gal1 and Gal9 plasma levels between CD and UC [ 27 38 39 Given the anti-inflammatory properties of Gal1 and Gal9 [ 12 13 14 15 16 40 22 37 30 41 42 43 44 45 43 46 In the case of SLE, our data confirmed an association between Gal9 plasma levels (not confirmed for Gal1) and higher DA, consistent with previous studies using the SLEDAI-2K index or the type I IFN gene signature [ 21 47 48 49 50 51 47 48 As for SLE, patients with PS exhibited a trend to higher plasma Gal9 levels correlating with PS activity, which were not observed for Gal1; however, other studies found no differences in Gal1 or Gal9 levels [ 29 34 27 38 52 27 35 Some limitations of this study must be considered: (a) the cross-sectional design does not allow us to determine whether galectin levels vary over time during patient follow-up, nor does it allow us to confirm whether Gal1 remains stable over time in other IMIDs, as previously observed in RA and SpA [ 22 36 53 54 55 56 30 41 42 43 46 31 32 48 49 4. Methods 4.1. Patients and Samples In this study, we requested plasma samples from patients diagnosed with six different IMIDs, including RA, PsA, SLE, IBD (ulcerative colitis [UC], Crohn’s disease [CD]), and PS, as well as HD from different sources. The samples from 830 patients were provided by Hospital Universitario Vall d’Hebron Biobank, collected by the Immune Mediated Inflammatory Disease Consortium (IMIDC) between June 2007 and December 2010. HD samples from 150 individuals were collected from IIS-IP Biobank and Spanish National DNA Bank Carlos III (Salamanca University). Samples were collected during patient follow-up after the initial diagnosis and were sequentially assigned to one of two groups based on their order of arrival at our center: a discovery group (1) and a subsequent validation group (2). Galectin determination was conducted in batches at two different time points in each group (2022 and 2024). We included patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a single IMID, excluding those with more than one IMID. Diagnostic and inclusion criteria for each IMID were as follows: RA: American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for RA [ 57 PsA: Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) [ 58 PS: diagnosis based on the dermatologist clinical criteria. IBD: diagnosed according to the standard Lennard-Jones criteria for CD and UC [ 59 SLE: 1982 revised ACR criteria for SLE classification [ 60 4.2. Measurement of Gal1 and Gal9 Plasma Levels in HD and IMID Population Gal1 and Gal9 were measured in plasma samples from all patients and HD by using the Human Galectin-1 Quantikine ELISA Kit DGAL10 (R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN, USA), and the Human Galectin-9 Quantikine ELISA Kit DGAL90 (R&D Systems; Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All samples were tested in duplicate in each plate, and, to minimize the influence of inter-assay variability, samples from the different IMIDs were included in every plate. Once the procedure for each ELISA was performed, plates were immediately read in a spectrophotometer (Innogenetics Diagnóstica y Terapéutica S.A.U, Barcelona, Spain) Absorbance was measured at 450 nm with correction at 620 nm. 4.3. Statistical Analysis The time of sample collection; demographic, laboratory, and disease-related data; and treatment patterns were provided by Hospital Universitario Vall d’Hebron Biobank. Differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between the discovery and validation populations, as well as across different diseases, were analyzed. For plasma levels of Gal1 and Gal9, their variations across different IMID diagnoses and their relationship with disease duration and moderate or high disease activity (DA) were analyzed. To allow comparative analyses across the cohort, a unified DA variable was created, classifying each patient into one of three activity levels (remission/low, moderate, and high DA). DA was assessed using validated indices specific to each condition, applying the following cut-off values to categorize remission/low, moderate, and high DA, respectively: DAS-28 ≥ 3.2 and ≥5.1 for PsA and RA [ 61 62 63 64 65 Most quantitative variables showed a non-normal distribution and were therefore presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). The Mann–Whitney U test or Kruskal–Wallis test was used to assess significant differences in Gal1 and Gal9 plasma levels according to clinical or laboratory variables and across different diagnostic groups. Bonferroni correction was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons, with p 22 5. Conclusions Our study revealed that plasma levels of Gal1 and Gal9 are differentially regulated across various IMIDs, with particularly elevated levels observed in SLE patients compared to other IMIDs. Additionally, Gal1 and Gal9 may serve as biomarkers for monitoring disease activity, with Gal1 potentially influenced by disease duration. While our data validate the utility of Gal9 in RA and SLE, we also highlight the need to further explore the role of Gal1 in both diseases.
