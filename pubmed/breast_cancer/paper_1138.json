Introduction Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a growing global health concern, affecting nearly one-fifth of the population in the United States of America and Europe, with a rising incidence in Southeast Asia [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 The current management of MetS focuses on addressing the risk factors and targeting the individual components of MetS. Therapeutic approaches aim to regulate anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, glycemic levels, and lipid levels [ 7 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Rice bran has emerged as a promising functional food for MetS management due to its rich nutritional profile and bioactive compounds. Derived from rice during the milling process, rice bran is abundant in dietary fiber, γ-oryzanol, tocopherols, tocotrienols, and essential fatty acids like oleic and linoleic acids [ 16 17 18 19 18 19 20 Despite growing interest, clinical evidence on rice bran’s broader metabolic effects remains unclear. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have primarily focused on its lipid-lowering properties [ 21 2. Materials and Methods The study was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to ensure rigorous data processing, analysis, and reporting [ 22 2.1. Search Strategy A systematic search of four electronic databases, namely PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Embase, was conducted on 1 January 2024, (with the last update on 30 January 2025) to identify relevant studies. Two reviewers independently performed the literature search to ensure comprehensive coverage and minimize selection bias. The search strategy incorporated key terms related to the intervention (i.e., rice bran, rice bran oil, rice oil, and oryzanol) and the outcome of interest (i.e., body mass index, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C). These domains were combined using the “AND” operator to refine the search. Duplicate records were identified and removed using EndNote (version 21). 2.2. Study Selection and Eligibility Criteria The screening process began with an initial review of titles and abstracts to identify potentially eligible studies. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, and any discrepancies were resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer. The inclusion criteria were limited to RCTs evaluating the effects of rice bran, rice bran oil, or its bioactive compound (oryzanol) supplementation on MetS-related markers compared to a control group. Studies were required to have MetS-related parameters. Studies were excluded if they were in vitro or animal experiments, review articles, case reports, expert opinions, conference proceedings, or book chapters. These sources were excluded due to their lack of peer review, insufficient methodological details, and limited suitability for quantitative synthesis. The screening and selection of eligible studies were conducted independently by two authors. Any disagreements that arose during this process were resolved through consultation with a third author. 2.3. Data Extraction The following information was extracted from the included studies: publication details (first author’s name, journal title, year of publication, and study location), participant characteristics (health status, age, and gender), intervention details (type/form, dosage, and duration of intervention), and outcome measures. The outcomes of interest included MetS-related markers, such as anthropometric parameters (e.g., BMI and waist circumference), blood pressure (e.g., systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)), glycemic parameters (e.g., FBG, HbA1c, and insulin levels), and lipid profiles (e.g., triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C). For each outcome, data were extracted to determine the mean change from the baseline and the corresponding standard deviations (SDs). If a study did not directly report the mean change and SD, or if the SD was unavailable, alternative metrics were used. Imputation was performed following the methods recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [ 23 24 For studies that presented results in a graphical format, the WebPlotDigitizer program [ 25 2.4. Risk of Bias Assessment The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 (RoB2) tool for parallel group randomized trials was used to assess the risk of bias across five domains: (1) the randomization process, (2) deviations from intended interventions, (3) missing outcome data, (4) measurement of the outcome, and (5) selection of the reported result. Each study was categorized as having a low risk of bias, some concerns, or a high risk of bias [ 26 2.5. Quality of Evidence Assessment To evaluate the quality of the included parameters, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria [ 27 2.6. Data Analysis Statistical analyses were conducted using RStudio (R version 4.4.0, Boston, MA, USA) with the “meta” package. Numerical data are presented as means with SDs. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% CIs was calculated using a random-effects model with the restricted maximum-likelihood method. Statistical significance was defined as a p 2 2 28 Subgroup analyses were conducted based on participants’ health conditions (dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, MetS, and healthy individuals), rice bran dosage (≥20 g/day, <20 g/day, and oryzanol), and the duration of intervention (≥90 days or <90 days). Additionally, for continuous outcomes involving more than six studies, meta-regression analysis was performed to examine the effects of rice bran dosage and intervention duration on each parameter. Publication bias was evaluated using a funnel plot, and Egger’s test was applied to detect small-study effects. Forest and funnel plots were generated using the “meta” package, while the “ggplot2” package was used to create the heat map. 3. Results 3.1. Search Results This study identified 3126 articles through a systematic search using predefined search terms. After duplicate removal, 1877 articles remained. Titles and abstracts were screened, and studies not meet the eligibility criteria were excluded. Subsequently, 121 articles underwent full-text assessment, of which 95 did not fulfill the inclusion criteria. Finally, 26 articles were included in this systematic review. The stages of study selection are summarized in the PRISMA flow diagram, as shown in Figure 1 3.2. Study Characteristics and Risk of Bias Assessment The study included 26 articles, comprising 642 participants in the rice bran group and 613 in the control group. The majority of studies were conducted in Asia (n = 18), followed by North America (n = 6) and Europe (n = 2). The study populations included healthy individuals (n = 2), individuals with dyslipidemia (n = 11), individuals with type 2 diabetes (n = 4), metabolic syndrome (n = 3), overweight or obesity (n = 1), colorectal cancer (n = 1), hypertension (n = 2), and others, including overweight/obese individuals with hypercholesterolemia (n = 2). The duration of rice bran supplementation ranged from 28 to 180 days, with 84 days being the most commonly studied period. The administered doses of rice bran varied from 1 to 84 g/d, while the doses of its bioactive compounds supplemented in the formulation or diet ranged from 0.04 to 0.3 g/d ( Table 1 Supplementary Material S16 Table 1 Supplementary Material S16 3.3. Effects of Rice Bran on MetS-Related Parameters 3.3.1.

Effects of Rice Bran on Lipid Profiles Effect of Rice Bran on Triglyceride Levels The effect of rice bran on triglyceride levels was evaluated in 19 studies, including 459 participants in the intervention groups and 440 in the control groups. The pooled analysis using a random-effects model revealed no significant difference in triglyceride concentration following rice bran consumption when compared to the control (WMD: −7.570 mg/dL; 95% CI: −16.714 to 1.573; p Figure 2 2 p Supplementary Material S8 Effects of Rice Bran on Total Cholesterol Levels A total of 21 studies from the included studies (517 participants in the intervention groups and 495 in the control groups) examined the effect of rice bran on total cholesterol levels, revealing a significant reduction in serum total cholesterol concentration (WMD: −13.594 mg/dL; 95% CI: −20.289 to −6.900; p Figure 2 2 p Supplementary Material S9 Effect of Rice Bran on LDL-C Levels In an analysis of 22 studies involving 536 participants who received rice bran and 512 receiving a control, rice bran showed a significant reduction in LDL-C (WMD: −14.580 mg/dL; 95% CI: −21.124 to −8.036; p Figure 2 2 p Supplementary Material S10 Effect of Rice Bran on HDL-C Levels A meta-analysis of 20 studies, involving 487 participants in the intervention groups and 467 in the control groups, indicated that rice bran consumption resulted in a significant increase in HDL-C (WMD: 3.074 mg/dL; 95% CI: 0.829 to 5.319; p Figure 2 2 p Supplementary Material S11 3.4. Subgroup Analysis Subgroup analyses were conducted based on participants’ health conditions, rice bran dosage, and the duration of the intervention. 3.4.1. Participants’ Health Conditions In Figure 3 Supplementary Material S12c In terms of glycemic improvement, rice bran supplementation resulted in a significant decrease in FBG in individuals with MetS (WMD: −17.280 mg/dL; 95% CI: −30.900 to −3.660) ( Supplementary Material S12e Supplementary Material S12f Lipid-lowering effects were observed across various health conditions. Significant reductions in triglycerides were noted in individuals with dyslipidemia (WMD: −22.490 mg/dL; 95% CI: −24.570 to −20.420), type 2 diabetes (WMD: −0.500 mg/dL; 95% CI: −0.630 to −0.370), and MetS (WMD: −32.880 mg/dL; 95% CI: −51.700 to −14.070) ( Supplementary Material S12h Supplementary Material S12i Supplementary Material S12j Supplementary Material S12k 3.4.2. Rice Bran Dosage (≥20 g/d, <20 g/d, or Oryzanol) Subgroup analysis based on rice bran dosage (≥20 g/d, <20 g/d, or oryzanol) revealed that the high dosage of ≥20 g/d significantly impacted various MetS-related parameters. Specifically, a significant reduction in both SBP (WMD: −4.820 mmHg; 95% CI: −8.880 to −0.760) and DBP (WMD: −4.840 mmHg; 95% CI: −7.970 to −1.700) was observed. Additionally, a significant reduction in HbA1c was noted in participants consuming ≥20 g/d of rice bran (WMD: −0.250%; 95% CI: −0.430 to −0.070). This dosage also resulted in significant improvements in lipid profiles, including reductions in total cholesterol (WMD: −12.720 mg/dL; 95% CI: −21.130 to −4.320) and LDL-C (WMD: −12.000 mg/dL; 95% CI: −20.420 to −3.590) ( Supplementary Material S15 For participants receiving supplemented oryzanol (ranging from 0.04 to 0.3 g/d), improvements were observed in several MetS-related parameters, including a reduction in BMI (WMD: −0.490 kg/m 2 Supplementary Material S15 3.4.3. Duration of the Intervention (≥90 Days or <90 Days) Subgroup analysis based on the duration of rice bran supplementation showed that both intervention durations (<90 days and ≥90 days) significantly improved HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels. However, supplementation for ≥90 days further improved BMI (WMD: −0.520 kg/m 2 Supplementary Material S15 3.5. Meta-Regression Analysis To explore potential associations, a meta-regression analysis was conducted based on the duration of the intervention and rice bran dosage. In terms of intervention duration, the results indicated a significant association between intervention duration and changes in DBP (coefficient = −3.598; 95% CI: −0.283 to −0.084; p Supplementary Material S13d 3.6. Results of Quality of Evidence Assessment The quality of evidence varied across outcomes. SBP was rated as moderate-quality, while BMI, WC, FBG, and insulin had a low quality of evidence. DBP, HbA1c, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C were classified as very-low-quality evidence ( Table 2 4. Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated 26 clinical trials investigating the effects of rice bran supplementation on MetS-related parameters. Our analysis revealed a statistically significant reduction in SBP, DBP, HbA1c, total cholesterol, and LDL-C levels, along with a significant increase in HDL-C levels among rice bran users when compared to the control groups. These findings suggest that rice bran consumption may be beneficial for improving cardiovascular and glycemic markers in individuals with MetS. However, further well-designed long-term clinical trials are warranted to confirm these effects and evaluate their clinical relevance. This meta-analysis indicates that rice bran has significant blood pressure-lowering effects. The predominant mechanism involves the inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which prevents the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor [ 54 55 56 56 57 18 50 This meta-analysis also observed a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c levels. A clinically meaningful change in glycemic control is generally defined as a difference of 5 mmol/mol (0.5%) [ 58 59 60 61 45 Our findings suggest that rice bran supplementation significantly improves lipid profiles, likely through multiple mechanisms. Rice bran’s bioactive (γ-oryzanol) compounds are known to modulate key metabolic pathways involved in lipid metabolism [ 16 62 63 64 65 The present study observed beneficial effects of rice bran on lipid profiles in the previous analysis, except for triglycerides [ 21 21 21 21 66 67 38 39 68 Our analysis also found that higher doses (≥20 g/d) of rice bran or its bioactive compound (i.e., γ-oryzanol) appeared to enhance several MetS-related parameters, including BMI, SBP, DBP, HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL-C, and HDL-C, suggesting a potential dose-dependent relationship. Consistent with previous meta-analyses, dosages typically ranging from 10 to 30 g/d have been shown to be both safe and effective for health improvements [ 17 19 Although this systematic review and meta-analysis provides valuable insights into the effects of rice bran on MetS-related parameters, several limitations should be acknowledged. First, a high degree of heterogeneity was observed in some parameters, which may be attributed to variations in study design, differences in population demographics (such as ethnicity), and inconsistencies in intervention factors, including rice bran form, dosage, duration, and variability in control groups across studies. Second, concerns regarding the quality of evidence should be noted, as approximately half of the evaluated parameters were classified as having very-low-quality evidence. Therefore, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Third, this study was unable to perform a meta-regression analysis on γ-oryzanol concentration due to the limited number of available studies. This limitation restricts the ability to draw strong conclusions about the association between varying oryzanol concentrations and MetS outcomes. 5. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis highlight the potential benefits of rice bran supplementation in improving MetS-related outcomes, including significant reductions in SBP and DBP, HbA1c, total cholesterol, and LDL-C levels, along with an increase in HDL-C levels. Effective doses of rice bran ranged from 1 to 84 g/d, while the doses of its bioactive compounds ranged from 0.04 to 0.3 g/d, suggesting that rice bran has the potential to be a natural dietary component and a promising functional food for managing MetS. However, future research is needed to confirm these findings, with a focus on its long-term safety and the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects.
