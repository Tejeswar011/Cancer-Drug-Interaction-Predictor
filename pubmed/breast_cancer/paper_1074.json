Introduction Obesity is a multifaceted health issue influenced by abnormal metabolic processes, which is influenced by psychosocial, genetic, and environmental elements [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 8 13 14 Probiotics are live microorganisms that provide health advantages to the host when consumed in sufficient amounts and are recognized for their ability to enhance or restore the gut microbiota [ 15 15 16 12 17 18 15 19 12 14 20 Grains are rich in fiber and oligosaccharides, making them outstanding sources of prebiotics [ 21 21 22 In our recent study, LAB strains were isolated from four types of grains, and certain strains demonstrated enhanced anti-adipogenic effects in C3H10T1/2 cells, alongside fundamental probiotic properties such as viability in acid and bile salts and strong adhesion to Caco-2 cells [ 22 Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 2. Results 2.1. Effects of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG, Pediococcus pentosaceus K28, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum RP12, and Levilactobacillus brevis RP21 on Body Over a period of 7 weeks, variations in body weight were monitored across different groups of mice. The group fed an HFD exhibited a more rapid weight gain ( Supplementary Figure S1A Supplementary Figure S1B Supplementary Figure S1B p Supplementary Figures S1C and S2A p Supplementary Figures S1D and S2B 2.2. Effects of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum RP12 on Body, Visceral Organs, and Fat Tissue Weight In another experiment lasting 10 weeks and involving only HFD and RP12 groups, body weight changes were observed. After 10 weeks, the average weights of the HFD and RP12 groups were 36.59 ± 0.76 g and 31.57 ± 0.52 g, respectively ( Figure 1 p Figure 1 p Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 p p Figure 1 Figure 1 p Figure 1 2.3.

Concentrations of Lipids and Short-Chain Fatty Acids in Feces The lipids and three short-chain fatty acids (acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid) were quantitatively analyzed in the feces collected from mice after 10 weeks. The fecal lipid content (21.74 ± 0.26 mg/g) in the RP12 group was 41.5% higher than that (15.36 ± 0.30 mg/g) in the HFD group ( Figure 6 Figure 6 p Figure 6 2.7.

Materials and Methods 4.1. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions Pediococcus pentosaceus Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Levilactobacillus brevis Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 22 v v 4.2. Animals and Experimental Design The animal care and studies of the mice were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the College of Biotechnology at Sungkyunkwan University (approval date: 7 September 2019, approval number: SKKUIACUC-20-02-10-2), covering the entire study period (November 2020–September 2021) and reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. For the pilot experiment, male C57BL/6J mice aged 5 weeks, which were procured from RaonBio Inc. (Yongin, Republic of Korea), were housed under controlled conditions (24 ± 2 °C temperature, 50 ± 10% humidity) with a 12 h light/dark cycle. Following a 1-week acclimation period, 5-week-old mice were randomly assigned to 5 groups (n = 3/group): high-fat diet (HFD), high-fat diet plus Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus Pediococcus pentosaceus Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Levilactobacillus brevis Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus Pediococcus pentosaceus Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Levilactobacillus brevis In a subsequent experiment using Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 27 Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Live LAB cells were administered daily via oral gavage at a concentration of 10 9 2 4.3. Serum Analysis Levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total cholesterol, glucose, triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were measured using a biochemical automatic analyzer (AU480, Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 4.4. RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) Total RNA extraction from epididymal fat tissue, liver, ileum and colon was performed using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. First-strand complementary DNA was synthesized using a Veriti™ 96-Well Thermal Cycler machine (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) by mixing the total RNA with ReverTra Ace Master Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). A mixture of Power SYBR Premix ExTaq (RP041A; Takara, Shiga, Japan), primers, and cDNA was employed for amplification using a thermal cycler machine (Takara). Normalization of gene expression was performed using a housekeeping gene, 36B4 12 72 73 74 75 76 77 Supplementary Table S1 12 4.5. Analysis of 16S rRNA Gene Sequences from Gut Microbiome For microbiome analysis, genomic DNA was extracted from fecal samples using a QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. The initial and second amplifications were conducted as previously reported [ 12 27 78 p 4.6. Quantitative Analyses of Lipids and Short-Chain Fatty Acids Lipids in feces (about 0.4 g) taken from mice were extracted and analyzed as previously outlined in reference [ 79 27 4.7. Histological Analysis of the Colon and Ileum Tissues from the colon and ileum were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) according to methods described earlier in reference [ 80 4.8. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance in gene expression differences between experimental groups in animals was determined by an unpaired Student’s t-test. For relative abundance analysis of the gut microbiome, significant differences between groups were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Values were considered statistically significant when p 5. Conclusions In this study, three lactic acid bacterial strains were used to investigate the anti-obesity effect in a mouse model subjected to a high-fat diet, and among these, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms26189056/s1 Author Contributions Conceptualization, J.-H.Y.; methodology, C.W.J., H.Y.L., H.S.K. and M.J.S.; software, C.W.J. and M.J.S.; validation, H.Y.L.; formal analysis, M.J.S.; investigation, H.S.K.; resources, M.J.S.; data curation, J.-H.Y.; writing—original draft preparation, J.-H.Y.; writing—review and editing, C.W.J., H.Y.L. and J.-H.Y.; visualization, M.J.S.; supervision, K.W.P. and J.-H.Y.; project administration, J.-H.Y.; funding acquisition, J.-H.Y.
