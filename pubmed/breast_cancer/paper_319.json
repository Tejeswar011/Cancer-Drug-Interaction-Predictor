Anoikis is a distinct form of apoptosis induced when cells detach from the extracellular matrix (ECM) or adhere to an improper ECM. It is a physiological obstacle to tumor cell metastasis. Anoikis resistance is considered to be a critical initial step in cancer cell metastasis. However, the mechanism by which tumor cells develop anoikis resistance is still unclear, in which the focal adhesion signaling pathway plays an important role. This review first outlines the composition of focal adhesion (FAs) multi‐protein signaling complexes and then discusses the following three aspects: integrin expression changes of tumor cells, intracellular oxidative stress response, and FAs multi‐protein signaling complex members activating downstream survival signaling pathways. The specific mechanisms of focal adhesion signaling pathways in tumor cell anoikis resistance and molecular characteristics of the anoikis resistance state are reviewed. The specific mechanisms of focal adhesion signaling pathways in tumor cell anoikis resistance and molecular characteristics of anoikis resistance strate are reviewed and discussed, and finally we summarized various drugs targeting the focal adhesion signaling pathway to resist tumor anoikis, hoping to provide new clinical directions for the treatment of metastatic recurrent tumors. anoikis resistance focal adhesion signaling metastasis tumor National Natural Science Foundation of China 10.13039/501100001809 #81972373 #82472737 #82472738 Fujian Provincial Department of Science and Technology 10.13039/501100005270 #2024J01014 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  Funding: Bin Liu and Qingqing Wu contributed equally to this work.

Metastasis is a complex, multi‐step process that serves as both a pivotal factor in cancer progression and a significant barrier to further improvements in long‐term survival [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Programmed cell death (PCD) refers to a process in which cells actively terminate their own life in an orderly and regulated manner under specific signals or genetic control. It plays a crucial role in development, tissue homeostasis, and immune responses [ 7 8 9 4 10 Integrins are transmembrane αβ heterodimers that connect the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton [ 11 12 13 14 2 Composition of FAs Integrins are key cell surface receptors that sense ECM composition and stiffness, translating it into cytoplasmic signaling pathways [ 15 16 17 15 18 19 20 21 17 9 17 1 FIGURE 1 Schematic representation of activation of focal adhesion complexes in tumors promoting anoikis resistance. When integrins on the surface of cancer cells are detached from the ECM, they activate focal adhesion complexes, which in turn promote downstream survival signaling pathways and resist anoikis. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic non‐receptor tyrosine kinase and a key component of the signal transduction pathway activated by integrins [ 22 23 24 The FERM domain contains approximately 300 amino acids and is further divided into three subdomains: F1, F2, and F3. It directly binds to the intracellular regions of transmembrane receptors [ 25 26 27 28 23 29 FAK's unique structural features enable it to function as both a kinase and scaffold in cell signaling. It is initially activated by extracellular signals from integrins, growth factors, or G protein‐coupled receptors [ 30 31 19 32 28 32 33 34 34 3 Mechanisms by Which Focal Adhesion Signaling Regulates Tumor Anoikis Resistance 3.1 Integrin Expression Patterns and Their Roles in Anoikis Resistance and Tumor Progression Tumor cells evade anoikis by altering integrin expression profiles, enhancing adhesion to diverse extracellular matrix (ECM) and activating pro‐survival pathways that suppress apoptosis in anchorage‐independent environments [ 34 35 1 TABLE 1 Impact of different integrin types on anoikis resistance in various tumors. Tumor type Integrins expressed Associated phenotypes Refs Squamous cell carcinoma αvβ5, αvβ6 Increased invasion and promoting anoikis resistance [ 36 37 Melanoma αvβ3, α5β1 Altering the Bcl2:Bax ratio to inhibit anoikis [ 38 Breast cancer αvβ3 Anoikis resistance to promote bone metastasis [ 39 40 Prostate cancer αvβ3 Anoikis resistance to promote bone metastasis [ 41 42 Glioma αvβ3 Promoting angiogenesis and invasion [ 43 Ovarian cancer αvβ3 Delayed onset of anoikis promotes metastasis of abdominal organs [ 44 45 Cervical cancer αvβ6 Anoikis resistance to promote metastasis [ 46 Colon cancer αvβ6 Anoikis resistance to promote metastasis [ 47 A key example is the shift from αvβ5 to αvβ6 in anoikis‐resistant squamous cell carcinoma; αvβ5 promotes anoikis, while αvβ6 overexpression confers resistance to detachment‐induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, αvβ6 activates ERK signaling and TGF‐β1 at the tumor–stroma interface, enhancing invasiveness and metastasis [ 36 37 38 In breast cancer, activated αvβ3 integrin is found in freshly isolated metastatic cells and MDA‐MB‐435 variants from mammary fat pad tumors or distant metastases in immunodeficient mice [ 39 48 40 41 42 43 46 47 Moreover, integrin conformation also affects anoikis sensitivity. In ovarian cancer, an epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell model revealed a link between post‐detachment cell survival and αvβ3 transmembrane domain (TMD) activation state. The results revealed that a variant of αvβ3 integrin in an “open” conformation showed constitutive signaling activity, enhancing EGFR signaling and activating downstream FAK, Src, and Akt pathways. This cascade upregulated anti‐apoptotic proteins (Bcl‐2 and survivin), inhibited caspase activation, and delayed anoikis in suspended epithelial‐like tumor cells [ 44 45 In conclusion, integrin subtypes play a dual role in tumor progression by mediating both physical adhesion and intracellular survival signaling under detachment stress. The balance and functional divergence between integrins—such as the switch from αvβ5 to αvβ6 and the distinct roles of αvβ3 versus α5β1—critically determine whether tumor cells undergo anoikis or acquire metastatic competence. 3.2 Intracellular Oxidative Stress Response Mediates Anoikis Resistance Through Part of the Focal Adhesion Signaling Pathway In many cancers, tumor cells exploit oxidative stress to resist anoikis, with reactive oxygen species (ROS) serving as key mediators of this resistance (Figure 2 49 50 51 52 53 2 − 2 − 2 2 2 − 2 − 2 2 54 55 56 57 58 FIGURE 2 Oxidative stress in tumor cells mediates anoikis resistance through the focal adhesion signaling pathway. Rac‐1 binds to integrin, and the generated ROS activates Src through redox mediation. Src trans‐phosphorylates the tyrosine 845 site of EGFR, thereby activating the downstream signaling pathways of ERK and Akt, ultimately leading to the degradation of the pro‐apoptotic protein Bim and promoting resistance to anoikis. ANGPTL4 binds to integrins β1 and β5, stimulates NADPH to produce O 2 − Studies have found that the expression of Zinc Finger Protein 32 (ZNF32) was significantly up‐regulated after hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells detach from the extracellular matrix. Zinc Finger Protein 32 (ZNF32) belongs to the Krüppel‐like family of transcription factors and is essential for cancer development [ 59 3.3 Members of the Multi‐Protein Signaling Complex of FAs In lung adenocarcinoma cells, suspension culture increases Src activity in anoikis‐resistant cells compared with normal and anoikis‐sensitive epithelial cells. The reason is that detachment‐induced Src activation compensates for lost survival signals, promoting anoikis resistance in tumor cells. The elevated Src activity is primarily attributed to the phosphorylation of Tyr‐419, rather than the dephosphorylation of Tyr‐530, in the Src protein [ 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 While the mechanisms involved in anoikis resistance in normal and malignant epithelial cells have been more intensively studied, less is known about the pathways underlying anoikis resistance in non‐epithelial cells, such as fibroblasts and sarcomas. Some research results showed that increasing Src activity contributed to the anoikis resistance of human osteosarcoma SAOS‐2 cells. Src was up‐regulated in anoikis‐resistant SAOS cells, and inhibiting Src activity can restore the sensitivity of the cells to anoikis. Notably, although FAK is generally regarded as a key mediator of integrin‐dependent survival signaling, this study observed that FAK was dephosphorylated in both anoikis‐sensitive and anoikis‐resistant SAOS‐2 cells upon anoikis induction, indicating a loss of its kinase activity. Given that FAK activation is typically associated with tyrosine phosphorylation, this finding suggests that FAK is not maintained in an active state in anoikis‐resistant cells. Nevertheless, these cells still exhibit resistance to detachment‐induced apoptosis. Thus, FAK activity is not essential for anoikis resistance here; instead, Src‐dependent PI3K/Akt activation may play a more pivotal role in survival under anchorage loss. Further studies revealed that Akt activity was upregulated in anoikis‐resistant human osteosarcoma SAOSar cells, whereas inhibiting PI3‐K activity restored the sensitivity of anoikis‐resistant cells, which once again confirmed the critical role of the PI3‐K/Akt pathway in cell survival. Furthermore, inhibition of Src led to reduced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 thereby inhibiting anoikis resistance. This study demonstrated that Src‐dependent activation of the PI3‐K/Akt pathway serves as a survival mechanism against anoikis, independent of FAK activity [ 68 Ovarian cancer is often inoperable due to the occurrence of metastatic lesions in the bowel and greater omentum, resulting in patient death. Here, Ray et al. [ 69 70 The mechanism by which tumors resist anoikis through focal adhesion signaling has also been studied in pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma up‐regulated factor (PAUF), a secreted protein, can promote metastasis by enhancing the migration and invasion capabilities of pancreatic cancer cells [ 71 72 73 74 75 2 TABLE 2 Molecules that cooperate with focal adhesion signaling pathways to resist anoikis.

Tumor cells detach from the original site, and then migrate, invade the circulatory and lymphatic systems, and colonize in distant sites where they eventually grow and proliferate to form secondary tumors. Loss of adherence to the extracellular matrix and acquisition of non‐anchored independent survival are absolutely essential for the survival of dispersing and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and the seeding of metastatic lesions; thus, tumor cells with malignant potential need to initiate mechanisms associated with anoikis resistance in order to survive and metastasize. During the process of anoikis resistance, cancer cells undergo different levels of alterations, including genes, proteins, cytoskeleton, and cytoarchitecture. As the center of the anoikis resistance mechanism of tumor cells, focal adhesion signaling complements these changes and works together to resist anoikis, which promotes the metastasis of tumor cells and shortens the survival period of patients. Consequently, a growing number of compounds have demonstrated significant therapeutic potential by targeting anoikis‐related mechanisms across various cancer therapies. This review elucidates the specific mechanism of focal adhesion signaling in anoikis resistance at the molecular level, which will provide a new perspective for treatment. However, in practical applications, several inevitable challenges remain to be addressed in targeting anoikis. The extended mechanism of resistance to anoikis based on the focal adhesion signaling pathway still requires further research and exploration, which will lay a solid foundation for subsequent tumor treatment; the development and clinical application of targeted drugs or inhibitors for key protein molecules involved in anoikis resistance require more active efforts; the mechanisms underlying anoikis resistance in specific cancer types remain poorly understood, and identifying the different regulatory factors is also a challenge, which will determine more multiple pharmacological intervention nodes. Most insights into tumor anoikis resistance mechanisms discussed here are derived from in vitro studies, highlighting the need for more in vivo and clinical research to facilitate the development of effective, targeted therapeutic strategies.
