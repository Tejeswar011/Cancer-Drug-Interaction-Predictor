Introduction With growing demand for precision medicine and tailored nutrition, targeted delivery systems have grown in popularity in the biomedical and food science disciplines. Certain naturally sourced food colloids, such as biomacromolecular materials like gelatin, pectin, and carrageenan, have emerged as research hotspots due to their unique rheological properties, biocompatibility, and environmental responsiveness, making them ideal for the development of smart delivery carriers [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 The development of smart food colloidal delivery systems allows for regulated release of natural macromolecules and thermosensitive pharmaceuticals. Non-covalent interactions, for example, can be used to create thermosensitive response systems for natural bioactive compounds, allowing for customizable drug release kinetics and maintaining stability under physiological settings. The customizable degradation and release behavior of emulsion gels can be used to load bioactive proteins and peptides [ 8 9 16 14 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Consequently, the development of efficient and safe targeted drug delivery systems is crucial for enhancing disease treatment outcomes and the efficacy of dietary interventions. This review seeks to encapsulate advancements in food colloidal materials for the precise targeted delivery of pharmaceuticals and nutrients, emphasizing design strategies for food colloidal carriers and their applications in diverse targeted delivery systems, while also delineating prospective stages of development for food colloidal delivery systems. 2. Food Colloid Delivery Carriers Colloidal delivery systems in food can significantly improve the encapsulation, protection, and targeted administration of pharmaceuticals and bioactive substances. Progress in this domain has demonstrated that natural macromolecules and food-grade materials can be employed to regulate essential properties such as solubility, stability, and release kinetics to enhance bioavailability and nutritional efficacy [ 2 3 23 Food colloidal delivery systems made of hydrophilic substances such proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids work as encapsulating matrices while also enhancing sensory attributes and prolonging shelf life [ 4 23 24 1 Besides these traditional approaches, advanced colloidal structures, including colloids and nano-emulsions, have been thoroughly investigated for their capacity for targeted and sustained delivery. Colloids are generated through the self-assembly of colloidal particles at a fluid interface, exhibiting remarkable mechanical strength and precise permeability control, therefore serving as efficient vesicular carriers for medicinal medicines. Likewise, radical nano-emulsions can promote the dispersion and gastrointestinal absorption of hydrophobic bioactives and pharmaceuticals, thereby considerably improving their bioavailability [ 25 26 27 28 Recent advancements in the design of food colloidal delivery systems underscore the interdisciplinary convergence of materials science, nanotechnology, and nutrition. Utilizing the intrinsic characteristics of macromolecules enables the creation of carriers ensuring the stability and tailored release of bioactive compounds while also improving the overall nutritional and sensory attributes of the final product [ 2 3 23 2.1. Definition and Classification of Food Colloids The phrase “food colloid” refers to multiphase systems where one or more components are scattered as particles, droplets, or bubbles within a continuous media, often ranging from nanometer to micrometer sizes. The definition of “food colloid” systems relies on the interplay between the dispersed and continuous phases, yielding distinctive physical features such as turbidity, viscosity, and the capacity to form organized networks [ 29 30 29 30 Food colloids can be categorized in multiple ways, primarily according to their physical condition and structural composition. This classification approach categorizes food colloids into systems including emulsions, foams, gels, and dispersions. Emulsions entail the dispersion of one immiscible liquid within another liquid (often oil-in-water or water-in-oil), whereas foams comprise gases dispersed in a liquid or solid matrix. Gels are a category of colloidal systems defined by a three-dimensional network of immobilized continuous phases, exemplified by emulsion gels that incorporate dispersed emulsions inside a gel matrix [ 1 29 30 1 29 In summary, food colloids are characterized by their dispersion structure and interfacial interactions, which are essential to their functional role in food systems. Classification according to composition, physical state, and provenance improves our comprehension of traditional food products and establishes a foundation for innovative technological applications in food design and nutrition. Ongoing advancements in the discipline, propelled by theoretical understanding and practical implementations, affirm that food colloid science is an essential component of study in food engineering. 2.2. Overview of Targeted Delivery Systems Targeted delivery methods are essential for current medication and bioactive molecule administration, improving therapeutic efficacy and reducing systemic side effects. These systems administer pharmacologically active drugs selectively to particular tissues or cells by optimizing the carrier’s characteristics, including size, morphology, surface chemistry, and responsiveness. Initial investigations in this domain concentrated on nanoparticle-based formulations that exploit improved penetration and retention effects in diseased tissues, particularly malignancies [ 31 32 31 33 Colloidal delivery systems have advanced considerably to include several platforms such as liposomes, polymer nanoparticles, and colloids, each providing distinct benefits regarding stability and controlled release properties. Colloids, created through the self-assembly of colloidal particles at the emulsion interface, exhibit distinctive features like elevated mechanical strength and regulated permeability, enabling tailored release of pharmaceuticals and bioactive substances [ 6 6 Biocompatible natural materials can be utilized in the formulation of colloidal delivery systems for food products, expanding the scope of targeted delivery applications. For instance, hydrophilic colloids in foods have been utilized to create carriers that safeguard delicate chemicals during gastrointestinal transit while improving their bioaccessibility at the absorption site [ 23 3 24 23 24 Furthermore, the domain has witnessed the advent of design techniques aligned with the principle of Delivery by Design (DbD), which underscores the customization of the physicochemical and biological characteristics of nanoparticle- and microparticle-based systems via a systems approach. These efforts seek to amalgamate concepts from nanotechnology, materials science, and pharmacokinetics to develop carriers that enhance therapeutic indices via passive and active targeting mechanisms [ 9 9 2 34 The advancement of targeted delivery systems demonstrates the integration of colloidal carrier structural design with biological interfaces to guarantee the controlled and effective distribution of therapeutically active substances. This multidisciplinary approach has expedited progress in drug delivery technology and established a basis for future innovations in precision medicine, where the interaction of carrier characteristics and biological responses is essential for therapeutic success. 2.3. The Physicochemical Properties of Food Colloids and Their Application Basis in Delivery Systems Food colloids are intricate multiphase systems, and their efficacy as delivery carriers is intimately linked to characteristics such as particle size, surface charge, composition, morphology, and reactivity to environmental stimuli [ 2 35 35 2 Besides size, the surface characteristics of colloidal particles, such as charge density and hydrophobicity, are crucial factors influencing the stability of emulsions and microgels. Dickinson [ 36 The pH sensitivity and environmental responsiveness of specific colloidal carrier systems are fundamental to their use in controlled release applications. Zhang et al. [ 37 The adaptability of colloidal systems is shown in the creation of tailored colloids that concurrently improve sensory attributes and functional advantages in food matrices. Douaire and Norton [ 38 38 The physicochemical features of food colloids, such as particle size, surface functionalization, interfacial behavior, and pH responsiveness, are critical factors in the development of efficient delivery systems. These qualities allow carriers to encapsulate, safeguard, and release bioactive chemicals in a regulated way, hence improving their therapeutic efficacy and functional performance in food and pharmaceutical applications. Progress in colloid science is expanding the use of these systems, facilitating creative approaches for precision nutrition and tailored medicines. 2.3.1. Rheological Properties of Food Colloids The rheological characteristics of food colloids are essential for comprehending their processing behavior and the sensory attributes of the final product. The properties, such as viscosity, shear thinning, yield stress, and viscoelastic modulus, result from the intricate interactions among dispersed particles, the continuous phase, and the particles inside the system [ 39 A fundamental aspect of rheological investigations is the characterization of the viscoelastic characteristics of food colloids in reaction to applied stress. In the process of ice cream manufacturing with whipped toppings, the stalling of viscoelastic fat aggregation results in the creation of trans-volumetric networks. These networks improve the product’s structure and stability, while influencing its flow characteristics and sensory attributes [ 40 41 Figure 1 Furthermore, environmental parameters including temperature, ion type, and ionic strength significantly influence the dynamic and steady-state rheological properties of colloidal dispersions. Research on the rheological properties of Honeybush seed gum dispersions indicates that variations in temperature and electrolyte concentration can markedly influence the steady-state shear behavior and dynamic viscoelasticity of these systems [ 42 Under oscillatory shear, the rheology of food colloids demonstrates intricate phenomena, including two-step yielding and strain-induced directional strengthening. The destruction and subsequent re-formation of the microstructural network under oscillatory shear results in a nonlinear rheological response [ 43 In conclusion, the multiscale coupling of particle interactions, network development, and external processing conditions constitutes the rheological foundation of food colloids. A thorough comprehension of these connections can improve the design of food colloid systems and assist in customizing textural and sensory attributes to fulfill customer expectations. The intricate dynamics of these linkages may be leveraged in the future to innovate new goods and enhance conventional food processing. 2.3.2. Stability and Encapsulation Capacity of Food Colloids In recent years, food colloids have garnered significant attention as efficient carriers for the encapsulation and stabilization of bioactive chemicals. Two major performance measures for these systems are encapsulation capacity (i.e., the efficacy of retaining bioactive chemicals) and stability under diverse storage and processing settings. Numerous studies indicate that the meticulous formulation of food colloids can markedly enhance their encapsulation effectiveness and durability. Nanoliposomes engineered to encapsulate grape seed tannins exhibited a high encapsulation efficiency (~79% for epicatechin), demonstrated exceptional physicochemical stability for up to 90 days under refrigeration, maintained a controlled particle size distribution, and possessed an appropriate surface charge (zeta potential −41.6 mV) [ 44 45 45 Encapsulation can be enhanced by creating composite nanoparticle systems that offer multifunctional advantages. Lactoferrin-based ternary composite nanoparticles have been engineered for curcumin delivery, attaining high encapsulation efficiencies (~86%) and loading capacity, with enhanced thermal, photostability, and storage stability of curcumin [ 46 47 Besides nanoparticle systems, microemulsion gel systems are extensively utilized for their benefits, such as high solubility and thermodynamic stability, along with the adjustable rheological characteristics of the gel matrix [ 48 49 Nano-emulsions exemplify food colloids that facilitate the effective distribution of bioactive substances. Their diminutive droplet size enhances bioavailability and absorption while safeguarding against extrinsic variables such as light, heat, and oxidation [ 50 51 The utilization of biopolymers for the fabrication of nanoparticles to encapsulate polyphenolic chemicals and antioxidants is a novel strategy to enhance stability and bioavailability. The application of biopolymers as carriers enhances the inadequate water solubility and pH sensitivity of encapsulated molecules, hence maintaining the bioactivity of unstable chemicals during storage and digesting [ 52 53 In conclusion, the encapsulation capacity and stability of food colloids are influenced by various parameters, including particle size, surface charge, microstructural organization, and the selection of biopolymer materials and production methods. Techniques including nanoliposomes, microcapsules, composite nanoparticles, microemulsion gels, and nanoemulsions enhance encapsulation efficiency and stability, thereby augmenting the bioactivity and functionality of bioactive compounds in food and nutraceutical applications [ 3 44 45 46 48 50 2.3.3. Interaction Mechanisms Between Food Colloids and Drugs/Nutrients Comprehending the interactions between food colloids and medications or nutrients is essential for maintaining the stability of delivery systems. In these systems, several noncovalent interactions (e.g., hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and electrostatic attraction) are crucial for the encapsulation and release kinetics of active ingredients. A significant method is donor-acceptor ligand interaction, wherein drug loading capacity can be augmented through the use of specific ligand interactions. Polymeric micelles with electron acceptor groups can be conjugated to pharmaceuticals like Adriamycin, resulting in exceptionally high drug loading efficiencies [ 54 Protein-derived colloids, such as zeinolysin nanoparticles, exhibit distinctive pH responsiveness and electrostatic interaction properties in food delivery systems. Corn alcohol soluble protein, a hydrophobic protein sourced from maize, can be modified into nanoparticles that encapsulate chemotherapeutic agents like ellipticine. Pourhossein et al. [ 55 The connection between the medicine or nutrition and the protein-based carrier was augmented by the use of natural proteins such bovine serum albumin (BSA), which enhances colloidal stability and offers various binding sites for the active compound. Neves et al. [ 56 3 4 A distinct contact mechanism was clarified by colloidosomes, which are hollow microcapsule structures made of colloidal particles. Dinsmore et al. [ 57 Emulsion gels, generally formulated from food-grade proteins and polysaccharides, depend on several interaction mechanisms for encapsulation and controlled release. Abdullah et al. [ 1 58 2 59 Alternative techniques, such as layer-by-layer (LbL) construction, further exemplify the significance of electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Połomska et al. [ 60 Moreover, stimulus-responsive methods have been utilized in the design of colloidal carriers to modulate the release of medications or nutrients in response to alterations in the external environment. Liu et al. [ 61 In conclusion, the interaction processes between food colloids and medications or nutrients are intricate and encompass several complex interactions, including non-covalent interactions. Colloids are formulated and synthesized through interactions including donor-acceptor coordination, pH responsiveness, electrostatic interactions, protein-drug binding, and interfacial self-assembly, which influence encapsulation efficiency, colloidal stability, and the release kinetics of active ingredients. A comprehensive understanding of the fundamental interaction mechanisms has not only propelled the construction of precision-targeted delivery systems but also fostered innovation in the wider domain of functional food and medicine delivery. 2.3.4. Interfacial Behavior Has a Decisive Impact on Delivery Efficiency Interfacial behavior is crucial for the distribution efficiency of colloidal carriers by influencing the encapsulation, stability, and controlled release of medicines and nutrients. The characteristics of the interfacial layer (e.g., interfacial tension, viscoelasticity, adsorption kinetics, and dynamic rearrangement of colloidal particles) directly affect the release of bioactive chemicals in the physiological environment. Microscale interfacial tension measurements are crucial for elucidating the regulatory processes underlying droplet stability and encapsulation efficiency. Research on micrometer-scale droplets indicates that reduced interfacial tension facilitates the development of stable emulsions, crucial for preserving the integrity of encapsulated actives throughout storage and digesting [ 62 63 Research in microfluidics has underscored the significance of interfacial dynamics in double emulsions. Chen et al. [ 64 65 The configuration of proteins at the interface significantly influences the overall efficacy of the delivery system. Proteins, owing to their amphiphilic characteristics, spontaneously adsorb at the oil–water interface, creating an adsorbent layer that offers electrostatic and spatial positional stabilization resistance. Nik et al. [ 66 67 Investigations of multiscale interfacial structures have enhanced the overall comprehension of these phenomena. Marze [ 68 69 The capacity of food colloids to adsorb at the oil–water interface directly influences the stability of the emulsion system. The synergistic interaction between whey protein and inulin diminishes interfacial tension and creates a more robust interfacial layer, hence enhancing the retention of vitamin D3 during digestion. In vitro simulated digestion trials shown that xanthan gum impeded stomach emptying by enhancing system viscosity, leading to a 40% increase in the fraction of insulin designated for intestinal release. Colloid-biofilm interactions significantly influence cellular absorption efficiency. Carboxymethylcellulose-modified nanoparticles facilitate the absorption of quercetin by intestinal epithelial cells via lattice protein-mediated endocytosis. In conclusion, the interfacial characteristics of colloidal carriers, encompassing interfacial tension, adsorption kinetics, and viscoelastic film formation, are critical determinants of delivery effectiveness. Refining these interfacial parameters via meticulous design and material selection can improve stability, encapsulation capacity, and controlled release characteristics of medicines and bioactive nutrients, hence augmenting their bioavailability and therapeutic effectiveness. 2.4. Common Food-Grade Colloidal Materials and Their Characteristics Food-grade colloidal materials serve as essential components in the development of sophisticated delivery systems for bioactive substances, with their inherent features critically influencing encapsulation efficiency, stability, and release patterns. These colloids, originating from natural biomolecules like proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids, are frequently transformed into nanoparticles, emulsions, gels, and Pickering systems. Their biocompatibility, repeatability, and adjustable interfacial characteristics render them appropriate for food applications [ 29 62 Proteins are the most widely used food-grade colloidal materials. Common proteins include soy protein, pea protein, ovalbumin, and whey protein. Many proteins are amphiphilic molecules that can be used to encapsulate hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances. For instance, naturally occurring systems like casein micelles and milk fat globules in milk can encapsulate and safeguard hydrophobic compounds, serving as a model for engineered systems; likewise, legume and flaxseed proteins have been examined for their superior emulsification, foaming, and film-forming capabilities, which are closely linked to their particle sizes and substantial water-absorption capacity. Furthermore, nanoparticles derived from complex proteins (e.g., lactoferrin ternary system) exhibit improved dispersibility and superior preservation of hydrophobic nutrients like curcumin, hence mitigating issues related to poor water solubility and low bioavailability [ 2 46 Emulsion gels are structured colloids assembled from proteins and polysaccharides to provide three-dimensional networks capable of trapping large amounts of water, oil, or air, combining the functional advantages of controlling texture and mouthfeel, as well as having the ability to encapsulate bioactive compounds [ 1 65 Stabilized for consumption Pickering emulsions derived from natural raw materials have distinctive interfacial characteristics owing to their irreversible adsorption at the oil–water interface. Recent research indicates that food-grade particles, such as those derived from plant saponins (including saponin and glycyrrhizic acid) or protein aggregates, effectively stabilize Pickering emulsions, augmenting resistance to agglomeration and strengthening encapsulation stability [ 66 67 68 69 Common food-grade colloidal materials, including proteins (e.g., casein, legume proteins, and flaxseed proteins), polysaccharide-protein complexes, and plant-derived saponins, demonstrate unique physicochemical properties such as elevated interfacial activity, emulsification potential, and the capacity to create structured networks. These features are fundamental to the customization of food colloids with specific functionalities, employed to regulate micronutrient release and boost bioavailability, as well as to improve the texture and shelf life of functional foods. Food-grade colloidal systems are sustainable and biocompatible, now employed in various applications including nutraceuticals and medicine administration, as seen in Figure 2 2.5. Preparation Methods of Colloidal Carriers Diverse techniques for the synthesis of colloidal carriers for food and nutraceutical applications have been established, employing both bottom-up and top-down approaches. Preparation procedures are chosen according to the enclosed substance, intended release profile, and scalability requirements. Researchers have devised methods from traditional emulsification and coalescence to sophisticated techniques including nanoprecipitation, spray drying, freeze drying, electrostatic spinning, and layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly to guarantee that the resultant carriers uphold food-grade safety and functionality [ 70 71 72 Emulsification is a prevalent technique for encapsulating lipophilic functional food components (e.g., taste compounds, vitamins, and essential oils) by the preparation of micro/nanoemulsions. For instance, the nanoencapsulation of citrus essential oils was accomplished by formulating oil-in-water systems that utilize natural surfactants and biopolymers to provide thermodynamic stability and facilitate controlled release features [ 73 74 75 Alternative techniques, like complex coalescence and nanoprecipitation, facilitate the generation of colloidal carriers from biopolymers, often proteins and polysaccharides. In these processes, electrostatic interactions or solvent exchange among biopolymers can facilitate self-assembly and phase separation, resulting in the creation of particles with a regulated core–shell structure. Sodium caseinate-stabilized zeinolysin particles can be synthesized via an anti-solvent precipitation method, wherein the intrinsic amphiphilicity of casein and zeinolysin facilitates the creation of natural food-grade colloidal systems for encapsulating hydrophobic nutraceuticals [ 76 77 Spray drying and freeze drying are techniques specifically designed for the creation of microencapsulation. These techniques facilitate the fast elimination of solvents to produce powders, thereby encapsulating the bioactive substances within the biopolymer matrix. These drying methods are extensively employed in the encapsulation of polyphenolic compounds and vitamins, with freeze-drying being especially effective in maintaining the integrity of heat-sensitive constituents; however, challenges such as particle aggregation and bioactive degradation post-drying persist [ 78 79 Advanced methods, including electrostatic spinning and fine-emulsion electrostatic spinning, have been investigated for the fabrication of nanofiber carriers for the production of loaded bioactives. Poly(ester amide) nanofibers for amino acids were synthesized using a refined emulsion-electrostatic spinning technique, wherein encapsulated enzymes were preserved in submicron compartments, as illustrated in Figure 3 80 81 Liposome encapsulation techniques represent a significant category of methods for the creation of colloidal carriers. Liposomes, composed of phospholipid bilayers, are generally formed using thin-film hydration, subsequently followed by sonication or extrusion to yield vesicles with a regulated size distribution and surface charge. These vesicles are engineered to extend circulation duration and improve stability through alterations in lipid composition and surface characteristics, as depicted in Figure 3 82 83 2 Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are an alternative formulation approach that employs the solid state of the lipid matrix at ambient temperature for regulated release. For instance, SLNs containing ergocalciferol can encapsulate fat-soluble vitamins, so decelerating digestion and facilitating prolonged release throughout the gastrointestinal system [ 84 Ultimately, composite and multilayer compositions enhance the adaptability of colloidal carriers. The layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly technique facilitates the successive application of oppositely charged biopolymers around a core, creating a protective shell that regulates permeability and stability [ 72 85 In summary, the formulation of colloidal carriers for food applications is complex and depends on several encapsulation methods. Emulsification (including single and double emulsions), coagulation, nanoprecipitation, spray and freeze-drying, liposome formation, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and sophisticated methods such as electrostatic spinning and layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly offer distinct benefits for attaining elevated encapsulation efficiency, stability, and controlled release. 2.6. Surface Modification Strategies for Colloidal Carriers Surface modification of colloidal carriers is a crucial approach to improve their stability, targeting efficacy, circulation duration, and overall therapeutic effectiveness. Surface changes can be accomplished using covalent and non-covalent processes, including physical adsorption, chemical coupling, layer-by-layer assembly, and customization of carrier interface attributes. These alterations can alter surface charge and hydrophobic/hydrophilic equilibrium, enhancing the attachment of certain ligands or stealth polymers, thus boosting interactions with biological systems [ 86 A variety of chemical modification techniques have been established to impart unique functionalities to colloidal carriers. Colloids have been synthesized through incremental surface modification of natural minerals, such as elohimite nanoclay, utilizing Janus colloidal surfactants characterized by different zones exhibiting opposing wettability [ 87 88 Alongside chemical coupling, physical methods like layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly have become increasingly common. The LbL approach facilitates the successive adsorption of oppositely charged polymers or biomolecules, resulting in the formation of multilayer shells with regulated permeability and release characteristics [ 89 Figure 4 90 91 91 The specificity of targeting can be augmented by attaching the ligand component to the carrier surface. Carbohydrate coating and folate functionalization are employed to target lectin receptors or folate receptors on cancer cells [ 92 86 Inorganic colloidal carriers also advantage from advanced surface engineering techniques. Methods that incorporate surface functionalization and biocoupling, including the modification of nanoparticles like gold or semiconducting materials with diverse chemical and biological reagents, enhance their utility in imaging, sensing, and targeted therapeutics [ 93 Figure 4 94 Diverse surface modification strategies, including the preparation of Janus particles (illustrated in Figure 4 87 86 89 92 86 88 89 Figure 4 Surface Finishing Strategies ( a 90 b 94 c 87 3. Research Progress on Food-Based Colloidal Systems for Precise Targeted Delivery in Different Tissues Food colloids have developed into precision-targeted delivery methods to improve the bioavailability, stability, and controlled release characteristics of medicines and nutraceutical bioactive substances. These methods employ natural macromolecules (proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids) to create colloidal carriers, designed for selective targeting and enhanced absorption, addressing the issues of low water solubility and rapid metabolism of numerous bioactive compounds [ 3 23 Food-grade colloidal carriers, such as nanoemulsions, liposomes, and emulsion gels, possess intrinsic advantages owing to their biocompatibility and Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status. For instance, nanoemulsion formulations have effectively encapsulated hydrophobic nutraceuticals to enhance aqueous dispersion and gastrointestinal absorption while safeguarding the active ingredients from degradation [ 38 95 1 23 96 Moreover, oral cell-targeted delivery methods formulated from consumable components have propelled the advancement of these delivery platforms. They employ the binding properties of particular ligands and carriers to cellular receptors to augment the absorption of encapsulated substances at the intended site of action and minimize off-target effects. Food-grade polymers can be chemically altered to provide controlled-release formulations that ensure prolonged therapeutic effects and reduce negative effects by facilitating the progressive release of bioactive compounds [ 97 Progress in nanofabrication and surface modification technologies (e.g., layer-by-layer assembly, nanomicelle production) has improved the accuracy of targeted systems. The manipulation of particle size, surface charge, and hydrophobicity in colloidal carriers improves targeting efficacy, maintains transport stability, and facilitates binding and internalization by target cells [ 98 99 5 The interdisciplinary integration of materials science, food chemistry, and nanotechnology has facilitated the development of intricate food colloidal delivery systems that allow for exact targeting. These technologies enhance the shelf-life and sensory attributes of functional meals while also augmenting the therapeutic efficiency of encapsulated pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, presenting considerable potential for preventive nutrition and clinical applications ( Table 1 3.1. Colloidal Delivery Systems for Anticancer Drugs Colloidal delivery methods exploit the tumor-specific milieu to improve the targeted delivery of anticancer pharmaceuticals. These systems have been engineered to enhance the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of chemotherapeutic drugs while minimizing systemic toxicity by precision targeting. Diverse ways have been formulated to employ food-grade colloids or synthetic counterparts, encompassing attributes such as stimulus responsiveness, ligand-mediated targeting, and intelligent release patterns. Aptamer-based systems represent a potential methodology for precise targeting. These methods employ oligonucleotide aptamers that identify the overexpression of particular receptors on tumor cells to facilitate spatial and trigger-responsive drug release control [ 100 101 102 Alternative colloidal systems, including functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (f-MWNTs), employ non-covalent π-π stacking interactions to encapsulate hydrophobic pharmaceuticals (e.g., paclitaxel), while the incorporation of folic acid or poly(ethylene glycol) modifications improves their solubility, biocompatibility, and tumor-targeting efficacy [ 103 104 Figure 5 121 122 123 Dendrimers, or dendritic macromolecules, have garnered significant interest owing to their highly branching, well-defined architectures that facilitate multivalent interactions with biological receptors. Their nanoscale, uniform characteristics and capacity for chemical functionalization render them optimal carriers for the targeted and accurate delivery of pharmaceuticals to cancer cells [ 124 125 126 In anticancer applications, these colloidal delivery systems depend on the precise adjustment of physicochemical parameters, including particle size, surface charge, and hydrophobicity. Colloidal systems possess stimulus-responsive components that react to particular environmental variables, like acidic pH levels in tumors and elevated enzyme concentrations. Surface modification techniques facilitate the attachment of certain ligands (e.g., folic acid, aptamers) to improve cellular absorption and minimize off-target effects [ 100 102 125 Technologies for tumor-targeted delivery have emerged as a prominent research focus at the convergence of biomedical and food sciences. Food colloids, due to their distinctive physicochemical characteristics and biocompatibility, exhibit significant potential in the development of precise delivery methods. Polysaccharide-based (e.g., chitosan, pectin) and protein-based (e.g., whey proteins, zeinolysin) colloidal carriers can undergo surface modification to facilitate ligand-receptor-mediated target recognition. Alginate microcapsules exhibiting pH-responsiveness can facilitate over 90% regulated drug release in acidic circumstances that replicate the tumor microenvironment, offering a novel approach to mitigate the toxic side effects of chemotherapeutic agents on healthy tissues. 3.2. Brain-Targeted Delivery Systems In recent years, food colloids have emerged as attractive carriers for brain-targeted delivery, owing to their biocompatibility, bioavailability, and intrinsic capacity to regulate drug release. Colloidal systems can be engineered to improve blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability and facilitate targeted medication delivery to central nervous system (CNS) tissues by utilizing proteins like lactoferrin and casein, as well as food-derived macromolecules such as polysaccharides and lipids, including chitosan [ 3 A crucial method in brain-targeted delivery systems aims to employ receptor-mediated transport across the blood–brain barrier (BBB). Lactoferrin, a naturally occurring protein in milk, can create biocoupled carriers with solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) for targeted brain administration by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Lactoferrin-conjugated solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) can enhance the targeting and prolonged release of anticancer agents, demonstrating increased cytotoxicity against brain cancers [ 105 106 The intranasal method of drug delivery has emerged as a compelling alternative for brain-targeted administration, leveraging the direct anatomical connection between the nasal cavity and the brain to circumvent the blood–brain barrier for precise drug delivery. Research indicates that colloidal carriers, including liposomes, nanoemulsions, and polymeric nanoparticles derived from food-grade substances, can be delivered intranasally to facilitate quick and effective drug delivery to deep brain regions while reducing systemic exposure [ 107 108 Moreover, new developments in multifunctional nanoparticle design emphasize surface changes and intelligent response architectures to accommodate the brain microenvironment. Multifunctional nanoparticles that integrate prolonged circulation characteristics with targeting moieties (such as peptides, aptamers, and carbohydrate ligands) have been engineered to surmount the blood–brain barrier. Food colloids can be similarly transformed into heterogeneous systems that encapsulate lipophilic anticancer or neurotherapeutic agents and respond to stimuli (e.g., pH, enzymes) within the brain parenchyma [ 109 In summary, food colloids offer a flexible and promising foundation for brain-targeted delivery systems. They are constructed from natural food-grade components that provide intrinsic biocompatibility and safety, while advanced design techniques such as lactoferrin coupling, chitosan nanoparticle production, and intranasal administration improve blood–brain barrier penetration and facilitate targeted delivery to central nervous system tissues. The integration of food colloid science with nanotechnology is creating novel therapeutic opportunities for addressing brain disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors, with the potential for enhanced efficacy and less systemic toxicity. 3.3. Intestinal Targeted Delivery Systems The gut serves as a primary location for nutrition absorption, and food colloids present advantageous platforms for targeted intestinal delivery by encapsulating bioactive substances, safeguarding them from the hostile gastric environment, and improving penetration across the intestinal mucus barrier. Food colloid delivery systems composed of food-grade proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids comply with regulatory safety criteria (GRAS status) and enhance drug breakdown and absorption in the small intestine. A significant barrier in intestinal delivery is the passage of colloidal carriers through the mucus layer, whose permeability is influenced by mucus structure, age variations, and extracellular content. Subsequent research by Macierzanka et al. [ 127 128 The creation of food colloidal materials utilizing pH-responsive and enzyme-resistant substances might improve their capacity to safeguard and selectively release bioactives in intestinal environments. Sodium caseinate-stabilized zeinolysin colloidal particles have demonstrated efficacy as transporters of bioactive chemicals, functioning as a natural component that can form stable aggregates in aqueous conditions [ 76 110 3 Alongside structural design tactics, programmable co-assembly methods have been employed to improve intestinal targeting. Figure 5 111 The alteration of lipid-based colloidal carriers during intestinal digestion significantly influences medication solubilization and transport. Yao et al. [ 129 In conclusion, the investigation of food colloids in gut-targeted delivery systems necessitates the customization of the physicochemical characteristics of the carriers to address the specific constraints posed by the intestinal microenvironment. By targeting mucus permeability, pH responsiveness, and the dynamic rearrangement of lipid nanoparticles, these systems provide potential for improved protection, controlled release, and bioavailability of bioactive substances. These tactics underscore the potential of food colloids as multifunctional carriers for nutraceutical and pharmaceutical applications, thereby enhancing the efficacy of oral administration therapies. 3.4. Lung-Targeted Delivery Systems Food colloids have arisen as prospective biocompatible carriers for lung-targeted delivery systems owing to their intrinsic safety, modifiable physicochemical features, and compatibility with inhalation delivery methods. In pulmonary medication administration, colloidal carriers can be designed as dry powders, aerosols, or solutions to improve deposition in the alveolar region of the lungs while addressing issues such as particle aggregation and fast clearance by alveolar macrophages [ 112 The spray-drying process is a prevalent preparation method that transforms food-derived colloidal suspensions into nanostructured powders appropriate for dry powder inhalers (DPIs). Spray-dried nanoparticles can enhance aerodynamic qualities and ensure effective lung deposition, thereby enabling targeted administration of therapeutic medicines for respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [ 112 A further interesting approach involves the production of nanoliposome suspensions. Liposomes originating from consumable lipids can be fabricated at nanoscale dimensions and generated as fine aerosols using nebulization. Research has highlighted that the physicochemical characteristics of liposome suspensions, such as particle size distribution and surface charge, are essential for aerosol stability and deposition patterns in the lungs [ 113 Computational studies have clarified the interaction process between food colloidal nanoparticles and lung surfactant monolayers. Figure 5 130 Moreover, specific chemical changes associated with L-cysteine or other targeting moieties have demonstrated enhanced pulmonary distribution. Research on L-cysteine-coupled poly-L-lactic acid nanoparticles incorporating 5-fluorouracil has demonstrated a marked enhancement in lung deposition, validating the function of L-cysteine in the pulmonary transport mechanism and indicating its prospective advantages in conditions like non-small cell lung cancer [ 114 Colloidal technologies, including solid lipid nanoparticles, polymer nanoparticles, and liposomes, are adaptable for lung-targeting applications [ 131 132 In conclusion, the application of food colloids in lung-targeted delivery systems has been enhanced by a multidimensional strategy. Methods like spray drying and aerosol production have been refined to yield stable inhalable particles [ 112 114 130 131 132 3.5. Skeletal Muscle-Targeted Delivery Systems Food colloids present considerable potential as delivery methods targeting skeletal muscle, owing to their intrinsic biocompatibility, food-grade safety, and capacity for surface functionalization. These carriers, originating from natural macromolecules like proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids, can be engineered into nanoparticles, emulsions, or gels that encapsulate various therapeutic agents, including plasmid DNA and small-molecule drugs, enhancing biodistribution and enabling controlled release. Numerous studies indicate that surface modification using muscle-specific peptides markedly improves cellular uptake and transfection efficacy. Jativa et al. [ 133 Figure 5 134 Besides gene delivery, food-derived functional substances have been recognized as modulators of skeletal muscle. Chikazawa and Sato [ 115 2 116 Recent research by Hicks et al. [ 135 In conclusion, food colloids employed as carriers for targeted distribution to skeletal muscle signify a pioneering research domain that amalgamates the benefits of natural food-derived substances with sophisticated nanotechnology approaches. Utilizing surface modification techniques, such as muscle-targeting peptide coupling demonstrated in dendrimer systems and encapsulating biologically active food compounds with established anabolic functions, these carriers can proficiently surmount biological barriers and deliver therapeutic payloads to skeletal muscle tissue. Moreover, findings from scaffold-based muscle regeneration research [ 116 135 3.6. Heart-Targeted Delivery Systems Food colloids are garnering heightened interest as efficient vehicles for cardiac-targeted delivery systems, particularly in the management of myocardial ischemia and infarction. Owing to their biocompatibility, inherent safety, and capacity for engineering from natural or food-grade lipids and biopolymers, such colloids can be customized to improve drug solubility, safeguard unstable bioactives, and facilitate preferential enrichment of ischemic myocardium via passive and active targeting mechanisms [ 117 An exemplary case is polyethylene glycolated lipid nanoparticles encapsulating baicalein, a flavonoid possessing cardioprotective properties. Zhang et al. [ 117 117 An alternative method involves active targeting through peptide-conjugated polymer nanoparticles. Sun et al. [ 118 Recently, vegetable oil-derived Pickering nanoemulsions have been examined as cytoplasmic drug delivery vehicles [ 119 119 In summary, our investigations indicate that food colloidal systems, such as polyethylene glycolized lipid nanoparticles, RGD-functionalized polymeric nanocarriers, and food-grade Pickering nanoemulsions, provide viable platforms for the targeted delivery of cardioprotective pharmaceuticals. By employing passive targeting through EPR effects and active targeting via receptor-mediated uptake, medication accumulation in the ischemic heart can be enhanced, pharmacokinetic stability can be augmented, and systemic side effects are anticipated to be reduced. Future research may concentrate on enhancing surface modification, particle stability, and release kinetics of these nanocarriers to attain improved precision in cardiac-targeted therapy. 3.7. Food Colloids in Application of Food Colloids in Oral Delivery Systems Food colloids are pivotal in improving oral delivery by serving as biocompatible food-grade carriers that safeguard, transport, and enhance the absorption of various bioactive substances. These systems are generally composed of naturally occurring macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids, and can be manipulated into emulsions, microemulsions, liposomes, and emulsion gels with regulated release characteristics. Benefits encompass increased solubility and stability of hydrophobic pharmaceuticals, gastrointestinal targeted protection, and augmented contact with intestinal epithelial cells [ 3 120 Li et al. [ 120 136 Wang et al. [ 3 137 Plant-derived colloidal delivery technologies enhance the versatility of these compositions. Tan and McClements [ 24 1 Perry and McClements [ 2 In summary, the application of food colloids in oral delivery systems incorporates many design strategies to tackle significant problems associated with the gastrointestinal tract, such as enzymatic degradation, fluctuating pH levels, and the low solubility of numerous bioactives. These systems enhance the stability, absorption, and bioactivity of medicines and nutraceuticals by employing natural food-grade components and sophisticated preparation processes such as double emulsions, microemulsions, emulsion gels, and plant-based nano emulsions. This comprehensive strategy enhances the oral bioavailability of pharmaceuticals and facilitates the integration of immunomodulation and nutritional enhancement into functional food development. Figure 5 Food Colloids in Precision Targeted Delivery Systems ( a 121 b 111 c 130 d 133 The targeted distribution of food colloids to specific locations, including cancers, the brain, and the intestines, constitutes a key area of investigation in food nutrition and food materials science. This method seeks to improve the bioavailability of active constituents such as pharmaceuticals and minerals, facilitating tailored release. Food colloidal distribution encounters multiple hurdles, such as navigating significant pH gradient fluctuations, penetrating the intestinal mucosal barrier, and accommodating individual differences in gut flora. These concerns and challenges necessitate ongoing, comprehensive investigation in the future. 4. Research Progress on Food-Based Colloidal Systems for Nutrient Delivery Recent years have shown substantial advancements in the application of food colloids for the exact targeted delivery of pharmaceuticals and bioactive chemicals, attributable to the designed adaptability of colloidal systems. Food colloids, including emulsion gels, protein nanoparticles, and colloids, provide various preparation techniques that can be tailored for regulated degradation, sensory experience, and precise delivery of food additives and therapies [ 1 2 3 4 4.1. Food Colloids in Delivery of Vitamins and Minerals Food-based colloidal systems have emerged as effective carriers for the tailored administration of vitamins and minerals, mitigating challenges such as inadequate solubility, low stability, and diminished bioavailability. Colloidal systems are generally constructed using food-grade natural macromolecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids as primary ingredients. They are engineered to encapsulate, safeguard, and regulate the release of water-soluble and fat-soluble vitamins and minerals, thereby augmenting their nutritional effectiveness in functional foods and beverages [ 3 38 An essential technique entails employing plant-derived colloidal delivery systems. Tan and McClements [ 24 138 Correspondingly, microencapsulation techniques have been devised for the concurrent administration of vitamins and minerals. Gu et al. [ 139 Moreover, investigations into colloidal delivery techniques respond to contemporary market requirements. Martins et al. [ 140 141 142 In summary, advancements in food colloids for the delivery of vitamins and minerals encompass the creation of plant-based nanoemulsions and microgels for encapsulating lipophilic vitamins, as well as novel fortification techniques in processed foods. Employing natural materials can protect delicate micronutrients from deterioration, control their release, and eventually improve bioavailability. The integration of modern food colloid design and targeted fortification procedures in these delivery systems has considerable potential to enhance food nutritional quality and mitigate worldwide micronutrient shortages. Current challenges focus on clarifying the molecular interaction mechanisms between colloidal carriers and nutrients, improving product quality stability during large-scale production, and developing multi-nutrient synergistic delivery systems. Innovative Pickering emulsion colloidal systems and 3D printing techniques present new opportunities for the concurrent delivery of nutritional combinations, including B vitamins, vitamin E, and selenium. Future research will concentrate on creating intelligent colloids that can modulate gut microbiota to facilitate the dual integration of nutrition delivery and metabolic regulation. 4.2. Food Colloids in Encapsulation and Delivery of Probiotics and Bioactive Peptides Food colloids have emerged as adaptable vehicles for the encapsulated delivery of probiotics in functional foods. The distribution of probiotics faces obstacles including hostile gastrointestinal environments, processing pressures, and storage conditions. Encapsulation with food-grade biopolymers, including proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids, creates a protective colloidal matrix that safeguards probiotics from acids, bile salts, and oxygen, while facilitating regulated release in the targeted intestinal area [ 143 144 A method involves bacterial-induced colloidal encapsulation, as illustrated in the research by Zhang et al. [ 145 Figure 6 146 147 6 7 148 Another new strategy is the use of natural hydrogels for encapsulation. For instance, as seen in Figure 6 147 144 149 Advanced preparation techniques, such as microfluidic devices, enhance the encapsulation process by enabling fine control of particle size, shape, and encapsulation efficiency without language [ 150 Milk protein-based encapsulants, when utilized as a matrix, deliver nutrients while offering protection, making them suitable for integration into dairy products without modifying their intrinsic flavor or texture [ 151 In summary, advancements in food colloids for probiotic encapsulation have produced several solutions that integrate natural polymer encapsulating technologies, sophisticated production techniques, and targeted release systems to address difficulties related to microbial viability. These colloidal systems augment the functional efficacy of probiotics in food applications, maintain elevated cellular activity from processing to ingestion, and play a crucial role in the advancement of the next generation of functional foods and nutraceuticals. Nevertheless, ongoing research continues to encounter numerous challenges, including the assessment of survival rates and stability of probiotics in the presence of gastric acid and digestive enzymes; the intestinal mucus layer and epithelial cell barrier obstructing the absorption of probiotics and bioactive peptides, consequently impacting delivery efficiency and targeting; and the elevated costs and intricate processes associated with large-scale production. 4.3. Food Colloids in Targeted Release of Functional Lipids Food colloids have arisen as a viable approach for the precise delivery of functional lipids. Due to the frequent limitations of functional lipids, such as inadequate water solubility, vulnerability to oxidation, and low bioavailability, food colloid delivery systems have been created to encapsulate and safeguard functional lipids while also facilitating controlled and site-specific release profiles within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Nanolaminate coatings, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and biopolymer microgels have emerged as pivotal platforms for the targeted release of bioactive lipids, including ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, carotenoids, and phytosterols [ 139 152 Table 2 A significant technique involves employing biopolymers to create nanolaminate coverings on lipid droplets. McClements delineates the architecture of these coatings, integrating several layers of biopolymers encasing droplets infused with lipophilic bioactives. Nanolaminate systems improve the stability of encapsulated lipids by resisting oxidative degradation and adjusting interfacial characteristics that regulate subsequent release. The multilayer construction facilitates a controlled release mechanism by allowing progressive diffusion of the lipid once the colloid arrives at the target region. Moreover, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) offer a flexible method for the delivery of bioactive lipids. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) are engineered to encapsulate lipophilic bioactives within a solid lipid matrix at room temperature [ 152 139 The suppression of lipid oxidation is a crucial element influencing the release and bioactivity of functional lipids. Figure 6 153 Furthermore, encapsulating techniques tailored for ω-3-rich fish oils have been investigated to address their instability and diminished bioavailability. Venugopalan et al. [ 154 Figure 6 Food Colloids in Targeted Delivery of Nutrients ( a 139 b 145 c 147 d 153 5. Applications of Nanoliposomes in Delivery of Bioactive Substances Nanoliposomes, serving as multifunctional nanocarriers, have garnered significant interest for the transport of bioactive compounds in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and food industries. Their distinctive architecture (bilayer lipid vesicles typically under 200 nm in diameter) can encapsulate both hydrophilic and lipophilic substances, offering benefits of biocompatibility, degradability, and possibility for controlled release. Moreover, the alteration of their physicochemical properties via surface modification, polymer coupling, or biopolymer coating can enhance their utility in targeted drug administration and precision nutritional formulations [ 155 156 Nanoliposomes are extensively utilized for medication and gene delivery. Mozafari [ 155 156 157 158 Targeted delivery is a significant application domain of nanoliposomes. Paolino et al. [ 159 160 160 Nanoliposomes not only target specific organs but also enhance the bioactivity of polyphenolic substances effectively. Sun et al. [ 161 162 163 164 Collectively, these advancements indicate that nanoliposomes serve as a dependable medium for the encapsulation and targeted distribution of various bioactive compounds. Nanoliposomes provide numerous benefits, including high encapsulation efficiency, controlled release kinetics, and enhanced bioavailability, whether employed in targeted drug or gene therapy in clinical environments, stabilization and release of sensitive nutrients in food systems, or improved skin delivery in cosmetic formulations. Future research is anticipated to concentrate on the issues associated with large-scale production and the further optimization of surface modification approaches for accurate targeting and extended in vivo circulation durations. 5.1. Preparation Methods and Advantages of Nanoliposomes The formulation of nanoliposomes has evolved into a multifaceted study domain, with several preparation techniques providing benefits regarding particle size regulation, encapsulation efficacy, and product functionality. Traditional methods, including microfluidization, extrusion, and sonication, have been extensively employed to produce nanoscale liposome vesicles (typically under 200 nm in diameter) capable of encapsulating both hydrophilic and lipophilic substances. Microfluidization employs high-pressure homogenization to amalgamate lipid and aqueous phases, resulting in uniformly sized liposomes suitable for large-scale production. Extrusion facilitates meticulous regulation of particle size distribution by directing a lipid slurry through a polycarbonate membrane with a predetermined pore size. Large-scale production can be burdensome [ 165 155 Additional benefits of nanoliposomes encompass biocompatibility and degradability, acknowledged as safe, derived from natural phospholipids. Their capacity to encapsulate both hydrophilic and lipophilic molecules broadens the spectrum of deliverable active ingredients while safeguarding them against environmental influences such as oxidation, pH variations, and enzymatic degradation. Nanoliposomes possess controlled release characteristics and the capacity for targeted distribution via ligand coupling, enabling them to attain therapeutic concentrations at designated regions of action while reducing systemic side effects. In conclusion, conventional preparation techniques including microfluidization, extrusion, and sonication provide distinct benefits for customizing nanoliposomes. Microfluidization and extrusion are essential for attaining uniform particle size and excellent encapsulation efficiency, whereas sonication offers a rapid and efficient method for particle size reduction. These methods, coupled with post-formulation modifications, facilitate the batch production of highly biocompatible nanoliposomes that improve solubility, stability, and permit controlled and targeted delivery of bioactive compounds, thereby advancing the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and cosmetic sectors. 5.2. Protective Role of Nanoliposomes for Unstable Bioactive Substances Food colloids frequently safeguard unstable active ingredients by one or more of the following mechanisms: (1) Fully encapsulating unstable active compounds within carriers (e.g., liposomes, nanoemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles) to establish a physical barrier that entirely isolates them from the external environment; (2) Leveraging confinement effects to disperse and immobilize active compounds within protein/polysaccharide gels, thereby restricting their molecular mobility and diffusion rates to decelerate degradation kinetics; (3) Utilizing controlled environments, such as pH or moisture levels, to protect substances sensitive to pH variations or susceptible to hydrolysis. Nanoliposomes, as biocompatible self-assembled bilayer vesicles, effectively safeguard unstable bioactives by separating sensitive chemicals from detrimental environmental influences, including oxidation, light, enzyme degradation, and heat instability. Encapsulating bioactive compounds within lipid bilayers enhances chemical stability and preserves bioactivity, hence prolonging shelf-life and enhancing the bioavailability of several nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals [ 166 167 A primary benefit of nanoliposome encapsulation is its capacity to safeguard extremely unstable chemicals, including those prone to oxidation and destruction. For instance, β-carotene, which is susceptible to light and oxidation, was encapsulated in nanoliposomes using high-speed homogenization, a technique that markedly diminished its breakdown rate while improving cellular absorption [ 166 167 168 Subsequent research developments have concentrated on the surface modification of nanoliposomes to improve protection. Nanoliposomes containing fexofenadine encapsulated with hyaluronic acid (HA) impede the mobility of phospholipid head groups, thereby diminishing micropolarity and improving storage and thermal stability while maintaining the membrane fluidity of the hydrophobic core [ 161 169 In addition, the protective effect of nanoliposomes has been enhanced in formulations designed to co-encapsulate synergistic bioactive compounds. For example, lecithin-based nanoliposomes co-encapsulating serpentinone and xanthohumol achieved high encapsulation efficiency and significant antioxidant activity, suggesting that such multicomponent nano-formulations can protect the active ingredient from degradation while achieving controlled release [ 170 82 171 In conclusion, the protective effects of nanoliposomes on unstable bioactives are numerous. For instance, encapsulating chemicals like β-carotene, essential oils, proanthocyanidins, and bioactive peptides within stabilized lipid vesicles can avert premature degradation of these unstable actives and guarantee continuous release. Surface modification using biopolymers like hyaluronic acid and chitosan enhances the protective effect by enhancing physicochemical stability and customizing release kinetics. Nanoliposomes serve as a dependable medium for the administration of sensitive bioactives in food, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical applications, thereby enhancing efficacy and prolonging shelf life. 5.3. Application of Nanoliposomes in Oral Delivery of Peptides, Proteins, Polysaccharides, and Other Substances Nanoliposomes have garnered significant interest as oral delivery systems for delicate biomolecules, including peptides, proteins, and polysaccharides. Their bilayer architecture offers dual compartments for encapsulating hydrophilic substances within water-soluble cores and lipophilic compounds in lipid bilayers, safeguarding unstable substances from adverse conditions like acidic pH in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and enzymatic degradation, while also enhancing solubility and bioavailability following oral administration [ 172 The research conducted by Sarabandi and Jafari [ 172 Yokota et al. [ 173 Auwal et al. [ 174 This study illustrates the substantial benefits of nanoliposomes as an oral delivery mechanism for many bioactive substances. Their capacity to safeguard sensitive molecules by encapsulation, provide regulated release mechanisms, and improve mucosal adhesion through surface modification renders them especially appealing for the advancement of functional foods and nutraceuticals. The scalability of techniques like high-pressure extrusion and direct heating enhances their economic viability. In summary, the incorporation of nanoliposomes in oral delivery systems resulted in effective encapsulation and safeguarding of peptides, proteins, and polysaccharides, markedly enhancing their stability and bioavailability within the gastrointestinal milieu. The investigation of flaxseed-derived bioactive peptides, casein hydrolysates, and biopeptide complexes involved the modulation of parameters such as surface charge, particle size, and release kinetics, demonstrating the adaptability of nanoliposomes as vehicles for drug and nutrition delivery. Future research focused on optimizing production techniques and investigating surface functionalization strategies is anticipated to improve their applicability in nutritional supplementation and therapeutic interventions ( Figure 7 6. Patents and Commercially Available Products Based on Food Gels 6.1. Patents Based on Food-Derived Colloidal Carriers Research patents on food-derived colloidal delivery systems predominantly employ components from food sources (such as proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids) to fabricate standard colloidal carriers (e.g., emulsions, liposomes, gel particles, and complexes). These provide the precise distribution of pharmaceuticals or bioactive agents to designated locations (e.g., stomach, small intestine, colon) through oral administration. This method improves the stability of pharmaceuticals or active compounds while enhancing the effectiveness of targeted distribution. Principal advantages encompass superior biocompatibility and environmental responsiveness (e.g., pH- or enzyme-mediated release). Table 3 6.2. Commercially Available Products Based on Food-Grade Colloids Investigations into food-grade colloidal carriers have been commercialized as dietary supplements, functional foods, or medicinal excipients, having food-grade colloidal technology as their foundation. These products facilitate “targeted delivery” capabilities, specifically in colonic administration and improved bioavailability. Table 4 7. Conclusions Colloidal targeted delivery systems based on food can selectively transport medications or nutrients to designated locations by altering the physicochemical characteristics of carriers and changing their surfaces with specific ligands, hence improving bioavailability and therapeutic effectiveness. This review encapsulates advancements in the application of food colloidal materials for the development of targeted delivery systems, emphasizing their roles in anticancer drug delivery, brain-targeted delivery, and intestinal-targeted delivery systems. Recent breakthroughs in the administration of bioactive components and the application of nanoliposomes for the oral transport of biomolecules are also emphasized. Food colloidal materials have superior biocompatibility and safety, rendering them optimal carriers for the development of tailored delivery systems. Nonetheless, food colloidal-focused delivery methods continue to encounter the following limitations: (1) Restricted assortment of carrier materials, complicating the fulfillment of diverse drug or nutrient delivery requirements; (2) the stability and targeting efficacy of particular ligands for surface modification require enhancement; (3) intricate preparation procedures obstruct large-scale production; (4) inadequate in vivo metabolic assessments and safety evaluations. Future research should concentrate on creating innovative food colloidal materials that exhibit improved biocompatibility, degradability, drug-loading capacity, and modifiability. Integrating multi-modal targeting strategies—such as active versus passive targeting and physical versus chemical targeting—can enhance delivery efficiency. Before clinical implementation, food-based colloidal targeted delivery systems must undergo comprehensive preclinical investigation and clinical testing. Preclinical evaluation must include pharmacokinetic, toxicological, and pharmacodynamic investigations to determine the in vivo performance, safety, and effectiveness of the delivery system. Despite various challenges, the advancement of innovative food-grade materials, refinement of composite targeting strategies, enhancements in manufacturing processes, and comprehensive clinical translation research will augment the efficacy of food colloid-based targeted delivery systems in disease treatment and nutritional intervention. These technologies provide an innovative approach for accurate medicine and nutrient administration, showcasing extensive application potential.
