To promote a better understanding of this disabling condition and to foster research on the topic, this review provides a comprehensive description of the hallmarks of CH, including its clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges, pathophysiology, and current and novel therapeutic targets. It concludes by describing the disease burden and advocating for significant improvements in healthcare systems, and promoting health equity, as well as reducing stigma. Principal findings Despite its distinctive clinical and chronobiological features, CH may be mistaken for other primary headache disorders or different types of orofacial pain. Key pathogenic characteristics include the activation of the trigeminal-autonomic system with the release of several neuropeptides, the involvement of the hypothalamus in regulating the circadian rhythm, genetic variants, and the mesolimbic system. Both invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation treatments have been used to target the trigemino-cervical, parasympathetic, and hypothalamic systems. Additionally, novel therapeutic targets are currently being study. Alongside canonical therapies, several complementary approaches have been explored over the years, with most evidence deriving from uncontrolled research involving individuals who do not respond to standard pharmacological treatments. Despite advancements in our understanding of this complex disease, CH continues to pose considerable social, economic, and psychological challenges. Advocacy is essential and should prioritize early diagnosis, alleviate stigma, provide specialized training for healthcare professionals, and offer support to and through patient associations. Conclusions CH is characterised by a complex, multifactorial, pathophysiology that is still not fully understood. Precise diagnosis, additional research studies, and robust psychosocial and institutional support are necessary to improve the quality of life for individuals affected by this debilitating condition.

Clinically, CH is characterised by severe and strictly unilateral pain, predominantly involving the territory of the first division of the trigeminal nerve, accompanied by autonomic symptoms. Attacks of CH generally last between 15 and 180 min, exhibit circadian and circannual recurrence, and may be associated with agitation or restlessness [ 1 2 5 6 Notwithstanding its distinctive clinical presentation, CH frequently remains underdiagnosed and unacknowledged in clinical practice, resulting in a long lag between the onset of the disease and obtaining an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment [ 7 8 Clinical, biochemical, and electrophysiological studies have recognised the crucial role of the trigeminal-parasympathetic system and the hypothalamus in the aetiology and recurrence of CH pain; nevertheless, the sequence of activation of these separate systems remains unclear. Additionally, while the hypothalamus is primarily recognised for regulating the seasonal and circadian patterns of attacks, additional structures seem to play a role, including the brainstem monoaminergic systems in the midbrain – particularly the dopaminergic system in chronic cases – and the descending pain control systems. However, the exact pathophysiological cascade and structures involved are still not completely understood. This lack of understanding is also witnessed by the restricted therapeutic alternatives, comprising solely sumatriptan and oxygen for acute management, steroids for bridging therapy, and a scarcity of genuinely effective prophylactic agents aside from verapamil. Additionally, despite multiple attempts to use alternative pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods, their use is limited by the lack of controlled clinical trials and their efficacy being restricted to a specific subset of patients. To delineate the hallmarks of CH across several domains, we provide a comprehensive description of several aspects of CH. Through different subsections, each designed to present the aspects that characterize CH-specific traits, this review aims to summarize the most thorough and accurate research available on this topic. These included CH clinical presentation, diagnostic challenges, pathophysiology, and current and novel therapeutic targets. Finally, it concludes by describing the disease burden and advocating for significant improvements in healthcare systems, reducing stigma, and promoting health equity. Clinical features of episodic and chronic CH CH is a debilitating disorder characterized by severe, unilateral pain typically located around the eye. As one of the most common TACs, autonomic symptoms are typical during CH attacks. CH can be divided into episodic and chronic subtypes. Those with episodic CH have bouts that last from 7 days to one year, separated by pain-free periods for at least 3 months, when untreated. Most cluster periods usually last between two weeks and three months [ 1 9 The clinical features of these subtypes reveal significant differences in attack frequency, bout duration, and associated symptoms. Individuals suffering from episodic CH experience well-defined cycles of recurrent attacks, often referred to as “bouts”, which can last for weeks to months. These bouts are commonly followed by extended periods of remission, sometimes lasting months or even years [ 10 11 CH episodes typically manifest as short but intense attacks, with each attack lasting between 15 min and three hours [ 9 12 13 10 14 15 In contrast, chronic CH is characterized by a more relentless pattern of attacks. Patients with chronic CH experience a higher frequency of attacks, with some individuals enduring as many as 10 or more headache episodes each day during active bouts, which can last for years without significant relief [ 11 In very rare cases, bilateral CH has been reported [ 16 17 18 18 19 20 Patients with CH frequently exhibit restless and agitated behaviours, presenting with continuously moving in an unsuccessful effort to alleviate their pain. Approximately 80–90% of individuals become restless in the Western cohorts [ 21 22 23 9 24 25 26 27 17 In regard to the sex-related differences in clinical features, studies from large cohorts have reported older onset age [ 4 28 29 4 28 4 30 4 30 30 31 30 31 4 28 4 28 29 30 31 4 28 29 4 28 31 For episodic CH, there is a characteristic circannual pattern, often peaking in the spring and fall, possibly aligning with temperature changes [ 32 33 12 13 11 34 35 18 36 37 38 39 Additionally, the pre-cluster symptoms, frequently presenting as localized pain and sensations, may alert patients to the impending onset of a bout and tend to be more recognized in individuals with a history of multiple bouts [ 40 41 42 Research shows that patients with episodic CH report more symptoms before a headache attack compared to those with chronic CH [ 5 Neurobiological mechanisms underpinning these clinical features highlight the role of the hypothalamus in CH pathophysiology [ 43 44 45 46 47 In summary, both chronic and episodic CH presents with a set of distinctive clinical features characterized by severe unilateral pain and ipsilateral autonomic symptoms. The differing attack frequencies, bout durations, and symptomatology distinguish the episodic and chronic CH, highlight the complexity of CH. The necessity for individualized treatment approaches to manage the debilitating nature of CH effectively should be underlined. Genetic basis CH is recognized as a complex disease, due to interactions between genetic and environmental factors and to date, various molecular genetic clues have been identified. First degree relatives of patients with CH have a 5–18 increased risk of developing the disease compared to the general population while second-degree relatives of patients have an 1–3 increased CH risk [ 48 49 50 49 51 Results from Linkage studies in CH have so far been negative. Calcium channel alpha 1 subunit (CACNA1A) micro satellites have been screened in CH families from the Netherlands and in a Swedish cohort, both studies were reported negative [ 52 53 54 HCRTR2 55 HCRTR2 HCRTR2 56 57 58 HCRTR2 Considering the periodical occurrence of CH bouts, genes that regulate chronobiological function have been investigated. Several studies genotyped CH patients and controls for the rs1801260 polymorphism of the CLOCK 59 62 CLOCK 63 CRY1 CRY2 64 PER1 PER2 PER3 65 66 According to clinical studies, more than 50% of CH patients have attacks triggered by alcohol consumption, suggesting a causative role for genes related to alcohol metabolism and alcohol dependence in the genetic predisposition to the disease. The alcohol dehydrogenase 4 ( ADH4) ADH4 67 ADH4 61 ADH4 62 68 69 So far there has been limited focus on the genetic aspects of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and its receptors in CH, but one genetic variant in the receptor activity-modifying protein 1 gene ( RAMP1 70 In a recent meta genome wide association study (GWAS) including 10 European cohorts and one East Asian eight loci were identified [ 15 FHL5 PLCE1 LRP1 71 MERTK MERKT 72 A recent study from France, using the whole genome sequencing (WGS) strategy, searched for candidate genes and new genetic variants of the disease investigating a multigenerational CH pedigree. The WGS on four members of the pedigree found that two family members showing the same phenotypic circadian pattern (familial periodicity) of symptoms had two genetic risk loci in the HCRTR2 CLOCK 73 Pharmacogenetic studies investigating the role of gene polymorphisms in drug responses in CH have been performed. In an analysis of 184 CH patients, no association between the HCRTR2 74 GNB3 75 69 76 5-HTTLPR CYP3A4 77 78 Increased knowledge in the genetics field of CH can improve diagnosis and treatment by identifying biomarkers and novel drug targets, as well as developing future treatment strategies. In the past years there have been a significant process in the genetics of CH. Several candidate genes have been screened in CH cohorts worldwide, but with conflicting results. This is mainly due to few replication studies, small cohorts and geographical differences. Genome wide association studies have on the other hand identified eight significant loci, where three of them are shared with migraine, and the prioritized genes show enrichment in arterial and brain tissues. Molecular pathways The trigeminovascular and cranial parasympathetic systems are activated during CH attacks, leading to the expression and release of vasoactive neuropeptides, including CGRP, PACAP, VIP and NO. This section will review the role of these molecules in CH and will highlight the presence of other potential modulators of CH pathophysiology. Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) CGRP is a neuropeptide that is expressed in the areas involved in the pathophysiology of CH, including the trigeminal ganglia (TG), the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and the hypothalamus [ 79 80 80 CGRP has been linked to CH pathophysiology in a variety of studies. CGRP is elevated in plasma in acute cluster headache in both spontaneous [ 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) The neuropeptide PACAP is expressed in CH relevant areas, including the trigeminal ganglia, the sphenopalatine ganglia, the otic ganglia, the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and the hypothalamus, among other regions [ 92 93 94 93 95 Like CGRP, PACAP is released during CH attacks. An exploratory study ( n 96 Other key studies highlight the relevance of PACAP for CH biology. The infusion of PACAP38 provokes CH-like attacks in episodic CH participants in the active, but not in the remission phase, and in chronic CH participants [ 97 98 99 Currently, there are no treatments targeting PACAP for CH. However, a proof-of-concept trial has shown the efficacy of an anti-PACAP antibody for migraine [ 100 Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) VIP is from the same peptide family, secretin-glucagon, as PACAP, with which it shares nearly 70% sequence identity [ 101 92 102 The studies that assess the role of VIP in CH are few, although they indicate a potential implication for its pathophysiology. Like CGRP and PACAP, VIP levels are elevated during CH attacks [ 81 97 98 99 Nitric oxide (NO) Nitric oxide (NO) is a signalling molecule widely expressed throughout the body that plays a role in several functions that are linked to CH pathophysiology, such as processing sensory information, pain sensitization and circadian regulation [ 103 104 106 Although it is not possible to measure the levels of NO due to its short half-life, its levels have been assessed indirectly by measuring the products of its oxidation, nitrite and nitrate. Two studies have shown higher levels of nitrite and nitrate in CSF and plasma of CH patients in their active period when compared to remission and healthy controls [ 107 108 109 110 Other modulators of CH Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium (K ATP ATP ATP 111 ATP ATP Melatonin is a hypothalamic hormone that is only secreted in darkness. Its role in CH biology has been suggested due to its anti-nociceptive and anti-inflammatory properties and its implication in circadian and circannual regulation [ 112 113 Orexin A and B are hypothalamic neuropeptides involved in the promotion of arousal and in the regulation of nociception, body temperature, feeding behaviour and neuroendocrine system, among other functions [ 112 114 Concluding remarks In summary, studies support the role of CGRP, PACAP, VIP and NO in the pathophysiology of CH. Further research should focus on understanding the pathways regulated by these and emerging molecules to discover new therapeutic targets and to optimise current therapeutic strategies for CH. The trigeminal autonomic reflex The trigeminal autonomic reflex (TAR) is a complex, bidirectional neural circuit in which trigeminal nociceptive afferents activate parasympathetic efferents, contributing to the hallmark cranial autonomic features of CH [ 115 Anatomy and reflex pathway The trigeminal nerve is divided into three branches: ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3) [ 115 116 117 117 Collateral projections from the TCC reach the superior salivatory nucleus (SSN) in the pontine tegmentum [ 116 116 Neuropeptides modulation The activation of the trigeminovascular system leads to the release of several neuropeptides and neurotransmitters from trigeminal sensory nerve endings, including CGRP, neurokinin A, substance P, NO, and PACAP [ 117 118 115 81 82 81 82 84 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo‐controlled crossover trial, 31 patients received 20‐minute infusions of CGRP or saline on separate days [ 119 119 120 Infusions of PACAP38 or VIP can trigger CH-like attacks without altering plasma CGRP or tryptase, and histamine (surrogate markers of mast cell activation), indicating that additional neuropeptides contribute to attack initiation [ 98 121 124 108 125 126 127 The role of the hypothalamus in trigeminal autonomic reflex Peripheral activation of the afferent and efferent arcs of the trigeminal autonomic reflex alone is insufficient to induce CH attacks [ 128 129 111 111 97 85 Functional MRI studies have shown increased activation of the anterior hypothalamus during painful mechanical trigeminal stimulation, which triggers the trigeminal autonomic reflex [ 130 131 132 Clinical implications SPG stimulation has been linked to CH attack remission in clinical studies [ 133 134 134 129 129 135 137 138 139 Conclusion and future directions The trigeminal autonomic reflex is a crucial neural mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of CH, involving intricate interactions between nociceptive and parasympathetic systems. Peripheral activation of the trigeminovascular system initiates parasympathetic outflow, which manifests as the characteristic autonomic features of CH, while central hypothalamic mechanisms regulate the reflex’s susceptibility to attack. This understanding has revealed multiple therapeutic targets, ranging from peripheral neuropeptides to central modulators. Future research should focus on elucidating how hypothalamic control intersects with peripheral signalling and explores combined therapeutic strategies that simultaneously disrupt both arms of the reflex arc. Hypothalamic mechanisms in CH The hypothalamus belongs to the limbic system and is a small yet highly complex and functionally diverse brain region that is highly interconnected with other parts of the central nervous system and maintains direct connections with the vasculature. Serving as a critical brain-hormonal interface, it regulates and modulates a wide array of physiological systems, many of which may be dysregulated in the pathophysiology of primary headache disorders. These include amongst others body temperature regulation, sleep, food and water intake, autonomic nervous system control, circadian and circannual rhythms, and pain-modulating systems [ 140 141 142 Several clinical features of CH, including cranial autonomic dysfunction and the characteristic temporal pattern of the disease, strongly implicate the hypothalamus as a key structure involved in both prodromal manifestations and the initiation of headache attacks [ 141 9 May and colleagues demonstrated increased regional cerebral blood flow in the posterior hypothalamic grey matter ipsilateral to the attack side during nitroglycerin-induced CH-like attacks, as observed using positron emission tomography (PET) [ 143 144 1 145 146 147  Fig. 1 Posterior hypothalamic activation ipsilateral to the side of headache during an attack in comparison to the headache-free state as demonstrated through the use of a positron emission tomography scan. It is noteworthy that functional imaging studies have repeatedly demonstrated activation in the posterior hypothalamic gray matter at the level of the junction with the midbrain. This activation (of this part of the hypothalamus) is not observed in cases of migraine or other forms of experimental headache. The Journal of Headache and Pain needs to secure permission to reproduce the figure originally published in Neurology (10.1212/WNL.52.7.1522) In addition to the role of the hypothalamus in attack generation, other studies sought to examine the long-term structural changes of the hypothalamus in CH. A pivotal study combining functional and structural data found a co-localization of functional activity in the individual attack and an increase in grey matter of the same area [ 148 149 150 151 152 148 153 153 154 155 156 Several studies have identified aberrant resting-state functional connectivity in patients with episodic CH, both during and between attacks, particularly between the hypothalamus and key regions of the pain-processing network, such as the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, contralateral thalamus, ipsilateral basal ganglia, insular cortex, inferior parietal lobule, parahippocampal gyrus, and bilateral cerebellar hemispheres [ 43 146 157 161 160 In chronic CH patients, functional connectivity alterations have been observed in the posterior hypothalamus, as well as in diencephalic-mesencephalic regions ipsilateral to the headache side [ 162 46 46 46 143 163 Evidence of the hypothalamic involvement in the generation of attacks led to the introduction of deep brain stimulation of the posterior hypothalamic grey matter as a treatment option for patients with intractable CH, particularly those with chronic forms of the disorder without remission periods, where disability is extremely high and alternative treatment options have been exhausted [ 164 165 167 168 169 170 170 171 Central mechanisms other than hypothalamus Despite the established role of the hypothalamus in the circadian rhythmicity and circannual rhythmicity of CH attacks [ 172 173 174 The brainstem structures are considered to play a pivotal role in CH pathophysiology [ 175 176 177 174 178 179 180 Recently, the ventral tegmental area (VTA)—a midbrain structure and central hub of the dopaminergic mesocorticolimbic system—has emerged, along with the broader mesocorticolimbic network traditionally associated with reward and motivation processes (including also the prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and amygdala), as a crucial component in the pathophysiology of CH. Multiple lines of evidence—including findings from several neuropsychiatric and chronic pain conditions, the effectiveness of VTA deep brain stimulation (DBS) in chronic CH, and CH-specific neuroimaging results—converge to support the involvement of this dopaminergic circuit in the disorder. Abnormalities within the mesocorticolimbic system are thought to contribute to pain chronification [ 181 182 183 184 185 Moreover, providing more direct evidence of the involvement of the mesocorticolimbic circuit, a series of functional neuroimaging studies in patients with chronic and episodic CH have progressively highlighted altered functional connectivity within this network. In particular, resting-state functional connectivity abnormalities have been observed in chronic CH between the posterior hypothalamus and diencephalic regions, including VTA [ 186 187 188 189 190 191 Another network thought to contribute to CH is the salience network. This important functional circuit mainly comprises the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, and frontal operculum and is involved in attentional, affective, and autonomic modulation and coordination. Functional connectivity changes in salience network, even during headache remission [ 192 Importantly, several studies have highlighted a disrupted interplay between the salience network and other brain networks and regions in patients with episodic CH. Specifically, reduced functional connectivity between the salience network and the left executive control network has been observed, suggesting potential difficulties in switching between internally and externally oriented cognitive states during in-bout period [ 193 159 194 The thalamus is another key brain structure significantly involved in CH pathophysiology due to its role—among many others—in the processing and integration of nociceptive stimuli. Evidence suggests that the thalamus contributes to headache sensitization, through mechanisms similar to those observed in migraine patients, where thalamic activity correlates with hyperalgesia and allodynia [ 195 193 Although further studies are needed to clarify the involvement of DMN in CH pathophysiology, increased functional connectivity between this network and the executive control network was recently observed in patients with CH [ 193 196 Importantly, recent functional imaging studies have revealed the existence of a complex network of interconnected regions within the cerebellum, including the prefrontal and insula cortices, as well as the amygdala. These regions have been shown to be involved in the processing of pain and emotional responses, suggesting a potential influence on the clinical symptoms of CH. The precise mechanisms by which these regions may modulate pain perception, emotional responses, and behavioural performance remain to be fully elucidated. Furthermore, structural imaging studies have demonstrated that patients suffering from chronic CH exhibit a reduced thickness in the anterior lobe of the cerebellum when compared to healthy individuals [ 197 The pituitary gland may also be implicated in a subset of patients. The presence of functional abnormalities or microadenomas has been demonstrated to exacerbate symptoms, particularly in the presence of hormonal imbalances such as hyperprolactinemia [ 198 Altogether, the evidence reviewed highlights that CH is not the result of a localized brain dysfunction but rather reflects widespread disturbances involving both subcortical structures—such as the brainstem, thalamus, and hypothalamus—and large-scale network dysfunctions, particularly within the mesocorticolimbic, salience, and the default mode networks. Although this supports the conceptualisation of CH as a multisystem disorder, a comprehensive understanding of the functional meaning and temporal dynamics of these alterations remains elusive. The lack of a robust unifying interpretative framework underscores the need for longitudinal studies across the different phases of the disorder in large sample of CH patients, aimed at disentangling the role of brain networks reorganization in the pathophysiology of CH and their relationship with the clinical and neuropsychiatric data. Electrophysiological aspects of CH Three core features of cluster headache—excruciating pain, autonomic disturbances, and a tendency to occur during sleep—have been investigated through various electrophysiological approaches. These studies have provided objective insights into the pathophysiological processes underlying the clinical presentation of the disorder. Among these features, pain processing has been the most extensively studied, using a range of electrophysiological techniques including the nociceptive blink reflex (nBR), laser-evoked potentials (LEPs), trigeminal evoked responses, and pain-related evoked potentials (PREPs) (Table 1 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 200 200 206 207 208 209 210 211 168  Table 1 List of neurophysiological studies that investigated the pain processing in subjects with cluster headache.

Using dynamic pupillometry, Micieli et al. [ 212 213 214 215 216 Finally, the strong circadian and sleep-related patterns of cluster headache have prompted electrophysiological studies into sleep physiology. According to Gorgoni et al. [ 217 218 219 168 Taken together, electrophysiological studies in CH consistently reveal central and lateralized dysfunctions in pain processing, widespread abnormalities in autonomic control, and disrupted sleep physiology, all of which have been captured using reliable neurophysiological techniques. Collectively, these findings not only reflect the complexity of CH but also underscore its distinct neurophysiological fingerprint—one that bridges pain, autonomic function, and chronobiology. The chronobiology of CH In its essential form the strictly unilateral CH attacks strike at night, typically after 1–2 h of sleep, every night for 1 to 2 months only to wane off after weeks or months. Unsurprisingly, the severity of the attacks and this curious timewise manifestation has prompted considerable scientific interest into the sleep and chronobiology of CH (Fig. 2  Fig. 2 Hypnogram overlaid with attack pattern and hypothetical implicated hormone fluctuations. Attacks might be related to sleep stage transitions during the night or daytime naps, or to relatively low melatonin and/or cortisol levels Sleep CH attacks tend to occur at fixed, predictable times often during sleep. This awakens patients with CH and thereby severely disturbs their night-rest. In clinical anecdotes, patients with CH may often deprive themselves of sleep to prevent attacks and may be afraid to take naps during the day because attacks may strike [ 220 221 Approximately 80% of patients with CH report attacks during sleep and 30% report attacks during daytime naps [ 222 223 223 229 221 230 231 223 232 233 Despite the high prevalence of poor sleep quality in CH patients, improvement of sleep quality is generally neglected in CH treatment or has only attracted minimal attention. Poor sleep quality may aggravate pain attacks by chronic sleep deprivation induced by nocturnal pain attacks leading to a vicious cycle. Only a few, mostly unsuccessful, attempts have been tried to influence nocturnal pain attacks in patients via changes of sleep structure or sleep quality. Sodium oxybate is a naturally occurring neurotransmitter and a GABA-B receptor agonist used in the treatment of narcolepsy. In contrast to benzodiazepines, sodium oxybate will deepen sleep (increased slow-wave sleep) [ 234 235 236 Chronobiology Among diseases and disorders, CH is amongst those with the strongest chronobiological features. This applies to both daily attacks and clusters of attacks. Concerning circadian rhythmicity, with some variation across the studied populations, 60–80% of sufferers report predictability in the occurrence of their attacks [ 35 222 35 222 222 237 Despite this short- and long-term predictability, it is evident that CH is also a dynamic condition. For example, there are indications that over time the chronobiological distinctiveness may fade [ 238 239 240 241 Along these lines, in episodic patients, rhythmicity seems strongly circadian (24 h) and in chronic more ultradian (< 24 h) [ 242 31 30 239 Looking towards medications known to influence biological chronorhythms, older reports of differential responses to melatonin, verapamil and lithium between subgroups of CH may support involvement of mechanisms controlling homeostasis and sleep [ 243 244 243 245 Conclusion The association between CH and sleep and chronobiology is quite distinct but essentially remains a pathophysiological curiosity as the gap towards clinical applications of this knowledge have not been bridged yet. Still, anything that can be done to improve the dreadful disorder, including diagnosis and treatment of possible co-occurring sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, should be undertaken [ 246 Personality traits of patients with CH Increasing attention is being paid to the potential role of psychopathological factors, including personality traits, in determining both the expression and progression of CH. This shift reflects the principles of the biopsychosocial model of health, which posits that disease arises from the complex, multidirectional interactions among biological, psychological, and social factors [ 247 248 Emotional and personality dimensions in CH Although depression is one of the most common psychiatric comorbidities in CH [ 249 250 251 252 251 253 These emotional and relational patterns have led researchers to explore whether CH might also be linked to more enduring personality configurations that go beyond episodic distress. In line with this perspective, Mongini et al. [ 254 While no single personality profile appears to define CH, certain traits recur across studies. An historical work by Cuypers [ 255 256 257 258 This heterogeneity was also evident in the comparative study by Munoz [ 259 Psychosocial functioning and behavioural patterns One particularly interesting aspect of personality functioning in CH concerns the direction in which emotional suffering is expressed. While it has often been assumed that patients with CH might be more prone to externalized anger or irritability, the empirical evidence offers a different pattern. A multicentre controlled study [ 260 From a social point of view, many CH patients appear to experience a reduction in social support and relational integration. As noted by Blomkvist [ 261 This psychological profile often coexists with behavioural patterns that may further impact disease management, including unhealthy lifestyle habits and risk-prone behaviours [ 262 263 264 Lambru and Matharu [ 265 266 267 15 Taken together, the evidence reviewed highlights a complex and nuanced psychological profile in CH patients, where specific personality traits may interact with emotional regulation, behavioural tendencies, and social functioning. These patterns, while heterogeneous, could share common features that deserve meaningful clinical implications—particularly in terms of diagnosis, disease burden, and treatment. Clinical implications and final considerations Although there is no single personality profile specific to CH, several traits—such as obsessive-compulsive, histrionic, paranoid, and schizoid features—appear more frequently in this population than in other headache disorders. Patterns of emotional detachment, impulsivity, and low social engagement are also common and may contribute to increased disability and treatment complexity. While current evidence provides valuable insights, methodological limitations—such as small samples and reliance on self-report tools—warrant caution. Future research should incorporate longitudinal designs and clinician-administered assessments to better capture the role of personality in CH. In very conclusion, what is evident is that a clearer understanding of the most recurrent psychological features in CH —particularly emotional instability, internalized hostility, and social withdrawal —could offer a useful framework for interpreting patient behaviour and guiding more personalized therapeutic approaches. Old and new Pharmacological targets: historical aspects and mechanisms of action Old targets Histamine One of the first potential drugs for CH treatment was histamine. Since the very first description by Bayard T. Horton in 1939 [ 268 269 268 270 271 Ergotamine Even before the recognition of “Horton syndrome” or “Histaminic cephalalgia”, in 1937 Wilfred Harris reported that subcutaneous injections of ergotamine tartrate alleviated “migrainous neuralgia” headache, nowadays considered to probably be CH patients [ 269 271 272 Methysergide Methysergide was explored as a possible migraine treatment in 1959 for the first time [ 273 274 273 274 Caffeine Caffeine is a non-selective antagonist of A 1 2 275 275 276 276 Lithium The use of the lithium salt as a remedy in CH is another example of a serendipitous finding which was first suggested by Karl Ekbom in 1974 [ 277 278 A 279 280 281 Further, long-term lithium treatment has been shown to increase neuronal monoamine synthesis, particularly that of the indolamine 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) [ 281 282 Steroids In 1975 Jammes communicated the results of the first double-blind, placebo-controlled, single crossover study that showed that prednisone decreased the CH attack frequency in 17/19 treated patients with prior failure to other therapies, such as ergotamine, methysergide, caffeine, phenobarbital and other analgesics [ 283 284 Oxygen In 1981, Lee Kudrow communicated for the first time that 100% oxygen at 7–10 L was able to abort CH attacks within minutes [ 285 278 Oxygens mechanism of action has long been considered to be vasoconstriction [ 286 81 287 Verapamil The first scientific evidence supporting the use of verapamil in CH was published in 1983 by Meyer and Hardenberg, in a series of five patients that received it [ 288 289 290 291 Verapamil’s mechanism of action in CH is not yet determined. However, it has been suggested to modify CGRP-release via blocking of presynaptic calcium channels [ 290 288 292 It should be noted that though most available data on CCBs effect on CH comes from verapamil, other voltage-gated CCBs such as nifedipine (30–180 mg/daily) and nimodipine (60–120 mg/daily) have also demonstrated a high efficacy in the prophylactic treatment of CH [ 288 Triptans The first preliminary evidence of sumatriptan in CH acute treatment was published in 1989 [ 293 294 1B 1B/D 295 296 297 Figure 3  Fig. 3 Timeline of the first evidence of efficacy for older drugs in the treatment of cluster headaches Future/evolving targets CGRP-targeting drugs CGRP is increased in plasma of CH patients during attacks when compared to out-of-bout periods [ 298 299 300 301 302 Psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) Psilocybin and LSD have been suggested to abort CH attacks and increase remission periods between bouts [ 303 304 Ketamine is a NMDA receptor antagonist that inhibits glutamate-mediated excitatory neurotransmission. This may decrease periaqueductal gray substance, dorsal raphe nucleus and locus coeruleus activation, also decreasing nociceptive signals to the trigeminal nucleus caudalis and ultimately reducing the CGRP release [ 305 Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase MER (MERTK) Recent GWAS studies have revealed an upregulation of the MERTK receptor in CH patients [ 306 307 72 72 Current acute and Bridge Pharmacological treatments of CH Treatment of CH requires acute, transitional and preventive drug treatment. Acute therapy (i.e., oxygen, triptans) is used for acute attack abortion or suppression, but does not influence the duration of the cluster episode. Preventive treatment aims to terminate the cluster episode, while transitional therapy aims to induce a rapid cessation or reduction in attack frequency to bridge the period needed for the preventive therapy to become effective. Acute treatment Several substances have proven efficacy to abort the acute CH attack in randomized, controlled clinical trials (RCTs). Oxygen Inhalation of 100% oxygen with a non-rebreathing face mask is one of the most frequently used acute therapies, as it has no adverse events. Two RCTs with have assessed the efficacy of oxygen vs. regular air inhalation in the acute treatment of CH attacks and 12 L/min for 15 min vs. regular air inhalation. The dose used in the first trial was 6 L/min for up to 15 min and the majority (56%) of participants reported substantial headache relief [ 308 309 Triptans A comprehensive Cochrane review found six randomized, RCT for the acute treatment of CH attacks [ 310 310 311 15 312 313 314 314 315 316 317 Intranasal Lidocaine One crossover RCT, one non-randomized trial and two case series have described the efficacy of lidocaine for the acute treatment of CH attacks [ 318 321 321 322 Ergotamine Dihydroergotamine (DHE) is an injectable alternative to triptans, but not generally available and with more side effects. The evidence of efficacy is based on small retrospective studies suggesting that intravenous DHE may be effective in both inpatient and outpatient settings [ 323 Octreotide Subcutaneous octreotide 100 µg was assessed in 57 participants with CH in a RCT versus placebo. Headache relief (mild to no pain) was achieved in 57% of subjects at 30 min with octreotide vs. 36% with placebo ( p 324 Transitional treatment Transitional treatment is required in almost all CH patients in addition to the acute treatment of attacks in order to shorten or interrupt the active cluster episodes as soon as possible and to ameliorate the pain until preventive treatments start to work [ 325 Corticosteroids Approximately one third of patients receive corticosteroids for the abortion of the cluster episode. Some small open studies reported a negative outcome [ 270 326 327 283 328 331 283 p 331 329 330 Occipital nerve block Efficacy and safety of greater occipital nerve blocks (GONB) was documented by several randomized controlled trials [ 332 334 332 333 p p 334 Ergotamine Subcutaneous or intramuscular DHE is used 2 or 3 times a day for a week and may be continued once or twice a day for another week if tolerated. Contraindications are vasoconstriction-related side-effects, and its availability is limited in some countries. Methysergide is probably effective, even though there are no controlled trials available. Concerns with concomitant triptan use as well as potential fibrotic complications over longer treatment periods limits its use [ 335 336 337 Triptans Sometimes long-acting triptans are used as short-term prophylactic therapy before verapamil or lithium start to work even though RCTs are still missing. Frovatriptan 2.5 mg was tested in nine subjects with episodic CH with 8 of them reporting complete pain relief at 48 h. Patients received frovatriptan for up to three weeks once or twice daily until their verapamil dosage was considered sufficient [ 338 339 340 341 Current preventive treatments of CH Traditional preventive treatment of CH mostly includes several non-specific pharmacological agents with limited evidence (Table 2 342 343 289  Table 2 Non-specific therapies for cluster headache Medication Mechanism of Action Dose Evidence Adverse Events/Monitoring Comments Verapamil Calcium channel blocker; inhibits cortical spreading depression and vascular reactivity 240–960 mg/day (divided doses) Gold standard Bradycardia, hypotension, constipation, ECG monitoring (AV block, QT prolongation) High doses often required; regular ECGs essential Lithium Modulates neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine); affects second messenger systems 600–1500 mg/day (target serum: 0.4–0.8 mmol/L) Good evidence, especially for chronic cluster Renal and thyroid function, lithium levels, tremor, nausea, polyuria Narrow therapeutic range; frequent monitoring needed Topiramate Blocks voltage-gated sodium channels; enhances GABA activity 50–200 mg/day Limited evidence, off-label use Cognitive dysfunction, nephrolithiasis, paresthesia, weight loss Off-label; reserved for refractory cases Melatonin Regulates circadian rhythms; antioxidant properties 9–12 mg at bedtime Moderate evidence, particularly for episodic cluster Drowsiness, vivid dreams, hormonal effects Useful for nocturnal attacks; well-tolerated The recommendation is supported by small RCTs and open label studies including a multi-center, randomized placebo-controlled, crossover study [ 344 345 346 The mechanism of action of lithium for the preventive treatment of CH is not fully elucidated; however, lithium is thought to act on several neurotransmitter systems and signal transduction pathways [ 347 342 348 349 350 352 342 Among newer treatments, monoclonal antibodies targeting the CGRP pathway have shown promise, though with subtype-specific limitations (Table 3 86 87 353 354 355 90 91  Table 3 CGRP targeted therapies for cluster headache Medication Mechanism of Action Dose Evidence Adverse Events/Monitoring Comments Galcanezumab Monoclonal antibody against CGRP ligand 300 mg monthly (higher than for migraine)  Positive evidence only for episodic cluster Injection site reactions, constipation Only approved therapy for episodic cluster headache Fremanezumab Monoclonal antibody against CGRP ligand No established dose for cluster Insufficient evidence Injection site reactions Not approved for cluster headache Erenumab Monoclonal antibody against CGRP receptor Not approved for cluster Negative trials Constipation, hypertension, injection site reactions No approval; trials failed to show efficacy Eptinezumab Monoclonal antibody against CGRP ligand 400 mg every 12 month Controversy results Nasopharyngitis, hypersensitivity reactions IV administration only; not approved for cluster e Rimegepant Oral CGRP receptor antagonist (Gepant) No approval for cluster No evidence Nausea, urinary tract infections Approved only for migraine (acute and prevention) Atogepant Oral CGRP receptor antagonist (Gepant) No approval for cluster No evidence Nausea, constipation, fatigue Approved only for migraine prevention Topiramate has shown some benefit in open-label studies and small trials, although its efficacy is inconsistent and limited by tolerability concerns [ 356 357 358 Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland, regulated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus, and is associated with shifts in circadian rhythms, and the sleep-wake cycle. The circannual urinary melatonin concentrations is lowered in individuals with episodic CH [ 359 342 360 Naratriptan, a long-acting oral triptan, has been used in selected cases with predictably nocturnal CH, administered in the evening to pre-empt nighttime attacks. While evidence is limited to case series and clinical experience, some reports suggest that naratriptan 2.5 mg given prophylactically may reduce the frequency or intensity of nocturnal attacks [ 361 362 363 OnabotulinumtoxinA has been evaluated in small case series using an adapted PREEMPT injection protocol, originally developed for chronic migraine or sphenopalatine injections. Although some patients with chronic CH have reported benefit, controlled trials are lacking, and its application remains experimental [ 364 366 In practice, combination therapy is frequently employed, particularly in chronic or refractory cases. Clinicians may combine verapamil with lithium, corticosteroids, or nerve blocks, often tailoring regimens to the patient’s comorbidities and response. While such multimodal strategies are considered clinically reasonable, controlled data on specific combinations are lacking. Finally, several experimental and lesser-studied therapies have been reported. Intranasal capsaicin and its synthetic analog civamide may reduce attack frequency via desensitization of trigeminal afferents [ 367 368 369 Alternative medical approaches on CH treatment Despite pharmacological advancements, many CH patients remain refractory to conventional treatments. As a result, there has been growing patient-driven interest in alternative medical approaches, including herbal therapies, dietary supplements, psychedelics and compounds such as sodium oxybate. We evaluate the current evidence and therapeutic potential of these alternative approaches in the management of CH (Table 4  Table 4 Alternative treatment options in cluster headache: an overview abbreviations: CH: cluster headache; IV: intravenous; IN: intranasal; GI: gastrointestinal; RCT: randomized controlled trial; mg: milligram; kg: kilogram; IU: international units; LSD: lysergic acid diethylamide Substance Administration and dosing Preventive or abortive CH subtype Level of evidence Summary of outcomes Herbal therapies  Kudzu Oral, tablets or decoction of dried root.

No serious adverse events reported  BOL-148 Oral, tablet, 3 mg every 5 days Preventive Mainly chronic Open label trial Non-hallucinogenic LSD analogue; reduces attack frequency and/or intensity in preliminary data. Well tolerated Herbal therapies Evidence for plant-based compounds in CH is observational, with cannabis and kudzu ( Pueraria lobata Kudzu root is traditionally used in Chinese medicine. In a survey of 235 CH patients, 16 self-administered kudzu. Among these, 69% reported reduced attack intensity and 56% a decrease in attack frequency [ 370 Cannabis use is more prevalent among CH patients compared to the general population [ 371 372 373 375 373 374 375 371 Dietary supplementals Evidence for dietary supplements in CH management remains limited compared to more established data in migraine prophylaxis. Some studies have explored potential roles for vitamin D and magnesium. Vitamin D deficiency is notably prevalent in CH patients [ 376 377 378 Intravenous magnesium sulphate provided relief in 41% of 22 patients, primarily those with low baseline ionized magnesium levels [ 379 Ketamine’ Sodium oxybate The sodium salt of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) exhibits GABAergic activity and is primarily used in narcolepsy. Its sleep-modulating effects have prompted exploration in CH [ 236 380 381 236 380 381 NCT06950281 Psychedelic compounds Psychedelic compounds are potent neuroactive substances that influence perception, mood, and cognition [ 382 Classic psychedelics Anecdotal reports and patient advocacy groups have long suggested that psychedelics may abort CH attacks, prolong remission periods, and reduce attack frequency [ 383 303 371 375 383 385 303 Clinical trials are sparse, but the concept of ‘pulse dosing’ involving repeated low doses spaced over days, has been investigated for psilocybin. In one study of 14 CH patients, a low-dose psilocybin regimen of three doses five days apart led to non-significant attack frequency reduction compared to placebo (−3.2 vs. −0.03 attacks per week) [ 386 387 388 While no controlled LSD trials have been published, two randomized studies are currently ongoing, employing hallucinogenic and sub-hallucinogenic doses ( NCT03781128 NCT05477459 Other serotonergic psychedelics, such as Lysergic acid amide (LSA) and N, N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) are used by CH patients [ 375 389 Ketamine This NMDA receptor antagonist’ therapeutic potential has primarily been evaluated in case series among refractory chronic CH patients, with varying dosing regimens [ 390 393 Two series combining intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 2 h) with magnesium sulphate showed ≥ 50% attack frequency reduction in over 75% of patients, with remissions lasting up to several weeks​ [ 392 391 393 Intranasal ketamine (15 mg every 6 min, max. 75 mg) as acute treatment in chronic CH did not meet its primary endpoint of ≥ 390 Across these studies, ketamine was generally well-tolerated, with mild and transient side effects. To our knowledge, no controlled studies have been published. However, a placebo-controlled trial investigating ketamine and magnesium infusion in chronic CH is now recruiting ( NCT04814381 BOL-148 This non-hallucinogenic structural analogue of LSD, demonstrated efficacy in a small case series in five CH patients, four of whom chronic [ 394 Conclusion The accumulating evidence suggests that certain psychedelics, BOL-148, selected herbal and dietary supplements, melatonin and sodium oxybate, may offer a promising alternative or adjunctive treatment for CH. However, robust clinical validation is lacking and significant barriers, including regulatory challenges, persist. Future research should focus on clarifying the precise mechanisms of these compounds and developing safe, legally accessible treatment options for CH patients. Non-invasive neuromodulation in CH Neuromodulation has emerged as a promising alternative to pharmacological treatments in primary headache disorders with some applications also in CH. Invasive modalities are usually offered for medically refractory patients [ 395 396 397 Vagus nerve stimulation Stimulation of the cervical branches of the vagus nerve to modulate pain and other symptoms in CH has been attempted by using the gammaCore device. This is small, portable device containing two electrodes that transcutaneously stimulate the vagus nerve with a 1 ms burst of five kHz sine wave (24 V peak, 60 mA) stimulation repeated at 25 Hz for 90 s [ 398 399 400 An fMRI study that investigated the neuromodulatory role of vagus nerve stimulation to the trigeminal autonomic reflex, showed that t-VNS may modulate functional connections between important areas for head pain and CH namely the pons, the spinal trigeminal nuclei and the hypothalamus [ 135 The therapeutic effect of t-VNS in CH has been evaluated in two randomised-controlled trials, an open-label prospective study and real-world studies. Two randomized doubleblind shamcontrolled trials (ACT1 and ACT2 studies) were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of t-VNS using gammaCore device in CH [ 401 402 P 403 A company funded small retrospective audit conducted in three headache services in the United Kingdom (UK), found positive results in chronic CH patients treated with gammaCore. However, these patients were known responders to t-VNS. Furthermore, the GONB, which is the preventive treatment that has amongst the best evidence of efficacy and tolerability in episodic and chronic CH, was not tried before using t-VNS in this study [ 404 405 406 Other non-invasive stimulation techniques In small open label studies, also other non-invasive stimulation techniques have been applied. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been tested in an open-label observational study including 19 patients suffering from chronic CH. A beneficial outcome of repetitive (10 Hz) TMS over the M1 area was reported. Paroxysmal pain and number of attacks were reduced when comparing baseline with 15 days poststimulation measures [ 407 Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (anode at Fz, cathode over C7) for refractory chronic CH patients has only been studied in a proof-of-concept study [ 408 Thirty-six patients with chronic CH were treated by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) of the GON for 8–12 consecutive weeks [ 409 In conclusion, t-VNS is currently the only non-invasive neuromodulation therapy with some controlled evidence in CH. The available body of evidence suggests that t-VNS may be effective as an acute attack therapy in patients with episodic CH. However, it is unclear whether t-VNS would be effective in patients who fail to respond to both subcutaneous sumatriptan and oxygen inhalation, which are very effective and more cost-effective than gammaCore. Open-label evidence on prevention of chronic CH suggest that t-VNS might be beneficial in some patients, but not in those with refractory chronic CH, at least long-term. Further methodologically robust randomised controlled trials are warranted to clarify its role in the arsenal of treatments for CH. Invasive neuromodulation There are currently three invasive neurostimulation methods that have been tested in CH. T: posterior hypothalamic deep brain stimulation, occipital nerve stimulation and spheno-palatine ganglion stimulation. The evidence of efficacy is limited for the first two, moderate for spheno-palatine ganglion stimulation [ 342 Deep brain stimulation (DBS) Given its implication in autonomic function and chronobiology, as well as attack-related hypermetabolism demonstrated in the posterior hypothalamus ipsilaterally to the site of CH attacks, the hypothalamus emerged as a central target for potential neuromodulation in CH. Nearly 25 years ago, Leone et al. reported for the first time the effectiveness of posterior hypothalamic DBS used compassionately in a patient suffering from a very severe form of rCCH [ 410 411 412 413 414 415 415 170 168 416 Major complications have been reported in 17% of subjects, including one death of day 3 of surgery due to intracerebral hemorrhage [ 417 418 Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) The principle of ONS is to deliver continuous stimulation to the greater occipital nerve and/or to the lesser occipital nerve, via a subcutaneous implanted electrode adjacent to the nerve, producing paraesthesia that should cover the occipital region. Originally described by Weiner [ 419 420 412 421 422 423 424 425 426 ® Spheno-palatine ganglion stimulation Hypothalamic dysfunction is assumed in CH pathophysiology to cause secondary parasympathetic activation involving paraventricular nucleus, superior salivatory nucleus and sphenopalatine ganglion. Given its easy access in the pterygopalatine fossa, the SPG was considered a potential target for stimulation to induce an inhibition of postganglionic parasympathetic outflow and stop CH attacks. With this aim, a chronically implantable neuromodulation device (Pulsante ® p 138 300 427 ® 138 Nerve blocks Greater occipital nerve block (GONB) GONB is recommended for the preventive/transitional treatment of CH by the American Headache Society evidence-based guidelines (Level A: established as effective) as well as by the recently published European Academy of Neurology guidelines [ 342 428 429 430 431 432 433 434 GONB proved effective as a transitional treatment for CH in three RCTs [ 332 334 430 Ambrosini et al. [ 333 433 333 In the trial by Leroux et al. [ 332 434 434 332 More recently, the ANODYNE study was designed in accordance with the guidelines of the International Headache Society for controlled trials in CH [ 334 435 Few data are available regarding the duration of pain-freedom and the consistency of response across subsequent GONB [ 430 436 436 436 Regarding safety and tolerability, several evidence suggests that GONB is a safe, well-tolerated, and minimally invasive procedure. The reported adverse events were described as mild and transient, with injection site pain being the most prevalent one. Less frequent adverse events were local numbness, local bleeding, neck stiffness, dizziness, syncope, local alopecia [ 332 334 430 436 Besides GONB, oral prednisolone as a transitional treatment in episodic CH has been shown to be effective in an RCT [ 331 Sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGb) Sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGb) has been tested as acute and preventive treatment for cluster headache. Several technical procedures have been described, ranging from an easy-to-perform local intranasal application of anaesthetic to endoscopically guided drug injection in the pterygopalatine fossa [ 437 342 428 320 321 438 SPGb has been tested as a preventive treatment for CH as well. In the study by Felisati et al. [ 439 440 440 A novel approach is represented by injection of onabotulinumtoxinA toward the sphenopalatine ganglion [ 441 443 441 442 442 In the open-label series by Simmonds et al. 31 drug-resistant chronic CH subjects were treated with 25 IU of onabotulinumtoxinA towards the SPG according to the previously described procedure [ 443 n n Cluster headache prognosis Research on the prognosis of CH is limited compared to that on migraine and tension-type headache. Data on the natural history of CH, including information on morbidity and potential factors influencing the course and response to treatment, come primarily from retrospective or longitudinal studies. When addressing CH prognosis, different situations must be envisaged, including transition from episodic to chronic pattern, remission, variation in bouts frequency, change in bouts features and, as the worst scenario, patients’ suicide. Although evidence is scarce, it seems that the possibility of modification over time is related to the form of CH at onset. According to a pioneering Italian study of Manzoni, the vast majority of those who onset with an episodic form (i.e. 81%) will maintain an episodic pattern; the same figures for those with a chronic pattern is lower (i.e. 52%) but, notably, approximately 33% will revert to an episodic pattern [ 444 20 CH prognosis is uncertain, especially when considering chronic CH, for which therapeutic strategies are limited. Factors associated with chronicity in CH are like those observed in other primary headaches, including more frequent attacks and longer periods of remission, longer disease duration, overuse of analgesics, especially opioids, and mental illness [ 11 445 446 447 264 Remission rates have been occasionally investigated. As reported in some studies, the rates of remission seem to peak after 3–5 years (e.g. 18.5% after three years [ 444 448 10 448 449 444 450 450 Lee et al. analyzed the natural course of untreated CH in a group of 42 patients who were not observed for an average of 7.5 years [ 238 238 Last, suicide has historically been considered as common in patients with CH, to the point that CH has also been defined as “suicide headache”. This might be due to first descriptions of this condition but also to the relevant comorbidity with depression: in fact, patients with CH show an almost 3 times increased odds of lifetime depression compared to those without CH [ 249 37 451 452 In conclusion, knowledge of CH prognosis is scarce, probably because most of the research carried out so far has focused on understanding the mechanisms of CH and attempting to find new therapeutic strategies. CH, especially the chronic and treatment-resistant form, generally has an uncertain prognosis, but some kind of partial improvements have been observed: reversing to an episodic pattern in up to 33% of patients; remission in bouts duration in up to 23% of patients and increase in between-bouts interval time. Negative prognosis also exists. In fact, most patients will show a stable pattern, and the risk of suicide is to be seriously taken into consideration: in fact, suicidal ideation might involve up to 60% of patients, and suicidal attempts 2–7% of patients. Therefore, a lot of questions remain unanswered on CH disease course and prognosis, in particular the implications of changes in CH attacks’ frequency and severity as factors that might predict CH remission. Long-term cohort studies are needed which follow populations of different ages and with different disease courses, to better address prognosis of CH. Also, an effort to maintain patients in cohort studies for a long period of time is of importance, to avoid losing information on those patients who dropped out likely because they improved. Definition and management of refractory cluster headache (rCCH) rCCH refers to chronic CH that remains disabling and frequent despite adequate trials of evidence-based, standard recommendation at recommended dose and duration. The burden of refractory cases is markedly high, rCCH patients frequently experience significant impairments, including restrictions in daily functioning, sleep disruption, and comorbid depression [ 453 8 Similar to refractory migraine, refractory cluster headache is not formally defined in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) [ 1 Standard preventives like verapamil, lithium, and topiramate often failed, leading many patients to rely on off-label therapies [ 412 Consensus diagnostic criteria for rCCH Although the ICHD-3, does not formally recognize rCCH as a distinct diagnostic entity, it provides diagnostic criteria for chronic CH, which is defined by attacks fulfilling the criteria for cluster headache that occur for at least one year without remission, or with remissions lasting less than three months [ 1 454 In 2014, the consensus statement by the European Headache Federation provides the first formal clinical definition of rCCH, bring attention to a critical gap in the classification of patients with chronic CH who fail to respond to standard preventive therapies [ 455 5  Table 5 European headache federation (EHF) diagnostic criteria for rCCH A Headache attacks fulfilling the ICHD-3 beta criteria for chronic CH, or probable CH and B-E criteria.  B At least three severe CH attacks per week that impact patients’ quality of life despite preventive or symptomatic treatment  C Failed consecutive prophylactic treatment trials with at least three agents that showed efficacy over placebo in randomized controlled studies, used at the maximum tolerated dose over a sufficient period of time  D Symptomatic chronic CH is ruled out by negative investigation with brain MRI and MRA, eventually supplemented with carotid CT angiograms or triplex carotid ultrasound  E Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 beta diagnosis Management for rCCH Once a patient is diagnosed with rCCH—clinicians must consider alternative therapeutic options beyond standard pharmacological therapy [ 342 Warfarin showed good efficacy (number needed to treat of 2.6) in a randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled trial [ 456 386 387 362 457 458 460 461 462 463 412 The field of neuromodulation is emerging as a promising and alternative therapeutical option for rCCH, offering relief when other treatments have failed. Neuromodulation includes invasive and non-invasive techniques targeting either central or peripheral parts of the cephalic nervous system including autonomic circuits that are involved in CH, particularly abnormal activity in the posterior hypothalamus and trigeminal-autonomic pathways [ 412 412 464 412 Cluster headache in children and adolescents Epidemiology and clinical features The epidemiology of CH in children and adolescents is limited by the lack of large population studies. Changeableness of headache phenotypes across the developmental age and verbal limitations of children to describe subtle clinical features required for diagnosis represent other obstacles [ 465 466 467 In a nationwide sample of 5,671 children aged from 5 to 12 years old, the prevalence of children with headache attacks characterized by severe unilateral fronto-orbital pain, lasting from 15 to 180 min and not fulfilling criteria for migraine and/or tension-type headache, was 2.1%. Among them, there were no cases with parents reporting prominent cranial parasympathetic autonomic features accompanying the attacks [ 468 469 465 470 471 465 472 472 467 5 37 276 The study of headaches peculiarities at developmental age is a unique opportunity to deeper understand neurobiological, clinical, and evolutionary aspects of headache disorders with potentially impacts on therapeutic interventions. Due to its rarity in childhood, identifying peculiarities of CH is challenging. However, a number of peculiarities of CH in children has been reported in case series, systematic reviews and meta-analysis, including: (a) less numerous attacks during a given bout [ 467 473 474 467 473 474 474 475 467 1 470 466 474 476 478 467 472 Despite the overlapping characteristics of CH and migraine in children, as well as some similar features of CH and other trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, the idiosyncratic headache pattern of CH tends to emerge and helps the clinician in the correct diagnosis. However, secondary causes must be carefully ruled out by appropriate investigation, especially intracranial neoplasms (e.g., prolactinoma, hypothalamic pilocytic astrocytoma) and rhinosinusitis, in addition to other less reported causes as cerebrovascular diseases, head and neck trauma, optic neuritis, and Graves’ disease [ 470 Therapy As for other primary headaches, the therapy of CH in youth derives from what is currently used in adult CH patients. Usually, CH treatments are divided in three types (acute, preventive, and transitional) based on the intervention timing. Acute treatments Inhalation of 100% oxygen at a dose of 7–12 L/min for 15 to 30 min through a non-breathing mask, commonly considered as the most effective acute treatment, is particularly suitable for children and adolescents due to the lack of adverse effects [ 342 479 480 470 474 477 470 477 Preventive treatments Verapamil, topiramate, and melatonin may be useful for CH prevention in youth [ 18 470 470 478 470 477 478 481 483 Transitional treatment Transitional therapies are started along with preventive medications and should lead to a quick improvement, before the preventive drugs may become effective, which may take days or weeks [ 342 484 478 482 485 GONB has not been studied adequately in Young CH patients. Unilateral injection with 30 mg of 1% Lidocaine and 40 mg of methylprednisolone has been shown effective on both intensity and frequency of the attacks in 3 adolescents with CH [ 486 Other recommendations CH has been found associated to tobacco exposure also in paediatric patients [ 372 472 CH in pregnancy and lactation Compared to migraine, CH is a relatively uncommon condition primarily affecting males. Consequently, there is less knowledge regarding its epidemiology during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Bouts of CH are rare during pregnancy. This is attributable to various potential factors. In the reproductive years, specifically under the age of 50, the male-to-female ratio is 7.2:1 for episodic CH and 11:1 for chronic CH [ 487 29 488 489 488 489 37 Burish et al. [ 490 490 491 The data are inconclusive about whether CH improves throughout pregnancy or remains stable, and most research is constrained by restricted sample sizes and retrospective methodologies. A survey of 249 individuals with CH revealed that 34 were female, of whom only eight had experienced pregnancy since the onset of CH; six of these eight reported a remission of clusters during pregnancy [ 488 489 18 29 Certain therapeutic recommendations and clinical studies concentrate explicitly on TACs in the context of pregnancy and lactation [ 482 492 494 In the context of pregnancy and lactation, high-flow oxygen therapy at 100% administered using a non-rebreather mask, subcutaneous sumatriptan or nasal spray, and zolmitriptan nasal spray should be employed with caution and under medical supervision as the primary acute interventions [ 492 482 495 496 497 497 498 499 500 In summary, CH attacks during pregnancy are infrequent; however, when they manifest, they typically retain their original characteristics and severity. Although some women may observe a modification in the seasonal rhythm of their CH during pregnancy, many do not. Options for treating CH during pregnancy are restricted due to safety concerns associated with drugs, making management of these headaches difficult. The crossroad between CH and other primary headaches Primary headache disorders are characterized by the absence of underlying cranial or cerebral lesions that could explain the pain, distinguishing them from secondary headaches [ 501 Most disorders in the ‘other primary headaches’ category [ 502 503 Exertional headaches [ 502 504 In contrast to the abovementioned primary headaches, cluster headache shares similarities with TACs, particularly in their stereotyped lateralization, prominent cranial autonomic features, hypothalamic activation and neuroanatomical substrates, and in response to overlapping pharmacological treatments and/or neuromodulation. While the overlap with other TACs is common and significant, it will be addressed separately. In the next paragraphs we will focus on the clinical, pathophysiological, and therapeutic intersections between cluster headache and migraine, emphasizing points of convergence relevant to clinical practice. Epidemiology and clinical characteristics In early medical literature, both migraine and what is now recognized as CH were classified as ‘vascular headaches’, based on the belief that cerebral vasodilation was the primary driver of pain. CH was initially considered a migraine variant, with its severe, unilateral pain attributed to distension of cephalic vessels. This view began to change in 1939 when Horton and colleagues described the condition as ‘histaminic cephalalgia’, identifying its unique clinical profile. By 1952, Horton had further characterized its cyclical nature and response to vasodilators, laying the groundwork for CH to be recognized as a distinct syndrome [ 505 506 The differences between the two disorders are evident in their prevalence: migraine affects about 14% of the global population, while cluster headache is much rarer, affecting around 0.1%. Both typically start between the ages of 20 and 30, but the gender ratio differs: cluster headache is more common in men (4:1), while migraine is more common in women (1:3). Migraine and CH are polygenic and multifactorial, with both showing a positive family history. CH family history varies from 0 to 22%, while migraine familial risk is 35%−60% [ 507 50 508 509 510 The duration of attacks also differs, with migraine attacks lasting 4 to 72 h, while CH attacks last 15 to 180 min. Although pain is Often localized to the ophthalmic nerve territory in both conditions, in CH, the most intense pain is typically found in the orbital, supraorbital, or temporal regions, whereas migraine pain can occur anywhere on the head. Migraine is unilateral in approximately 55–67% [ 511 512 465 513 514 CAS are a hallmark of cluster headache but are also observed in migraine. At least one CAS has been reported in 26–74% of migraine patients, with an average of two symptoms per patient [ 515 516 517 465 515 516 515 465 518 465 Both migraine and CH are episodic disorders with pain-free intervals. However, CH derives its name from the typical ‘cluster periods’ or bouts, during which attacks occur daily for weeks or months, followed by a pain-free remission phase. In contrast, migraine attacks typically occur throughout the year without a clearly defined pattern of bouts. Timing also differs: CH attacks are most frequent between 2:00 and 4:00 AM and are more common from September to November [ 31 519 Both conditions have identifiable triggers. Common migraine triggers include stress, sleep disturbance, and emotional factors [ 520 31 The overlapping biology: current view of shared mechanisms GWAS for migraine identified 123 risk loci [ 71 15 71 15 15 71 The hypothalamus is a critical hub in the pathophysiology of both migraine and CH, with neuroimaging studies demonstrating both overlapping and distinct patterns of hypothalamic involvement in each disorder. In migraine, the hypothalamus shows sustained activation during both the prodromal and ictal phases, suggesting a role in initiating attacks and potentially mediating prodromal symptoms. Conversely, in CH, increased posterior hypothalamic activity is consistently observed during the ictal phase, with recent findings even indicating its activation during remission in response to trigeminonociceptive stimuli, implying a persistent state of sensitization. Both disorders exhibit anterior hypothalamic activation in chronic forms and involve abnormalities in multisensory processing regions, yet CH patients show unique bilateral hypothalamic enlargement and increased functional activity in cognitive brain networks compared to migraine [ 517 521 522 A supervised machine learning approach identified hypothalamus and PAG connectivity as key MRI patterns distinguishing migraine and CH from controls. The best marker differentiating the two disorders was reduced functional connectivity between the left thalamus and parietal regions (precuneus, angular gyrus) in CH, possibly reflecting altered processing of internal sensory signals linked to agitation and restlessness [ 521 The hypothalamus modulates trigeminal pain processing via functional connections with the TNC, PAG, and higher-order cortical regions, including the PFC and anterior cingulate cortex [ 522 523 Functionally, the hypothalamus is anatomically compartmentalized. The posterior hypothalamus, implicated in the modulation of descending pain pathways, maintains reciprocal connectivity with key trigeminal nociceptive regions [ 522 35 Sleep has a strong but complex association with the clinical features of CH and migraine, both showing a high prevalence of sleep disturbances. Hypothalamic circadian entrainment to light is mediated by PACAP-containing retinal ganglion cells projecting to the SCN, a pathway increasingly implicated in headache pathophysiology. Peripheral PACAP reliably triggers migraine and CH attacks, and anti-PACAP monoclonal antibodies are now in clinical trials as preventive therapies [ 98 524 Additionally, other common triggers like stress responses may also be mediated through hypothalamic mechanisms, as the anterior hypothalamus contains corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)–secreting neurons, central to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and stress regulation, including pain-related responses [ 522 Additionally, sexually dimorphic circuits within the hypothalamus influence reproductive behavior and energy regulation in a sex-specific manner [ 523 525 Other hormonal patterns differ between migraine and CH, like melatonin and cortisol. Recently, glial-derived neurosteroids have been shown to modulate neuronal excitability and influence the course of both disorders. These effects may be genetically driven or triggered by stressors, potentially explaining attack triggers and shared comorbidities [ 526 The cellular heterogeneity of the hypothalamus is notable. Peptidergic neurons vary by neurotransmitter expression: some neuropeptides, such as oxytocin, are predominantly found in glutamatergic neurons, while others like neuropeptide Y localize to GABAergic populations. Pain modulation and autonomic control are further shaped by serotonergic and melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) pathways. Glial cells (astrocytes, microglia, and ependymal cells) play active regulatory roles, contributing to circadian rhythm generation, neuroendocrine signalling, metabolic sensing, and social and reproductive behaviours [ 523 Beyond the hypothalamus, CH and migraine pathophysiology also involve the trigeminovascular system and the trigeminal-autonomic reflex. Activation of the trigeminovascular system leads to the release of neuropeptides like CGRP, substance P, and neurokinin A. This system engages parasympathetic pathways via the sphenopalatine ganglion, releasing vasoactive mediators such as NO, VIP, CGRP, and PACAP-38, which likely contribute to pain and autonomic symptoms in both migraine and CH, albeit with distinct expression patterns [ 527 528 527 529 85 530 97 85 97 517 Similarities and differences in treatment options Modulation of the serotonergic system has proven effective as an acute treatment strategy for both migraine and CH, primarily via triptans, which act as 5-HT₁B/1D receptor agonists. While oral triptans are commonly used for migraine, they are usually ineffective for cluster headache, which typically requires subcutaneous injection. Interestingly, while 100% oxygen inhalation remains a mainstay of CH attack management, emerging evidence suggests that up to 46% of migraine patients may also derive benefit. The proposed mechanism involves oxygen-induced hyperoxia, which may inhibit dural plasma protein extravasation and modulate neuropeptide release within the trigemino-autonomic reflex arc. This overlap suggests shared downstream pathways in both disorders, particularly involving the trigeminal-autonomic system [ 517 527 In contrast, prophylactic treatments show more condition-specific responses. Agents such as topiramate, valproic acid, and CGRP pathway inhibitors clearly demonstrate superior efficacy in migraine prevention. Conversely, verapamil, steroids and melatonin are more reliably effective in CH. Interventional therapies further highlight this divergence: GONB, SPG interventions, and ONS show benefit primarily in CH, transcranial magnetic and supraorbital stimulation in migraine, whereas noninvasive VNS appears to have therapeutic value in both conditions. These findings underscore both the overlapping and distinct neurobiological mechanisms underlying migraine and CH, with implications for individualized treatment strategies [ 517 527 100 The subtle overlapping of TACs and other orofacial pain conditions Despite being considered distinct disorders, emerging clinical and radiological evidence supports a broader nosographic concept of SUNCT, SUNA, and trigeminal neuralgia, involving common neurobiological mechanisms [ 531 532 534 535 536 537 538 531 In a large, published SUNA series, a high proportion of patients reported pain in V2 and V3, the most frequently affected divisions in trigeminal neuralgia, thus supporting the hypothesis of continuum with this facial pain condition [ 539 Trigeminal neuralgia is typically characterized by remission periods, lasting from weeks to years. Similarly, remission periods lasting for several months have been also described in SUNCT [ 540 Triggered paroxysmal pain in trigeminal neuralgia is usually followed by a refractory period. Refractory periods have rarely been reported in TACs. The lack of refractory periods in SUNCT and SUNA should be explained by a central disinhibition of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis [ 541 Trigeminal neuralgia is characterized by electric shock-like sensation lasting from fraction of second up to 2 min. The cutoff at 2 min has not been thoroughly validated but is based on patient reports. Patients may report multiple overlapping attacks that may feel as one longer attack; this phenomenon, however, seems to be an unlikely occurrence in the presence of a refractory period. It has been suggested that patients with paroxysmal attacks of long duration may form part of a spectrum with SUNCT and SUNA [ 541 Autonomic symptoms, key signs of SUNCT and SUNA, are reported from 31 to 67% of patients with a definite diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia [ 542 543 531 544 The partial overlap among these facial pain conditions is also supported by the evidence of patients with trigeminal neuralgia and concomitant continuous pain reporting a higher occurrence of CAS, less frequent cutaneous trigger, waking from sleep and poor response to both pharmacologic and surgical treatments [ 541 545 Nocturnal attacks are common in TACs and are considered not typical of trigeminal neuralgia. Pain-related awakening has been described in a significantly higher proportion of patients with trigeminal neuralgia with long attack duration than in those with short attacks [ 546 Although the majority of SUNCT forms are idiopathic, secondary forms related to posterior fossa abnormalities have been described [ 537 547 Partial overlaps are also recognized in the pharmacological and surgical treatment options of these forms of facial pain. Lamotrigine, the preventive treatment of SUNA/SUNCT, is recommended as second-line treatment in patients with trigeminal neuralgia, when carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine are ineffective or contraindicated [ 548 549 550 551 These observations, taken together, support the hypothesis of common underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. These facial pain conditions may represent a spectrum disorder, characterized by unilateral short-lasting neuralgiform attacks with different degree of cranial autonomic activation, reflecting the different degree of involvement of central and peripheral mechanisms, namely the posterior hypothalamic dysfunction and the trigeminal sensory root damage. The burdens attributable to CH Headache disability means limitations in daily life. This includes work, school, and social time. It is a major part of the total burden. Burden also includes cost, distress, and social impact. Global Burden of Disease studies use attack rate and severity to measure it. Migraine Disability Assessment Score Questionnaire (MIDAS) and Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) are tools commonly used in clinics to measure the disability caused by migraine. The burden of CH is difficult to measure [ 552 10 553 Quality of life (QoL) in CH is low. Studies used SF-36, SF-12, and EuroQoL-VAS—all general tools to assess QoL. CH patients reported worse QoL than healthy subjects and even migraine patients. Invasive treatments may reduce attacks but often do not improve QoL [ 553 557 10 558 559 Disability in CH is often underestimated. Studies using MIDAS and HIT-6 tools showed high scores on HIT-6 (Often over 60) and MIDAS (over 21). Even after major treatments like nerve blocks or brain stimulation, disability stays high. This shows that the real impact of CH is deeper than what current tools can capture [ 10 553 560 561 562 The socioeconomic burden of CH is heavy. Few studies cover this aspect, but findings are clear. Many patients lose workdays, miss chances for promotion, or leave jobs entirely. Daily life is limited, even outside attack periods. Some lose their jobs due to the headache impact [ 10 553 563 565 10 553 563 565 Suicide risk in CH is high. CH is often called the ‘suicide headache’ due to the extreme pain it causes, despite large studies on actual suicide rates in this group are still lacking [ 10 37 452 566 451 Advocacy in CH In contrast to other more common forms of headache, such as migraine, this condition, precisely because of its lower prevalence, is little known among laypeople and often among physicians too, leading to frustrating clinical and diagnostic experiences for patients [ 567 568 4  Fig. 4 Factors involved in advocacy for cluster headache patients As mentioned above, one of the major challenges of CH is its rarity, which results in limited knowledge and awareness of the disease [ 569 568 570 570 The highly disabling nature of CH attacks is another critical aspect that requires advocacy [ 571 569 572 573 574 575 576 577 Although the stigma associated with headache has been extensively studied in migraine [ 578 579 557 580 557 579 567 581 570 582 In terms of access to care, patients with CH often face challenges due to a lack of specialists with experience in managing this rare condition [ 570 583 584 567 580 585 570 586 580 Although research on CH is progressing, more scientific effort and more financial support are needed to fully understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease, identify new therapeutic targets, and develop more effective and targeted treatments [ 11 587 575 570 584 11 372 375 588 Patient empowerment is a central element of advocacy in CH: providing patients with accurate and understandable information about their condition, available treatment options, and their rights can help them to become active participants in treatment decisions and advocates for themselves [ 570 570 572 Finally, there are new challenges on the horizon that should be considered when advocating for patients with CH. Given the increasing pathophysiological knowledge of the disease and the growing possibility of monitoring and modulating brain activity [ 589 590 591 585 592 In conclusion, advocacy in CH is an ethical obligation and a practical necessity. The objectives of addressing the unmet needs of patients, combating stigma, improving access to care, and promoting research are attainable goals that can be achieved through the collaborative efforts of patients, family members, physicians, researchers, associations, and policymakers. By following the advocacy models developed for migraine and adapting them to the specificities of CH, it is possible to bring about change and significantly improve the lives of those living with this painful and disabling condition [ 575 584 593 Conclusions CH is characterized by several key clinical factors, including the severe unilateral pain associated with autonomic symptoms and notable agitation, the higher prevalence in males, and specific circadian and circannual patterns of recurrence. Despite the extensive previous efforts, our therapeutic arsenal remains constrained to medications targeting non-specific pathways. This is attributable to both the rarity of the disease and the stagnation in pathophysiological knowledge. Indeed, the pathophysiological evidence for CH closely mirrors that of migraine, including significant involvement of the trigeminal-autonomic system and hypothalamic activation. In particular, hypothalamic dysfunction, likely in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, seems to play a major role in determining the circadian recurrence of attacks, influencing the temporal aspects of the attacks. Several other cerebral regions, including the brainstem and mesocorticolimbic networks, play an additional role, particularly in cases of chronic CH. Nonetheless, when these neurolimbic structures are suppressed using invasive techniques like DBS, the positive effects do not manifest instantaneously, but rather with a delay of several months, suggesting that they are not the locus of the primary dysfunction. Several molecules with a pivotal role in migraine pathophysiology, including CGRP, PACAP, VIP, and nitric oxide, seem to influence the modulation of pain and autonomic symptoms also in CH. However, the evidence that their plasma levels do not correlate with attack frequency and the discouraging outcomes obtained with the administration of CGRP-blocking antibodies suggest that some crucial biological differences exist between these two primary headache disorders. While CH and other primary headaches, especially migraine, exhibit shared genetic and pathophysiological pathways, they possess distinct clinical features and treatment responses, which makes it impossible to consider them as a continuum. Consequently, we should change our perspective by refraining from directly translating the insights gained from the research of other main types of primary headaches into CH pathophysiology. Additional research is required to ascertain not only which brain structure(s) initiates the attack, but also which one(s) is in charge of stopping it, and what the relationships are with the hypothalamic master clock and the subordinate clocks distributed throughout the human body. Then, further efforts should be made by all the researchers worldwide, focusing also on the distinct nature of pain associated with a CH attack compared to other primary headaches. This includes understanding the pathophysiological reasons for its severity, as well as its strict lateralisation, the biology under the higher male prevalence, or the loss of certain clinical and pathophysiological characteristics when CH becomes chronic. Comprehending these pathophysiological elements may facilitate the identification of novel molecular and structural targets, which may fuel the development of drugs that operate more rapidly and effectively. In conclusion, CH is characterised by a complex, multifactorial, and yet inadequately understood pathophysiology. Precise diagnosis, additional research studies, and robust psychosocial and institutional support are necessary to improve the quality of life for individuals affected by this debilitating condition.
