Introduction Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and a leading cause of death worldwide [ 1 2 3 5 6 8 9 10 11 In this study, we analyzed mutations and dysregulation of circadian rhythm genes in breast cancer samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, identifying three circadian rhythm–related subtypes in breast cancer. Furthermore, we developed a circadian rhythm gene‐based scoring system to predict breast cancer prognosis. Subsequently, by integrating genetic signatures and clinicopathological characteristics, we established a risk model with high prognostic accuracy and predictive capability, which demonstrated superior prognostic accuracy compared to traditional breast cancer staging systems. Overall, our results further elucidate the critical role of circadian rhythm genes in personalized treatment and prognostic evaluation in patients with breast cancer. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Data Collection and Preprocessing The gene expression profiles of BRCA tissues from four publicly available datasets ( GSE42568 GSE61304 GSE2034 GSE21653 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ https://xenabrowser.net 2.2. Unsupervised Clustering Analysis of Circadian Rhythm–Related Genes Prognosis‐related CRGs were filtered out using univariate Cox regression analysis with the R packages “survival” and “survminer.” Breast cancer patients were divided into three CRG clusters based on the prognosis‐related CRGs by consensus unsupervised clustering analysis with the R package “Consensus ClusterPlus.” The univariate Cox regression analysis was performed to identify the prognosis‐related differential expression genes (DEGs). Based on the prognosis‐related DEGs, breast cancer patients were divided into three gene subtypes by consensus unsupervised clustering analysis. The criteria were as follows: (1) balanced sample distribution across groups, (2) smooth incremental progression of cumulative distribution function (CDF) curves with plateau stability, and (3) intracluster linkage strength > 0.9 while intercluster linkage strength < 0.1. 2.3. Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes All raw data were normalized and standardized by using the R software package. Gene differential expression analysis was conducted through the “limma” packages in the Bioconductor package (available online: http://www.bioconductor.org/ q 2.4. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis The R package “GSVA” was used to perform single‐sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), which was used to explore the enrichment of tumor‐related pathways and immune cell infiltration in the TCGA database. Tumor‐related datasets were obtained from hallmark gene sets in the MSigDB database. The characteristic gene set containing 28 immune cell types was downloaded from a recent publication. 2.5. Establishment and Validation of a Breast Cancer Prognostic Predictive Signature Univariate Cox regression analysis was conducted to identify recurrence‐free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS)–related cancer hallmarks. 2.6. Construction of a Nomogram for Breast Cancer Prognosis Prediction To select circadian rhythm–related genes associated with prognosis, LASSO‐penalized Cox regression analysis was applied. The LASSO Cox regression model was employed to identify circadian rhythm highly correlated genes and to construct the prognostic CGS. For each patient, the coefficients of logistic regression were used to calculate the CGS score via the following formula: CGS score = ∑(coefficient × mRNA expression). Circadian rhythm score and relevant clinical parameters were used to construct a nomogram, using the survival and the “rms” package in R. The nomogram was constructed to estimate 1‐, 3‐, and 5‐year survival probabilities. The calibration curve and C index were used to evaluate the performance of the model. 2.7. Stromal and Immune Cell Infiltration We used xCell to estimate the cellular composition of stromal cells and immune cells in tumor samples from the TCGA dataset. Immune and stromal cell scores for each sample were calculated. The CIBERSORTx online website was used to evaluate the infiltration of 22 immune cells in each sample. The absolute abundance of eight immune cell populations of tissue‐infiltrating immune cells was calculated by the R package “MCPcount.” 2.8. Drug Sensitivity Analysis The GSCALite database was used for drug sensitivity analysis. The relationship between the expression levels of 12 target genes and drug sensitivity was calculated by Spearman correlation analysis. 2.9. Additional Bioinformatic and Statistical Analysis Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to visualize the differences between different groups. The “GSVA” and “GSEA” packages were used to analyze pathway enrichment between the three subtypes. The “pRophetic” package was used to predict half‐maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 12 p 2.10. SKBR3 Cell Culture and Treatment The human SKBR3 breast cancer cell line, used for in vitro experiments, was purchased from Wuhan Pricella Biotechnology. Cells were cultured and maintained in complete medium containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), high glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin. The SKBR3 cells were incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 ′ ′ 9 μ 2.11. Quantitative Real‐Time Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR (RT‐qPCR) Total RNA was extracted from breast cancer cells (SKBR3) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States). Total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using an RT reagent kit (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China). The RT‐qPCR was performed using a SYBR Green assay (Vazyme Biotech, Nanjing, China) on a StepOnePlus real‐time PCR instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., United States). The mRNA expression level of BMAL1, NCOA2, NOS2, NR1H3, SIAH2, and ADRB1 was normalized with ACTB, and the data were calculated through the 2 −ΔΔCt 1 Table 1 Table of primer sequences.

Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using R software. For forest plots, the hazard ratio (HR) was generated by univariate Cox or multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression, and the Kaplan–Meier approach was used for survival analyses.

Circadian Rhythm–Related Gene‐Based Subtypes Exhibit Distinct Immune Characteristics Given that immune cell infiltration is a critical factor influencing tumor progression and response to immunotherapy, we assessed the differences in tumor microenvironment (TME) immune cell infiltration between the subtypes. We found that patients in Cluster 1 had significantly lower immune scores compared to the other subtypes but exhibited the highest tumor cell purity, while Cluster 3 showed the highest stromal scores (Figure 4a 4b Figure 4 Immune characteristics of different circadian rhythm pattern subgroups.

Circadian Rhythm–Related Gene Signatures as Predictive Tools for Breast Cancer Prognosis To evaluate the predictive value of circadian rhythm–related genes for breast cancer prognosis, we analyzed the correlation between gene expression and patient OS. The results indicated that high expression levels of OPN4, NOS2, GPR157, NCOA2, CLOCK, and TH were associated with shorter OS in breast cancer patients, while high expression of EGR3, NR1H3, RELB, SIAH2, and ADRB1 was linked to improved survival rates (Figure 6 Figure 6 The correlation between circadian rhythm–related gene expression and overall survival time in BRCA was analyzed, including ADRB1, CLOCK, EGR3, GPR157, NCOA2, NOS2, NR1H3, OPN4, RELB, SIAH2, and TH.

Discussion In summary, based on the expression levels of 200 circadian rhythm–related genes, we identified three circadian rhythm–associated breast cancer subtypes, which exhibited significant differences in prognosis, clinical characteristics, and molecular features. Among these, Cluster 1 demonstrated the lowest survival rates, suggesting that this subtype may represent a subgroup with a poorer prognosis. Conversely, Cluster 3 consistently showed the highest survival rates, indicating that these patients may have more favorable clinical outcomes in the real world. However, the results differed in the GSE42568 GSE42568 Gene mutation signature analysis revealed that missense mutations were the most predominant type across all categories. PIK3CA emerged as the primary driver gene in Clusters 1 and 3, with mutations leading to an abnormal activation of the PI3K pathway, thereby promoting cell proliferation [ 13 14 Clinical feature analysis demonstrated that Cluster 1 was significantly associated with Luminal A and Luminal B subtypes, primarily observed in hormone receptor–positive (ER+ and PR+) patients, which typically indicate a more favorable prognosis [ 15 16 17 The inconsistency between these distribution patterns and the prognostic analysis results may stem from dataset heterogeneity or differences in treatment responses. For instance, the high sensitivity of Cluster 1 to endocrine therapy may be the key reason for improved prognosis, while the aggressive features of Cluster 2 might have been partially mitigated by targeted therapies. Therefore, future studies should focus on integrating the diversity of different datasets and individualized treatment regimens to achieve more accurate prediction of patient prognosis and provide more effective guidance for precision therapy. Differential gene analysis revealed that Cluster 2 exhibited the most significant differences compared to other subtypes, reflecting its unique molecular characteristics. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that Cluster 1 was significantly enriched in estrogen signaling and steroid metabolism–related pathways, consistent with its hormone‐dependent nature. Cluster 2 showed significant enrichment in cell cycle and inflammation‐related pathways, supporting its highly proliferative and invasive biological behavior. Cluster 3 was notably enriched in metabolic pathways (e.g., fatty acid degradation and lipolysis regulation) and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, indicating metabolism as its key feature. These findings provide direction for subsequent experimental validation and target exploration. Analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment revealed that Cluster 1 had the lowest TMB, indicating a lower genomic mutation load and weaker tumor immunogenicity [ 18 19 20 Cluster 2 exhibited the highest TMB and abundant immune cell infiltration, but severe immune cell exhaustion and significantly elevated immune checkpoint molecule expression, suggesting comprehensive activation of immune evasion mechanisms. Cluster 3 showed rich stromal components, the highest immune exclusion score, and the highest TIDE score, indicating potential strong resistance to immunotherapy [ 21 Drug sensitivity analysis indicated that Cluster 1 was most sensitive to traditional chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., docetaxel, paclitaxel, epirubicin, and gemcitabine) and hormonal therapies (e.g., tamoxifen and fulvestrant), consistent with luminal subtype characteristics. Cluster 2 showed the highest sensitivity to targeted therapies (e.g., ipatasertib and ribociclib), suggesting that the PI3K/AKT and CDK4/6 pathways may be potential therapeutic targets. Cluster 3 exhibited the lowest sensitivity to traditional chemotherapy, targeted drugs, and hormonal therapies. High expressions of NR1H3, NCOA2, and REL were significantly associated with resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, while CLOCK and SIAH2 expression positively correlated with drug sensitivity, indicating these genes as potential targets for overcoming drug resistance. To quantify the expression levels of circadian rhythm–related genes in individual tumors, we developed a risk model based on circadian rhythm–related gene scoring, successfully stratifying patients into high‐risk and low‐risk groups. Subsequently, the model predicted significantly shorter survival times for high‐risk patients. To further enhance prediction accuracy, we constructed a nomogram by integrating the risk score with clinicopathological characteristics (age, stage, and subtype). This nomogram demonstrated excellent performance in predicting 1‐year, 5‐year, and 10‐year RFS (AUC values of 0.825, 0.784, and 0.751, respectively). In addition, the nomogram outperformed individual staging and risk score models at all time points, particularly for short‐term prediction (500 days, AUC > 0.85). Although similar studies have been conducted using circadian genes, immune‐related genes, and glycosyltransferases to construct molecular subtypes and risk models [ 22 25 Some limitations should be acknowledged in the present study. First of all, the predictive reliability and clinical application of the circadian risk signature need further validation in prospective clinical trials. Second, the predictive roles of circadian rhythm–related genes determined in our study need to be verified in larger clinical samples. 5. Conclusion This study highlights the significant role of circadian rhythm–related molecular subtypes in breast cancer prognosis, immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity and successfully establishes a prognostic model based on circadian rhythm genes. In addition, these findings provide potential therapeutic targets for the precise classification and personalized treatment of breast cancer. Future research should further integrate multiomics data and clinical treatment information to optimize model performance for real‐world application in clinical practice.
