Case presentation A 22-year-old woman contacted the endocrinology department of another university hospital complaining of amenorrhea, fatigue, and loss of appetite for the last year. In her medical history, she had no known history of disease or drug use. She was a nonsmoker and did not drink alcohol. In her family history, she had an aunt and a cousin who had lung cancer and an uncle who had breast cancer. There were no psychiatric illnesses in the family. The patient's cortisol axis was examined due to amenorrhea; the cortisol level was not suppressed by the dynamic tests. No pathology was detected in the blood count, glucose, kidney, and liver function tests. There was no electrolyte imbalance. Thoracic-abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed no abnormality. Gallium-68 scintigraphy was within normal limits. The patient was referred to our tertiary pituitary center for sampling of the inferior petrosal sinus. The patient reported that she had lost 40 kg in one year. The physical examination revealed a body mass index (BMI) of 12.4 kg/m 2 1 1 1 Figure 1 Patient's image taken in August 2022 Table 1 Laboratory values at admission and at six-month follow-up *Measured using the insulin tolerance test **From 24-hour urine 5-HIAA 5-HIAA: 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid, DST: dexamethasone suppression test, ACTH: adrenocorticotropic hormone, FSH: follicle-stimulating hormone, LH: luteinizing hormone, DHEA-SO4: dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, TSH: thyroid-stimulating hormone, fT3: free triiodothyronine, fT4: free thyroxine, IgA: immunoglobulin A, IgG: immunoglobulin G, HOMA-IR: Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, DXA: dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry Parameters At admission At 6-month follow-up Reference range Cortisol (µg/dL) 26 12 10-20 ACTH (pg/mL) 28 14 10-20 DST 1 mg (µg/dL) 20 0.5 <1.8 DST 2 mg (µg/dL) 18 - <1.8 24-hour urine cortisol 2 times Within the normal range 30-160 Nighttime salivary cortisol 1.5 times Within the normal range 0.5-2 DST 8 mg (µg/dL) 15 - 50% suppression compared to baseline cortisol Estradiol (pg/mL) 6 17 30-200 FSH (mIU/mL) 0.7 7 5-20 LH (mIU/mL) 0.3 4 5-20 17-OH progesterone (ng/mL) 1.3 - <2 DHEA-SO4 (ng/mL) 135 - 65-368 Total testosterone (ng/dL) 37 - 6-82 TSH (mIU/L) 0.8 1.3 0.27-4.2 fT4 (ng/dL) 0.8 1.1 0.93-1.7 fT3 (ng/L) 0.9 - 2-4.4 Somatomedin C (mg/L) 39 - 107-367 Growth hormone (ug/L) 6.4 - 0.1-9.8 Growth hormone (mg/L)* 7.2, 7.8, 9.9 - 3 Prolactin (ng/mL) 12 - 10-25 5-HIAA (mg/day)** 4.9 - 2-9 Calcitonin (pg/dL) 1.2 - <10 Anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA (U/mL) 0.08 - <12 Anti-tissue transglutaminase IgG (A/mL) 0.25 - <12 HOMA-IR 1.4 - <2.5 DXA (Z scores)    Femoral neck 0.4 - >-2 Total lumbar 0.3 - >-2 The nutritional profile was drawn up by a dietitian. During the follow-up of the patient, it was observed that she refused to eat and secretly threw away food. A psychiatrist was called in; the patient and her father were interviewed. She confessed that she had been told by her friends that she had put on weight, and as a result, she stopped eating on her own initiative. On questioning the patient, it emerged that she had good relationships with family and friends and had no history of trauma. During her psychiatric examination, she stated that she was obsessed with her body image, was afraid of gaining weight, and only ate lunch once a day. The patient was diagnosed with AN, and psychotherapy was started. The diet was started with 20 kcal/kg/day in the form of three main meals and three snacks, and the amount of calories were increased every day. Regular weight monitoring was carried out. During the three-week follow-up period in the hospital, the patient gained 2 kg. At the six-month follow-up, she reported eating three meals a day and not feeling tired, and the physical examination revealed that she had gained 19 kg (Figure 2 2 1 Figure 2 Patient's image taken in February 2023 Discussion In our case, we present hypercortisolemia that developed in a patient diagnosed with AN. Cortisol levels improved with the elimination of the underlying cause. High nocturnal cortisol exposure in patients with CS increases the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [ 9 9 10 11 12 9 9 Clinical and biochemical overlaps in PCS can complicate the differential diagnosis. In our case, the result of 2 mg DST did not lead to cortisol suppression, but the typical stigmata of CS were also absent. In a study of CS, AN, and healthy individuals, corticosteroid receptors on leukocytes were lower in patients with CS and AN than in healthy individuals [ 13 14 11 15 Apart from amenorrhea, our patient did not exhibit any features of CS. The study by Invitti et al. found that the receptor affinity of glucocorticoids decreased in AN patients compared to control subjects, and the metabolic substrates of glucocorticoids were reduced [ 16 In patients with AN, we can find functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA) associated with hypoleptinemia and underlying mental illness [ 17 17 18 Patients with AN exhibit GH resistance, i.e., they have high GH and low IGF-1 levels. This is associated with downregulation of GH receptor expression and low levels of GH-binding proteins [ 19 20 20 19 21 Conclusions Hypercortisolism results from conditions that can chronically activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and occurs in many conditions, including psychiatric disorders such as AN. Our case presents a rare example of hypercortisolism with AN with a possible diagnosis of PCS. In patients with AN, CS should be suspected if typical symptoms and signs of CS are present. In PCS due to AN, the clinical and laboratory features are expected to improve with the necessary weight gain. Distinguishing between PCS and CS protects patients from unnecessary investigations and harmful treatments.
