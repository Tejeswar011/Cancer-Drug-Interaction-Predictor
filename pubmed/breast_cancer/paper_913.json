Clinically categorized into nodal and extranodal subtypes, the disease primarily involves systemic lymph nodes with possible involvement of other organs. This variability in organ involvement leads to diverse clinical manifestations and nonspecific imaging findings, contributing to frequent diagnostic challenges and misdiagnosis. Histopathologically, the characteristic cells demonstrate S100+, CD68+, and CD1a‐negative immunophenotype. We present a rare geriatric case of RDD, which may enhance diagnostic awareness and clinical management of this condition.

Management typically involves watchful waiting; surgical or pharmacological intervention may be considered for symptomatic organ involvement. 1 Introduction Rosai–Dorfman disease (RDD) is a rare histiocytic disorder. It was first described by Destombes in 1965, who reported four pediatric and young adult cases presenting with lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 Case History and Examination A 71‐year‐old male patient was admitted for evaluation of systemic lymphadenopathy detected on CT imaging 20 days prior. The patient initially presented to a local hospital with cough and productive sputum. PET/CT revealed the following findings: Multiple FDG‐avid lymph nodes in the mediastinum, bilateral supraclavicular regions, bilateral pulmonary hila, and retroperitoneum, demonstrating partial fusion with maximum dimensions of 2.7 × 3.6 cm. These findings suggest a high suspicion of lymphoma (Figures 1 2 Chronic bronchitis with emphysematous changes; multiple small patchy and band‐like high‐density pulmonary opacities consistent with inflammatory changes; right maxillary sinusitis. Bilateral pleural thickening with minimal effusion; aortic wall calcification. Hepatic steatosis; cholelithiasis with associated cholecystitis. Degenerative spinal changes. FIGURE 1 Fluorine 18‐fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) image. FIGURE 2 Largest mediastinal lymph node by diameter on PET/CT. The patient remained afebrile throughout the clinical course. Ultrasound‐guided core needle biopsy of the left supraclavicular lymph nodes demonstrated histopathological features of reactive hyperplasia, rendering definitive diagnosis inconclusive. Subsequent CT confirmed persistent mediastinal lymphadenopathy, particularly in stations 5 and 6 lymph nodes, which required further diagnostic evaluation. Medical history included well‐controlled hypertension (3‐year duration) and insulin‐dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus (20‐year duration). The patient reported permanent local residency without occupational or environmental exposure to chemical/radioactive/toxic substances and denied family history of similar conditions. 3 Treatment and Pathological Analysis 3.1 Operative Findings The patient was positioned in right lateral decubitus with thoracic access via the fifth intercostal space along the left midaxillary line. Intraoperative exploration identified a 4 × 5 cm hypervascular lymph node conglomerate at the aortic arch's inferior margin, demonstrating firm consistency and intimate association with the phrenic nerve. Given the neurovascular entanglement, complete resection was contraindicated. Representative nodal specimens were obtained for histopathological evaluation. 3.2 Pathological Analysis Gross examination of station 5/6 lymph nodes revealed: Capsular fibrosis with stromal hyalinization, Follicular atrophy accompanied by interfollicular plasmacytosis, and Marked sinusoidal ectasia containing numerous histiocytes. Microscopic features: Sinusoidal histiocytic proliferation with emperipolesis (lymphocytophagocytosis) (Figures 3 4 FIGURE 3 (H&E) 40× Low‐power histological examination of nodal involvement in Rosai–Dorfman disease demonstrates alternating pale and hypercellular zones. The hypercellular regions contain a mixed inflammatory infiltrate composed of small lymphocytes and plasma cells. The pale‐staining areas are dominated by characteristic RDD histiocytes with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. FIGURE 4 (H&E) 200× Histopathological evaluation of nodal Rosai–Dorfman disease demonstrates characteristic histiocytes with voluminous pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, accompanied by a mixed inflammatory infiltrate comprising small lymphocytes and plasma cells. 3.3 Diagnostic Conclusion The histomorphological features combined with S100+/CD68+/CD163+ immunophenotype confirm nodal RDD (Table 1 5 TABLE 1 Immunohistochemical profile.

Lack of staining of inflammatory cells in the cytoplasm of tissue cells. 4 Conclusion RDD is a rare histiocytic disorder characterized by systemic lymphadenopathy with frequent extranodal manifestations, resulting in clinical and radiological heterogeneity that often leads to misdiagnosis. Definitive diagnosis requires histopathological identification of a characteristic S100+/CD68+/CD1a− immunophenotypic profile in lesional histiocytes. This case represents an exceptionally rare geriatric presentation of RDD with predominant intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, requiring differentiation from lymphoproliferative malignancies. Notably, the hypervascular nature of these lesions poses significant intraoperative bleeding risks, often precluding complete surgical resection. 5 Discuss RDD, with an estimated prevalence of 1:200,000, predominantly affects young individuals with a male predilection. While the pathogenesis remains elusive, emerging evidence suggests potential associations with viral infections including herpesviruses, cytomegalovirus, and HIV [ 9 10 Although RDD is generally regarded as a self‐limited disorder, approximately 20%–50% of patients experience spontaneous regression over time [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 15 17 18 This rare geriatric presentation of RDD offers several critical teaching points. First, the extensive FDG‐avid lymphadenopathy involving supraclavicular, mediastinal, hilar, retroperitoneal, and notably rare peritoneal regions created a striking radiologic mimic of lymphoma, underscoring the diagnostic imperative for histopathologic confirmation even in atypical demographics. Second, the absence of typical febrile symptoms (seen in 70%–80% of cases) and the intraoperative finding of hypervascular, conglomerated nodes highlight the clinical heterogeneity of RDD presentations. Management Rationale and Follow‐up Strategy: Given the patient's asymptomatic status despite extensive nodal disease and the known potential for spontaneous regression (20%–50% of cases), we implemented a strict observational strategy. This approach avoids unnecessary interventions in an elderly patient, prioritizing serial clinical and radiologic monitoring. Specifically: Quarterly clinical assessments focus on symptom development (fever, weight loss, organ compression) and physical examination of nodal basins. Semi‐annual FDG‐PET/CT will assess metabolic evolution. Significant SUV increases or new symptomatic lesions would trigger multidisciplinary review for potential surgical debulking (if localized and compressive) or consideration of systemic therapy (if multifactorial progression). FDG‐PET serves as our tool for both differential diagnosis and treatment response assessment, aligning with emerging evidence of its utility in RDD monitoring [ 19 20 Conclusion: This case reinforces RDD's diagnostic complexity and the importance of conservative management in asymptomatic disease. Vigilant clinical and PET/CT‐based surveillance allows timely intervention only if progression occurs, optimizing outcomes while minimizing treatment‐related morbidity.
