Surgical tumor resection, standard-of-care for glioblastoma, not only results in the reduction of tumor burden, but also has profound immunostimulatory effects, offering a unique opportunity to break local immune tolerance and mount an effective anti-tumor immune response. Here, we explore the effect of local controlled release of resiquimod, a TLR7/8 agonist, from a biodegradable polymer scaffold implanted at the time of tumor resection. We find that treatment leads to the clearance of residual post-resection tumor, improved survival, and subsequent protection from tumor challenges in orthotopic mouse models of glioma. In addition, the controlled release of resiquimod from the scaffold boosts the resection-mediated disruption to the tumor microenvironment, leading to an early inflammatory innate immune response both in the brain and cervical lymph node, followed by an influx of lymphocytes. Thus, we show that sustained local TLR7/8 agonism at the time of tumor resection represents a promising approach for the treatment of glioblastoma. Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive tumor characterized by an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here, the authors present a therapeutic approach based on the implantation of a biodegradable scaffold for the sustained, local release of a TLR7/8 agonist at the time of tumor resection, to achieve anti-tumor immunity and protection from future tumor challenge.

Even with standard-of-care therapy including surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy, local tumor recurrence and mortality is almost 100% 1 3 4 6 7 8 9 Immunotherapies are a promising alternative to cytotoxic chemotherapies, and their success against other malignancies has sparked exploration for GBM. Unfortunately, GBM immunotherapy faces a steep uphill battle 10 16 17 18 19 20 21 23 One strategy for combatting the immunosuppressive TME has been to target microglia and macrophages, which are major mediators of anti-inflammatory signaling in GBM 24 25 24 26 27 28 Surgical debulking of the tumor is a core component of GBM clinical treatment and results in significant immunological effects. Studies have shown that trauma caused by surgery and the resulting immediate inflammation can later exacerbate immunosuppression within the TME 29 30 31 32 33 34 Immunotherapy delivered directly to the tumor site has proven safer and more effective than systemic administration 35 36 39 40 41 In this study, we formulate a small molecule TLR7/8 agonist, resiquimod, within a biodegradable polymer scaffold for controlled release of the agonist over several days. This scaffold is implanted in the brain at the time of tumor resection to harness the immunostimulatory effects of surgical tumor resection and generate an antitumor immune response. We find that delivery of resiquimod via scaffold increases and prolongs resiquimod retention in the brain compared to bolus injection of resiquimod. In two orthotopic murine models, GL261 and CT2A, scaffold therapy improves survival and leads to the formation of immune memory and protection from tumor challenge. Additionally, we observe that scaffold-mediated delivery of resiquimod leads to an immunostimulatory environment in the brain and draining lymph nodes and stimulates systemic T cell trafficking. These results suggest that sustained, local immune stimulation coupled with tumor resection offers an innovative strategy for GBM immunotherapy. Results Sustained resiquimod elicits tumor clearance, memory To probe the benefit of sustained local TLR7/8 stimulation within the context of tumor resection, resiquimod was formulated within an acetalated dextran (Ace-DEX) polymer scaffold for controlled release. Ace-DEX is a biodegradable polymer with adjustable degradation rates created by modifying hydroxyl groups of dextran with cyclic and acyclic acetals 42 44 1 A, B 1A Fig. 1 GL261 study and pharmacokinetics.

This is important, as studies have shown that resection can greatly affect drug diffusion 45 46 1C 1 1B 1C 1D In a mouse model of GBM resection, a pilot study was done with GL261-mCh-Luc tumors to evaluate the feasibility and dose of perioperative treatment with bolused soluble resiquimod and Ace-Resi (Supplementary Fig. 2A 1D 2B–F 2K, L To examine immune memory formation, the long-term survivors from both low and high dose Ace-Resi groups were challenged with GL261-mCh-Luc tumors in the contralateral hemisphere 10 weeks after tumor resection and treatment. All mice demonstrated protection from challenge indicating an immune memory response (Fig. 1E 2G–J 1F 2M + + 2N These results suggested that controlled release via scaffold was more important than the dose of resiquimod in achieving a durable anti-tumor response.

On set days after surgical resection of CT2A-Luc tumors and perioperative scaffold treatment, mice were euthanized, and immune populations were analyzed using flow cytometry (Fig. 3A 3B 6 Fig. 3 Ace-Resi remodels the brain immune environment.

Surgical resection is the standard-of-care for GBM and has profound immune effects; however, preclinical evaluations of immunotherapy are rarely studied within this paradigm 53 54 36 55 57 We observed large differences in the pharmacokinetics of Ace-Resi in the brain versus bolus intracranial injection of resiquimod. Ace-Resi had average of 10-fold increases in local resiquimod concentration in the brain compared to plasma out to 3 days. Reduced systemic delivery of resiquimod is important as many clinical trials with TLR7/8 stimulation have concerns with systemic toxicities 58 60 In this study we find that sustained local release of resiquimod administered at the time of tumor resection can lead to durable tumor suppression that protects mice from a tumor challenge indicating the formation of immune memory response. It appears that the dose of resiquimod applied is not the critical element to mount an anti-tumor response, but rather that the local resiquimod stimulation lasts longer than a bolus administration (>1 h as measured by pharmacokinetics). Further, we found Ace-Resi tumor clearance to be dependent on the presence of T cells and interferon signaling. In both GL261-mCh-Luc and CT2A-Luc models, bolus injection of soluble resiquimod intracranially did not result in tumor regression or any long-term survivors. This is in contrast to Grauer et al. 28 45 46 A similar immunotherapeutic strategy has shown efficacy against other non-intracranial tumors. Park et al. 55 −/− 61 64 Recently, Turco et al. 65 Consistent with literature, we found that tumor resection has significant immunostimulatory effects 31 32 + The promising results from this study present several opportunities for further exploration and improvement. Encouragingly, mice responded well to this therapy, exhibiting minimal weight loss; however, a comprehensive safety analysis will be essential before translation to a clinical setting. Of note, our finding that resiquimod dose is less important than the sustained local release for antitumor effects, suggests that dose reduction could be achieved for improved safety profile while maintaining therapeutic benefit. One drawback of this study is the absence of human data or patient derived xenograft models which may limit the extent to which findings can be generalized to clinical populations. However, the requirement for an intact immune system to observe Ace-Resi activity necessitates the use of immunocompetent preclinical models. Lastly, in this study we utilized a biodegradable polymer scaffold to achieve continuous local stimulation in mice; however, clinically this could be more simply achieved with a catheter (Ommaya reservoir) placed during surgery. This approach could bypass the lengthy FDA approval process for novel biomaterials and provide the added safety benefit of easily suspending treatment if necessary. In summary, we formulated TLR7/8 agonist, resiquimod, within a biodegradable nanofibrous Ace-DEX scaffold. We found that increased and sustained local concentration of resiquimod in the brain compared to bolus injection. In two murine models of glioma resection and recurrence, GL261 and CT2A, we found that sustained release of resiquimod was necessary to form an anti-tumor immune response and that surviving mice were protected from subsequent tumor challenge. Additionally, we found Ace-Resi improved survival in a model of breast cancer brain metastasis. We observed that sustained local stimulation of TLR7/8 at the time of tumor resection augments resection-mediated disruption to the immunosuppressive TME and induced systemic T cell trafficking. This allows for the recruitment of inflammatory innate immune cells and freshly primed cytotoxic T cells that can effectively suppress and clear residual tumor while forming a lasting immune memory (Fig. 7E Methods Experimental design The objective of this controlled laboratory experiment was to determine if sustained local TLR7/8 agonism (achieved by formulating small molecule, resiquimod, within a biodegradable polymer scaffold) applied at the time of GBM tumor resection would improve survival. Pharmacokinetic studies confirmed that Ace-Resi extended the duration of resiquimod exposure in the murine brain relative to bolus injection. Mice bearing two different orthotopic luminescent GBM tumors (GL261-mCh-Luc and CT2A-Luc) were utilized for evaluation, as well as confirmation in the same cell line without reporter protein (CT2A-Par). Treatment was also confirmed in a breast cancer brain metastasis model (EO771). Survival was prospectively selected as the primary endpoint, and for luminescent tumors, serial bioluminescence imaging was used to quantify and monitor local tumor recurrence. Formation of an immune memory response towards the tumor was determined by challenging long-term surviving mice with a new inoculate of tumor cells in the contralateral hemisphere, utilizing naïve mice as a control. Immune cell infiltrates were evaluated by flow cytometry after a second tumor challenge. Tolerability of Ace-Resi treatment was assessed by weight loss. For mechanistic studies, flow cytometry and ELISA were used to assess cell populations and serum cytokines, respectively. Athymic (Nu/Nu) and interferon receptor knockout (Ifnar −/− Sample sizes were determined based on results from prior experiments to ensure statistical significance could be analyzed. One control mouse was excluded as it died unrelated to tumor burden, and three mice were euthanized as a result of surgical complications. Mice were randomly assigned to treatment groups on the day of surgery. When possible, monitoring mice for survival was done in a blinded manner. Mice were evaluated regularly and euthanized if they reached humane endpoints. Cell culture GL261 cells were engineered to express mCherry-firefly luciferase (mCh-Luc) using previously developed lentiviral vectors to allow for fluorescent and bioluminescent imaging as in our previous study (GL261-mCh-Luc) 66 Mice All animal protocols were approved by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), and care of mice was in accordance with the standards set forth by the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the American Veterinary Medical Association. Experimental and control animals were co-housed in a specific pathogen-free/SPF animal facility with 12 hour light/dark cycle 70 °F temperature and 50% humidity. Female C57BL/6 mice age 7−10 weeks from Charles River (stock # 027) were utilized for GL261 models, and Jackson Labs (stock # 00064) for CT2A and EO771 models. Female Nu/Nu (Nu- Foxn1 nu Ifnar1 −/− Scaffold fabrication To generate the hydrophobic biopolymer Ace-DEX, dextran (450-650 kDa, Sigma, Cat # 31392) and pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (1.55% wt/wt, Sigma, Cat # 232238) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Sigma, Cat # 276855) and reacted with 2-ethoxypropene (20% v/v, Matrix Scientific, Cat # 70378) under anhydrous conditions for 15 minutes. The resulting polymer was precipitated in basic water (400 µL of triethylamine in 1 L of deionized water) and lyophilized. Ace-DEX was dissolved in ethanol (Fisher Cat # 04-355-224) and centrifuged to remove impurities. Then the polymer was re-precipitated in basic water, lyophilized, and stored at -20°C. Cyclic acetal coverage (CAC) was determined to be 31% by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, Varian Inova 400) 43 To formulate resiquimod scaffold, Ace-DEX was dissolved at a concentration of 300 mg/mL in a tri-solvent system consisting of dichloromethane (Fisher, Cat # D37-20), hexafluoro-2-propanol (Sigma, Cat # 105228), and butanol (Sigma, Cat # 360465) at a ratio of 30%, 30%, and 40% v/v respectively. Resiquimod (10% wt/wt, Accel PharmTech, Cat # XP2356) was added to the polymer solution and 1 mL was extruded from a glass syringe with a 21-guage needle at a flow rate of 1 mL per hour. A voltage bias ( ± 7 kV direct current) was applied across the needle and a metal collection plate. The resulting scaffold (termed Ace-Resi) was retrieved from the collection plate and stored at -20°C until further use. A scaffold without any resiquimod was fabricated similarly as a control (termed Ace-Blank). Scaffold characterization Electrospun scaffolds were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy to elucidate fiber morphology. A small piece of each scaffold was mounted on aluminum stubs using carbon tape, sputter coated with palladium and imaged at 2 kV on a Hitachi S-4700 Cold Cathode Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies, Krefeld, Germany). To measure resiquimod loading, scaffold samples were weighed, dissolved in DMSO and the absorbance at 260 nm was compared to a standard curve. Resiquimod encapsulation efficiency was defined as the amount of measured resiquimod divided by the theoretical resiquimod loaded. Resiquimod release and scaffold mass loss were determined by adding pre-weighed scaffold samples to a sink of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) agitated at 37 °C. At specific time points, scaffold samples were removed, washed with basic water, lyophilized, and re-weighed to determine the total scaffold mass loss. Scaffold mass loss was calculated according to Supp Equation 1 2 To assess the pharmacokinetics of resiquimod released from Ace-Resi/fast within the mouse brain compared to bolus soluble injection, experimental groups were applied to a resection cavity created in the right frontal lobe in a non-tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mouse. At 1 hour, 6 hour, 1, 3, and 7 days, mice were euthanized, and the brain and plasma were collected. Any remaining scaffold was removed from the brain. The removed scaffold was lyophilized, dissolved in DMSO, and evaluated by fluorescence (excitation 260 nm, emission 370 nm) against a standard curve to quantify the percentage of resiquimod retained within the remaining scaffold. Plasma samples and brain tissue were snap frozen. Brain tissue was homogenized in PBS using 1.4 mm porcelain homogenization beads and diluted in PBS for a 4x dilution. Samples were analyzed with LC-MS/MS to measure the concentration of resiquimod. The lower limit of quantification for resiquimod in the brain was 1 ng per gram of tissue and in plasma was 1 ng per mL. Mouse tumor models For all surgical procedures, mice were anesthetized by vapor isoflurane. Bupivacaine was utilized for local analgesia, and meloxicam (5 mg/kg) was administered before surgery and once daily for the following 3 days. A model of GBM resection and recurrence was used to evaluate drug-loaded scaffolds similar to those previously described 37 2 3A 2A 3A 5A 5D 15A 2 5 To assess for a memory immune response in GL261-mCh-Luc and CT2A-Luc studies, long-term survivors were challenged with tumors (2 × 10 5 For the CT2A-Par study, survivors were challenged with 2 × 10 5 + + + Evaluation of immunological effects Mice were implanted with CT2A-Luc tumors in the right frontal lobe as described above. Two weeks later, tumors were resected, and scaffolds were implanted with the following groups: Ace-Blank, Ace-Resi 100 µg. As controls, a subset of mice with and without tumors did not undergo resection, tumor and healthy groups, respectively. At days 1, 3, 7, and 10 following resection, mice were euthanized. Brain, superficial cervical lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, and blood were collected for leukocyte analysis. Serum was also collected, and cytokines were measured by ELISA according to manufacturer guidelines: IFN-β (R&D Systems, Cat # DY8234-05), TNF (Biolegend, Cat # 430901), IFN-γ (Biolegend, Cat # 430801). Superficial cervical lymph nodes (pooled from right and left sides), spleen, and bone marrow (extruded from a single femur) were harvested. Single-cell suspensions were generated by grinding through a 70 µm cell strainer. Red blood cells were lysed from spleen and bone marrow samples with ACK lysis buffer. All cell suspensions were washed with FACs buffer (PBS + 2% FBS), then passed through another 70 µm strainer. Blood was collected into both K3EDTA-coated (Greiner, Cat # 450475) and serum separator tubes (Greiner, Cat # 450472). Serum was stored at -80 °C for later use. Fifty microliters of blood from K3EDTA tubes was treated with ACK lysis buffer to remove red blood cells. The cell suspension was then washed with FACs buffer. For S1P1 staining, bone marrow (extruded from a single femur) was harvested into S1P1 buffer (500 mL PBS, 5 mL 10% buffered neutral formalin, 2 mL 0.5 M EDTA, 2.5 g bovine serum albumin) to fix cells immediately. Single-cell suspensions were generated by grinding through a 70-µm cell strainer in S1P1 buffer. Red blood cells were lysed with ACK lysis buffer. Cell suspensions were washed with S1P1 buffer and passed through another 70 µm strainer. Cells were washed twice in FACS buffer, stained for 30 minutes on ice, then washed twice and resuspended in FACS buffer. Whole brains were removed and dissociated via homogenization in HBSS. Brain homogenate was suspended in 30% Percoll, and the cell pellet was collected. Red blood cells were lysed with ACK lysis buffer. Cell suspensions were washed twice in FACS buffer and passed through a 70 µm strainer. Following the generation of single-cell suspensions, cells were divided based on downstream application (either surface staining or intracellular cytokine staining (ICCS)). For the identification and exclusion of dead cells in all flow analysis, samples were stained with eBioscience Fixable Viability Dye (Invitrogen, Cat # 65-0866-018) diluted 1:1000 in FACS buffer for 30 minutes on ice, then washed twice with FACS buffer. All samples were acquired using either an Attune NxT flow cytometer (ThermoFisher) or an LSRFortessa flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Flow data analysis was performed using FlowJo (Becton Dickinson). All samples were subject to sequential debris, doublet, and dead cell removal prior to analysis. A complete list of antibody clones, fluorochrome conjugates, vendors, and dilutions is included in Supplementary Table 3 For brain lymphocyte panel, cells were treated with brefeldin A (5 μg/mL, Biolegend, Cat # 420601) and monensin (2 µM, Biolegend, Cat # 420701) with and without phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 ng/mL, Sigma, Cat # P8139) and ionomycin (500 ng/mL, Sigma, Cat # I0634) for 4 hours at 37 °C. For systemic lymphocyte and systemic counts panels (involving only surface stains), cells were washed twice in FACS buffer, then stained for 30 minutes on ice in FACS buffer, resuspended in 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 minutes on ice, then washed twice and resuspended in FACS buffer. All other panels employed ICCS, where cells were then fixed and permeabilized for 30 minutes on ice using the eBioscience Foxp3 / Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set (Thermo Fisher, Cat # 00-5523-00), washed twice with permeabilization buffer, then stained with a mixture of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies diluted in permeabilization buffer for 30 minutes at room temperature, washed twice with permeabilization buffer and resuspended in FACS buffer.
