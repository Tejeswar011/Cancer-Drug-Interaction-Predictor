Scapular Ewing sarcoma (SES) represents <4% of ES cases with limited literature. We report a case of SES with uncommon respiratory symptoms in a 37-year-old male and conduct a systematic review to improve comprehension of SES demographics, clinical attributes, and management. Literature Review A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar including SES case reports and series from 1983 to 2024. Using Covidence, references were screened. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility, resulting in the inclusion of 32 studies. Risk of bias was assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists. A total of 124 SES cases were analyzed. SES predominantly affected adolescents with median age of 16 years; IQR: 12–24, and most commonly presented with shoulder swelling. A case within this cohort exhibited respiratory symptoms. Metastases occurred in 30% of cases, mainly to the lungs and bones. Remission was achieved in 64% of cases, while 29.7% had fatal outcomes. Conclusion This review highlights the predominance of shoulder symptoms and identifies a unique respiratory presentation. Given the high metastatic rate, standardized protocols are needed to ensure oncological control and preserve shoulder function. Registration PROSPERO,CRD420251008692. ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS  Scapular Ewing Sarcoma (SES) is a rare bone tumor (<4% of Ewing sarcoma (ES) cases). Typical clinical presentations include shoulder swelling and pain. Metastases occur in ∼30% of SES cases, mainly lungs and bones. Management of SES aligns with standard protocols for similar-stage ES. Standardized protocols are needed to optimize care.

Introduction Ewing sarcoma (ES) and its related sarcomas represent a category of aggressive round-cell mesenchymal tumors primarily observed in the pediatric and young adult population [ 1–3 2 4 5 Previously, the umbrella term ‘Ewing sarcoma family of tumors’ encompassed various lesions based on their morphological, immunophenotypical characteristics and chromosomal translocations. This group included extraosseous Ewing sarcoma, peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET), and Askin tumors. However, the 2013 WHO classification of sarcomas consolidated these entities into the designation “Ewing sarcoma,” distinguished by hallmark FET–ETS gene fusions [ 6–8 Scapular Ewing sarcomas (SES) represent a small fraction, comprising less than 4% of all documented ES cases [ 9 10 9 11 This article aims to achieve two key objectives: firstly, to present a unique case study of SES in an adult patient showcasing an unusual respiratory manifestation. Secondly, it seeks to conduct a comprehensive systematic review that consolidates available literature on SES to augment comprehension of its demographics, clinical characteristics, as well as management, and oncological outcomes. 2. Case description 2.1. Patient history and initial examination A 37-year-old male patient was admitted to the pulmonology department, presenting symptoms of dyspnea and dry cough. No significant personal or familial medical history was reported. Physical examination revealed bilateral diminished breath sounds in the middle and inferior posterior thoracic regions, accompanied by dullness to percussion in the same areas. 2.2. Diagnostic assessments 2.2.1. Preliminary Workup Initial laboratory tests indicated mild normochromic normocytic anemia, elevated white blood cell count, notably high C-reactive protein levels, and increased Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. A chest X-ray exhibited bilateral homogeneous densities in the middle and inferior thoracic regions, suggestive of bilateral pleural effusion. A subsequent pleural puncture revealed hemorrhagic effusion and pleural fluid analysis confirmed exudative characteristics with elevated LDH levels. Cytology of the pleural fluid sample showed an abundance of red blood cells and white cells, primarily lymphocytes (90%), alongside altered mesothelial cells. An initial attempt at a pleural biopsy, using an Abrams needle, did not yield contributory results. 2.2.3. Imaging Studies The thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan showed extensive bilateral pleural effusion and scattered nodular lung and pleural tumors bilaterally ( Figure 1(A,B) Figure 1(C,D) Figure 1. Thoracic CT imaging findings. (A) Bilateral nodular lung; (B) bilateral pleural effusion and pleural tumors; (C and D) scapular tumor: axial (C) and coronal (D) section. 2.3. Histopathological findings ( Figure 2 The microscopic analysis unveiled a disruption in the fibro-adipose and striated muscle tissue attributed to a densely populated malignant tumor proliferation. The tumor was composed of blue-rounded cells with a solid, diffuse architecture that interwove with the connective tissue, forming an intricate ‘filigree’ pattern. This proliferation is frequently organized into rosette formations, aligning tumor cells radially and in palisades around blood vessels. The malignant cells typically presented as small to medium-sized, characterized by scanty cytoplasm and ill-defined borders, intermittently displaying a vacuolated appearance. Their nuclei exhibited a vesicular nature with subtle size variations. The mitotic index was 21 mitoses per 10 high-power fields indicating the proliferative activity of the tumor. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed pronounced membranous staining for CD99 and diffuse, robust staining for NKX2-2. Furthermore, the tumor cells exhibited positivity for Vimentin and Cytokeratin while showing no reactivity for neuroendocrine markers (Chromogranin A -/CD56 -), melanocytic markers (S100 protein -/Melan A -/HMB45 -), lymphoid markers (CD20 -/CD3 -/Pax 5 -), vascular markers (CD34 -), and muscular markers (myogenin -/desmin-). Remarkably, tumor cells displayed intense and diffuse staining with Bcl2, weak staining with EMA, and were negative for TLE1. The histopathological findings strongly supported the diagnosis of a primitive neuroectodermal tumor/Ewing sarcoma, revealing a high Ki67 proliferation index of 70%. 2.4. Staging investigations Whole-body Tc-99m methylene diphosphonate (Tc-99m MDP) scintigraphy revealed pathological isotope uptake localized at the tip and medial border of the right scapula. Interestingly, the lytic lesion identified on the T4 vertebra CT scan exhibited normal tracer uptake, indicative of its purely lytic composition. Subsequent procedures involved a video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy of the pleura, accompanied by talc pleurodesis, confirming the metastatic nature of the pleural lesions. As per the AJCC staging system, this characterized the high-grade ES as stage IV [ 12 2.5. Management and follow-up Due to the unresectable nature of scapular lesions and vertebral and thoracic metastases, orthopedic surgery was deemed unfeasible. Instead, the patient underwent a primary course of chemotherapy, VDC (vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide), resulting in the resolution of pleural effusion and regression of pulmonary metastases. However, despite an initial positive response, disease progression ensued. A subsequent round of chemotherapy failed to yield favorable outcomes, leading to spinal cord compression, paraplegia, increased osteolytic activity in the right scapula, significant necrosis of adjacent soft tissues, worsening necrosis of bilateral pleural masses, and the emergence of osteolytic lesions in the posterior arches of the 11th and 12th left ribs. The patient’s overall survival spanned 18 months. 2.6. Patient perspective The patient’s perspective on their challenging prognosis and the discomfort of chemotherapy was marked by resilience amidst adversity. Simultaneously, the family navigated a delicate balance between hope and acceptance, witnessing the toll of illness. The medical team, in turn, exhibited unwavering dedication, prioritizing the preservation of the patient’s dignity by implementing palliative care measures aimed at alleviating their discomfort. 2.7. Consent Written informed consent was diligently obtained from the deceased patient’s family to publish this case report along with the accompanying images. 3. Systematic review of literature 3.1. Methodology 3.1.1. Search strategy This systematic review was conducted per the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The search strategy involved comprehensive exploration within PubMed databases, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, employing predefined search terms: (“Ewing Sarcoma” OR “Ewing’s Sarcoma”) AND (“Scapula” OR “Shoulder Blade”). Only the first 200 search results from Google Scholar were considered, according to Bramer et al., who stated that beyond this threshold, it is unlikely to find any relevant studies [ 13 3.1.2. Eligibility criteria Retrospective case reports and case series reporting SESs were included. Articles in French and English were included. Study-type reviews were excluded. 3.1.3. Data extraction Two authors, HC and HBR, independently conducted the initial screening of retrieved articles. In the event of discordant evaluations, a third author, SBR, provided input to facilitate consensus. We used Covidence to remove duplicated studies and maintain the records of identified and screened studies. Microsoft Excel sheet was used to extract the study’s characteristics such as type of study, year of publication, age, sex, presenting symptom, respiratory involvement, metastatic sites, surgical and adjuvant treatment, follow-up, and outcomes. If a study had multiple patients reported, then all the patients from the study were pooled. 3.1.4. Outcome measures Our primary objective was to identify the total number of reported cases of SES. The secondary objectives were to describe the clinical characteristics. 3.1.5. Statistical analysis The categorical variables were reported in frequency with percentages. The continuous variables were presented in mean with standard deviation (SD). No normally distributed data were reported as the median and Interquartile interval (IQR). 3.1.6. Risk of bias assessment Joanna Briggs Institute’s (JBI) critical appraisal checklists for case reports and case series were used for risk of bias assessment. The checklist included 8 to 10 items. If the answer to an item was yes, it was scored 1; otherwise, it was scored zero. For case reports, quality scores of 2 or less, 3 to 5, and 6 or greater were considered low, moderate, and high quality, respectively. For case series and cohort studies, quality scores of 4 or less, 5 to 7, and 8 or greater were considered low, moderate, and high quality, respectively ( Supplementary Tables 1 2 Table 1.

Results 4.1. Literature research A total of 433 references were imported for screening. During the identification phase, 4 duplicates were manually removed, and an additional 113 duplicates were detected and excluded using Covidence. After de-duplication, 316 studies were screened based on titles and abstracts. Of these, 43 studies were selected for full-text review to assess eligibility. During the full-text assessment phase, 11 studies were excluded based on predefined criteria: one due to wrong outcomes, six due to wrong study design, and four due to an inappropriate patient population. Ultimately, 32 studies met the stringent criteria for inclusion [ 14–45 Figure 3 Figure 2. Pathological findings of the scapular mass biopsy.

A PRISMA-based illustration of our systematic literature review. ES: Ewing Sarcoma; SES: Scapular Ewing Sarcoma. 4.1.1. Primary outcomes The 32 included studies consisted of 10 case series reporting a total of 101 cases of SES, 22 individual case reports, and the current case report. In total, 124 cases of SES were analyzed (123 from the existing literature and 1 from the present case report). Data summarized in Table 1 4.1.2. Secondary outcomes SES was diagnosed between 1 day and 57 years of age, with a median of 16 years (IQR 12–24), mainly during adolescence and early adulthood. Two congenital cases were identified in the neonatal period. Males represented 59.3% of cases. Clinical presentations were documented in 20 cases, with shoulder girdle swelling reported in 80% of them. Neurological manifestations, mainly related to spinal cord extension, were observed in 3 cases. Uniquely, our case presented with respiratory symptoms. Of the 112 cases assessed, 78 (69.6%) showed no evidence of metastatic spread. Among the 34 cases with metastases, the lungs (24 cases) and bones (10 cases) were the most frequently involved sites. Rare metastatic sites included the chest wall (1 case), intradural extension (1 case), bone marrow infiltration (1 case), and retroperitoneal localization (1 case). Pleural involvement was identified exclusively in the present case. Two patients exhibited multi-organ metastatic involvement. 4.2. Management and outcomes Chemotherapy was administered in 81 cases (65.3%) and radiotherapy in 26 cases (21.0%). The most common treatment protocol combined preoperative chemotherapy, surgical resection, and postoperative chemotherapy, applied in 28 cases (22.6%). Follow-up durations ranged from 2 days to 8 years. Reported survival rates in cohort studies were 68% and 38%, respectively. Among the 75 cases with available remission data, 48 (64.0%) achieved complete remission, while 4 (5.3%) showed disease progression or recurrence. Across the 118 cases with available outcome data, 35 patients (27.0%) died. 5. Discussion Ewing Sarcoma, a malignant tumor originating from mesenchymal tissues, ranks as the second most common bone malignancy affecting children and young adults, with a higher prevalence among males [ 1 3–5 10 9 10 32 The epidemiology of SES mirrors that of typical ES affecting bones, with a median onset age of 16 years, ranging from congenital cases to 57 years, and a notable male predominance of 59.3% [ 2 18 22 28 3 46 47 11 24 26 29 31 33 Pleural effusion with dyspnea as the initial manifestation of ES is an infrequent occurrence and has been only documented in cases involving the ribs [ 48–51 Typically, Ewing Sarcoma exhibits a pattern of metastasis to the lungs (57%) and bones (34%) while pleural metastases of ES, particularly in cases of SES, are exceptionally rare [ 10 11 32 34 52 53 54 This systematic review underscored a relatively less aggressive metastatic profile in SES, where merely 30% of cases exhibited secondary localizations, a marked deviation from the heightened incidence (80%) observed in alternative forms of ES [ 2 3 52 11 32 Imaging technologies such as CT-scan, MRI, and PET/CT play a key role in characterizing and staging ES. However, definitive confirmation necessitates a tissue biopsy [ 1 7 8 1 2 7 8 55 Distinguishing Ewing’s sarcoma from other blue cell tumors may be histologically challenging, encompassing differential diagnoses like lymphoma, leukemia, small cell carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and neuroblastoma. Immunohistochemistry, crucial for differentiation, highlights markers like CD99, a cell surface glycoprotein encoded by the MIC2 gene, which typically exhibits strong staining in Ewing’s cells. However, its lack of specificity mandates the use of complementary markers like NKX2-2, displaying higher specificity (98%) in ES cases [ 7 8 55 The molecular hallmark of ES involves the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation between FET and ETS genes, resulting in the EWS/FLI1 oncogenic gene fusion in around 85% of cases. This fusion protein, EWS/FLI1, acts as a pivotal transcription factor governing tumor progression [ 1 3 7 8 56 57 58 58 The management and prognosis of SES emphasize the significant role of surgery and radiation in achieving local disease control, substantially improving survival rates when combined with systemic chemotherapy [ 2 8 52 Among the 124 cases analyzed, 11 patients were treated with a multimodal approach consisting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, total scapulectomy with extracorporeal irradiation and reimplantation of the scapula, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Given the high metastatic potential of SES, standardized treatment protocols are essential to ensure oncological control while preserving shoulder function. Current guidelines recommend a multimodal approach combining neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical resection with limb-sparing techniques, and adjuvant radiotherapy when indicated. Gupta et al. recently proposed a consensus framework for managing ES of the shoulder girdle, emphasizing early diagnosis, multidisciplinary planning, and functional rehabilitation [ 52 Retrospective cohort studies evaluating SES demonstrate 5-year survival rates spanning between 38% and 68% across diverse disease stages [ 32 34 53 Recent advances in molecular oncology reveal promising directions for bone sarcoma research and management. Emerging data highlight the role of circDOCK1, a circular RNA, in promoting tumor progression and drug resistance [ 59 60 61 6. Conclusion This systematic review, encompassing 124 reported cases of scapular Ewing sarcoma, is the largest to date in the English literature. It provides an updated overview of SES clinical features, disease progression, and management, addressing the scarcity of large-scale studies. SES predominantly affects males during childhood and young adulthood, typically presenting with shoulder swelling or limited mobility. A unique case with respiratory symptoms was also identified, expanding the known clinical spectrum. Histopathological characteristics, treatment approaches, and outcomes were consistent with Ewing sarcoma at other skeletal sites. The observed variability in management protocols, especially in surgical approaches, highlights the need for a standardized oncological protocol. This protocol should focus not only on oncological control but also on preserving shoulder mobility, thus improving functional outcomes and potentially enhancing survival rates in affected patients.
