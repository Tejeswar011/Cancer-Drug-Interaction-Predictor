(A) Redox transformation of nitroxides in tissues. In vivo Fig. 1 One of the most important fields of application of site-specific ROS detection is oncology. In tumors, redox regulation modulates tumor initiation, proliferation, metastasis, programmed cell death, autophagy, and metabolic reprogramming [ 31 32 [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] 37 38 39 34 35 [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] in vivo The present study aims to assess the value of EPR spectroscopy using a dual probe for site-specific ROS detection in vitro in vivo 46 in vivo 16 [19] [20] [21] 23 47 Fig. 1 l 20 22 48 in vitro in vivo 49 50 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Superoxide production by enzymatic assay To produce superoxide, a Xanthine/Xanthine Oxidase system was used. Xanthine (Sigma-Aldrich, Hoeilaart, Belgium) and Xanthine Oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich) were added at the concentration of 1 mM and 5 mU/ml, respectively, to PBS buffer (Thermo Scientific, pH 7.4) with 1 mM of NADH (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mM of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA, Sigma-Aldrich). This system allows a superoxide production of 1.97 μM/min as described elsewhere [ 51 2.2 ROS measurements on whole cells exposed to redox modulators 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and maintained in culture in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Thermo Scientific, Merelbeke, Belgium) supplemented with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI FBS, Gibco, Thermo Scientific). The day prior to acquisition, cells were treated with either 25 μM l 6 in vivo 2.3 Tumor models and treatments All experiments involving animals were allowed by the local ethics committee (UCLouvain agreement reference: 2022/UCL/MD/33) and performed in accordance with Belgian law for the protection and welfare of animals. Six weeks old females BALB/cAnNRJ (Janvier Labs, France) were housed under standardized light and temperature conditions of light and temperature (12-h daylight cycle, 22 ± 2 °C) before and during the experiments. All animals had ad libitum access to chow pellets and water. After acclimation, 2 × 10 5 2 3 Mice were treated for 3 days with either 500 mg/kg of L-BSO, 0.3 mg/kg of Antimycin A or the appropriate controls (saline solution for L-BSO experiment or DMSO for Antimycin A experiment). The treatment was injected intraperitoneally by alternating the injection site. 2.4 In vivo L-band EPR When tumor size reached a diameter of 7 mm (≅ 250 mm 3 52 Fig. S1 Fig. S1 D e c a y r a t e = Ln ( i n t e n s i t y T 2 ) − Ln ( i n t e n s i t y T 1 ) T 2 − T 1 After the first acquisition, mice were treated daily with either L-BSO, Antimycin A or the appropriate control. Each day, a new EPR acquisition was performed to study the evolution of nitroxides decay rates over time. 2.5 Ex-vivo analysis On the third day of treatment with L-BSO, Antimycin A or control, an ex-vivo in vivo in vivo 19 Fig. S2 2.6 4T1 cells transfection with SOD2 10 5 2.7 Western blotting 4T1 and 4T1-SOD2 cells were harvested from 100 mm Petri dishes and lysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) with 1 % Halt protease inhibitors and Halt phosphatase inhibitors (ThermoFisher). For PRX1 and PRX3 immunoblotting, cysteine residues were alkylated (to determine the oxidized and reduced isoforms) and proteins extracted using a non-reducing environment as explained elsewhere [ 53 2.8 Mitochondrial nitroxide fraction quantification 20 × 10 6 2.9 Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed on Graph Pad Prism 9.5. All data are shown means ± SEM. The numbers of replicates and applied statistical tests are indicated in the legend of each figure. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 In vitro confirmation of site-specificity of ROS detection by the dual probe The implementation of the new toolbox to detect global ROS and mtROS was performed by steps of increasing complexity. First, we assessed that the decay of the EPR signal coming from both probes was sensitive to the presence of ROS. An enzymatic system, xanthine/xanthine oxidase, was first used as it is well known to produce superoxide radical in the presence of oxygen and NADH ( Fig. 2 54 Fig. 2 55 56 Fig. 2 Fig. 2 In vitro Fig. 2 Then, we tested the ability of the method to detect redox modulation in different compartments of cells. We hypothesized that mitoTEMPO is more sensitive than 3CP to mitochondrial redox modulations. This is thought to be due primarily to the better penetration and greater accumulation of mitoTEMPO in mitochondrial lipid membranes. Our results support this hypothesis, showing that mitoTEMPO accumulates more efficiently in mitochondria than 3CP ( Fig. S3 To assess the sensitivity of the two nitroxides for redox modulation in different cellular compartments, 4T1 cells were exposed to either L-BSO, an agent inducing glutathione depletion [ 20 22 48 53 Fig. S4A Fig. S4B Fig. S4C Fig. S5 • Fig. 2 • Fig. 2 Fig. S4D 3.2 Noninvasive site-specificity of ROS detection in tumors in vivo For in vivo Fig. S6 versus Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Fig. S5 in vivo in vitro Fig. 2 in vivo Fig. 3 In vivo t t t t Fig. 3 3.3 Blood wash-out did not contribute significantly to the EPR signal decay While the previous results showed that L-BSO and Antimycin A induced differing consequences on nitroxide decay kinetics, it was important to check that this was due to different sites of ROS production while removing confounding factors bias. For example, it has been described that changes in perfusion/hemodynamics could play a role in the wash-out of nitroxides [ 49 in vivo 19 Fig. 4 ex-vivo Fig. 4 in vivo Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Fig. S7 Fig. 4 Evolution of the concentration of the nitroxide form (top) and of the combined forms (nitroxide + hydroxylamine) (bottom) of 3CP and MitoTEMPO • Fig. 4 3.4 Superoxide contributes partially to signal decay rate Because superoxide is the primary ROS produced by mitochondria [ 37 35 50 Fig. 5 Fig. 5 , Fig. 5 in vitro Fig. S8 in vivo 29 57 in vivo 58 59 Fig. 5 Contribution of superoxide to the EPR signal decay rate in vivo. in vivo in vivo. Fig. 5 Overall, one of the main strengths of this assay resides in the fact that EPR spectroscopy allows for noninvasive in vivo In vitro 54 In vivo It is important to note that the reduction of nitroxides in biological systems is shaped by the complex interplay between cellular oxidants and the reductive capacity of each cell type. Rather than following a single, universal mechanism, nitroxide bioreduction depends on the relative abundance and activity of intracellular reductants such as GSH, NADH, NADPH, as well as redox enzymatic systems whose expression and activity vary across cell types [ 10 11 6 For the future, it would be interesting to use the combination of the two probes with imaging modalities, such as EPR imaging, MRI or DNP-MRI, to further investigate the heterogeneity of the redox response of cancer cells to treatments.
