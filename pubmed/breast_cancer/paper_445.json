The antibiotics tested included: ampicillin, vancomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, erythromycin, clindamycin, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. The test was performed using THAPH and THA1CLF Sensititre plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using the Sensititre Vizion Digital MIC Viewing System. Results were compared to microbiological cut-off values established by the EFSA to classify strains as either resistant (R) or susceptible (S). To ensure accuracy, two quality control strains, Enterococcus faecalis Escherichia coli 16 Hemolytic activity testing of P. acidilactici The hemolytic activity of the LAB strains was assessed on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates supplemented with 5% (v/v) sheep blood.

(Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters) Reviewer #1: Overall comment: 1. The manuscript is well-organized and written. 2. The discussion is well-reasoned and integrates genetic discoveries with regulatory concerns, including the EFSA recommendations. Recommendations 1. Abstract: \"novel composite alignment\" of tet(M); this terminology could be explained more precisely to aid the general readership. 2. Discussion: The observed susceptibility to tetracycline in the presence of tet(M) and resistance to clindamycin in the absence of comparable ARGs warrants further mechanistic discussion. Could gene silence, promoter inactivity, or undiscovered resistance factors be involved? Please discuss more about it. 3. Discussion: The discovery of katA and cfa, which are rarely seen in P. acidilactici, is interesting. These findings indicate potential innovative adaptations. Please find literature or brief contextualization to discuss. 4.

We have addressed each point as detailed below, with changes highlighted in the “Revised Manuscript with Track Changes” file. Comment 1: Abstract: \"novel composite alignment\" of tet(M); this terminology could be explained more precisely to aid the general readership Response: In the revised abstract, we have replaced the term “novel composite alignment” with a more precise and descriptive phrase: “novel composite genetic arrangement flanked by mobile elements, suggesting historical recombination and altered mobility potential.” This change clarifies the genetic context of tet(M), indicating its integration within a composite structure bounded by mobile genetic elements and providing insight into its potential evolutionary origin and mobility. This revision aims to improve clarity for the general readership and to better convey the biological significance of our finding. Change location: Abstract, lines 37–38. Comment 2: Discussion: The observed susceptibility to tetracycline in the presence of tet(M) and resistance to clindamycin in the absence of comparable ARGs warrants further mechanistic discussion. Could gene silence, promoter inactivity, or undiscovered resistance factors be involved? Please discuss more about it. In the revised Discussion (page XX, paragraph XX), we have expanded the explanation to include possible mechanisms for tetracycline susceptibility despite tet(M), such as promoter inactivity, structural mutations, and inducible expression. For clindamycin resistance without erm or lnu genes, we now discuss potential roles of 23S rRNA or ribosomal protein mutations, overexpression of MFS efflux pumps, and uncharacterized determinants such as cfr. These additions provide a clearer rationale for the observed genotype–phenotype discrepancies. Change location: Discussion, lines 412–431. Comment 3: Discussion: The discovery of katA and cfa, which are rarely seen in P. acidilactici, is interesting. These findings indicate potential innovative adaptations. Please find literature or brief contextualization to discuss. Response: we now describe katA as a rare heme-dependent catalase in LAB, potentially acquired from catalase-positive gut or feed bacteria, enhancing oxidative stress tolerance and survival in aerobic and gastrointestinal conditions. Cfa encodes cyclopropane fatty acid synthase, which increases membrane rigidity and hydrophobicity, improving acid and bile tolerance, stability during feed processing, and intestinal persistence. Together, these genes may represent an adaptive signature that enhances resilience for livestock probiotic applications. Change location: Discussion, lines 457–470. S1 Fig. Hemolytic Activity Test of five Thai P. acidilactici strains: If you have a clearer image, please replace it for plate marked no. 5 and 6 Response: We have replaced the original S1 Fig. with a high-resolution TIFF image showing plates 5 and 6 more clearly. The updated image improves visibility of hemolysis zones, enabling clearer distinction of alpha-hemolysis. The figure legend has been retained but the image quality now meets PLOS ONE resolution standards (≥300 dpi). Change location: Supplementary Figure S1. Editorial Requirement 1: Data Availability Statement We have revised the Data Availability Statement as requested. The accession numbers for all genome assemblies have been included, along with the repository name (NCBI GenBank) and the link to the database. Additional annotations are provided in the Supplementary File. Change location: Data Availability Statement, lines 536-542 Editorial Requirement 2: Figure Captions All figure captions are now included separately in the manuscript following the PLOS ONE format, placed immediately after the first mention of the figure in the text. Editorial Requirement 3: References The reference list has been checked and updated to ensure accuracy. No retracted papers are included. Response to Editorial Requests PLOS ONE formatting: Manuscript reformatted per PLOS templates. Data Availability Statement: Revised to include repository names and GenBank accession numbers in the correct format. Figure captions: Added standalone captions for all figures. Reference list: Checked for completeness, accuracy, and currency. No retracted articles are cited. New references added for katA, cfa, and resistance mechanism discussion. We believe these revisions have improved the clarity, completeness, and impact of our manuscript, and we look forward to your further consideration.
