Targeted therapies have improved treatment outcomes as driver mutations have been identified, especially in adenocarcinomas. Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) provides insights into the genetic mutation profile of cancer and helps identify actionable mutations. The mutational landscape of cancer varies based on the patient's ethnic background, and there is limited information on the genetic profile of NSCLC within the Finnish population. Material and Methods We analysed the genetic mutational profile of 96 advanced NSCLCs that underwent CGP between November 2021 and March 2023 at Tampere University Hospital. Additionally, we compared the genomic alterations in our cohort with those in the international datasets. Results Clinically actionable alterations associated with a targeted therapy were identified in 45% of patients, including 63% of never‐smokers and 41% of ever‐smokers. The most common actionable alteration was KRAS G12C (18%), followed by EGFR alterations (14%). However, only 33% of the patients with an actionable alteration received targeted therapy. The median tumour mutational burden (TMB) was 5, with 31% of patients exhibiting a TMB greater than 10. Conclusions CGP affects the treatment strategies for NSCLC. Nearly half of our entire cohort had a genetic alteration eligible for approved targeted therapies. Besides these findings, CGP provides additional data to assess treatment decisions and outcomes, including co‐occurring genetic alterations and TMB. In real‐world clinical practice, the practical application of this information can be restricted by the varying unavailability of optimal treatments. biomarker comprehensive genomic profiling non‐small cell lung cancer targeted therapy Tampereen Tuberkuloosisäätiö 10.13039/501100006706 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:28.09.2025  K.

Next‐generation sequencing (NGS) enables the simultaneous, cost‐effective analysis of multiple mutations across various genes using minimal sample material [ 6 7 Cancer mutation prevalence is influenced by the patient's ethnic background [ 8 9 In this study, we determined the distribution of genetic findings identified by the FoundationOne CDx gene panel in advanced NSCLC patients. The aim was to investigate whether the mutation profile in the Finnish dataset differs from that in the international datasets, thus providing new and valuable insights into genetic findings in advanced NSCLC within the Finnish population. 2 Material and Methods 2.1 Patients We conducted a retrospective, observational study of all patients with non‐squamous NSCLC, as well as those with squamous cell lung cancer who had smoked less than 10 pack‐years, who underwent comprehensive genomic profiling between November 2021 and March 2023 at Tampere University Hospital. In November 2021, CGP was adopted for routine clinical use at Tampere University Hospital for the evaluation of patients with advanced NSCLC. CGP was intended for patients with suspected advanced‐stage NSCLC who were deemed eligible for anticancer drug therapy. The hospital serves approximately 9% of the Finnish population, and during the study period, CGP was performed on 96 NSCLC patients. We retrospectively reviewed electronic patient records to identify all individuals assessed for NSCLC at Tampere University Hospital between November 2021 and March 2023. All patients who underwent CGP were included in the study cohort. NSCLC diagnoses were made by institutional pathologists according to the 2021 WHO Classification of Thoracic Tumours [ 10 The study was conducted in accordance with national legislation on the Secondary Use of Health and Social Data (552/2019), which permits the pseudonymised processing and access to personal health data collected as part of standard clinical practice for research purposes. The Wellbeing Services County of Pirkanmaa, as the data controller, granted permission for data access (permit number 2802/2023). In line with the guidelines of the Finnish National Board on Research Integrity (TENK), ethical review by a research ethics committee was not required for this registry‐ and archive‐based study [ 11 2.2 Next‐Generation Sequencing The FoundationOne CDx (F1CDx: Foundation Medicine Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA) [ 12 12 13 14 2.3 Statistical Analyses The frequencies of genetic variants between different groups were compared using the chi‐square test or Fisher's exact test. Linear correlations were assessed using Spearman's test. A p 3 Results 3.1 Patient Characteristics Comprehensive genomic profiling using F1CDx or F1LCDx was conducted on 96 NSCLC patients. The median age was 73 years (range 46–91), with 65% being male. Nineteen patients (20%) in the cohort were never‐smokers, the majority of whom were female (68%, 13 out of 19). Adenocarcinoma was the most common tumour histology, accounting for 92% of patients. In accordance with institutional guidelines, four patients with squamous cell lung cancer and fewer than 10 pack‐years of smoking were also tested. Most patients had stage IV NSCLC (80%). Three patients had an immigrant background, while the remainder were of Finnish European descent. The clinical characteristics of the cohort are summarised in Table 1 TABLE 1 Clinical characteristics of the cohort.

Of these, ten had received surgical treatment, and in eight cases, NGS samples were taken from the original surgical specimen. None had received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) prior to NGS analysis; however, two had received immuno‐oncological treatment—one with atezolizumab following prior platinum‐based chemotherapy and the other with nivolumab following chemoradiotherapy. For the remaining 88 patients, samples were collected from the most accessible site. One patient with recurrent disease had undergone chemoradiotherapy before NGS sampling. Forty‐six samples were taken from the primary tumour, while 39 were retrieved from metastatic sites. In total, 57 samples were histological, and 36 were cytological. Additionally, three liquid biopsies were collected from plasma derived from peripheral whole blood. 3.2 Mutational Profile of Tumours Genetic alterations were identified in 256 genes. The most frequently mutated gene was TP53 CDKN2A/B KRAS RICTOR KMT2D EGFR KEAP1 STK11 MTAP ERBB2 MET BRAF 1 FIGURE 1 The genetic alterations most relevant in NSCLC. Fusions were identified in seven patients (7.3%), including ALK in four patients and ROS1, RET, and ABL1 in one patient each. No FGFR or NTRK fusions were detected. EML4‐ALK fusions included three with Variant 1 and one with Variant 3a/b. One patient with an EML4‐ALK Variant 1 fusion also exhibited an ALK‐ZRANB3 non‐canonical fusion. The remaining fusions included one each of the SDC4‐ROS1, KIF5B‐RET, and ABL1‐TSC1 non‐canonical fusions. Clinically actionable gene alterations were classified using the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT) classification system [ 15 2 TABLE 2 Targeted therapy for ESCAT level I/II alterations across the cohort ( n Gene Alteration No. of patients (%) ESCAT score Therapy Approval or evidence  ALK Fusion 4 (4.2) I  1st‐ to 2nd‐generation ALK inhibitors Lorlatinib  EMA FDA  ROS1 Fusion 1 (1.0) I  Crizotinib Entrectinib Repotrectinib  a  EMA FDA  RET Fusion 1 (1.0) I  Pralsetinib Selpercatinib  EMA FDA  EGFR Exon 19 deletion 7 (7.3) I 1st‐to 3rd‐generation EGFR TKIs  EMA FDA Leu858Arg 2 (2.1) I  Gefitinib Erlotinib Afatinib Osimertinib Dacomitinib Amivantamab + carboplatin + pemetrexed  EMA FDA Ser768Ile + Gly719Ser 1 (1.0) I  Afatinib Osimertinib Erlotinib Gefitinib Dacomitinib NCCN guidelines level 2A Leu861Gln + Leu833Phe 1 (1.0) I  Afatinib Osimertinib Erlotinib Gefitinib Dacomitinib NCCN guidelines level 2A Exon 20 insertion 2 (2.1) I  Amivantamab Mobocertinib  a  EMA FDA  KRAS Gly12Cys 17 (17.7) I  Sotorasib Adagrasib  EMA FDA  MET Exon 14 skipping 4 (4.2) I  Capmatinib Tepotinib Crizotinib  b  EMA FDA NCCN guidelines level 2A Amplification 1 (1.0) II  Capmatinib Crizotinib Tepotinib NCCN guidelines level 2A  BRAF Val600Glu 2 (2.1) I  Dabrafenib + trametinib Encorafenib + binimetinib  EMA FDA  ERBB2 Exon 20 insertion 1 (1.0) II  Fam‐trastuzumab deruxtecan Ado‐trastuzumab emtansine  b  EMA FDA NCCN guidelines level 2A Abbreviations: EMA, European Medicines Agency; ESCAT, ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets; FDA, U.S. Food and Drug Administration; TKI, tyrosine kinase inhibitor.  a Only FDA approval.  b NCCN guidelines treatment options, level 2A.

Among CHEK2 variants, nine patients (82%) carried the Ile157Thr mutation, likely a germline variant. Eight were sequenced with F1CDx and one with F1LCDx, but as non‐tumour samples were unavailable, germline status could not be confirmed. TET2 is a tumour suppressor gene linked to various cancers, including haematological malignancies and solid tumours [ 17 The median tumour mutational burden (TMB) for the cohort was 5 mutations per megabase (mut/Mb), with a median of 7 mut/Mb (range 0–33) in F1CDx. The mean bTMB for the three F1LCDx assays was 1.33 mut/Mb (range 0–4). In total, 30 patients had a TMB of at least 10 mut/Mb (TMB‐H). Microsatellite instability was not detected in any of the F1CDx or F1LCDx assays. PD‐L1 status was evaluated in 96% of patients. Patients were categorised into three clinically relevant PD‐L1 expression subgroups: less than 1%, 1%–49%, and 50% or higher, representing 32%, 34%, and 29% of patients, respectively. No correlation was observed between PD‐L1 expression and tumour mutational burden. A higher proportion of TMB‐H patients was found in the PD‐L1‐negative group (< 1%) compared with the PD‐L1 50% or higher group (42% vs. 11%, p 2 FIGURE 2 TMB across PD‐L1 expression subgroups. 3.3 Co‐Occurring Mutations  TP53 CDKN2A/B KRAS EGFR FLT1 KEAP1 KMT2D SMARCA4 STK11 AKT3 EGFR TP53 ARID1A NF1 RB1 18 CDKN2A/B STK11 p KEAP1 p SPEN p MTAP p KRAS FLT1 p APC p KEAP1 STK11 KRAS‐KEAP1‐STK11 KRAS‐STK11‐KEAP1 19 3.4  ESCAT We classified the clinically actionable gene alterations using the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets (ESCAT) [ 15 3 FIGURE 3 Genetic mutations identified throughout the cohort linked with matched therapies.

TMB‐H is classified as an ESCAT level I alteration found in 30 patients (31%) within the cohort, ten of whom also had a level I gene alteration. In total, 63 patients (66%) had ESCAT level I or II genomic alterations. 3.5 Association of Clinical Characteristics on Genomic Alterations Never‐smokers were more likely than ever‐smokers to harbour ESCAT level I EGFR alterations (37% vs. 8%, p p p p p 3 TABLE 3 Actionable ESCAT level I/II alterations in ever‐smokers and never‐smokers.

CGP was intended for patients with advanced‐stage NSCLC, and the cohort included only four patients presenting with early‐stage disease. Consequently, the CGP findings predominantly reflect advanced‐stage NSCLC. Clinically actionable genetic alterations were identified in 45% of patients more frequently in never‐smokers (63% vs. 41%). However, only 33% of eligible patients received targeted therapy, largely due to lack of reimbursement. Significant inequities exist in access to cancer treatments across European countries [ 20 21 The most frequent actionable gene alteration in our cohort was KRAS Gly12Cys (17 patients), but none received targeted therapy due to non‐reimbursement. This alteration is more common in smokers [ 22 p p EML4‐ALK fusions were detected in four patients, two of whom died before receiving the F1CDx results, illustrating the aggressive nature of the disease and emphasising the importance of timely detection, given the availability of effective therapies. Other actionable fusions included SDC4‐ROS1 and KIF5B‐RET, each identified in one patient, both of whom were never‐smokers. These patients received targeted therapy for their alteration. The Finnish population exhibits genetic differences compared to other European populations, and there is limited data on the mutational landscape of Finnish NSCLC patients [ 9 23 24 25 9 16 The CHEK2 Ile157Thr germline mutation has been linked to an increased risk of breast, colon, kidney, prostate, and thyroid cancers [ 26 24 27 28 Additional genomic differences were observed when comparing our cohort with the MSKCC advanced NSCLC cohort [ 16 PIK3CA PIK3CA 29 28 Our cohort exhibited lower frequencies of EGFR (19% vs. 34%) and MET (6% vs. 13%) alterations compared to the MSKCC cohort [ 15 The most common co‐occurring alteration was TP53, observed in 83% of EGFR‐mutated tumours. TP53 mutations have been recognised as a negative predictive marker in patients receiving TKI treatment [ 30 18 Tumour mutational burden (TMB) serves as a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, as a high TMB increases the likelihood of a greater number of immunogenic neoantigens [ 31 32 33 30 33 Lung cancers across all PD‐L1 expression levels may respond to ICIs, highlighting the need for additional biomarkers to predict immunotherapy efficacy [ 34 35 p 36 Samples for NGS analysis were obtained from the most accessible site, with 54 (56%) taken from the primary tumour and 39 (41%) from metastatic sites. In addition, three liquid biopsy samples were collected from peripheral blood when tissue samples were inadequate or not available. Primary tumour samples were more often histological (69%), whereas samples from metastatic sites were more frequently cytological (68%), most commonly EBUS‐TBNA from metastatic lymph nodes. This reflects real‐world practice and the challenges of obtaining representative samples in NSCLC. No significant differences in tumour cell fraction were observed between biopsies, cytology specimens, or resection samples. A lower tumour cell fraction mainly reduces the sensitivity for detecting copy number alterations. No significant differences in genomic alterations were identified with respect to sample type or site of sampling. This study has certain limitations, primarily its retrospective design and the relatively small patient cohort. In a real‐world setting, the samples obtained for NGS analysis were small in the majority of patients. Samples were taken from the primary tumour, a metastatic site, or a liquid biopsy from peripheral blood. While this could potentially influence the genomic findings, no such effect was observed in our study. Nevertheless, this study highlights the substantial practical relevance and real‐world impact of CGP on patient treatment. The cohort encompasses all patients from a single centre with advanced NSCLC, excluding those with squamous cell lung cancer and a substantial smoking history, who were considered eligible for cancer therapy over a period of more than one year. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report comprehensive genomic profiling in advanced‐stage NSCLC, providing valuable insights that significantly expand the limited data available on the Finnish population. 5 Conclusions Comprehensive genomic profiling offers extensive information that can guide treatment decisions in NSCLC. In our cohort, 63% of never‐smokers and 41% of ever‐smokers were found to harbour ESCAT level I/II gene alterations eligible for EMA/FDA‐approved targeted therapies. CGP also provides insights into co‐occurring alterations that may influence treatment outcomes. Additionally, the tumour mutational burden (TMB) derived from CGP panels, alongside certain genomic profiles combined with PD‐L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC), can better predict the efficacy of immunotherapy, potentially helping to avoid ineffective treatments associated with adverse outcomes. Therefore, CGP has a significant impact on treatment strategies for the majority of NSCLC patients. However, in real‐world clinical practice, there are limitations to the practical application of this information, as optimal treatments may not always be accessible. A significant prevalence of the CHEK2 Ile157Thr mutation in Finnish NSCLC patients suggests a previously unreported association. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and assess their implications for cancer susceptibility assessment.
