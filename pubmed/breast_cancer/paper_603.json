Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a central transcriptional orchestrator of inflammation, immune modulation, and tumor progression. Beyond canonical signal transduction, the immunological functions of NF-κB are intricately governed by a spectrum of post-translational modifications (PTMs)—including phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and methylation—that fine-tune its activation, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcriptional specificity. In this Review, we explore how these context-dependent PTMs dynamically shape NF-κB’s role in cancer immunity: promoting macrophage polarization, controlling antigen presentation by dendritic cells, regulating T cell exhaustion, and sustaining immunosuppressive networks within the tumor microenvironment. We further delineate how PTM-mediated NF-κB signaling interfaces with immune checkpoint expression—particularly PD-L1 and IDO1—and fuels resistance to immunotherapies. Emerging pharmacological strategies targeting NF-κB-modifying enzymes or degradation via PROTACs hold promise to reprogram the immune landscape. By integrating mechanistic insight with translational potential, we position NF-κB’s post-translational regulation as a fertile axis for next-generation immunotherapeutic innovation.

We propose that decoding the PTM architecture of NF-κB will be pivotal for refining immune checkpoint blockade, overcoming resistance, and designing next-generation immunomodulators. 2 PTMs in the NF-κB signaling pathway 2.1 Phosphorylation RelA can be phosphorylated both in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, phosphorylation at S276 enhances NF-κB transcriptional activity and promotes NF-κB–dependent expression of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 ( 10 11 2.2 Acetylation Acetylation is another important post-translational modification of RelA, primarily occurring in the nucleus, and it plays multiple regulatory roles in NF-κB activity. For example, acetylation at lysine K221 enhances the DNA-binding ability of NF-κB ( 12 13 2.3 Ubiquitination Ubiquitination of NF-κB is also an important mechanism for regulating its activity. SOCS1, an E3 ligase for the RelA subunit, binds to RelA and mediates its ubiquitination, thereby inhibiting NF-κB activity. Ubiquitination mediated by PDLIM2 can also impact RelA function ( 14 15 2.4 SUMOylation SUMOylation is a post-translational modification involving the covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) to lysine residues on target proteins. Studies have shown that, in macrophages, TRIM60-mediated SUMOylation of TAB2 at K329 and/or K562 suppresses downstream NF-κB activation, leading to reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and attenuated TLR-mediated innate immune responses in vivo 16  Table 1 Table 1 Overview of NF-κB-associated PTMs and their roles in tumor immunity. Modification Tumours Effect Reference Phosphorylation PDAC inhibition of the translocation of NF-κB ( 11 Acetylation PDAC suppression the transcriptional activity of NF-κB ( 13 Ubiquitination HCC tumor immune evasion ( 15 SUMOylation / attenuated innate immune responses ( 16 3 PTM-governed NF-κB signaling in the tumor microenvironment The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a dynamic and immunologically active niche that not only responds to but actively shapes tumor evolution, immune escape, and resistance to therapy. Comprised of neoplastic cells, infiltrating immune subsets, stromal fibroblasts, vascular elements, and a plethora of soluble factors, the TME is continually reprogrammed through signaling cascades—chief among them, NF-κB. While extensively studied for its canonical role in sustaining tumor cell survival and proliferation, NF-κB also serves as a central modulator of immune dynamics within the TME ( 17 Recent studies highlight that the immunoregulatory potential of NF-κB is not solely dictated by pathway activation, but rather by the combinatorial effects of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that modulate its stability, transcriptional specificity, and co-factor recruitment. Phosphorylation of p65 at Ser276 enhances its interaction with CBP/p300, promoting pro-inflammatory gene transcription; conversely, acetylation at Lys122 or Lys123 represses DNA binding and nuclear retention, limiting NF-κB activity ( 18 19 NF-κB-driven transcription of TNF-α and IL-6 exemplifies its dualistic immunological functions. TNF-α may promote cytotoxic T cell recruitment or paradoxically support tumor survival via NF-κB-dependent feedback loops, depending on the cellular context and PTM patterning of NF-κB subunits ( 20 21 22 23 24 26 27 28 At the cellular level, NF-κB’s impact is cell-type specific and PTM-dependent. In TAMs, NF-κB signaling—modulated by methylation of RelA—can skew polarization toward an M2-like phenotype that supports angiogenesis and immune tolerance, although certain phosphorylation events promote M1-like, pro-inflammatory programs under stress conditions ( 29 30 31 Thus, NF-κB functions as a molecular fulcrum balancing anti-tumor immunity and immune evasion. Its functional output is not binary, but dictated by a dynamic PTM code that integrates environmental cues within the TME. Dissecting this PTM-governed signaling landscape offers a refined framework for designing precision immunotherapies that aim to selectively reprogram the immune milieu toward sustained tumor control. 4 PTM-regulated NF-κB signaling in immune cell subsets across cancers 4.1 Macrophage polarization Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) display remarkable plasticity, shifting between pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes depending on environmental and molecular cues. NF-κB is a central determinant of this polarization, yet its activity is governed by distinct post-translational modifications (PTMs) that dictate transcriptional outcomes. Upon stimulation by LPS or IFN-γ, NF-κB subunits undergo phosphorylation (e.g., p65 Ser536) and acetylation that favor M1-associated gene expression, promoting the secretion of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and sustaining antitumor inflammation ( 32 33 34 35 NF-κB-driven polarization varies across cancer types. In oral squamous cell carcinoma, NF-κB activation enhances M1 macrophage responses ( 36 37 39 40 45 4.2 Dendritic cells and antigen presentation Dendritic cells (DCs) are pivotal in orchestrating antitumor T cell responses. Canonical NF-κB activation via MyD88 and TLRs promotes DC maturation by enhancing expression of CD80, CD86, and cytokines like IL-12. Specific PTMs—such as p65 phosphorylation or methylation—amplify DC immunostimulatory capacity by upregulating MHC-I and MHC-II presentation pathways ( 46 49 + + Functionally, cDC1s excel at cross-presenting tumor antigens on MHC-I to CD8 + 50 + 51 53 4.3 T cell subset regulation For CD8 + + 54 57 + 58 61 62 + 63 + + 64 68 4.4 Immune cell infiltration across cancers The influence of NF-κB signaling on immune cell infiltration is highly context dependent. In cervical and renal cancers, NF-κB promotes Treg accumulation and correlates with poor prognosis ( 61 69 + 70  Figure 1 23 Figure 1 PTM-Encoded Divergence of NF-κB Signaling in T Cell Infiltration Across Cancer Types: Schematic illustration depicting the context-dependent effects of post-translationally modified NF-κB signaling on immune cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment. In cervical and renal cancers, specific NF-κB PTM patterns enhance Treg recruitment, reinforcing an immunosuppressive milieu. In melanoma, aberrant PTM-driven NF-κB activity suppresses CD8 + In cervical and renal cancers, specific NF-κB PTM patterns enhance Treg recruitment, reinforcing an immunosuppressive milieu. In melanoma, aberrant PTM-driven NF-κB activity suppresses CD8⁺ T cell and NK cell infiltration, facilitating immune evasion. Conversely, in lung cancer, PTMs that favor pro-inflammatory NF-κB outputs lead to upregulation of chemokines such as CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10, promoting effector T cell infiltration and antitumor immunity. 5 PTM-orchestrated NF-κB control of immune checkpoint networks 5.1 PD-1/PD-L1 Axis The PD-1/PD-L1 axis represents a cornerstone of immune checkpoint regulation, where PD-L1 expression on tumor and immune cells suppresses T cell–mediated cytotoxicity. PD-1 functions to suppress autoimmunity. Cancer cells express PD-L1, which binds to PD-1 on the surface of T cells, thereby inhibiting T cell activation and leading to cancer immune evasion. This mechanism has been confirmed in various malignancies, including lung cancer, melanoma, glioma, and breast cancer ( 71 72 75 In parallel, NF-κB indirectly upregulates PD-L1 by inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6, and IFN-γ, which activate JAK/STAT pathways that synergize with NF-κB signaling. For instance, TNFR-mediated NF-κB activation in breast, ovarian, lung, and pancreatic tumors promotes robust PD-L1 expression ( 13 76 78 PD-L1 expression not only suppresses CTL function by inhibiting IFN-γ and TNF-α production, but also contributes to T cell exhaustion and impaired proliferation. Moreover, NF-κB-mediated PD-L1 upregulation facilitates M2 macrophage polarization and Treg recruitment, reinforcing immune evasion ( 79  Figure 2 Figure 2 PTM-Tuned Mechanisms of NF-κB-Mediated PD-L1 Upregulation Across Cancers: Schematic illustration summarizing how PTM-activated NF-κB directly binds κB elements in the PD-L1 promoter and indirectly enhances PD-L1 expression via cytokine induction (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ). These transcriptional and paracrine mechanisms converge to promote immune evasion and therapy resistance in NSCLC, gastric, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and liver cancers.

These transcriptional and paracrine mechanisms converge to promote immune evasion and therapy resistance in NSCLC, gastric, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and liver cancers. 5.2 CTLA-4 CTLA-4 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on activated T cells and constitutively on Tregs. While NF-κB does not directly bind the CTLA-4 promoter, it regulates CTLA-4 expression indirectly through the induction of Foxp3—the transcription factor essential for Treg lineage commitment. PTM-driven NF-κB signaling, particularly c-Rel phosphorylation and nuclear acetylation, enhances Foxp3 transcription, stabilizing the suppressive phenotype of Tregs and promoting CTLA-4 surface expression ( 80 84 85 5.3 LAG-3 LAG-3 is expressed on exhausted T cells and Tregs, contributing to T cell inhibition upon engagement with MHC-II. Though direct transcriptional control by NF-κB remains poorly defined, PTM-enhanced NF-κB signaling induces cytokines such as IL-10, IL-27, and IL-12, which indirectly promote LAG-3 upregulation and functionality ( 86 87 5.4 IDO1 IDO1 metabolizes tryptophan into kynurenine, leading to T cell anergy and immunosuppression. Its expression is transcriptionally controlled by the noncanonical NF-κB pathway via p52/RelB complexes. PTMs such as NIK ubiquitination and RelB methylation enhance nuclear translocation and IDO1 promoter binding ( 88 90 91 92 Together, these findings underscore the multilayered control exerted by NF-κB—both direct and cytokine-driven—over a spectrum of immune checkpoints. While PD-L1 and IDO1 are under direct transcriptional regulation by PTM-sensitive NF-κB complexes, CTLA-4 and LAG-3 are governed indirectly via modulation of Tregs and cytokine circuits (  Table 2 Table 2 Overview of immune checkpoint molecules regulated by PTM-governed NF-κB signaling in the tumor microenvironment.

Current therapeutic strategies include IKK inhibitors, direct NF-κB inhibitors, and next-generation proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs)—each shaped by distinct mechanisms of action and unique clinical challenges. IKK inhibitors, such as BAY 11-7082, suppress canonical NF-κB activation by preventing IκBα phosphorylation ( 93 Direct NF-κB inhibitors, including Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), covalently inhibit p65/p50 nuclear translocation ( 94 95 PROTACs represent a transformative approach by harnessing the ubiquitin-proteasome system to degrade target proteins. PROTAC molecules link a ligand for the protein of interest (e.g., NF-κB subunits, IKKβ, PD-L1) with a ligand for an E3 ubiquitin ligase (e.g., VHL, CRBN, MDM2) ( 96 99  Table 3 Table 3 Overview of NF-κB inhibitors and their therapeutic applications in cancer.

First, toxicity and immunosuppression pose major concerns. Systemic inhibition of NF-κB—particularly when indiscriminately targeting canonical components like IKKβ—can compromise host immunity and increase susceptibility to infection, given the pathway’s indispensable role in physiological immune responses. Fine-tuning NF-κB activity via modulation of specific PTMs (e.g., acetylation, SUMOylation) may offer a more selective approach to preserve immunological homeostasis. Second, target specificity remains elusive. NF-κB’s ubiquitous expression across normal and malignant tissues complicates efforts to develop tumor-selective inhibitors. A promising direction involves targeting tumor-specific PTM signatures of NF-κB subunits—such as context-specific acetylation or methylation patterns—that distinguish oncogenic NF-κB activity from its physiological roles. Third, therapeutic resistance frequently arises through compensatory signaling networks (e.g., PI3K-Akt, STAT3) or reprogramming of NF-κB PTM states that bypass inhibitor blockade. Rational combination strategies—such as co-targeting PTM-modifying enzymes (e.g., HDACs, methyltransferases) alongside immune checkpoints—may overcome adaptive resistance. Finally, delivery challenges—especially for large molecules like PROTACs or targeted epigenetic inhibitors—limit tissue penetration and bioavailability. Nanoparticle- or antibody-based delivery systems tailored to tumor-specific NF-κB PTM profiles may enhance pharmacokinetic properties while reducing off-target effects. Future therapeutic paradigms must therefore shift from global NF-κB inhibition toward precision rewiring of PTM-defined NF-κB circuits, enabling selective dismantling of tumor-promoting signals while preserving host immunity. 6.2 Leveraging PTM-regulated NF-κB for pan-cancer immunotherapy 6.2.1 NF-κB Activity Scoring as a Predictive Biomarker With the growing emphasis on personalized immunotherapy, transcriptome-based NF-κB activity scores have emerged as promising biomarkers to stratify patients and guide treatment selection. These scores, reflecting the cumulative activation of NF-κB-responsive genes, correlate with immunologically “hot” tumor microenvironments—marked by elevated IFN-γ signaling and high tumor mutational burden (TMB) ( 100 In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high NF-κB activity has been associated with favorable responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as Atezolizumab ( 100 6.2.2 NF-κB as a therapeutic target to overcome immunotherapy resistance Persistent NF-κB activation represents a critical barrier to durable immunotherapy responses, as it sustains immune checkpoint expression, promotes immune suppressive cell infiltration, and drives epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Importantly, several recent studies have demonstrated that targeting NF-κB—particularly its PTM-defined functional states—can reverse resistance and re-sensitize tumors to ICIs: BMS-345541, an IKKβ inhibitor, suppresses IFN-γ–induced PD-L1 expression, restoring T cell responsiveness ( 101 102 103 11 15 11 13  Table 4 Table 4 Overview of the impact of targeting PTM-related NF-κB on cancer immunotherapy. Tumours Mechanism Effect Reference HCC Inhibiting ubiquitination of NF-κB promotes PD-L1 expression and immune escape ( 15 PDAC NF-κB phosphorylation restoring sensitivity to anti–PD-L1 therapy ( 11 PDAC deacetylation improving anti–PD-1 therapy ( 13 7 Conclusions and future directions NF-κB stands at the nexus of inflammation and immunity, orchestrating the transcriptional programs that shape tumor–immune interactions across malignancies. As a central regulator of both innate and adaptive responses, NF-κB controls cytokine networks, immune cell polarization, antigen presentation, and immune checkpoint expression—collectively sculpting the immunological tone of the TME. Yet, these functions are not uniform; rather, they are profoundly context-dependent and post-translationally encoded. Emerging evidence reveals that the biological fate of NF-κB is largely dictated by PTMs—including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation—which modulate its activation threshold, subcellular localization, DNA-binding specificity, and crosstalk with co-factors. This PTM-defined plasticity explains the divergent immunological outcomes of NF-κB activation across different tumor types and microenvironmental contexts. Moving forward, mapping the PTM landscape of NF-κB in cancer will be essential to design selective and tumor-specific intervention strategies. From a translational perspective, PTM-informed NF-κB inhibition offers several therapeutic opportunities: 1) In inflammation-driven cancers such as colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer, targeting PTM-mediated NF-κB hyperactivation may suppress immune evasion and prevent malignant transformation. 2) In checkpoint-resistant tumors (e.g., prostate, glioblastoma, TNBC), PTM-specific inhibitors or PROTAC-based degraders may re-sensitize tumors by downregulating PD-L1, IDO1, and immunosuppressive myeloid populations. 3) In immunologically “hot” tumors with high NF-κB activity, integrating NF-κB inhibition with ICIs may amplify cytotoxic responses while mitigating immune exhaustion. Technological advances will accelerate this field. AI-guided PTM target discovery, NF-κB activity scoring, and spatial transcriptomics will aid patient stratification and drug repurposing. Moreover, organoid models, intravital imaging, and CRISPR-engineered PTM-site mutants will facilitate functional dissection of NF-κB circuits within complex TMEs. Ultimately, the future of NF-κB-targeted therapy lies not in global suppression, but in the precision rewiring of PTM-governed NF-κB axes—disrupting its pathological immunosuppressive programs while preserving physiological immunity. As depicted in  Figure 3 Figure 3 Schematic overview of NF-κB-mediated immune remodeling and translational therapeutic strategies: Upon activation by inflammatory or antigenic signals, NF-κB undergoes PTM-defined modulation to regulate key immune subsets—including TAMs, DCs, T cells, and MDSCs—and to orchestrate the expression of immune checkpoints. These effects converge to sustain an immunosuppressive microenvironment and promote tumor progression. Therapeutic strategies targeting NF-κB—ranging from selective inhibitors and PROTACs to combination regimens and computational tools such as activity scoring and AI-enabled modeling—offer promising avenues for precision immunotherapy.
