Monogastric animals are especially more sensitive to environmental and dietary stressors. Using herbal feed additives rich in natural antioxidants can help balance the redox state in the body, improving both health and production efficiency. Scutellaria baicalensis Lonicera japonica Abstract The use of antibiotics as growth promoters (AGPs) has been a common practice in animal production; however, concerns over microbial resistance have led organizations, such as the FAO, EU, and EFSA, to restrict or ban their use. This has prompted a growing interest in natural alternatives, particularly medicinal herbs, for enhancing animal performance and health. Among these, Scutellaria baicalensis Lonicera japonica S. baicalensis L. japonica oxidative stress pigs poultry herbal additives This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Animal-derived foods play a vital role in the global food supply by providing essential nutrients, such as protein, fat, minerals, vitamin A, B vitamins, and more. Therefore, enhancing the health and productivity of food animals is directly linked to improvements in human health. In recent decades, livestock have increasingly been exposed to a variety of environmental stressors, such as temperature fluctuations, poor ventilation, and inadequate lighting, as well as nutritional challenges like oxidized fats, mycotoxins, and heavy metals. Among all body systems, the intestinal tract stands at the forefront of these challenges. It serves not only as the primary site for nutrient digestion and absorption but also as a critical barrier between the external environment and the body’s internal systems [ 1 2 3 4 5 Plant-derived feed additives typically include herbs, spices, and natural flavoring agents, either in whole form or as concentrated extracts. Compared to conventional antibiotics as growth promoters (AGP), including penicillin, bacitrasin, tetracyclines, tilmicosin, and tylosin [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 Scutellaria baicalensis L. japonica 12 13 14 15 Scutellaria baicalensis Lonicera japonica) 2. Oxidative Stress: Definition and Mechanism The term “oxidative stress” refers to a condition in which the physiological balance between pro-oxidants and antioxidants is disrupted in favor of pro-oxidants, leading to molecular and subsequent cellular damage caused by oxidation [ 16 Figure 1 2 − 2 2 1 2 17 16 18 19 3. Oxidative Stress: Causes and Influencing Factors in Monogastric Animals Thermal stress, encompassing both heat and cold challenges, poses significant risks to the health, productivity, and overall welfare of poultry and swine ( Table 1 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 Cold stress (CS) is a significant environmental stressor that negatively impacts the growth, health, and welfare of both poultry and swine. Young animals in both species are particularly susceptible due to their limited ability to regulate body temperature. In neonatal broiler chickens, immature thermogenic organs hinder effective thermoregulation during early post-hatch development, making them highly vulnerable to cold environments [ 27 28 28 29 30 31 32 24 Feed toxins are harmful substances present in animal feed, typically produced by microorganisms, such as fungi and bacteria, or introduced through contamination of feed ingredients. The primary sources of feed toxins include mycotoxins, microbial contamination, and chemical pollutants. Fungal toxins, especially those produced by molds such as aflatoxins, vomitoxin (deoxynivalenol, DON), and ochratoxins, are among the most concerning, particularly in poultry and swine production [ 33 34 Salmonella Campylobacter Clostridium perfringens Escherichia coli 35 36 37 38 39 Lipids in animal feed, particularly those high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), are highly susceptible to oxidation when exposed to high temperatures or improper storage conditions. This oxidation results in the formation of lipid peroxides, such as malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), which are key indicators of lipid peroxidation and can contribute significantly to oxidative stress (OS) in animals [ 40 41 42 In poultry, fats and oils serve not only as concentrated energy sources but also play key roles in enhancing feed digestibility, improving palatability, and supporting the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) [ 43 44 45 46 47 48 vetsci-12-00816-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Causes and influencing factors of OS in monogastric animals.

Effectiveness of Scutellaria baicalensis Lonicera japonica The use of herbal extracts as feed additives in poultry has gained increasing attention due to their reported benefits in enhancing growth performance and health status. These benefits are largely attributed to their antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial properties [ 83 Scutellaria baicalensis Lonicera japonica 83 Table 2 84 S. baicalensis 85 S. baicalensis S. baicalensis 86 The gastrointestinal tract plays a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis and serves as the primary defense barrier against pathogens [ 87 88 89 90 L. japonica 25 S. baicalensis L. japonica 91 85 92 In terms of gut microbiota modulation, baicalin supplementation has been reported to enhance populations of beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus Bifidobacterium E. coli Salmonella 93 94 L. japonica S. baicalensis Salmonella pullorum 95 S. baicalensis L. japonica Herbal extract mixtures (HEMs) are gaining traction as viable and sustainable alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters in livestock production, largely due to their multifunctional bioactive properties.
