Major challenges are discussed, such as data sparsity, lack of interpretability, limited generalizability, and integration into experimental workflows. We also address ethical and regulatory considerations surrounding model transparency, fairness, and reproducibility. Looking forward, we explore promising directions such as generative modeling, federated learning, and patient-specific therapy design. Together, these advances point toward a future of precision polypharmacology driven by biologically informed and interpretable ML models.

Introduction In recent years, the paradigm of drug discovery has been shifting from the traditional “one drug, one target” approach toward a more holistic and systems-level strategy—multi-target drug discovery [ 1 2 3 4 Multi-target drugs are strategically designed to interact with a pre-defined set of molecular targets to achieve a synergistic therapeutic effect for complex diseases. This approach, known as rational polypharmacology, is a deliberate strategy to address the multifactorial nature of diseases [ 5 6 7 However, identifying effective multi-target drug candidates remains a major challenge. The combinatorial explosion of potential drug-target interactions (DTI), the complexity of biological networks, and the limitations of high-throughput experimental screening demand scalable, accurate, and intelligent computational solutions [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 The integration of ML into multi-target drug discovery has opened new opportunities for understanding and optimizing complex therapeutic strategies, but it has also introduced significant challenges in data representation, model generalizability, and clinical applicability [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 18 20 21 This review provides a comprehensive overview of how ML methods are applied to multi-target drug discovery, with an emphasis on their integration into systems pharmacology. We begin by outlining the biological rationale, then explore various ML techniques for feature representation, model construction, and network-based analysis. Key applications and case studies will be discussed to highlight their real-world implications. Finally, we address current challenges and propose future directions to guide research at the intersection of AI and multi-target pharmacology. The organizational framework is presented in Figure 1 2. Fundamentals of Multi-Target Drug Discovery Traditional drug discovery often follows a ‘one-drug, one-target’ paradigm, but this approach has limitations when addressing complex diseases. The evolution from this classical view to a systems pharmacology perspective is illustrated in Figure 2 The traditional paradigm of drug discovery has long focused on developing selective agents that modulate a single target associated with a specific disease [ 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Despite the appeal of multi-target drug discovery, conventional experimental methods face significant limitations [ 23 26 32 33 3. Machine Learning Techniques for Multi-Target Prediction The complex and nonlinear nature of multi-target drug discovery requires computational methods that can efficiently model interactions across diverse chemical and biological spaces. ML has become a powerful approach to address these challenges, offering the flexibility to integrate heterogeneous data, learn hidden patterns, and make predictions at scale [ 34 Figure 3 3.1. Data Sources and Feature Representations Effective ML for multi-target drug discovery relies heavily on rich, well-structured data representations derived from diverse biological and chemical domains [ 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 Table 1 44 3.2. Classical Machine Learning Models Classical ML algorithms have laid the groundwork for multi-target drug discovery by offering scalable and interpretable tools for prediction. SVMs and RFs are widely adopted due to their strong performance in high-dimensional settings and robustness to overfitting [ 46 47 48 49 3.3. Deep Learning and Representation Learning DL approaches have significantly advanced the capabilities of multi-target drug prediction by enabling automatic feature extraction and modeling of complex nonlinearities [ 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the paradigm of multi-target drug discovery by shifting from a traditional ‘screen-and-select’ approach to a ‘design-and-generate’ one. These models, trained on vast datasets of chemical structures and their associated biological activities, can learn the underlying chemical and pharmacological rules to create entirely novel molecules from scratch, a process known as de novo design [ 14 67 68 69 70 71 72 In summary, each of the discussed approaches offers distinct trade-offs in multi-target drug discovery. Classical ML models ( Section 3.2 73 Section 3.3 74 Section 3.4 5 3.4. Network-Based and Systems Pharmacology Approaches ML in systems pharmacology often leverages the structure of biological networks to contextualize DTI [ 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 78 A key trend is to integrate factors beyond direct drug-target binding, such as pharmacokinetics and the influence of the gut microbiota (GM). A recent study using an animal model showed that the GM can significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs, thereby affecting their efficacy and potential for drug interactions [ 84 The ability of knowledge graphs to encode vast, heterogeneous biomedical data makes them particularly powerful for novel target discovery and drug repurposing, which are essential facets of multi-target therapy. Recent advancements have led to the development of sophisticated graph foundation models that perform zero-shot drug repurposing, identifying therapeutic candidates for diseases with limited or no existing treatments. A prime example is TxGNN, a graph neural network model trained on a comprehensive medical knowledge graph [ 85 86 4. Applications and Case Studies ML-based strategies for multi-target drug discovery have transitioned from theoretical frameworks to practical applications across a wide spectrum of therapeutic areas. These applications demonstrate the feasibility of ML techniques and highlight their capacity to uncover novel DTI, optimize combination therapies, and accelerate drug repurposing. This section presents representative case studies that illustrate how ML is being applied to real-world drug discovery challenges in oncology, neurodegenerative diseases, infectious diseases, and personalized therapy. As shown in Figure 4 4.1. Oncology: Targeting Redundant and Synergistic Pathways As highlighted in Figure 4 87 88 Table 2 89 90 91 92 93 94 4.2. Neurodegenerative Diseases: Tackling Multifactorial Pathogenesis Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease (AD and PD) involve multiple pathogenic processes, including protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation [ 118 Table 3 119 120 121 121 122 123 124 125 126 Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) presents a growing public health crisis, where multi-target therapies offer a way to prevent rapid resistance evolution [ 23 Table 4 131 132 133 134 135 One of the most promising applications of ML in multi-target discovery lies in drug repurposing and personalized therapy [ 87 156 23 157 158 159 160 161 162 5. Challenges and Future Perspectives Despite the promising potential of ML in multi-target drug discovery, significant challenges remain. A primary obstacle is the lack of high-quality, large-scale datasets, which are often sparse, heterogeneous, and imbalanced, leading to issues like overfitting and poor generalizability [ 163 164 165 72 166 73 The future of multi-target drug discovery will likely be shaped by synergistic advances that address current limitations. Key areas include developing standardized, high-quality datasets and more interpretable ML models to provide clearer biological insights [ 74 167 168 169 6. Conclusions The integration of machine learning into multi-target drug discovery is a transformative shift in pharmacology, moving beyond traditional single-target methods to better address complex diseases like cancer and neurodegeneration. This approach leverages powerful techniques such as deep learning and graph neural networks to enable high-throughput analysis and predictive modeling. While promising applications in cancer therapy and drug repurposing have been demonstrated, significant challenges remain, including data sparsity and a lack of model interpretability. The future of this field depends on advances in data integration, transfer learning, and interdisciplinary collaboration, with generative AI and patient-level omics data poised to further enhance the development of safer, more personalized therapeutic interventions.
