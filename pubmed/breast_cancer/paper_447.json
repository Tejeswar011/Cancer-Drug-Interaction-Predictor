Elevated solid stress compresses intratumoral blood vessels, leading to hypoperfusion, and hypoxia, which impair oxygen and drug delivery. These conditions hinder the efficacy of drugs and promote tumor progression and treatment resistance compromising therapeutic outcomes. To enhance treatment efficacy, mechanotherapeutics and ultrasound sonopermeation have been developed to improve tumor perfusion and drug delivery. Mechanotherapy aims to reduce tumor stiffness and mechanical stress within tumors to normal levels leading to decompression of vessels while simultaneously improving perfusion. On the other hand, ultrasound sonopermeation strategy focuses on increasing non-invasively and transiently tumor vessel wall permeability to boost perfusion and thus, improve drug delivery. Within this framework and aiming to replicate published experimental data in silico, we developed a mathematical model designed to derive optimal conditions for the combined use of mechanotherapeutics and sonopermeation, with the goal of optimizing efficacy of nano-immunotherapy. The model incorporates complex interactions among diverse components that are crucial in the multifaceted process of tumor progression. These components encompass a variety of cell populations in tumor, such as tumor cells and immune cells, as well as components of the tumor vasculature including endothelial cells, angiopoietins, and the vascular endothelial growth factor. Seeking initial model verification, we carried out validation of model predictions with published experimental data, wherein a strong correlation was observed between the model predictions and the actual experimental measurements of critical parameters, which are essential to reinforce the overall accuracy of the mathematical framework employed. In addition, a parametric analysis was performed with primary objective to investigate the impact of various critical parameters that influence sonopermeation. Model predictions showed maximal drug delivery and tumor volume reduction at an acoustic pressure range of 0.24–0.27 MPa and mechanical index of 0.17, consistent with values used in clinical trials following sonopermeation treatment. The analysis provided optimal guidelines for the use of sonopermeation in conjunction with mechanotherapy, that contribute to identify optimal conditions for sonopermeation. Author summary Solid tumors consist not only of malignant cells but also of stromal cells and an extracellular matrix, collectively shaping a complex tumor microenvironment. In tumors with significant fibrosis, excessive extracellular matrix accumulation—primarily collagen and hyaluronan—results in increased rigidity and mechanical solid stress accumulation. This stress can compress blood vessels, leading to reduced blood flow (hypoperfusion) and oxygen deprivation (hypoxia), which in turn impede drug delivery and fuel tumor progression. Mechanotherapeutic approaches focus on alleviating tumor stiffness and solid stress by targeting extracellular matrix components or Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts, ultimately relieving vessel compression and enhancing perfusion. Ultrasound sonopermeation, a technique combining ultrasound waves with microbubbles, has been explored to temporarily increase vascular permeability and alleviate intratumoral solid stress, thereby facilitating drug penetration. Recent experimental studies indicate that integrating mechanotherapy with sonopermeation may yield synergistic benefits, further enhancing treatment effectiveness. Here, we developed a mathematical model to optimize these combined therapeutic strategies by incorporating crucial tumor microenvironmental dynamics. The model provides results for the most effective treatment conditions, aligning closely with experimental and clinical findings. Additionally, we performed a parametric analysis to determine the optimal values of ultrasound frequency and mechanical index required for sonopermeation to maximize drug delivery and improve the overall efficacy of cancer therapy. http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663 H2020 European Research Council 101141357 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3093-1696 Stylianopoulos Triantafyllos http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663 H2020 European Research Council 101076425 https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7125-4062 Mpekris Fotios European Union Cohesion Policy Programme “THALIA 2021-2027” https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3093-1696 Stylianopoulos Triantafyllos This project received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe research and innovation programme (grant agreement nos. 101141357 to TS and 101076425 to FM).

Introduction Solid tumors are complex biological entities that are composed not solely of malignant cellular populations but also include various additional components, such as stromal cells and extracellular matrix (ECM), which collectively form the tumor microenvironment (TME) [ 1 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 13 14 16 A therapeutic strategy aimed at decompressing vessels while simultaneously enhancing the perfusion levels within tumor tissues involves the application of mechanotherapeutics, which are intended to reduce tumor stiffness and the mechanical forces within tumors to normal levels [ 17 18 26 20 27 6 28 29 23 12 23 30 16 23 26 31 32 Ultrasound sonopermeation is a method to enhance drug delivery in solid tumors that utilizes ultrasound in combination with microbubbles. Sonopermeation can enhance transiently the permeability of vessel walls, thereby improving the delivery of therapeutic agents. This method has shown promise in overcoming biological barriers and improving drug delivery to tumors [ 33 34 35 37 38 39 34 40 44 6 Up to now, there has been limited research on mathematical modeling related to sonopermeation and drug delivery for the treatment of solid tumors. Few mathematical models have been formulated to investigate the impact of microbubbles within blood vessels [ 45 46 47 47 49 27 50 53 2. Materials and methods I 2.1. Description of the mathematical model Tumor progression within the host tissue is formulated in a continuum mechanics framework using the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient tensor. The model is deterministic, and we solve the quasi-static linear momentum balance to obtain the tumor’s equilibrium configuration at each time point [ 27 50 55 S1 Text Fig 1 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012676.g001 Fig 1 Schematic representation of the components of the mathematical model and their interrelations. The model incorporates diverse populations of cells (illustrated as yellow boxes), tumor angiogenic factors (illustrated as blue boxes), and various therapeutic modalities, each exerting distinct influences within the Tumor Microenvironment (illustrated as pink boxes). This detailed illustration explains the interactions amongst each individual model component, as well as the various potential combinations of these model components, thereby revealing the effects that these interactions have on functional vascular density/perfusion, and oxygenation levels within the examined system. These effects may be classified as positive, negative, or even positive under conditions. The model accounts for the intricate interactions among various components ( Fig 1 52 + + 56 Sonopermeation facilitates an increase in the vessel wall pore size, thereby enhancing vascular permeability, which might augment functional vascular density [ 38 6 28 6 28 29 An improvement in functional vascular density enhances the efficacy of nano-immunotherapy, which consequently leads to a more effective suppression of non-stem-like cancer cells, stem-like cancer cells and induced cancer cells [ 6 57 58 19 50 + + 59 + 60 51 61 62 However, rapid tumor-cell proliferation can counteract these benefits by re-establishing mechanical and immunological barriers. The proliferation of tumor cells leads to significant compression of the surrounding vasculature, which in turn results in a decrease in perfusion and a consequent inactivation of immune cells within the TME [ 11 63 64 65 Regarding the tumor vascular components: The process of angiogenesis, which is a fundamental mechanism crucial for the formation of new blood vessels, is triggered through the proliferation of endothelial cells that form the vessels, thereby augmenting the overall perfusion [ 52 66 67 68 2.2. Transport of drugs 2.2.1. Transport of nanotherapy. We postulated that the delivery of nanotherapy exists in three separate states: the nanoparticle carrier containing the chemotherapy (c n f int 69 70 ∂ c n ∂ t + ∇ · ( c n v f ) = D n ∇ 2 c n + Q s t a − k e l c n \\] (1) ∂ c f ∂ t + ∇ · ( c f v f ) = D f ∇ 2 c f + α k e l c n − k i n t c f \\] (2) ∂ c i n t ∂ t + ∇ · ( c i n t v s ) = k i n t c f − k deg c i n t \\] (3) where D n f el int deg f s f s S1 Text 71 sta Eq.

(5) Equation (4) 3. Materials and methods II 3.1. Modeling the effects of mechanotherapeutic ketotifen Within the framework of this mathematical model, the incorporation of the mechanotherapeutic ketotifen has been integrated to facilitate the alleviation of stress within solid tumors, thereby leading to a consequential enhancement in the overall efficacy of nano-immunotherapy [ 6 6 28 29 20 More specifically, upon the administration of ketotifen, there is a linear decrease in both the shear modulus and the bulk modulus within the tumor tissue in half, which can be quantitatively assessed in relation to the baseline values of these mechanical parameters prior to treatment [ 28 k th μ k S1 Table 3.2. Incorporation of sonopermeation Regarding the phenomenon of sonopermeation, the effect of acoustic pressure on vessel wall pores size has been added in the mathematical model. The process of sonopermeation is known to induce an increase in the size of the pores within the vessel wall, thereby augmenting vascular permeability, which in turn leads to a significant improvement in the functional density of the vascular network. Specifically, it has been demonstrated that sonopermeation possesses the capability to enlarge cell pores, with average dimensions that can vary significantly from 100 nanometers to 1.25 micrometers, and it is noteworthy that the generation of larger sonopermeation pores is positively correlated with an increase in acoustic pressure or an extension of treatment duration of the sonopermeation [ 73 r o = − 14977.9087 * p ac 2 + 8208.3947 * p a c − 69.0722 , (6) The mathematical expression outlined in Equation (6) ac o S6 Fig The integration of the acoustic pressure into our mathematical model is accomplished via the subsequent relationship: p a c = M I * f r \\] (7) The acoustic pressure, p ac 74 75 6 38 39 41 76 6 41 76 S1 Table Equations 6 7 47 48 3.3. Solution methodology To effectively model tumor growth, it is presumed that the tumor has a spherical configuration, surrounded by a normal tissue of cubic shape. The cubic host domain, which serves as the spatial environment for the tumor growth, is designed to be two orders of magnitude larger, thereby reducing any potential boundary effects that could interfere with the progression of the tumor. Due to symmetry present in the system under investigation, it is deemed sufficient to consider only one eighth of the entire system for analysis. The clarification of the boundary conditions that have been incorporated in this study is depicted in S1 Fig The system of equations that comprise the mathematical model was solved using the commercial finite elements software COMSOL Multiphysics (COMSOL, Inc., Burlington, MA, USA), using the Solid Mechanics, Transport of Diluted Species, Convection-Diffusion Equation and Domain ODEs and DAEs Physics. The computational domain is composed of 6015 finite elements and 51628 degrees of freedom; furthermore, the time-dependent solver that is employed to derive the solutions to the equations governing this model is the PARDISO algorithm. The finite element implementation employs Lagrange shape functions with quadratic element order. The time integration is performed using the Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) within PARDISO, with a maximum time step size of 0.25 days. The time-stepping strategy is set to “Free,” allowing the solver to adaptively select time steps within this constraint. Due to the high nonlinearity of the model, the system of equations is linearized at each time step using a Newton–Raphson method, with a maximum of 4 iterations per time step and a tolerance factor of 1. 4. Results 4.1. Comparative analysis of mathematical model predictions with experimental data To evaluate the robustness of our mathematical framework and to justify the parameter values employed within the model, we conducted a validation analysis between model predictions with published experimental data [ 6 In vivo 6 The therapeutic regimen implemented through mathematical modeling was analogous to the experimental protocol utilized for MCA205 fibrosarcoma and K7M2 osteosarcoma tumors ( Figs 2A 3A 3 3 3 6 6 77 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012676.g002 Fig 2 Comparison of model predictions with experimental data of tumor growth for MCA205 fibrosarcoma tumors.

(A) (B) 2 In order to carry out a comparison between the predictions generated by the model and the experimental data, all model parameters were set to baseline values derived independently from relevant studies ( S1 Table 6 k 1 S1 Text k 1 k 1 S2 Table 78 79 2 2 k 1 The tumor volume estimations derived from mathematical modeling exhibit strong agreement with the experimental data, as monotherapies—namely control solution, ketotifen, sonopermeation, and the combination of ketotifen with sonopermeation—demonstrated no antitumor effects in terms of tumor volume reduction relative to the control group. Conversely, a notable reduction in overall tumor volume was observed for the combinatorial treatment. Our model substantiates that the combination of ketotifen and sonopermeation with nano-immunotherapy significantly improved therapeutic outcomes and particularly suppressed tumor growth ( Figs 2B 3B S3 S4 2 2 To elucidate the comparative analysis between the model and experimental data, we further compared model predictions with experimental measurements of perfused area using contrast enhanced ultrasound and drug concentration measured with fluorescence imaging and with IFP measurements [ 6 Figs 4 S5 (c int ) Fig 4 Figs 2A 3A Fig 4 Fig 4A 4C Fig 4B Fig 4D 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012676.g004 Fig 4 Comparison of model predictions in conjunction with experimental data [ 6 The horizontal axis delineates the various treatment groups that were included in the experimental investigations: control, ketotifen, sonopermeation, ketotifen-sonopermeation, Doxil-aPD1, ketotifen-Doxil-aPD1, sonopermeation-Doxil-aPD1, ketotifen-sonopermeation-Doxil-aPD1. The vertical axis (y) for each instance varies between (A) (B) (C) (D) Our mechanistic model enables us to interpret the biological processes underlying the observed changes in tumor volume, perfused area, drug concentration and IFP across different treatment groups ( Figs 2 4 Figs 2 3 Fig 4 4.2. Parametric analysis of essential variables for sonopermeation The goal of the parametric analysis is to elucidate the specific values of distinct parameters that exert the most significant influence on the phenomenon of sonopermeation and consequently, the resultant therapeutic outcomes that can be achieved through this technique. Upon the application of sonopermeation, there is a marked enhancement in the pore size, or permeability, of the vessels walls associated with tumor tissues, leading to greater drug infiltration. In order to facilitate a controlled and effective delivery of the therapeutic agent without incurring any detrimental damage to surrounding tissues, it is imperative to meticulously regulate the parameters associated with ultrasound application. In the context of sonopermeation, the ultrasound is typically applied in a pulsed manner to reduce tissue damage from excessive heating and enable microbubble inflow during pulse intervals, especially when bubble destruction is likely. The sinusoidal ultrasound wave is characterized by parameters such as velocity, wavelength, frequency, pressure amplitude, pulse length (burst duration), pulse repetition frequency (PRF), exposure time (duty cycle), treatment duration, and post-sonopermeation effects [ 34 80 82 38 81 83 89 38 90 91 In view of the previously mentioned parameters, we opted to integrate and simulate within our mathematical model the frequency employed for sonopermeation, the acoustic pressure that we correlate with the mechanical index (MI) through the Equation (7) Fig 5 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012676.g005 Fig 5 Impact of sonopermeation frequency on the following parameters: (A) pore radius (m), (B) drug concentration (mol/m 3 3 -1 The values corresponding to the various model parameters were computed at a position that is equidistantly located between the central region of the tumor and its peripheral boundaries. Grey regions depict the optimal range of frequencies. Optimal area was identified using the top-K percent criterion (i.e., k = 5%) by selecting values in the x axis (i.e., frequency) associated with values in the y axis within 95-105% of minimum tumor volume (Panel C). This frequency range was the same for the rest of the panels. In Fig 6 ac 41 76 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012676.g006 Fig 6 Impact of mechanical index of the transducer on the following parameters: (A) pore radius (m), (B) drug concentration (mol/m 3 3 -1 The values corresponding to the various model parameters were computed at a position that is equidistantly located between the central region of the tumor and its peripheral boundaries. The grey region depicts the optimal range of the mechanical index. Optimal area was identified using top-K percent criterion as described previously in the caption of Fig 5 The optimal regions presented in Figs 5 7 Fig 5C 3 3 Figs 5 6 90 91 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012676.g007 Fig 7 The influence of varying sonopermeation frequencies, in conjunction with diverse values of the mechanical index of the transducer utilized for the application of sonopermeation, on the synergistic effects of combined therapy is analyzed.

As illustrated in Fig 7 Figs 5 6 41 2 Extending the durations of the effect of sonopermeation from 24 hours to 72 hours leads to a further rise in intratumoral drug concentration (note the higher color-bar values in Fig 7H Fig 7G Fig 7E Fig 7E 7F Fig 7H Fig 7F Fig 7E 7G In Fig 8 k 1 90 91 k 1 −1 −1 k 1 -1 Fig 7 Fig 8A 8B k 1 -1 Fig 8C 8D k 1 -1 Fig 8A 8B Fig 8C 8D the Fig 7E 7F k 1 -1 k 1 41 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012676.g008 Fig 8 The impact of varying sonopermeation frequencies, in combination with different values of the mechanical index of the transducer applied for the application of sonopermeation, on the synergistic effects of the combined therapy.

Discussion In this study, we have formulated a mechanistic mathematical framework that integrates the synergistic application of mechanotherapeutics and sonopermeation, with the primary objective of realizing the highest possible efficacy of nano-immunotherapy in the treatment of cancer. The model we developed encompasses the diverse interactions that occur among various categories of cancer cells, immune cells, tumor associated macrophages, endothelial cells, tumor angiogenic factors and an array of different therapeutic modalities, each of which exerts its unique and distinct influences within the complex domain of the tumor microenvironment. Our model represents a significant advancement over prior research endeavors, as it incorporates the effects of sonopermeation alongside the mechanotherapeutic agent ketotifen, which is known for its therapeutic potential. The complexity of our model can be substantiated by the favorable alignment of the predictions generated by the mathematical model with the experimental results obtained from in vivo studies on two distinct sarcoma cell lines that exhibit varying growth rates, specifically one characterized by a rapid growth rate (the fibrosarcoma MCA205) and another that demonstrates a comparatively slower growth rate (the osteosarcoma K7M2). The experimental data we have collected provide compelling evidence that the mechano-modulation of the tumor microenvironment, achieved through the combined application of mechanotherapeutics and sonopermeation, can result in multiplicative synergistic effects that significantly enhance perfusion and improve overall therapeutic outcomes [ 6 k ₁ The parametric analysis, which examined a variety of parameters, provided optimal guidelines that are essential for the effective implementation of sonopermeation. These parameters include the mechanical index of the transducer utilized, the specific frequency at which sonopermeation is conducted, the acoustic pressure applied during the procedure, the duration over which the effect of sonopermeation is exerted and the rate of proliferation of cancer cells. More specifically, the analysis delineates a precise range of values for these critical parameters within which the efficacy of sonopermeation is markedly enhanced, thereby yielding the most favorable and effective results. Based on the parametric analysis, the optimal conditions for maximizing drug concentration and minimizing tumor volume are achieved when the frequency is set to 2.5 MHz, the mechanical index is approximately 0.17, and the corresponding acoustic pressure is calculated to be 0.27 MPa. Importantly, these optimal values are in accordance with values employed for sonopermeation in a clinical trial for patients with pancreatic cancer, highlighting the clinical relevance of the model [ 41 38 92 The manuscript reports results of a pilot project and thus, it has certain limitations especially in relation to the application of the effect of sonopermeation within the framework of our model. Sonopermeation could improve the overall efficacy of drug delivery by leveraging additional mechanisms that are not explicitly included in the current model framework. For instance, the interaction of acoustic waves and the resultant shear wave stresses, that are exerted upon endothelial cells by the action of microbubbles has been defined in accordance with prior studies [ 46 93 94 95 2 2 24 25 26 Furthermore, in our mathematical model, we do not model the propagation of ultrasound waves ignoring attenuation and scattering effects, but we employ the effects of sonopermeation on various components of the tumor microenvironment based on experimental observations. Additionally, to predict tumor growth the model does not capture the high-frequency oscillations and accelerations associated with ultrasound microsecond timescale which is a much lower timescale compared to that of tumor growth [ 47 37 96 99 6 39 77 100 101 In this study, we model the tumor tissue as a poroelastic medium [ 102 49 103 106 (k 1 ) Supporting information S1 Text Description of the mathematical model.
