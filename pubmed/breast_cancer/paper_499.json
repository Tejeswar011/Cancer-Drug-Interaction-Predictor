The murine tail is the most commonly used model to study secondary lymphedema. The murine hindlimb model offers a more clinically translatable approach but results in the literature have been inconsistent. The purpose of this study is to optimize the murine hindlimb lymphedema to achieve consistent results and assess the utility of radiation. Methods C57BL/6 mice underwent either 20-Gy irradiation of one hindlimb 7 days prior to surgery ( n n Results The average paw thickness of the operated hindlimb in irradiated mice on postoperative day (POD) 14 was 3.5 ± 0.3 cm compared to 2.1 ± 0.05 cm on the contralateral limb ( p p p p Conclusion Radiation of the murine hindlimb model results in sustained lymphedema compared to non-irradiated mice. The murine hindlimb lymphedema model is clinically more translatable than the murine tail model with consistent results.

Male and female C57BL/6 mice 9–10 weeks (21-23 g) were utilized (purchased from Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Both male and female mice used as lymphedema affects both sexes. Paw thickness and calf thickness measurements (0.7 mm from the base of the heel) were obtained using an electronic caliper. The contralateral non-irradiated hindlimb served as control. Mice either underwent 20 Gy irradiation of one hindlimb (7 days prior preop, 2 mm Al filter, 2 × 2 cm field, 250 kV, 1.30 Gy/min) (Precision X-Ray Inc., North Branford, CT) or no radiation. Following inhaled isoflurane anesthesia, a circumferential skin incision was made at the proximal hindlimb (Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Paw thickness in irradiated murine hindlimb model The murine hindlimb model consisting of ( a b c d e n f P Near-infrared laser lymphangiography was used to assess lymphatic function (Fig. 2 1 20 21 22 Fig. 2 Near-infrared laser lymphangiography and histological analysis of murine hindlimb model a-b p c d-e f-g All methods were carried out in accordance with IACUC guidelines and regulations. All methods were reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software; Boston, MA). Parametric continuous variables were compared using paired samples t p Results Eleven mice underwent 20-Gy irradiation of one hindlimb seven days prior to surgery and nine mice had no preoperative radiation. For the irradiated mice, the average paw thickness of the postsurgical hindlimb on D14 was 3.5 ± 0.3 cm compared to 2.1 ± 0.1 cm on the contralateral limb (CL) ( p 3 p p p p p p Fig. 3 Paw thickness comparison in the irradiated and nonirradiated murine hindlimb model Percent change of paw thickness in irradiated, operated paw compared to the nonirradiated, operative paw from the day of radiation to postoperative D90 On D14, the average paw thickness in mice that did not undergo radiation was 2.6 ± 0.2 cm compared to 2.1 ± 0.2 cm on the CL ( p p p p p p p 3 Discussion Secondary lymphedema is characterized by chronic limb swelling from inflammation and fibroadipose deposition from lymphatic dysfunction [ 1 6 1 6 1 1 6 15 1 6 15 19 23 28 In this study, consistent results of sustained paw thickness at 90 days postoperatively were achieved using a preoperative dose of 20 Gy radiation to the proximal hindlimb one week prior to surgery, lymphatic disruption, and popliteal lymphadenectomy compared to a non-irradiated hindlimb. Average paw thickness returned to baseline level at POD-97 in the irradiated mice. The surgical approach of lymphatic disruption varies in existing literature consisting of lymphatic vessel transection and popliteal lymphadenectomy with or without subinguinal lymph node removal with follow-up time ranging between 14 to 182 days among studies that included radiation [ 6 15 17 19 23 26 16 15 29 29 30 Our study offers clinically relevant optimization of the murine hindlimb lymphedema model, resulting in consistent and sustained limb swelling up to 90 days post-surgery. While previous studies have explored radiation-based models, our murine hindlimb model distinguishes itself by offering a simplified protocol that avoids complex surgical procedures or fractionated radiation dosing, thereby improving reproducibility and translational value [ 15 18 19 6 18 19 23 15 6 6 15 16 16 26 6 15 18 19 6 15 26 The murine hindlimb lymphedema has previously been inconsistent. Studies that have included radiation and lymphatic vessel transection with popliteal lymphadenectomy have exhibited follow-up time of 14–182 days [ 6 15 17 19 6 15 31 6 15 16 Conclusion Radiation of the murine hindlimb model results in sustained lymphedema compared to non-irradiated mice. The murine hindlimb lymphedema model is clinically more translatable than the murine tail model and includes limb lymphatic vessel disruption, popliteal lymphadenectomy, and ideally radiation for consistent results with lymphedema sustained for 90 days.
