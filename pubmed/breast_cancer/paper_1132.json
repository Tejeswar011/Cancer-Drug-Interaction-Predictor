Introduction Trauma is a leading cause of death worldwide among individuals under 40 years and remains a major health concern in both high- and low-income countries [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Sarcopenia, the age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and function [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Several studies in Western populations have demonstrated that CT-defined sarcopenia predicts poor outcomes after trauma [ 16 17 18 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Patient Selection This retrospective analysis utilized data extracted from the Korean Trauma Data Bank (KTDB). We identified 891 patients aged 65 years or older who had been admitted to a designated Level I trauma center between January 2020 and December 2021. Patients were included if they underwent abdominal CT within one week of admission. Patients without adequate L3-level CT images or relevant clinical data were excluded ( Figure 1 Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Ajou University Hospital (AJOUIRB-DB-2023-102), and the requirement for informed consent was waived due to the retrospective nature of the study. This study was conducted and reported in accordance with the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines, and the completed checklist is provided in the Supplementary Materials 2.2. Data Collection Patient information was obtained from electronic medical records, including demographic characteristics such as age, sex, weight, and body mass index (BMI), along with selected clinical variables. The severity of traumatic injuries was quantified using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and the Injury Severity Score (ISS), together with vital signs and laboratory findings at emergency department arrival. Clinical outcomes included in-hospital mortality, total transfusion volume, duration of mechanical ventilation, overall hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission duration, and cumulative hospitalization expenses. 2.3. SMI Calculation Abdominal CT scans were retrospectively reviewed to measure SMA. Images were acquired using a 64-slice Siemens SOMATOM Definition Flash scanner (Siemens Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). Cross-sectional images at the level of L3 were selected, and skeletal muscle was defined as tissue with attenuation values between −30 and 150 Hounsfield units. Body composition parameters, including SMA, subcutaneous fat area, and visceral fat area, were quantified with the AsanJ-Morphometry™ software (Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea) [ 19 20 Figure 2 The SMI was calculated by dividing SMA (cm 2 2 S M I = S M A  c m 2 h e i g h t 2  m 2 2.4. Definition of Sarcopenia in This Study Consensus definitions of sarcopenia require both reduced muscle mass and impaired muscle strength or physical performance [ 7 18 21 22 2 2 2 2 2.5. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and R software, version 4.3.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). First, baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were compared between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients ( Table 1 t Second, clinical outcomes, including in-hospital mortality, 24 h mortality, hospital LOS, total hospital costs, and major complications, were compared between groups to evaluate associations with sarcopenia ( Table 2 Table 3 Third, survival analysis was conducted using a landmark Kaplan–Meier approach to illustrate differences in mortality beyond the first 24 h after admission. Patients who died within 24 h were excluded from this analysis, as early deaths are primarily attributable to unsurvivable injuries or massive hemorrhage and are unlikely to be influenced by sarcopenia. Survival curves were constructed up to 30 days, and patients who were discharged alive prior to death were censored at the time of discharge. Group survival curves were compared using the log-rank test ( Figure 3 Finally, to identify independent predictors of mortality, we performed a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Variables with a p Table 4 All statistical tests were two-sided, and p 3. Results 3.1. Patient Demographics and Characteristics From January 2020 to December 2021, 891 patients aged ≥65 years were registered in the KTDB. A total of 169 patients were excluded for the following reasons: absence of abdominal CT within the first week of admission (n = 16), inadequate L3-level CT images caused by artifacts or temporary abdominal closure (n = 141), or missing anthropometric data such as height or weight (n = 12). Accordingly, 722 patients (486 males and 236 females) comprised the final study cohort. The lowest sex-specific SMI quartiles were 36.37 cm 2 2 2 2 Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1 p p p p 3.2. Clinical Outcomes and Complications As shown in Table 2 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 p 4 4 p Regarding in-hospital complications ( Table 3 3.3. Mortality Overall, 81 patients (11.2%) died during hospitalization. In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in the sarcopenia group compared with the non-sarcopenia group (15.5% vs. 9.8%, p p p Figure 3 3.4. Cox Regression Analysis To further evaluate the independent effect of sarcopenia on survival, a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed in 694 patients who survived beyond the first 24 h ( Table 4 p p p p p In the multivariable model, sarcopenia remained an independent predictor of 30-day mortality (HR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.07–5.23; p p p 4. Discussion This retrospective cohort study showed that lower skeletal muscle mass on CT—quantified by the L3 SMI was associated with higher 30-day mortality in elderly Korean trauma patients, even after adjustment for injury severity and other covariates (HR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.07–5.23; p p p These findings are consistent with a systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 retrospective studies among trauma populations (n = 2867), in which CT-assessed sarcopenia was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (RR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.30–2.94) and 30-day mortality (RR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.21–2.13) [ 23 p 24 Considering why sarcopenia is linked to poorer outcomes, several biologically plausible pathways have been proposed: lower skeletal muscle mass may reflect reduced physiologic and metabolic reserve, blunted immune–inflammatory modulation via myokines, and respiratory muscle weakness, each of which can hinder recovery from shock, infection, and surgery [ 25 26 27 28 The sarcopenia group was generally older, with a larger proportion aged ≥75 years, consistent with longitudinal evidence demonstrating an age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and quality [ 29 30 Importantly, despite having a lower mean ISS, the sarcopenia group experienced higher mortality. Previous studies in geriatric trauma patients have also shown that ISS alone does not fully capture the impact of comorbidities and frailty; for instance, elderly patients with rib fractures demonstrate nearly double the mortality of younger patients despite lower ISS and higher GCS [ 31 32 Hospital LOS was shorter in the sarcopenia group (12 [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 p p 33 Complication rates did not differ significantly between groups in our cohort, consistent with prior studies. A CT-based cohort using an L4 psoas-to-vertebral area index reported an adjusted OR of 1.08 (95% CI, 0.52–2.21) for any complication [ 24 p 34 This study has several strengths. It focuses on an Asian elderly trauma cohort, an underrepresented population in CT-based sarcopenia research whose body-composition profiles may differ from those of Western cohorts. In addition, we applied careful analytical strategies, including a 24 h landmark approach to reduce bias from nonsurvivable injuries and a multivariable model that accounted for key demographic and clinical factors. These approaches strengthen the validity of our findings and suggest that sarcopenia could serve as a prognostic marker in elderly trauma patients. This study has several limitations. First, its retrospective, single-center design limits generalizability and raises the possibility of selection bias, including exclusion of patients without adequate admission CT or complete anthropometrics. Second, sarcopenia was defined by a single cross-sectional measure of muscle quantity at admission; muscle quality, including CT radiodensity/myosteatosis, and strength were not assessed. Prior studies have shown that muscle strength and quality decline more rapidly with age than muscle mass and that functional measures may better predict outcomes than muscle mass alone [ 35 36 37 Notwithstanding these limitations, our findings suggest that CT-based skeletal muscle assessment may serve as a practical and objective tool for early risk stratification in elderly trauma patients. Because abdominal CT is frequently obtained during initial trauma evaluation, L3 SMI can be calculated from existing images at no additional scan, radiation, or cost, facilitating potential integration into clinical practice. Prospective multicenter studies are now needed to measure muscle quantity and quality at admission using CT to standardize assessments of handgrip strength, gait speed, respiratory muscle performance, and nutritional status, and to obtain follow-up imaging to capture in-hospital muscle loss. Longer-term follow-up should be used to derive and externally validate an Asian-specific risk model that integrates these measures with clinical variables such as age, sex, ISS, and GCS, including calibration of population-appropriate cut points. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, our findings suggest that CT-defined sarcopenia is independently associated with 30-day mortality in elderly trauma patients and may serve as a prognostic marker. Given the widespread use of abdominal CT in the assessment of trauma patients, early identification of sarcopenia through CT-based skeletal muscle mass measurement could help clinicians develop targeted treatment strategies to improve patient outcomes.
