Despite the growing number of studies on the accessibility and feasibility of chatbot genetic service delivery, limited attention has been paid to user interactions with chatbots in a real-world health care context. Objective We examined users’ interaction patterns with a pretest cancer genetics education chatbot as well as the associations between users’ clinical and sociodemographic characteristics, chatbot interaction patterns, and genetic testing decisions. Methods We analyzed data from the experimental arm of Broadening the Reach, Impact, and Delivery of Genetic Services, a multisite genetic services pragmatic trial in which participants eligible for hereditary cancer genetic testing based on family history were randomized to receive a chatbot intervention or standard care. In the experimental chatbot arm, participants were offered access to core educational content delivered by the chatbot with the option to select up to 9 supplementary informational prompts and ask open-ended questions. We computed descriptive statistics for the following interaction patterns: prompt selections, open-ended questions, completion status, dropout points, and postchat decisions regarding genetic testing. Logistic regression models were used to examine the relationships between clinical and sociodemographic factors and chatbot interaction variables, examining how these factors affected genetic testing decisions. Results Of the 468 participants who initiated a chat, 391 (83.5%) completed it, with 315 (80.6%) of the completers expressing a willingness to pursue genetic testing. Of the 391 completers, 336 (85.9%) selected at least one informational prompt, 41 (10.5%) asked open-ended questions, and 3 (0.8%) opted for extra examples of risk information. Of the 77 noncompleters, 57 (74%) dropped out before accessing any informational content. Interaction patterns were not associated with clinical and sociodemographic factors except for prompt selection (varied by study site) and completion status (varied by family cancer history type). Participants who selected ≥3 prompts (odds ratio 0.33, 95% CI 0.12-0.91; P P Conclusions Findings highlight the chatbot’s effectiveness in engaging users and its high acceptability, with most participants completing the chat, opting for additional information, and showing a high willingness to pursue genetic testing. Sociodemographic factors were not associated with interaction patterns, potentially indicating the chatbot’s scalability across diverse populations provided they have internet access. Future efforts should address the concerns of users with high information needs and integrate them into chatbot design to better support informed genetic decision-making. cancer genetics chatbot delivery user interaction genetic testing pretest genetic services pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf no pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Background Access to cancer genetic services is a crucial factor for cancer prevention and education, especially for those with familial cancer predisposition [ 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 6 7 3 8 12 13 14 15 16 3 Among the alternative solutions, chatbots (or conversational agents) are being increasingly used for service delivery amid the current technological evolution [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 17 Recent research has explored how chatbots can be effective remote service delivery alternatives for cancer genetic services [ 25 25 27 26 27 28 29 30 31 26 32 33 33 33 Unlike the aforementioned descriptive feasibility study, our study also explored the potential influence of clinical and sociodemographic factors on use patterns. Understanding whether clinical factors such as inherited predisposition to certain cancers or having a primary care physician affect user interaction patterns can help tailor future chatbots to improve accessibility and interactivity, better addressing the needs of individuals with different clinical backgrounds [ 33 34 17 35 36 37 25 27 27 26 26 17 Overall, due to the limited research on how patients use cancer genetic service chatbots—particularly in large-scale, real-world health care settings—and the lack of empirical evidence on how clinical and sociodemographic factors influence those use patterns, this study was conducted to fill those gaps. Objectives To address these research gaps, this study explored the use patterns of a pretest genetics education chatbot in 2 large health care systems. The primary outcomes were to examine participants’ core interactive experiences: user interactions with informational prompts (how many times they opted to view more informational content), user open-ended questions (how many questions they asked and of what nature), and genetic testing decision after the completion of the chat. In addition, to better capture the nuances of user interactive actions, we explored 2 secondary outcomes, that is, user conversation completion status (whether an individual completed the entire content of the pretest education) and user dropout points (for participants who did not complete the entire chat, whether a user left the chat before any informational content). Furthermore, given the intention of using an educational chatbot to increase access to genetic counseling services for hereditary cancer, it is pertinent to explore whether clinical and sociodemographic factors are related to differences in the participants’ interaction with the educational content on genetics, as well as their genetic testing intention. Analyzing how patient characteristics related to their use of the chatbot, as well as their genetic testing decision after completing the chat, is important for a better understanding and development of future genetics education chatbots. Methods Study Design Procedures The BRIDGE randomized controlled trial has been previously described [ 38 29 Participants Patients in the BRIDGE trial were identified as eligible for cancer genetic testing based on their family history of cancer in the EHR [ 39 43 44 45 47 Pretest Genetics Chatbot The research team scripted the rule-based chatbot to reflect the content of a pretest cancer genetic counseling appointment [ 29 33 genetics basics gene mutations positive result risk percent uncertainty in risk medical record genes included lowering risk type of results risk percent Multimedia Appendix 1 Data Collection and Outcomes Overview Transcripts were coded into a data collection tool in REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture; Vanderbilt University) [ 48 49 Outcome Measures Regarding primary outcomes, interactions with informational prompts were counted as the number of times a participant opted to view more informational content. The maximum number of informational prompts was 9. Open-ended questions were counted as the number of questions asked. Genetic testing decision was indicated as no I’m not sure yet yes Regarding secondary outcomes, chat completion status was coded as did not complete chat completed chat prior to informational content and after informational content Clinical covariates included algorithm criteria met based on specific patterns of family history of cancer suggesting a hereditary syndrome (breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, multiple predispositions, or other) and whether the participant had a recorded primary care provider in the EHR ( yes no Regarding sociodemographic covariates, we collected data on age (measured continuously), sex (male or female), race and ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, or other), number of children (0 or ≥1) and siblings (0 or ≥1), and preferred language (English or Spanish). We assessed urbanicity (urban or rural) using the 2010 rural-urban commuting area codes and categorized it as urban focused or rural city or town focused [ 50 51 52 Regarding time of day, we collected participants’ chat start and end times, which were categorized into 5 intervals: early morning (2 AM-10 AM), midday (10 AM-2 PM), afternoon (2 PM-6 PM), evening (6 PM-10 PM), and night (10 PM-2 AM). Statistical Analysis The data were cleaned and analyzed using SPSS Statistics (version 29.0; IBM Corp). Means and SDs were calculated for continuous variables, and counts and percentages were reported for categorical variables. Descriptive analyses were conducted for participant clinical information, sociodemographic information, and chat interactions. Pearson chi-square tests and independent 2-tailed t We used logistic regression models to examine associations between participants’ clinical and sociodemographic characteristics and three user interaction outcomes: number of open-ended questions (categorized as 0 ≥1 No/Not sure yet Yes Initially, 481 participants began the pretest education chat. However, 2.8% (13/481) of user interaction transcripts could not be downloaded for log analysis from the web-based portal in the commercial platform due to nonresponsiveness of the commercial platform, resulting in a final analytic sample of 468 participants included in the analysis, with 226 (48.3%) from the NYULH site and 242 (51.7%) from the UHealth site. For the primary outcomes (ie, number of informational prompts, number of open-ended questions asked, and genetic testing decision), we included participants who completed the education chat (391/468, 83.5%) in the analysis, with 47.8% (187/391) from the NYULH site and 52.2% (204/391) from the UHealth site. For the first secondary outcome—completion status—we included all participants who launched the chat (n=468). For the other secondary outcome—dropout point—we included all participants who entered the chat but dropped out during the process (77/468, 16.5%). Due to missing data for race and ethnicity in the EHR (42/468, 9% for those who launched the chat; 34/391, 8.7% for those who completed the chat) in our sample, we conducted analyses on all target outcomes both including and excluding race and ethnicity. We present adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. Statistical significance was determined at P Ethical Considerations The BRIDGE trial (approval number IRB_00115509) was approved as a single–institutional review board protocol by the University of Utah Institutional Review Board, consistent with current US National Institutes of Health policy for multisite RCTs. Because the trial compared 2 clinical service delivery models, the institutional review board approved a waiver of consent for the procedures described here. Data were de-identified. Participants did not receive compensation for the procedures described here.

Only 14.1% (55/391) of the users opted for no informational prompts. Specifically, most of the prompts that users opted for fell under the following 4 categories: genetics basics lowering risk genes included medical record gene mutations risk percent uncertainty in risk genetics basics In terms of open-ended questions, among participants who completed the education chat (391/468, 83.5%), most (350/391, 89.5%) did not ask any questions, and 10.5% (41/391) typed at least one open-ended question for a total of 62 questions. Of the aforementioned 41 participants, 32 (78%) asked 1 question, 4 (10%) asked 2 questions, and 5 (12%) asked ≥3 questions. The most frequently asked questions were about the cost and insurance coverage of genetic testing (17/62, 27%). Other common topics were questions about logistics (16/62, 25.8%), more genetics or testing information (15/62, 24%), and personal health (9/62, 14.5%). In total, 3% (2/62) of the questions were concerned about whether genetic testing results would affect their future insurance status, and 2% (1/62) were family related. There were 7 other questions: 2 (29%) requesting a call from the service, 1 (14%) asking about coordinating the test with an upcoming blood draw, 1 (14%) seeking to change a previous answer, 2 (29%) inquiring about pausing and resuming the process, and 1 (14%) asking how privacy is protected.

The odds of dropping out of the chat after the informational content are described in the “dropout point” column in Table 8 Discussion Principal Findings Many patients have limited access to genetic services, and due to the increasing need to deliver cancer genetic services for improved health outcomes, alternative delivery models for pretest genetics education are gaining more attention [ 3 25 1 53 54 This study closely investigated how users interacted with the chatbot, focusing on whether they tended to seek additional information within the conversation and ask further open-ended questions. Regarding how users interacted with the informational prompts and relevant examples, we have 3 main findings. First, although we found that the vast majority of users selected at least one prompt, a closer examination revealed differences in the selection of individual prompts. Specifically, 4 prompts received a high number of clicks, whereas others, such as gene mutations risk percent uncertainty in risk 55 56 Our examination of how users engaged with open-ended question features can provide valuable insights into enhancing the usability of cancer genetic service chatbots. Low response rates and poor quality of answers to open-ended questions have consistently posed challenges in user surveys [ 57 57 58 59 33 60 We further delved into the specifics of use patterns. First, the high chat completion rate indicates the acceptability of the chatbot design and user overall satisfaction. Users with different cancer family histories showed differences in their likelihood of completing the conversation. This insight highlights the importance of making further efforts to provide more targeted information that addresses the needs of individuals with different cancer family histories, as well as personalizing educational content based on their specific clinical contexts. Tailoring content to match user characteristics may enhance patient engagement with educational materials [ 33 Notably, although the chatbot service delivery model performed equivalently to the standard-of-care model in providing pretest cancer genetic services and promoting genetic testing, most patients invited and assigned to either model chose not to initiate the pretest genetic services [ 29 61 62 63 63 64 63 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 69 73 The ultimate goals of developing alternative pretest education models, such as using chatbots, are to enhance patients’ comprehensive knowledge of cancer genetics and support their related decision-making processes [ 29 33 74 Precision medicine emphasizes the importance of enabling informed health decisions, helping individuals understand their personal health status, the available options, and the potential benefits and consequences of each choice [ 75 29 16 76 77 54 As new technologies, particularly generative artificial intelligence (AI), continue to advance, there is a growing interest in harnessing these innovations to enhance chatbot health service delivery. AI-driven or machine learning–based chatbots provide personalized and engaging interactions tailored to the unique needs of users [ 78 79 80 81 In the field of cancer genetic testing, theoretical frameworks are still underused [ 82 83 84 84 Strengths and Limitations Compared with the small feasibility study by Chavez-Yenter et al [ 33 85 Third, our findings may be limited by incomplete or biased family history data in the EHR. Our inclusion criteria were based on the 2018 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. While the review of family history information by genetic counseling assistants ensured that those who receive testing met the criteria, our prior work has shown systematic underidentification due to biases in the available cancer family history information in the EHR [ 85 Conclusions Despite the limitations, the results of this large-scale trial demonstrate that chatbots can serve as a cost-efficient, convenient, and broadly applicable alternative for pretest cancer genetic education. Our analysis of user interaction patterns with the chatbot content revealed its effectiveness in engaging users, as indicated by the high completion rate and frequent selection of informational prompts. In addition, we examined how clinical and sociodemographic factors impact these interaction patterns, providing insights to improve the scalability of chatbot services across diverse population groups and support personalization to better address the needs of individuals from different backgrounds. Enhancing individuals’ genetic knowledge and cognitive skills enables them to make informed decisions about genetic service uptake, such as genetic testing [ 86 The research reported in this publication was supported by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health, United States, under award U01CA232826.
