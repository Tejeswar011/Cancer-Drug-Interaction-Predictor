Variations in individual drug exposure can significantly impact therapeutic efficacy and toxicity. Therefore, developing and validating innovative and reliable methods for TDM is critical for advancing personalized medicine in oncology. This proof-of-concept study aimed to evaluate the analytical performance and clinical feasibility of the True Dose ® ® Materials and methods Reagents and materials Chemicals and standards Epirubicin-HCl (100 mg, Batch 3559), doxorubicin-HCl (150 mg, Batch D2975000), and daunorubicin-HCl (120 mg, Batch D0125000) were obtained from the British and European Pharmacopoeia Reference Standards. Organic solvents used to prepare the precipitation solution and the IS solvent composition are purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Ultra-pure water was obtained using a Milli-Q water system (Merck Millipore). Consumables and True Dose kit True Dose ® ® ® LC-MS/MS analysis LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Waters Acquity Premier UPLC system (Binary Solvent Manager, Sample Manager, Column Manager) coupled to an Xevo TQ-S Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). Chromatographic separation was achieved using an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.8 μm, 100 Å) maintained at 35 °C, with an autosampler held at 8 °C. Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water, and mobile phase B consisted of 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The flow rate was set at 300 µL/min. The chromatographic gradient employed was (time [min.], %B): 0.0, 25; 3.0, 45; 3.2, 72; 4.9, 72; 5.0, 100; 7.1, 100; 7.6, 25; 8.0, 25. A volume of 2 µL was injected for each sample. Drugs were quantified by multiple reaction monitoring using electrospray ionisation in positive (ESI+). Quantifier and qualifier SRM transitions for epirubicin/doxorubicin were 544.3 → 397.0 and 544.3 → 379.0, respectively. Daunorubicin was employed as a secondary internal standard in the True Dose ® Fresh calibration curves (7.8–1000 nM) were prepared on the day of analysis. Quality control (QC) samples at low, medium, and high concentrations were included with all test-runs for performance validation. Calibration and quality control samples Calibration curves and QC samples were prepared by spiking fresh human venous blood with known concentrations of epirubicin. The Lowest Limit of Quantification (LLOQ) was 4.1 nM, and the Upper Limit of Quantification (ULOQ) was 1000 nM. The calibration curve was prepared fresh on the day of analysis. Blood samples without added epirubicin (0 nM) served as blank controls. All QC samples were analyzed alongside study samples to monitor precision and accuracy across runs.

Traditional venous blood sample preparation for experimental use For comparison, venous blood was collected into 10 mL EDTA tubes from healthy volunteers. In the lab, 10 µL of 1 µM doxorubicin (IS) and 500 µL of an organic precipitation solution (IPA: MeOH, 1:1 with 0.1% formic acid) were manually added. After vortexing for 30 s, the sample was either processed immediately (T0) or stored at − 26 °C for delayed analysis.

The laboratory preparation protocol for the True Dose ® 1 Clinical sample collection and preparation (patient use) For clinical validation, matched capillary and venous blood samples were obtained from patients at two time points following the epirubicin infusion. Each patient contributed one capillary sample collected using the True Dose ® ® Cap-TD (single): A nurse collected 20 or 50 µL of capillary blood using the True Dose ® Lab-TD (triplicates): 50 µL of venous blood was pipetted into activated True Dose ® Traditional (triplicates): Tubes were pre-filled with 1 ml of methanol and 20 µL of doxorubicin (IS) (1 µM in DMSO, without additives). Then, 50 µL of venous blood was added and vortexed for 30 s. Samples were immediately stored at − 26 °C for 3 days. Post-Storage Processing (all sample types): On Day 3, all samples were vortexed for 10 s, sonicated in an ice bath for 10 min, and centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 10 min. A 150 µL aliquot of the supernatant was transferred to labelled amber insert vials and stored at − 26 °C until LC-MS/MS analysis.

The trial is currently open for recruitment, and patients included in this feasibility phase were enrolled under ethical approval granted as part of the overarching TailorDose II study framework. The study protocol was approved by the Regional Ethics Review Board of the Karolinska Institute (Dnr 2019–02745 and 2024-02661-02), and all procedures adhered to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written and verbal informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to enrollment. Eligible participants included adults diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer who were scheduled to receive their first cycle of neoadjuvant or adjuvant epirubicin-based chemotherapy. Four patients were enrolled over two time periods: two from May to June 2024, and two from October to November 2024. Sampling protocol Each patient provided matched venous and capillary blood samples at two defined time points during the first chemotherapy cycle: Cycle 1, Sample 1 (C1S1): 2.5 h post-infusion, collected at the clinic; Cycle 1, Sample 2 (C1S2): 48 h post-infusion, collected at home by a mobile research nurse (Fig. 2  Fig. 2 Workflow comparison between ( A B Two 5 mL venous EDTA tubes were collected and processed the same day using the standard LC-MS/MS workflow at each time point (Fig. 2 ® 2 Both the 20 µL and 50 µL capillary formats were evaluated in May. Only the 50 µL format was utilized in the October-November cohort. Capillary microsampling kit overview and collection process The True Dose ® ® ® 3  Fig. 3 True Dose kit composition. During sampling, patients were asked to wash their hands with warm water. A nurse assisted by pricking the fingertip with a lancet, collecting capillary blood using the Minivette ® Impact of hematocrit on analytical performance Whole blood from a healthy individual was first centrifuged to separate red blood cells (RBCs) from plasma. These components were subsequently recombined in defined ratios to generate artificial blood samples with hematocrit concentrations ranging from 0 g/dL (plasma only) to 18 g/dL. A fixed concentration of epirubicin (37 nM) was spiked into each sample before reconstitution. The samples were then processed using the True Dose ® Statistical analysis All quantitative analyses were based on data generated by LC-MS/MS. The AUC for epirubicin was calculated using Waters TargetLynx™ software. Ratios between epirubicin and the IS doxorubicin and daunorubicin AUCs were also determined to evaluate analytical performance and comparability. Several statistical parameters were used for all protocols conducted in this study, including the analytical equivalence study, pre-activation and post-activation stability tests, and the clinical sample evaluation. Linearity was assessed through linear regression analysis, and the calibration curves were required to meet a minimum R² threshold of 0.99. Analytical precision was expressed as the CV%, calculated using the formula: CV (%) = (Standard Deviation ÷ Mean AUC) × 100. A CV of no more than 11% was considered acceptable for all replicate LC-MS/MS measurements from day 3 onward. Stability of both epirubicin and the IS was assessed by comparing AUC values across different storage durations. Degradation was deemed acceptable if it remained below 15% after 14 days of storage under the specified temperature conditions. The comparability of the True Dose ® In the clinical setting, samples collected at 2.5 h and 48 h post-epirubicin infusion were compared to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of the True Dose ® All statistical calculations were performed using Microsoft Excel.

Clinical evaluation Four patients were enrolled in the study: two between May and June 2024, and two between October and November 2024. Two participants provided both capillary and venous blood samples at two time points: 2.5 h (Cycle 1 Sample 1, C1S1) and 48 h post-infusion (Cycle 1 Sample 2, C1S2), while two participants provided only C1S1 due to logistical issues with the mobile nurse. In total, six capillary blood samples were collected using the True Dose ® Capillary vs. venous True Dose and traditional sampling Among the capillary patient samples ( n 5  Fig. 5 The ratio of epirubicin and doxorubicin between each different method. Two Cap-TD samples from the first-generation kit (v1.0) were excluded from all comparative analyses due to internal standard degradation (Supplemental Table 3): one (P1 C1S1) with marked degradation (doxorubicin AUC = 1837) and one (P2 C1S1) with partial degradation (doxorubicin AUC = 5024). For the remaining Cap-TD samples ( n An exception was P3 (C1S1), where Traditional variability (2.0%) was lower than Cap-TD (5.2%), likely due to ion suppression at higher analyte levels (~ 800 nM). P4 (C1S1) showed slightly higher Cap-TD variability (8.8%) compared with Lab-TD (8.5%), which may reflect patient-specific sample composition. Overall, reproducibility was maintained across sampling types, and the Cap-TD and Lab-TD workflow demonstrated performance comparable to, or better than, Traditional venous sampling under most conditions (Table 5  Table 5 Variability (CV%) of epi/doxo signal ratios in capillary (Cap-TD) and venous (Lab-TD) samples compared to traditional method, LC-MS/MS analysis.

Effect of hematocrit on epirubicin quantification using the True Dose method Blood samples with a spanning range of hematocrit levels (7–18 g/dL) were prepared to evaluate the influence of red blood cell content on epirubicin quantification using the True Dose ® 6 A weak inverse relationship between hematocrit levels and epirubicin signal (AUC) was observed, with a modest reduction in signal intensity at higher hematocrit concentrations. Across 7.3–18.4 g/dL, the mean AUC decreased by 18.2%. Inclusion of plasma (0 g/dL) indicated a total reduction of 36.4% from plasma controls to the highest hematocrit tested. A more pronounced decline was noted above 17 g/dL, indicating a modest matrix effect on analyte recovery at higher red blood cell content (Fig. 6  Fig. 6 Impact of hematocrit levels (0–18 g/dL) on the AUC signal of epirubicin (37 nm) when analyzed with the True Dose method.

These metrics meet ICH M10 regulatory thresholds and exceed or match prior DBS and VAMS studies 18 20 23 28 18 34 ® 13 16 35 Although epirubicin AUCs at 37 nM and 111 nM increased at Day 3 and Day 7 (up to 147.1% and 125.4% of T0 values, respectively), this did not reflect a typical degradation trend. Instead, these elevations likely represent time-dependent changes in the sample matrix or extraction behavior. As these signals declined again by Day 14, the phenomenon appears transient. Across all post-activation timepoints, CV% for the epi/doxo ratio at 37 nM and 111 nM remained ≤ 11.0%, supporting stable relative quantitation over the 14-day period. In accordance with ICH M10 bioanalytical method validation guidelines 28 This preliminary stability evaluation was conducted over a wide concentration range, but not all concentrations were analyzed in replicates; thus, time-dependent precision improvement could only be confidently assessed at 37 nM and 111 nM. Ongoing studies will broaden the tested concentration range, assess longer storage durations (e.g., 21–30 days), and investigate potential analyte–matrix interactions to better understand the observed signal variability. This early variability in True Dose ® ® The IS-stabilized capillary workflow is a significant advancement over DBS and VAMS, which often suffer from hematocrit bias, variable analyte recovery, and sample desiccation variability 23 24 24 36 37 In this proof-of-concept dataset from 4 patient samples, True Dose ® The IS degradation observed in these two v1.0 Cap-TD samples likely resulted from a combination of human error during sealing, where even a slight leak could allow air exposure or partial solvent evaporation, and the lower initial IS concentration in v1.0 (400 nM vs. 1 µM in later versions), which made small losses appear proportionally larger in the AUC. Subsequent kit versions (≥ 2.0) incorporated design and procedural refinements, and no IS degradation was observed thereafter. Variability in some patient sample results likely reflected biological rather than methodological factors. For example, P4 showed slightly higher Cap-TD variability, possibly due to differences in protein binding, endogenous metabolites, or concurrent medications. For P3 (C1S1), a high epirubicin concentration (~ 800 nM) near the upper clinical range may have caused minor ion suppression from co-eluting phospholipids and other endogenous components, rather than kit-derived additives. These results align with earlier findings by Radovanovic et al. and Tripathy et al., who reported successful clinical application of patient-centric microsampling for paclitaxel and abrocitinib, respectively 21 36 ® 22 38 While Corsi et al. recently explored bioresorbable implantable sensors for doxorubicin TDM, highlighting advances in continuous monitoring technologies, these systems remain constrained by regulatory and technical barriers 39 ® 40 An important innovation in the True Dose ® 41 Traditional hospital-based TDM is constrained by sample timing, venous access, cold-chain transport, and lab availability 15 17 19 ® Our findings reinforce prior recommendations from Groenland et al. and Liu et al. 13 ® Study limitations include a small patient pool ( n 22 These findings support further exploration of True Dose ® Conclusions In conclusion, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the True Dose ® Supplementary Information Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
