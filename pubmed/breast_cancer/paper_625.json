Materials and Methods Treatment-naïve patients who underwent >24 months of follow-up were included. We analyzed inter-visit changes in the foveal subretinal fluid (SRF) height after anti-VEGF treatment or PDT compared to no treatment and long-term prognosis of best-corrected visual acuity in choroidal neovascularization (CNV)-free patients. Results Nineteen patients were enrolled, and the mean follow-up duration was 4.81 years. In 14 CNV-free patients, 11 received anti-VEGF injections, three patients underwent PDT, and two patients had both treatments. During the follow-up period, there were a total of 243 inter-visit events (88 injections and 155 observations without treatment). At the last visit of patients who received the treatment, complete resolution was more significantly achieved in the CNV group than in the CNV-free group ( p p p p Conclusion Treatment with anti-VEGF and PDT do not seem to be effective for foveal SRD of CNV-free inferior staphyloma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients A retrospective study was conducted on patients newly diagnosed with foveal SRD associated with inferior staphyloma in the Department of Ophthalmology at Yonsei Medical Center (Severance Hospital and Gangnam Severance Hospital) between July 2009 and June 2021. Patients were selected for medical record review from a clinical database containing patients' ophthalmologic examinations and ocular history. Only patients diagnosed with foveal SRD associated with inferior staphyloma and who underwent more than 24 months of follow-up were included in this study. Anti-VEGF therapy (ranibizumab, bevacizumab) and/or half-dose PDT with verteporfin was applied for the purpose of reducing SRD. Patients were presented for follow-up at 1- to 6-month intervals, depending on the disease activity and the clinician's decision. All included patients had undergone a comprehensive ophthalmological examination at the initial presentation, which included measurement of the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit-lamp biomicroscopy, indirect fundoscopy, color fundus photography, fluorescein angiography (FA), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) using the Heidelberg retinal angiography device (HRA-II; Heidelberg Engineering, Dossenheim, Germany), and spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT; Spectralis; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). SD-OCT consisted of 6-mm horizontal raster scans with 30–60-µm spacing that covered a 1500-µm diameter centered on the fovea. We also included high resolution images of 9-mm horizontal and vertical scans. At every follow-up, all examinations except angiography were performed. When the occurrence of neovascularization was suspected, FA and ICGA were performed. The CNV was determined with the consent of the two examiners based on hyperfluorescence and leakage from the suspected lesion. The patients were excluded if any of the eyes exhibited the following signs: CNV secondary to AMD; media opacities significant enough to limit the quality of imaging; and a history of ocular inflammation, retinal detachment, retinal vascular occlusive diseases, epiretinal membrane, macular holes, ocular trauma, and previous vitreoretinal surgery and/or laser photocoagulation. There were a total of five patients with CNV who were not diagnosed with AMD. The age range of the five patients was between their 60s and 80s. None of the patients exhibited typical features of AMD, such as soft drusen, subretinal drusenoid deposits (reticular pseudodrusen), pachychoroid, or polypoidal structures. Two patients showed shallow pigment epithelial detachment associated with abnormal curvature, while three patients exhibited type 2 CNV characteristics. Two patients who underwent cataract surgery during the follow-up period were excluded from the analysis of visual acuity. Treatment protocols In CNV-free inferior staphyloma with foveal SRD, there is currently no established standard treatment. As a result, the decision to initiate treatment varied among physicians. In the administration of the anti-VEGF injection, bevacizumab (Avastin) 1.25 mg or ranibizumab (Lucentis) 0.5 mg was injected 3.0 mm or 3.5 mm posterior to the limbus through the pars plana using a 30-gauge needle in the operating room, using an aseptic technique. PDT was performed using half-dose verteporfin (Visudyne; Novartis, Basel, Switzerland). For this, 3 mg/m 2 2 In the case of CNV-free inferior staphyloma, the use of anti-VEGF and PDT treatments was off-label. Imaging analysis All OCT images, color fundus photographs, and FA and ICGA findings were reviewed by two independent examiners (J.L., J.W.J.) to determine the presence of accompanying CNV and the height of foveal SRD. The agreement between the two examiners was good. Discrepancies between examiners for categorical values and differences over 20% between the quantitatively measured values were resolved by open adjudication. If no consensus was reached, a final decision was made by the other senior examiner (S.H.B.) and the two closest values were averaged. The height of the subretinal fluid (SRF) was manually measured at the subfoveal point using the OCT system's built-in calipers, specifically from the distance between the lower interface of the detached retina and the upper interface of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Outcomes and statistical analysis The changes in BCVA between the initial and final visits were evaluated based on whether complete SRF resolution occurred and whether CNV was present. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to assess the difference in BCVA between the initial and last visits. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the proportions of complete SRF resolution at the last visit according to the presence of CNV. The anti-VEGF agents administered were bevacizumab (119) and ranibizumab (7); the two medications were not analyzed separately. The main question of this study was whether anti-VEGF treatment was effective in foveal SRD of patients with CNV-free inferior staphyloma. We determined the inter-visit changes of SRF at every visit according to anti-VEGF treatment and observation without any treatment as the main variable, and it was analyzed under the assumption that every inter-visit change was independent. To minimize the influence of inter-treatment effects, cases of anti-VEGF therapy conducted within 12 months after PDT were excluded from the inter-visit analysis. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, the initial amount of foveal SRF, follow-up duration, inter-visit intervals, and the number of visits and anti-VEGF injections varied among subjects. Therefore, the patients, follow-up duration between the former and latter visits, and the amount of foveal SRF at the former visit were statistically adjusted. To improve the validity of the conclusion, inter-visit changes in foveal SRF height were converted into various variables and analyzed. Absolute value change and rate of change in foveal SRF between the anti-VEGF treatment group and the no treatment (observation) group were analyzed by a linear mixed model with an unstructured covariance matrix. The criteria classified changes into categorical groups, defining significant changes as ±20% or more, and changes of less than ±20% as stable. The chi-squared test and a generalized linear mixed model, adjusted for confounding factors, were used to analyze the differences in the categorical classification of ±20%. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). A p This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Yonsei University Medical Center before the review of data began, and the requirement to obtain informed consent from the patients was waived by the IRB (3-2021-0460). All study protocols adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. RESULTS The study included 19 eyes from 19 enrolled patients (5 males, 14 females). The mean±standard deviation (SD) patient age was 62.47±13.48 years, and the mean±SD follow-up period was 4.81±2.71 years. During the follow-up period, a total number of 126 anti-VEGF injections were administered (bevacizumab, 119; ranibizumab, 7). Patients' detailed diagnoses and received treatment are summarized in Fig. 1 Complete SRF resolution Whether complete SRF resolution was obtained at the last visit according to the presence or absence of CNV and treatment was analyzed ( Table 1 p Visual prognosis In the CNV-free group, visual acuities were improved in patients with complete resolution, while visual acuities showed decreased tendency in the patients without complete resolution (mean±SD, LogMAR, 0.48±0.35 to 0.62±0.28; p Fig. 2A In the CNV group, despite treatment efforts, visual acuities decreased at the final visit compared to those at the first visit, showing marginal significance (mean±SD, LogMAR, 0.32±0.13 to 0.67±0.27; p Fig. 2B Effectiveness of anti-VEGF treatment When the inter-visit change patterns of foveal SRF were divided into increase, stable (within ±20%), and decrease, the patterns were evaluated as 47 (30.3%), 67 (43.2%), 41 (26.5%) cases in cases of observation, and 19 (21.6%), 33 (37.5%), 36 (40.9%) cases in cases of anti-VEGF administration, respectively, with no significant differences ( p Table 2 After correction for confounding factors, there was no difference in inter-visit SRF change between the observation cases and anti-VEGF cases for all variable types ( Fig. 3 Tables 3 4 p Fig. 3 Table 3 p Table 3 p Table 4 As a result, the anti-VEGF injection did not significantly reduce SRF compared to observation (no treatment). In fact, in many cases, the SRF was increased despite anti-VEGF injection, and the SRF was decreased despite just observation. A representative case is shown in Fig. 4 Effectiveness of PDT A total of three patients underwent half-dose PDT, and all patients underwent a single PDT session. After the PDT treatment, in three consecutive follow-up visits at 3-month intervals, complete resolution could not be reached at any time, and the decreased SRF was not maintained ( Supplementary Fig. 1 DISCUSSION Inferior staphyloma with foveal SRD is a rare medical condition. Therefore, there have only been a limited number of case reports or case series studies, often with a small number of patients and short follow-up durations. The amount of SRD, especially in cases without CNV, may generally fluctuate and can spontaneously resolve without any treatment. Previously, a spontaneous resolution case was reported in a patient with inferior staphyloma with foveal SRD, and one patient was also observed in our cohort. Therefore, when SRF decreases after treatment, it is difficult to determine whether it is caused by the treatment effect or is just a spontaneous decrease. In addition, it is difficult to construct a prospective study for these rare medical conditions, and the clinical data of a retrospective study are usually unrefined and heterogenous. Given these limitations, only conclusions based on a relatively sufficient number of cases and sophisticated statistical methods would be reliable. We believe that our study could draw confirmative conclusions about the treatment effect of anti-VEGF, based on enrolling a relatively large number of patients and the anti-VEGF injections with a long-term follow-up duration of more than 2 years and a mean of 4.81 years. Longstanding SRD can cause permanent damage to photoreceptors and visual deterioration. 20 21 22 In this study, anti-VEGF did not seem to be effective on foveal SRD of the patients with CNV-free inferior staphyloma. The inter-visit changes of foveal SRF height in CNV-free patients were investigated between 88 anti-VEGF treatment cases and 155 observation cases, and the absolute value, rate, and subgroup categorized as ±20% of inter-visit foveal SRF changes were analyzed. After adjusting for confounding factors, such as SRF height at the former visit and inter-visit duration, analyses showed no statistical differences in inter-visit change of foveal SRF between the anti-VEGF treatment cases and the observation cases ( p p p Bevacizumab (anti-VEGF) has been shown to be effective in reducing neurosensory detachment by reducing the vascular permeability in various ocular diseases, such as choroid-retinal vascular diseases 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 16 17 18 19 23 In our study, the majority of anti-VEGF injections were bevacizumab (81 cases), and only seven cases were ranibizumab in 14 CNV-free patients. When comparing bevacizumab and ranibizumab, there was no statistically significant difference, indicating that both injections were ineffective. In our cases, we did not use aflibercept or brolucizumab, which are known to be superior in removing fluid in cases such as neovascular AMD. Therefore, we could not draw conclusions about the effectiveness of these anti-VEGFs. Half-dose PDT has been established as the first-line of treatment for chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). 24 17 24 25 The reason for choosing half-dose PDT in our study was due to verteporfin's does-dependent chorioretinal damage. 26 Although rare, intravitreal injections can potentially cause serious complications such as endophthalmitis, and PDT, as previously stated, may cause outer chorioretinal atrophy. By not administering unproven, unnecessary treatments, ineffective medical expenses and possible complications can be reduced. Furthermore, given that spontaneous resolution can occur in a significant proportion of cases, a watchful waiting approach may be the most appropriate strategy. This approach involves regular follow-up to monitor for any visual changes or the development of complications that may necessitate further intervention. When discussing prognosis with patients, it is essential to inform them that while interventions may not always result in improved outcomes, spontaneous resolution of SRF is possible. Clear communication with patients about the likely course of their condition, the potential for improvement without intervention, and the need for ongoing monitoring can help manage expectations and ensure that patients are well-informed. The disease entity of foveal SRD associated with inferior staphyloma appears to be similar to that of SRD with a dome-shaped macula. Both diseases are accompanied by high myopia and posterior staphyloma, and no effective treatment has been determined. Dome-shaped macula is characterized by a convex anterior protrusion (bowing towards the vitreous cavity) or posterior protrusion on both sides of the macula, whereas inferior staphyloma has a posterior protrusion only in the inferior part of the macula. The pathophysiology of both diseases remains controversial; however, both diseases are thought to accumulate foveal SRF through a similar mechanism related to anatomical changes, specifically focal scleral thickening and abrupt changes in choroidal thickness. 27 28 29 30 31 32 29 This study has several limitations. First, although foveal SRF with inferior staphyloma is a very rare pathological condition, a larger number of patients would have strengthened the credibility of the conclusion. Additionally, due to the retrospective study design, there is an inherent risk of selection bias. Since the treatment and observation groups were not randomized, it is possible that patients in the treatment group had a higher necessity for intervention, which may have introduced bias. Furthermore, the amount of SRF at the time of visits and the interval between prior and current visits could have influenced treatment responses. To minimize potential biases, we made statistical adjustments to account for these confounding factors. However, despite such efforts, we acknowledge that these biases may still have impacted our findings. These limitations should be addressed in future research. Lastly, since all of the patients enrolled in this study were of East Asian descent (Korean), the study only focused on a single ethnic group. The results for diverse ethnicities should be considered in future studies. In conclusion, in the case of foveal SRD in CNV-free inferior staphyloma, treatment with anti-VEGF and PDT does not appear to be effective. Since complete resolution of SRF can prevent potentially permanent damage to photoreceptors and lead to a better visual prognosis, novel therapies would be needed.

photodynamic therapy (PDT). After the PDT treatment, in three consecutive follow-up visits at 3-month intervals, complete resolution could not be reached at any time, and the decreased SRF was not maintained. Fig. 1 Summary of detailed diagnosis and treatment of enrolled patients. CNV, choroidal neovascularization; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; PDT, photodynamic therapy. Fig. 2 Changes in BCVA at the initial and last visit. (A) In the CNV-free group, visual acuities were improved in patients with complete resolution, while visual acuities showed decreased tendency in patients without complete resolution (mean±standard deviation, LogMAR, 0.48±0.35 to 0.62±0.28; p p Fig. 3 Comparison of absolute value of inter-visit SRF change between the observation cases and the anti-VEGF cases. All change values are displayed with different colored dots according to the patients. The estimated means after correction for confounding factors, such as the foveal SRF height at the former visit and/or inter-visit duration, are indicated in different types of black circles. After adjusting for confounding factors, there was no difference in inter-visit SRF change between the two groups ( p Fig. 4 Representative case of serial changes in one patient receiving anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment. A 63-year-old male patient with foveal serous retinal detachment associated with CNV-free inferior staphyloma in his right eye. (A) At his first visit, foveal SRF was observed; however, no treatment was given. (B) At 3 months after the initial presentation, the foveal SRF decreased. To reduce residual SRF, intravitreal bevacizumab was administered. (C) At 3 months after the injection, rather, the foveal SRF increased. CNV, choroidal neovascularization; SRF, subretinal fluid.
