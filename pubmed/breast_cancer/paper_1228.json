We investigated if IRMS-based isotopic profiling could reflect metabolic dysregulations associated with disease progression. This topic is both timely and clinically relevant. This is due to the fact that patients with OSCC have poor prognosis, which is related to lymph node involvement. In this prospective study, we analyzed tumors derived from 61 patients.

Introduction Isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) is an analytical method useful for measuring the relative abundance of selected isotopes. Lately, this technique has gained popularity and new applications in biomedicine [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 IRMS offers numerous possibilities for research in cancer biology, as it reflects changes in cell metabolic reactions. Metabolic reprogramming, which is believed to be a major hallmark of cancerogenesis, includes several well-defined changes in cancer cell pathways. These changes help provide essential substances and energy to meet altered anabolism and growth needs of cancer cells. This complex process includes upregulation of aerobic glycolysis, glutaminolysis, lipid metabolism, an increased pentose phosphate pathway and amino acid metabolism, as well as mitochondrial changes [ 12 13 13 14 10 11 15 Malignant neoplasms derived from epithelial tissues are characterized, amongst other features, by early cervical lymph node metastases. It has been proven that carcinoma spread to lymph nodes is one of the major factors affecting the outcome of treatment of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), decreasing the 5-year survival rate. Metastasis to regional cervical lymph nodes is related to the deterioration of tumor control (this increases the risk of loco-regional recurrence and distant metastases) [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 A more accurate method for stratifying the risk of lymph node metastases could improve overall treatment outcomes in patients with oral cancer. In this study, we investigated if IRMS measurements could serve as a useful method in assessing the risk of lymph node spread. It can be assumed that alterations in tumor biology evaluated at the isotopic level can be a good predictor of lymph node metastases. The aim of this study was to verify if changes in the abundance of nitrogen 15 13 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Patient Cohort This prospective study included 61 consecutive adult patients with OSCC treated surgically in our department, fulfilling the inclusion criteria. The cohort consisted of 24 females and 37 males aged 43 to 92 years (mean age of 66.3 ± 9.4). The inclusion criteria were a primary diagnosis of OSCC (confirmed by histopathological examination) and localized tumor advancement enabling radical resection with clear surgical margins (R0 resection, defined as no microscopic residual tumor at the resection margin). The exclusion criteria included prior malignancy or irradiation of the head and neck region, previous chemotherapy or antibody therapy, and the presence of distant metastases. The nutritional status of all patients was assessed using body mass index (BMI) and a panel of laboratory tests, including total protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), transferrin, glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), inorganic phosphate, calcium, and magnesium levels. Patients with malnutrition (BMI < 18.5) or a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus were excluded from the study. No participant followed specific dietary restrictions or exclusionary regimens. This study was approved by the Bioethics Committee (RNN/185/18/KE). All patients enrolled into this study underwent standard therapeutic procedures (tumor resection, neck dissection) and adjuvant treatment, if necessary, as recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) [ 25 15 13 Additionally, the lymph node ratio (LNR) was calculated for each patient in the pN(+) group. This parameter was defined as the number of lymph nodes with metastases divided by the total number of dissected lymph nodes (LNR = number of metastatic lymph nodes/total dissected lymph nodes). Histopathological assessment was combined with IRMS to provide a comprehensive understanding of nodal spread. 2.2. Preparation of the Samples During surgical procedures, four tissue samples (approximately 2 mm × 2 mm each) were extracted from each patient’s tumor. The collected specimens underwent specific processing routes for IRMS analysis and histopathological assessment. Two samples were immersed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and evaluated histopathologically by an experienced pathologist (JK). The entire postoperative tumor and lymph node specimens underwent routine histopathological examination, assessing features such as depth of cancer infiltration (DOI, measured in millimeters), tumor thickness and diameter, bone invasion, surgical margins status (R status), angioinvasion, neuroinvasion, number and localization of lymph node metastases, and extranodal extension (ENE). TNM staging, following the American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th Edition, was used [ 26 2.3. IRMS Procedure IRMS analysis of δ 15 13 15 13 To ensure reproducibility, repeated calibrations using certified reference materials were performed. In this study, standard IRMS validation protocols were followed. Calibration reproducibility was assessed through statistical evaluation of replicate measurements, including standard deviations and control chart analysis. IRMS measurements were conducted using a Sercon SL20–22 Continuous Flow Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometer connected to a Sercon SL elemental analyzer for simultaneous carbon–nitrogen analysis. Isotopic ratios were expressed as δ values, calculated using the following formula: δX(‰) = (R sample/R standard − 1) x 1000 (1) 15 13 15 14 13 12 13 13 12 15 15 14 13 15 Additional IRMS parameters analyzed included the minimal (Min) and maximal (Max) percentage mass contents of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), median and interquartile range (IQR), mean ± standard deviation (SD), percentage mass contents of C and N, and total nitrogen-to-carbon ratio ([N]/[C]). 2.4. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using Statistica, version 12.0 (StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). For univariate analysis of risk factors for cervical lymph node metastasis, the χ 2 2 p 27 p 3. Results 3.1. Lymph Node Status (pN) and Neck Dissections In total, 61 patients were enrolled in this prospective analysis. About 60% of the study group were men ( n Most patients (45.9%) were diagnosed with an advanced stage of the disease (pT4). Almost 80% of cases ( n Table 1 The majority of OSCCs involved the floor of the mouth ( n n Figure 1 Neck dissections were performed on the whole group of patients (61 cases) enrolled in the study. The extent of lymphadenectomy (the levels of cervical lymph nodes removed and one-sided or bilateral neck surgery) depended on the primary tumor site and preoperative radiological assessment of the neck lymph nodes. Overall, we performed 115 neck dissections. These included selective neck dissections (SNDs), specifically lymphadenectomies limited to levels I–III (supraomohioid neck dissections, SOHNDs) and surgeries limited to levels I–IV (extended supraomohioid neck dissections, ESOHNDs). Selective neck dissection was performed only for cN0 malignancies. Radical neck dissection was performed in cN3 cases, including bulky metastatic diseases by the accessory nerve and cases with multiple clinically metastatic lymph nodes. The remaining patients with cN(+) (where nodal spread did not involve the accessory nerve, internal jugular vein, and/or the sternocleidomastoid muscle) underwent modified radical neck dissections. SNDs prevailed in this study, with a total of 91 procedures performed. Levels I–V dissections, including radical neck dissections (RND) and modified radical neck dissections (MRND), were performed 24 times. ( Table 2 During all SND procedures, a total of 1450 cervical nodes were cleared (ranging from 9 to 33 lymph nodes), averaging 15.9 nodes per procedure. During level I–V dissections, a total of 572 nodes were resected (ranging from 14 to 42 lymph nodes per procedure), averaging 23.8 nodes per procedure. Taking into consideration all types of neck dissections, the median lymph node yield was 15 nodes per procedure (ranging from 9 to 49). In total, 2022 lymph nodes were dissected during all surgeries, averaging 33.2 nodes per patient. In 33 out of 61 patients, cervical lymph node metastases were confirmed by histopathological examination. The total number of positive lymph nodes resected during all procedures was 123, with an average of 3.7 and median of 3.0 (ranging from 1 to 9). The median lymph node ratio (LNR) was 0.10690 (ranging from 0.02222 to 0.36). ( Table 3 Analysis of nodal involvement revealed that pN3b status was most frequent in patients with cervical lymph node metastases. This was determined in 28 cases (45.9%). A minority of this study group were patients in the pN1 stage (1 case), pN2b (3 cases), and pN2c (1 case). The rest of our cohort were patients without lymph node spread ( n Contralateral metastases were found in nine cases, while bilateral lymph nodes involvement were observed in eight patients. Metastases larger than 3 cm occurred in 17 patients. Single metastases were observed in 26 cases, while multiple metastases were observed in 8 individuals. Lymph node spread was most commonly present in patients with tumors involving the lower gingiva ( n n Figure 2 Histopathological assessment revealed that in most patients in the pN(+) stage, extracapsular nodal spread was present. This was observed in 27 patients (79.4%). Subsequently, a univariate analysis of risk factors of cervical lymph node metastasis was performed. The results indicate that factors like male gender ( p p p p p p p p 2 n n p p p Table 4 3.2. Multivariate Logistic Regression Analysis of the Risk Factors of Cervical Lymph Node Metastasis The following statistical variables were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis: age, gender, smoking status, depth of invasion, tumor stage, presence of angio/neuroinvasion, and keratosis. The age, gender, and tumor staging were found to be independent risk factors of cervical lymph node metastasis ( p Table 5 3.3. IRMS Measurements of Nitrogen 15 13 The abundance of nitrogen 15 13 No significant correlation was found between the isotopic values and lymph node metastases.

Discussion The results of this prospective study provide valuable insight into the potential utility of IRMS in understanding the biological background of oral cancer, especially regarding tumor progression and lymph node involvement.

Similarly, Madej et al. utilized the natural abundance of 13 15 10 Unlike our earlier cross-sectional analyses focusing on tissue–margin contrasts and site/stage stratification, the present prospective study emphasizes nodal risk, incorporates multivariable modeling of established clinical predictors, and examines δ 13 15 Our findings are consistent with the data presented in the literature, indicating that variations in isotopic 13 15 10 11 15 These observations are consistent with the metabolic reprogramming that occurs in the cancer cells. Advanced tumors often exhibit enhanced glycolysis, glutaminolysis. It can be assumed that more aggressive tumor behavior can be related to dysregulation of carbon metabolism. Similarly, the pattern of the 15 Nonetheless, the global comparison of IRMS parameters between LNM(+) and LNM(−) groups failed to reach the level of statistical significance. Several explanations may account for this finding. First of all, it is possible that the metabolic profiles of primary oral tumors are similar regardless of their metastatic status. IRMS measurements capture the biochemical environment and nutrient molecules utilized by cancer cells. However, the ability to metastasize is driven by a distinct set of factors, such as genetic mutations, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and tumor–stromal interactions, which may not be reflected in isotopic variations. Moreover, isotopic abundance was measured only in samples from primary tumors. The metabolic microenvironment of these tumors may differ from that present in metastases in lymph nodes. Additionally, the sample size, inter-patient variability, and biological heterogeneity may have been confounding factors that affected our results. The sample size of 61 patients may have been insufficient to detect subtle correlations between IRMS parameters and lymph node status. Our observations suggest that isotopic changes may serve as indicators of overall tumor biology related to metabolic reprogramming rather than direct predictors of lymph node metastasis. From a clinical point of view, the relevance of our findings lies in their potential to improve the stratification of patients with poor prognosis and those at risk for lymph node metastases. Current radiological methods, such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have limitations in detecting occult metastases, with sensitivities ranging from 60 to 90% [ 17 18 22 24 29 Our study also identified important risk factors for cervical lymph node metastases, namely male gender, age under 65 years, smoking, advanced clinical disease stage, angioinvasion/neuroinvasion, depth of infiltration (DOI > 10 mm), histopathological grade, and presence of keratosis. These findings are consistent with previous reports linking these factors to adverse outcomes in OSCC patients [ 16 p 22 30 Nevertheless, further statistical analysis found only three independent risk factors for nodal metastases in our cohort, including younger age (<65 years), male gender, and advanced clinical stage. Importantly, we found that the isotopic parameters also varied with these factors. These observations support the hypothesis that the metabolic profile assessed by IRMS reflects the underlying tumor biology associated with metastatic potential. A potential limitation to the broader application of the IRMS method is the possible impact of confounding factors (e.g., diet, nutritional status, and systemic metabolic diseases) on stable isotope ratio measurements. Although detailed dietary data were not collected in this study, a review of clinical records and participant interviews indicated that none of the participants adhered to exclusionary diets or restrictive nutritional regimens. All individuals reported consuming a typical mixed diet without omitting major food groups. This suggests a relatively consistent nutritional background across the cohort, although some dietary variability cannot be ruled out. The results of our study suggest that IRMS might not replace traditional histopathological examination in assessing lymph node metastasis risk. However, it may serve as a valuable tool that may complement diagnostic methods by providing additional information on tumor metabolism. This may be particularly useful in a multimodal approach to risk stratification. Incorporating IRMS analysis together with clinical, pathological, and genetic markers may offer a comprehensive strategy that could better predict treatment outcomes and guide therapeutic decisions. For instance, lower δ 13 Our study has some limitations. First of all, the sample size consisted of 61 patients (LNM(+) = 33; LNM(−) = 28). An a priori power analysis indicates the study provides approximately 80% power (α = 0.05, two-tailed) to detect medium-to-large group differences in isotopic metrics (Cohen’s d ≈ 0.7) between lymph node strata; smaller effects would likely require a larger cohort. Secondly, potential confounding factors, such as diet and nutritional status, can affect the isotope ratio measurements, as discussed above. Lastly, in our study, tissue sampling was performed only on primary tumors, not on metastatic lymph nodes. Without measurements from metastatic lymph nodes, the usefulness of IRMS as a biomarker for nodal spread is limited. In future investigations, longitudinal assessment of δ 13 15 13 15 5.
