Each of these assays gives, for a particular cell or tissue type, a distinct picture of 3D chromatin architecture. Accordingly, making sense of the relationship between genome structure and function requires teasing apart two closely related questions: how does chromatin 3D structure change from one cell type to the next, and how do different measurements of that structure differ from one another, even when the two assays are carried out in the same cell type? In this work, we assemble a collection of chromatin 3D datasets—each represented as a 2D contact map—spanning multiple assay types and cell types. We then build a machine learning model that predicts missing contact maps in this collection. We use the model to systematically explore how genome 3D architecture changes, at the level of compartments, domains, and loops, between cell type and between assay types. http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002 National Institutes of Health UM1HG011531 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7283-4715 Noble William Stafford http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051 National Human Genome Research Institute R01HG011466 https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7283-4715 Noble William Stafford This study was supported by the National Institutes of Health in the form of grants awarded to WSN (UM1HG011531 and R01HG011531) in the form of salary for WSN and AM.

An important aspect of this control involves bringing distal regulatory elements close, in 3D space, to the genes that they regulate. Consequently, abberant changes to chromatin architecture can lead to diseases as genes become improperly regulated [ 1 4 Accordingly, a variety of technologies have been developed to measure genome 3D conformation in a high-throughput fashion, allowing scientists to more fully explore the relationship between genome structure and function ( Table 1 5 7 8 10 6 9 12 11 13 contact map 10.1371/journal.pone.0331124.t001 Table 1 Properties of assays measuring 3D genome architecture generated by 4DN and included in this study.

Each panel displays a contact map for chromosome 19 from a particular assay and a particular biosample where the number of normalized log counts is displayed as a color. Only cell types with at least two experiments and assays with at least two experiments were included. Each of the 41 non-missing contact maps has a colored border to indicate whether it was used for training (green), validation (orange) or testing (red). Such predicted contact maps have a variety of possible uses. A systematic analysis of a complete collection of contact maps may provide global insights into how important aspects of chromatin architecture, e.g. TAD boundaries and loops, differ or are similar across biosamples and assays. In some cases, it may not be possible to run multiple 3D chromatin assays on a particular sample due to the material necessary for each experiment. Interesting features in a predicted contact map may suggest hypotheses for follow-up experiments or may help in prioritization of future 3D chromatin assays. Conversely, if the predicted contact map for a given biosample or assay closely resembles one or more existing contact maps, that suggests that conducting the experiment may not be worthwhile. In these cases, predicted contact maps for other assay types may give an idea of what the results would have been if they had been done. Several methods have been proposed previously to predict Hi-C contact maps, or portions thereof. Some methods, such as Akita [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 In contrast to these approaches, we consider the complementary problem of imputing unseen contact maps given only a collection of available contact maps. This imputation task is conceptually similar to previous work on imputing 1D epigenomic data [ 22 24 We introduce Sphinx, a deep tensor factorization method for imputing entire contact maps. Sphinx is comprised of learned representations of biosamples, assays, and genomic positions, and a neural network that combines these factors to make predictions. We evaluate Sphinx in a cross-validated setting, demonstrating that it outperforms several baseline methods. We then systematically apply Sphinx to the full 4DN dataset in a prospective fashion, and we examine the predicted contact matrices on three levels: contact decay profiles, compartments, and topologically associating domains (TADs). The results suggest an increased capability to compare contact matrices, and a smoothing effect on similarity between biosamples and assays. 2 Methods 2.1 Sphinx The deep matrix factorization approach was implemented in a similar fashion to the Avocado imputation approach [ 24 Fig 2 Fig 3a 25 https://github.com/Noble-Lab/Sphinx 10.1371/journal.pone.0331124.g002 Fig 2 The Sphinx model. Each dimension of the 4D input is encoded using latent factors, and the concatenated factors are processed by a multi-layer perceptron. The figure shows an example of predicting the contact between positions 2 and 5 in DNA SPRITE H1-hESC. The final output of the model is the predicted normalized contact count. 10.1371/journal.pone.0331124.g003 Fig 3 Sphinx outperforms mean model baseline. (a) Sphinx was trained using 500 randomly selected settings of seven different hyperparameters. Each panel plots the validation set MSE (x-axis) for various values of a particular hyperparameter (y-axis). MSEs are shown as horizontal lines for the three baseline methods: cross-mean (red line), same cell type (magenta), and same assay type (green). All analyses are based on data from chromosome 19. (b) Each panel plots the test set MSE achieved by Sphinx (x-axis) versus the cross-mean baseline (y-axis). Each point corresponds to one of the 14 assay/cell type combinations in the test set. (c) A comparison of the number of training experiments that shared assay (blue), cell type (orange), or either assay or cell type (green) versus the MSE of the test set example. Each point is one test set example. The x-axis is jittered for visibility. Least squares lines are shown along with their associated R 2 2.2 Data sets We systematically downloaded all available contact map datasets from the 4D Nucleome web portal ( https://data.4dnucleome.org/ S1 Table Table 2 Fig 1 S2 Table 3.4 10.1371/journal.pone.0331124.t002 Table 2 Biosamples included in the data set. Biosample Description HeLa An immortal cell line derived from cervical cancer cells from Henrietta Lacks GM12878 Lymphoblastoid cell line from a woman of European descent HFFc6 Human foreskin fibroblast cells hESC Human embryonic stem cells WTC-11 Pluripotent stem cells derived from leg fibroblast IMR-90 Lung fibroblast cells HUVEC Human umbilical vein endothelial cells CC-2251 Mammary epithelial cells 192627 Adult normal human epidermal keratinocytes Prior to analysis, each contact map is normalized as follows. First, we log ( x + 1 ) log log ( x + 1 ) 5 The data was randomly partitioned into train, test and validation sets as illustrated in Fig 1 2.3 Baseline methods Due to the key differences between Sphinx and existing methods described in Sect 1 24 26 2.4 Computing the contact decay, eigenvector, and insulation score To compute the contact decay profile, we computed the we computed the mean normalized count along each of the diagonals of the contact matrix. To compute the eigenvector, we used NumPy version 1.25.2. To compute the insulation score, we used a window size of 30, and computed the mean of sliding window diagonal submatrices of the contact matrix, sliding the window by 1 bin at each step. 3 Results 3.1 Sphinx accurately imputes unobserved contact maps To validate our modeling approach, we began by measuring how well the model predicts previously unseen data. To this end, we randomly selected a subset of contacts map to use for validation and testing ( Sect 2.2 Sect 2.3 Our experiment began by using the validation set to select hyperparameters for Sphinx. In this step, we defined a seven-dimensional grid of hyperparameters, including learning rate, cell type factors, assay factors, position factors, the number of layers, the number of nodes per layer, and the dropout rate. Because this grid is too large to explore completely, we opted to randomly select 500 points on the hyperparameter grid and use those as the basis for our selection. The results of this hyperparameter search suggest that Sphinx successfully outperforms the baseline methods with a variety of hyperparameter settings ( Fig 3a Next we evaluated how well the selected hyperparameters generalize to the test data. This analysis suggests that Sphinx performs comparably to the best-performing baseline (cross-mean). In particular, computing the overall MSE on the test set, we find that Sphinx outperforms the baseline in 8 out of 14 cases ( Fig 3b Fig 3c R 2 3.2 Imputation model reveals similarities between biosamples Having established that Sphinx produces comparable predictions to the cross-mean baseline, we next set out to systematically apply Sphinx to the full dataset. The goal here is to provide a data resource that enables exhaustive comparison of all cell lines and all assay types. Without imputation, many comparisons would be incomplete. For example, based on the pattern of missingness in Fig 1 in situ Accordingly, we used the previously trained model to impute contact maps for all unobserved assay-cell type combinations ( Fig 1 Figs 4 6 10.1371/journal.pone.0331124.g004 Fig 4 Imputation enables visualization of unobserved contact decay profiles. Contact decay profiles for training (green outline), validation (orange outline), test (red outline) and unobserved data (purple outline) are shown. The inset shows an example of one contact decay profile with the distance from the diagonal (X-axis) plotted against the intensity (Y-axis), which is the mean value for all normalized contacts at that distance from the diagonal. Axes are consistent across all panels. 10.1371/journal.pone.0331124.g005 Fig 5 Imputation enables visualization of unobserved eigenvector profiles. Eigenvector profiles for training (green outline), validation (orange outline), test (red outline) and unobserved data (purple outline) are shown. The inset shows an example of the eigenvector profile with the position (X-axis) plotted against the eigenvector value (Y-axis). Axes are consistent across all panels. 10.1371/journal.pone.0331124.g006 Fig 6 Imputation enables visualization of unobserved insulation score profiles. Insulation score profiles for training (green outline), validation (orange outline), test (red outline) and unobserved data (purple outline) are shown. The inset shows an example of the insulation score profile with the position (X-axis) plotted against the insulation (Y-axis). Axes are consistent across all panels. Finally, based on these imputed values, we computed complete pairwise correlation matrices for cell types and assay types ( Fig 7 2.4 c 1 c 2 c 1 a c 2 a a in situ 10.1371/journal.pone.0331124.g007 Fig 7 Comparisons of cell types and assay types based on contact decay, eigenvectors, and insulation scores. In each panel, the Pearson correlation is calculated between the (left column) contact decay profiles, (middle column) eigenvectors, and (right column) insulation scores for each of the cell types with shared assays (top row) and assays with shared cell types (bottom row). The lower triangle is the correlation after missing contact maps have been imputed, and the upper triangle is correlation with no imputation. Blue squares indicate comparisons that were not possible due to unobserved experiments. The dendrogram is computed using the imputed values. 3.3 Imputation reveals hypotheses for contact decay profiles and insulation score Using our held out validation and test datasets, we can verify that hypotheses generated by our imputations are plausible. For example, when we consider contact decay profiles ( Fig 4 27 Another example can be seen in the insulation scores for dilution Hi-C ( Fig 6 3.4 Sphinx on larger scale data To investigate how Sphinx’s performance changes when trained from more data, we trained the model on chromosome 1 with the same set-up as when trained on chromosome 19. We kept the sum of the normalized logged counts the be same as in chromosome 19, which meant that on average, the counts when we trained chromosome 1 were lower because there are more bins in chromosome 1. Chromosome 1, after pruning, was 2232 × 2232, compared to 556 × 556 in chromosome 19. We reasoned that because there were changes in sparsity and number of bins, we should conduct a hyperparameter search for chromosome 1. Because there were more bins in chromosome 1, training this model was more computationally intensive, and hence we were unable to conduct a full hyperparameter search. We checked around 150 hyperparameter combinations, as opposed to the 500 combinations in chromosome 19. The deep imputation model outperformed the cross-mean baseline model in validation in 89 hyperparameter combinations, but visually, the most significant improvements were made when the initial learning rate was 0.0005, which was not observed in chromosome 19 ( Fig 8A Fig 8B Fig 8C Fig 8D 10.1371/journal.pone.0331124.g008 Fig 8 On sparser data, Sphinx outperforms the baseline in validation data, but not in test data. (A) We conducted a hyperparameter search using the standard Sphinx model for chromosome 1 with around 150 hyperparameters tested. (B) Raw MSE, contact decay profile MSE, eigenvector MSE, and insulation score MSE are compared between Sphinx and the cross-mean model, similarly to in Fig 3 We further attempted to run Sphinx at 10 kb on chromosome 19 (S1 Sect); however, we suspect that many of the same issues we experienced with chromosome 1 were exacerbated at 10kb resolution. Namely, there was increased sparsity at 10kb resolution and due to computational constraints, we did not conduct as extensive of a hyperparameter search. 3.5 Experimenting with a convolutional architecture A convolutional architecture ( Fig 9A 10.1371/journal.pone.0331124.g009 Fig 9 Convolutional Sphinx architecture does not improve performance over standard architecture (a) Cell type and assay factors are input into the hidden layers as in Fig 2 y x We used the Sphinx model to make predictions on each of the test set examples, as in Fig 3 Fig 9B Fig 9C 4 Discussion Each distinct 3D contact map assay provides unique insights into the biology of the cell type that it is used on. Some methods, such as in-situ Hi-C, micro-C, or DNase Hi-C, aim to provide global contact maps. Other methods, such as ChIA-PET or PLAC-seq, focus on interactions mediated by particular proteins. DNA SPRITE includes contacts that are physically more distant, such as in the case of nuclear bodies. These distinct purposes can provide complementary insights. Although many chromatin 3D contact maps have been collected for combinations of assays and human cell types, there are still many combinations that have not been collected. This missingness motivates a computational method to impute unobserved experiments in order to generate hypotheses and enable downstream analyses that require complete observations. We first developed baseline methods that take the average of experiments either using only the same assay, the same cell type, or either. We then improved on these baseline methods using our machine learning model to predict areas where the baseline method was most likely to be incorrect. We demonstrated that we improved upon the baseline methods in many of the validation cases and more often than not in the test set ( Fig 3A 3B In our matrix of 88 potential contact maps from the 4DN web portal, we produced imputed experiments for the 47 unobserved experiments ( Fig 10 Fig 7 10.1371/journal.pone.0331124.g010 Fig 10 Sphinx imputes contact maps for unobserved assay-cell type combinations. The plot is similar to Fig 1 A limitation of this work is that the number of available experiments is currently somewhat small, limiting both the training and evaluation of such models. We found that increasing the number of training experiments was associated with a decrease in the MSE ( Fig 3 Supporting information S1 File (PDF) References 1 Kempfer R Pombo A Methods for mapping 3D chromosome architecture Nat Rev Genet. 2020 21 4 207 26 31848476 10.1038/s41576-019-0195-2 2 Meaburn KJ Gudla PR Khan S Lockett SJ Misteli T Disease-specific gene repositioning in breast cancer J Cell Biol. 2009 187 6 801 12 doi: 10.1083/jcb.200909127 19995938 PMC2806312 3 Spielmann M Lupiáñez DG Mundlos S Structural variation in the 3D genome Nat Rev Genet. 2018 19 7 453 67 doi: 10.1038/s41576-018-0007-0 29692413 4 Krijger PHL de Laat W Regulation of disease-associated gene expression in the 3D genome Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol. 2016 17 12 771 82 doi: 10.1038/nrm.2016.138 27826147 5 Lieberman-Aiden E van Berkum NL Williams L Imakaev M Ragoczy T Telling A et al Comprehensive mapping of long-range interactions reveals folding principles of the human genome Science. 2009 326 5950 289 93 doi: 10.1126/science.1181369 19815776 PMC2858594 6 Fullwood MJ Liu MH Pan YF Xu H Mohamed YB Orlov YL et al An oestrogen-receptor-alpha-bound human chromatin interactome Nature. 2009 462 7269 58 64 19890323 10.1038/nature08497 PMC2774924 7 Rao SSP Huntley MH Durand NC Stamenova EK Bochkov ID Robinson JT et al A 3D map of the human genome at kilobase resolution reveals principles of chromatin looping Cell. 2014 159 7 1665 80 doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2014.11.021 25497547 PMC5635824 8 Hsieh T-HS Weiner A Lajoie B Dekker J Friedman N Rando OJ Mapping nucleosome resolution chromosome folding in yeast by Micro-C Cell. 2015 162 1 108 19 doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2015.05.048 26119342 PMC4509605 9 Fang R Yu M Li G Chee S Liu T Schmitt AD et al Mapping of long-range chromatin interactions by proximity ligation-assisted ChIP-seq Cell Res. 2016 26 12 1345 8 doi: 10.1038/cr.2016.137 27886167 PMC5143423 10 Ramani V Cusanovich DA Hause RJ Ma W Qiu R Deng X et al Mapping 3D genome architecture through in situ DNase Hi-C Nat Protoc. 2016 11 11 2104 21 doi: 10.1038/nprot.2016.126 27685100 PMC5547819 11 Quinodoz SA Ollikainen N Tabak B Palla A Schmidt JM Detmar E et al Higher-order inter-chromosomal hubs shape 3D genome organization in the nucleus Cell. 2018 174 3 744 757.e24 doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2018.05.024 29887377 PMC6548320 12 Mumbach MR Rubin AJ Flynn RA Dai C Khavari PA Greenleaf WJ et al HiChIP: efficient and sensitive analysis of protein-directed genome architecture Nat Methods. 2016 13 11 919 22 doi: 10.1038/nmeth.3999 27643841 PMC5501173 13 Beagrie RA Scialdone A Schueler M Kraemer DC Chotalia M Xie SQ et al Complex multi-enhancer contacts captured by genome architecture mapping Nature. 2017 543 7646 519 24 28273065 10.1038/nature21411 PMC5366070 14 Reiff SB Schroeder AJ Kırlı K Cosolo A Bakker C Mercado L et al The 4D Nucleome Data Portal as a resource for searching and visualizing curated nucleomics data Nat Commun. 2022 13 1 2365 doi: 10.1038/s41467-022-29697-4 35501320 PMC9061818 15 Dekker J Belmont AS Guttman M Leshyk VO Lis JT Lomvardas S et al The 4D nucleome project Nature. 2017 549 7671 219 26 doi: 10.1038/nature23884 28905911 PMC5617335 16 Fudenberg G Kelley DR Pollard KS Predicting 3D genome folding from DNA sequence with Akita Nat Methods. 2020 17 11 1111 7 doi: 10.1038/s41592-020-0958-x 33046897 PMC8211359 17 Schwessinger R Gosden M Downes D Brown RC Oudelaar AM Telenius J et al DeepC: predicting 3D genome folding using megabase-scale transfer learning Nat Methods. 2020 17 11 1118 24 33046896 10.1038/s41592-020-0960-3 PMC7610627 18 Zhou J Sequence-based modeling of three-dimensional genome architecture from kilobase to chromosome scale Nat Genet. 2022 54 5 725 34 doi: 10.1038/s41588-022-01065-4 35551308 PMC9186125 19 Zhang S Chasman D Knaack S Roy S In silico prediction of high-resolution Hi-C interaction matrices Nat Commun. 2019 10 1 5449 doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-13423-8 31811132 PMC6898380 20 Yang R Das A Gao VR Karbalayghareh A Noble WS Bilmes JA et al Epiphany: predicting hi-c contact maps from 1d epigenomic signals Genome Biology. 2023 24 1 134 37280678 10.1186/s13059-023-02934-9 PMC10242996 21 Liu T Wang Z DeepChIA-PET: accurately predicting ChIA-PET from Hi-C and ChIP-seq with deep dilated networks PLoS Comput Biol. 2023 19 7 doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011307 37440599 PMC10368233 22 Ernst J Kellis M Large-scale imputation of epigenomic datasets for systematic annotation of diverse human tissues Nat Biotechnol. 2015 33 4 364 76 doi: 10.1038/nbt.3157 25690853 PMC4512306 23 Durham TJ Libbrecht MW Howbert JJ Bilmes J Noble WS PREDICTD PaRallel epigenomics data imputation with cloud-based tensor decomposition Nat Commun. 2018 9 1 1402 doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-03635-9 29643364 PMC5895786 24 Schreiber J Durham T Bilmes J Noble WS Avocado: a multi-scale deep tensor factorization method learns a latent representation of the human epigenome Genome Biol. 2020 21 1 81 doi: 10.1186/s13059-020-01977-6 32228704 PMC7104480 25 Kingma D, Ba J.

You may also include additional comments for the author, including concerns about dual publication, research ethics, or publication ethics. (Please upload your review as an attachment if it exceeds 20,000 characters) Reviewer #1: I suggest the authors to expand the discussion on the limitations of the tool to impute loops. It may require a new layer to be included in the network. It is not necessary to do it at this point but it would be beneficial to point this out. I would recommend a quick additional analysis to benchmark when comparing the maps. Could the authors calculate the Pearson as a function of genomic distance (for example 10.1073/pnas.161360711 - SI and 10.1093/nar/gkaa818 - fig.4 G)? Did the authors try to impute inter-chromosomal maps? That would be interesting to comment on that result or comment as a potential improvement of the model in later versions. Reviewer #2: The available submitted PDF by the authors already contains the responses to three reviewers and manuscript modifications. I understand that this correspond to a previous review round for publication at PLoS One and that these responses should be considered, but if so this was not apparent to me from the invite or the instructions provided. The authors have addressed most of the reviewers concerns and extensibly modified the manuscript. My reviewer recommendation is a minor revision with my specific comments below: Figure 1. The introduction states “among the 88 possible contact maps, 4DN has carried out 41. Our goal is to accurately impute the missing 47 contact maps”. However, the figure legend reads “44 non-missing contact maps”. Figure 2. Scheme is unclear, text labels are inconsistently positioned, some boxes are empty with unclear meaning, why positions are highlighted with blue circles is not described Page 6. MSE (mean squared error) is an undefined acronym, even though very common I think the authors should define it once when first mentioned in the text. Figure 4 is referenced in the text out of order (after Figure 9), figure numbers should be arranged in the order they are referenced in the text There are some missing references in reviewer responses (both to papers, sections and figures in the manuscript), probably errors in the LaTeX formatting ********** 6.
