Extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3) is an antioxidant enzyme that regulates oxidative stress and is regarded as a tumor suppressor. However, studies have demonstrated that SOD3 can either promote or inhibit cell proliferation and survival in various cancers, and its molecular mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment are poorly understood. In this study, we report a breakthrough in uncovering the role of SOD3 derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in LUAD.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most prevalent subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), comprises approximately 40% of NSCLC cases. Despite significant advancements in early diagnosis and treatment methods, a cohort study on metastatic LUAD indicates that patients have a low 5-year survival rate of only 6% [ 1 3 4 5 While various cell types, including tumor, stromal, and immune cells, contribute to the formation of the TME, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) serve as primary components in the stroma. Factors secreted by CAFs, such as growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, exosomes, and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, promote capillary formation, lymphangiogenesis, tumor invasion, and metastasis [ 6 7 8 9 10 Hypoxia-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause the reversible oxidation of cysteine thiol groups, leading to structural modifications that significantly alter protein function [ 11 12 13 SOD3 14 16 SOD3 17 18 19 Here, we discovered that SOD3 is predominantly expressed in CAFs, and its expression is associated with recurrence in LUAD patients. Using a mouse xenograft LUAD model transplanted with human-derived CAF, we showed that overexpression of SOD3 in CAF induces lymphangiogenesis, resulting in tumor metastasis in the lymph nodes. Mechanistically, transcriptome analysis revealed that SOD3 overexpression in CAF enhanced cancer exacerbation-related genes, particularly angiogenesis, lymph vessel development, collagen degradation, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Our findings suggest that SOD3 may be a prognostic factor for LUAD patients, and SOD3-expressing CAF could be a potential therapeutic target to disrupt the stroma-tumor alliance relation in tumor development and progression. Materials and methods Human samples Surgical tissue samples ( n Cell lines and mice The human NSCLC cell line (PC9), acquired from the RIKEN BRC cell bank (RCB4455), was utilized in this study. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (043-30085, Fujifilm, Japan) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (A5256701, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 20 2 SOD3 overexpression in CAFs and PC9 For SOD3 overexpression in CAFs and PC9, the lentiviral vector pLV[Exp]-mCherry-EF1A > hSOD3 [ NM_003102.4 ® 5 SOD3 SOD3 mCherry SOD3 mCherry SOD3 2 Single-cell RNA sequence data analysis in LUAD clinical tissue samples Accession number GSE131907 21 22 1 p Bulk RNA sequence and transcriptomic analysis CAF and CAF SOD3 ® GSEA was conducted on a total gene of 20,829 genes using GSEA (v4.3.2) software downloaded from the GSEA website ( http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp SOD3 LUAD xenograft mouse model For xenograft tumor models, tumors were implanted subcutaneously through co-injection of PC9 cells and CAF, CAF mCherry SOD3 5 5 mCherry SOD3 Tissue processing for histological examination The harvested mouse tumor and lymph node samples were processed into formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections. The samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h and subsequently dehydrated in 70, 80, 90, and 100% ethanol and xylene. Finally, the samples were embedded in paraffin, and serial Sect. (4 μm thick) were prepared for hematoxylin and eosin (HE), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and fluorescent IHC. Immunohistochemistry For immunostaining, the following antibodies were used: SOD3 (1:100, AF3420, R&D), CD31 (1:100, 3528, Cell Signaling Technology), α-SMA (1:100, 19245, Cell Signaling Technology), LYVE1 (1:50, MAB2125, R&D), CK7 (1:50, 4898, Cell Signaling Technology), CK7 (1:40, M7018, Dako), and Podoplanin (1:50, M3619, Dako). All FFPE sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, followed by H 2 2 Fluorescent immunohistochemistry Fluorescent immunohistochemistry for SOD3, α-SMA, and CK7 was performed. After the tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, antigen retrieval was conducted using microwave heating in 0.01 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for 5 min. Next, the sections were incubated in a blocking solution containing 1% BSA, 2% normal donkey serum, and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (0.05 M Tris base, 0.155 M NaCl) for 20 min at room temperature. The sections were then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies used were SOD3 (1:100, AF3420, R&D), α-SMA (1:200, 19245, Cell Signaling Technology), and CK7 (1:40, M7018, Dako). Secondary antibodies were diluted to 1:100 and applied for 1 h at room temperature. The secondary antibodies used included Alexa Fluor 555 anti-rabbit IgG (A32794, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) for α-SMA, Alexa Fluor 488 anti-goat IgG ( A32814 Western blotting Cells were washed with cold PBS, and whole cell lysate was extracted with a lysis buffer, a mixture of RIPA buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS), a complete mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and phosphate inhibitor cocktails 2 and 3 (Sigma-Aldrich, Burlington, MA, USA). After normalization of protein concentration, samples were mixed with 3×SDS sample buffer (188 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 3% SDS, 30% Glycerol, 0.01% Bromophenol blue) and boiled at 95 °C for 10 min. Protein samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were blocked in 3% skim milk (31149-75, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) prepared in TBS-T (0.05 M Tris base, 0.155 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h with shaking at room temperature. The primary antibodies were applied to the membrane and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibodies for western blot analysis were SOD3 (1:1000, AF3420, R&D), VEGFA (1:1000, 50661 CST), VEGFR2 (1:1000, 2479, CST), p-VEGFR2 (1:1000, 2478, CST), E-cadherin (1:1000, 13-1900, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA), N-cadherin (1:1000, 13116, Cell Signaling Technology), and β-actin (1:1000, 81115-1-RR, Proteintech). Then, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h with shaking at room temperature. Before and after secondary antibody incubation, 10 min, three times washes with TBS-T with shaking were performed. Blots were visualized with Fusion Solo 7 S Imaging System (Vilber, France). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) The total RNA was isolated and purified using the Monarch Total RNA Miniprep Kit (T2010S, New England Biolabs). The quantity of RNA was assessed using an Implen NanoPhotometer (Implen GmbH). For cDNA synthesis, 500 ng to 1 µg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using the SuperScript IV VILO Master Mix (11756050, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) in a total reaction volume of 20 µL. qRT-PCR was performed using the KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix (2×) Kit (KAPA Biosystems) on a Bio-Rad real-time PCR system. Each reaction was carried out in a total volume of 20 µL containing 1 µL of cDNA template, 10 µL of 2× master mix, and 0.4 µM of each primer. The thermal cycling conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Gene expression levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene ACTB (β-Actin) or PRL13A and calculated using the 2 −ΔΔCt 1 DCFDA Intracellular ROS levels were assessed using the DCFDA Cellular ROS Detection Assay Kit (Abcam, ab113851), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cells (2.5 × 10 4 Treatment of PC9 cells with conditioned medium We prepared different conditioned media (CM) from CAF mCherry SOD3 5 mCherry SOD3 VEGFR phosphorylation assay To assess the activation of VEGF signaling, VEGFR2 phosphorylation was examined by western blotting.

SOD3 protein expression levels were semi-quantitatively assessed by two independent observers using a standard staining intensity scoring system ranging from 0 to 3: 0 (no staining), 1 (weak), 2 (moderate), and 3 (strong) (Supplementary Fig. 1B). Based on these scores, samples were stratified into SOD3-low (Score 0, 1) and SOD3-high (Score 2, 3) groups for further analysis.

Results SOD3 expression in fibroblasts positively correlates with the recurrence in LUAD To assess the SOD3 expression pattern in LUAD, we performed immunohistochemistry in clinical samples. As shown in Fig. 1 1 1 1 p 1  Fig. 1 SOD3 expression in fibroblasts positively correlates with recurrence in LUAD. A B n P C GSE131907 D E F G H To identify the major source cells secreting SOD3 in the LUAD TME, we performed a scRNA sequence analysis using a publicly available database by Kim et al. ( GSE131907 21 1 1 1 CAF-derived SOD3 alters the phenotype of LUAD cancer cells in vivo To investigate the role of CAF-derived SOD3 in the LUAD TME, we overexpressed SOD3 in LUAD patient-derived CAFs [ 20 2 2  Fig. 2 SOD3-rich CAFs’ impact on the tumor phenotype in LUAD xenografts.

Histological analysis of tumor samples revealed that CAF SOD3 SOD3 2 To gain further insight into tumor infiltration into the vessel-like structures, we performed IHC staining using CD31, a blood vessel endothelial cell marker (Fig. 2 2 SOD3 2 SOD3 2 These data indicate that SOD3 overexpression in CAFs promotes tumor invasion into the blood and lymphatic vessels. SOD3 overexpression in CAF promotes tumor metastasis to lymph nodes and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process in LUAD Given the observed lymphatic vessel invasion of the tumor, we next investigated lymph node metastasis in tumor-transplanted mice. Lymph nodes were harvested, formalin-fixed, and embedded in paraffin for histological analysis. HE staining of lymph node sections revealed tumor cell invasion (Fig. 3 3 SOD3 3 3  Fig. 3 SOD3 overexpression in CAF enhances the lymph node metastasis and EMT in PC9 cells.

A B C D E F Taken together, these data indicate that SOD3 high expression in fibroblasts is associated with the pro-tumorigenic traits in LUAD. SOD3 expression in fibroblasts positively correlates with the rate of lymphatic invasion of tumors in LUAD clinical samples Finally, we analyzed the correlation between tumor invasive character and SOD3 expression in the fibroblasts and ECM within the LUAD TME. LUAD patient-derived biopsies were carried out by the IHC on SOD3 and divided into two groups: low and high SOD3 expression. To analyze the tumor invasive feature, we performed the double staining of CK7 together with podoplanin, a lymphatic vessel marker. As shown in Fig. 6 6 6  Fig. 6 SOD3 expression in fibroblasts positively correlates with the rate of lymphatic invasion of tumors in LUAD patients. A B P C Discussion Imbalances in redox metabolism are common characteristics of human cancers [ 23 2 − 2 2 24 25 26 27 28 29 31 23 14 32 35 SOD3 catalyzes the dismutation of O 2 − 2 2 2 2 2 36 37 38 Unlike previous studies, our research identifies CAFs as the primary source of SOD3 production in the LUAD tumor microenvironment. Through scRNA-seq and immunohistochemical analysis of clinical samples, we show that CAFs mainly produce SOD3 in the LUAD tumor microenvironment. CAFs play a pivotal role in facilitating tumor progression, migration, and metastasis by secreting various cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Importantly, SOD3 expression in stromal cells has been shown to modulate cancer cell growth and migration in thyroid cancer [ 38 Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis provide critical pathways for metastatic cancer cells to disseminate to lymph nodes and distant organs [ 39 2 2 2 2 2 2 25 2 2 2 2 40 2 2 41 42 43 2 2 44 2 2 31 45 46 47 48 50 SOD3 Lymphatic endothelial cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes undergo reprogramming to acquire an immunosuppressive phenotype, thereby facilitating tumor metastasis [ 51 52 53 54 55 19 56 18 This study has several limitations. While we used patient-derived human CAFs and confirmed key findings in clinical LUAD samples, the in vivo experiments were conducted in xenograft models, where human tumor cells and CAFs interact with murine stromal components. Such cross-species interactions may not fully recapitulate the complexity of the human tumor microenvironment, particularly in terms of endothelial cell signaling, matrix composition, and cytokine responses. Additionally, the use of immunodeficient mice precludes the involvement of the immune system, which is known to modulate tumor progression and stromal dynamics. Another limitation is the absence of a definitive loss-of-function model for SOD3. Although we attempted CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of SOD3 in CAFs, complete depletion resulted in significant cell death and reduced viability, indicating that SOD3 is essential for CAF survival under our experimental conditions. Consequently, we utilized control CAFs with low endogenous SOD3 expression as comparators in our overexpression studies. While this approach allowed us to examine the functional impact of elevated SOD3 levels without inducing cytotoxic stress, it does not fully recapitulate the effects of SOD3 loss. Despite these limitations, the consistency between xenograft findings and clinical validation supports the relevance of our conclusions. Furthermore, while the precise mechanism underlying the interplay between SOD3 and lymph node metastasis was not directly addressed in this study, previous research, consistent with our RNA sequencing data, suggests that SOD3 mediates VEGF-dependent tumor progression, lymphangiogenesis, and metastasis in breast cancer [ 46 Taken together, targeting cell-specific SOD3 may represent a promising treatment strategy for cancer. Our findings further propose that SOD3-rich CAFs may serve as a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for LUAD patients. However, therapeutic targeting of SOD3-rich CAF in the tumor microenvironment has significant challenges. One major obstacle is the stromal heterogeneity. Even the CAF population has diverse subpopulations with distinct functions, which have opposite effects. Thus, targeting the whole population may result in an unwanted outcome. Moreover, there are potential compensatory mechanisms among redox-regulating enzymes, and the physiological role of SOD3 in maintaining normal tissue homeostasis could limit the safety and specificity of such interventions or may result in off-target effects. Future studies are needed to develop strategies that selectively inhibit tumor-promoting SOD3 activity without disrupting its systemic protective functions.
