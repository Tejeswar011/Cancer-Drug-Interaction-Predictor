Recent interest has shifted toward understanding its broader metabolic effects through metabolomics. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on the biochemical mechanisms and therapeutic implications of the KD, with a particular focus on metabolomic profiling and neurological health. Methods: This narrative review synthesizes findings from the last five years of metabolomic studies investigating the biochemical consequences of the KD and its variants, including the classical KD, modified Atkins diet (MAD), medium-chain triglyceride diet (MCT), and low glycemic index treatment (LGIT). The review integrates data on analytical techniques, such as liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and evaluates alterations in key metabolic pathways. Results: The KD significantly modulates energy metabolism, shifting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation and ketone body utilization. It affects mitochondrial function, one-carbon metabolism, redox balance, neurotransmitter regulation, and gut–brain axis signaling. Metabolomic profiling has identified β-hydroxybutyrate (βHB) as a key regulatory metabolite influencing mitochondrial respiration. Long-term KD use may impact renal and hepatic function, necessitating clinical caution and individualized nutritional monitoring. Conclusions: Metabolomic analysis provides critical insights into the multifaceted effects of the KD, supporting its role as a targeted metabolic therapy in neurological diseases. However, potential risks linked to prolonged ketosis warrant further investigation.

Introduction The ketogenic diet (KD) is a nutritional model characterized by high fat content, moderate protein intake, and very low carbohydrate consumption, which leads to a marked reduction in glucose availability as the primary energy source [ 1 2 3 The KD should primarily be regarded as a therapeutic intervention rather than a conventional dietary approach. Its application is rooted in clinical contexts, most notably in the management of drug-resistant epilepsy, where its efficacy has been documented for nearly a century [ 4 5 6 Originally developed for epilepsy, particularly in children, the KD remains an important clinical tool in neurology [ 7 5 6 8 9 10 7 At the mechanistic level, the therapeutic potential of the KD derives from its ability to induce ketosis and thereby shift cellular energy metabolism from glucose to ketone utilization [ 2 11 The investigation of these mechanisms has been greatly advanced by metabolomics, which enables comprehensive profiling of metabolic alterations associated with the KD [ 9 2 9 Clinically, the KD has shown robust efficacy in reducing seizure frequency in drug-resistant epilepsy, with benefits documented in both pediatric and adult populations [ 4 7 1 6 10 5 9 Despite this broad therapeutic potential, the long-term safety and sustainability of the KD remain controversial. Reported side effects include dyslipidemia, nephrolithiasis, gastrointestinal discomfort, micronutrient deficiencies, and, in children, impaired growth [ 3 7 In this context, metabolomic studies are uniquely positioned to clarify both the benefits and risks of the KD, offering a systems-level perspective on its multifaceted effects. By integrating metabolomic data with clinical outcomes, researchers can identify biomarkers predictive of efficacy and safety, stratify patients most likely to benefit from dietary intervention, and refine therapeutic strategies. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of recent clinical and preclinical studies on the KD and its therapeutic variants, with a particular focus on neurological disorders. Besides summarizing established clinical outcomes, we emphasize how metabolomic and complementary high-throughput approaches—such as LC-MS, GC-MS, NMR, magnetic resonance spectroscopy/imaging (MRS/MRI), and stable isotope tracing—have advanced our understanding of KD-induced biochemical and physiological adaptations. These technologies allow precise mapping of metabolic remodeling, including alterations in lipid and amino acid pathways, ketone body fluxes, mitochondrial function, and neurotransmitter metabolism. By integrating these insights with clinical data, metabolomics not only describes the metabolic shifts elicited by the KD but also identifies predictive and mechanistic biomarkers that support a more personalized and safe application of this dietary therapy. In this context, metabolomics has transformed the understanding of the KD from a descriptive dietary intervention into a mechanistically defined therapy, providing both explanatory and predictive insights. Recently, there has been a significant increase in interest in the KD. On the Pub-Med platform, 5581 articles have been published in the time frame 1931–2025. However, more than 50% of these publications were written in the last five years. There are far fewer papers combining the topic of KD and metabolite research—only 226 articles between 1979 and 2025—and more than 64% of these were written in the last five years ( Figure 1 The literature review was conducted based on an analysis of scientific articles related to the ketogenic diet, metabolism, and the application of chromatographic techniques in their investigation. The focus was primarily on publications from the past five years. The literature was selected using search results from the Google Scholar https://scholar.google.com https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov In recent years, there has been a dynamic increase in interest in the KD in the context of various diseases, which is reflected in the number of scientific publications available on the PubMed platform, presented in Figure 2 2. Milestones of the KD Ketogenic therapy, understood today as a medical intervention using the effects of the state of ketosis on the pathophysiology of selected diseases, has its roots going back to antiquity. Already in medical texts attributed to Hippocrates of Kos (c. 460–370 BC) and his disciples and successors—collected in the so-called Corpus Hippocraticum—there are references to the therapeutic use of fasting in the treatment of epileptic seizures [ 12 13 14 The first modern reports on the use of starvation in the treatment of epilepsy date back to the early 20th century. In 1911, two French physicians, Guelpa and Marie, published the results of a clinical observation in which they applied fasting to 26 epileptic patients. Six of them showed a marked reduction in seizure frequency and severity [ 14 15 A more detailed report on the therapeutic use of fasting in the treatment of epilepsy was presented in 1921 by Geyelin at the congress of the American Medical Association. The results of a controlled study conducted on a group of 36 patients showed a clear reduction in the number of seizures—by up to 80% [ 16 Despite such promising results, fasting as a therapeutic method had a significant limitation—its long-term use was not feasible for physiological and practical reasons. Around the same time, research began into the possibility of nutritional control of hyperglycemia in diabetic patients. Based on the earlier work of Newburgh and Marsh, Woodyatt in 1921 proposed the use of high-fat and low-carbohydrate diets as a method of regulating blood glucose levels. He also observed that both increased dietary fat supply and fasting in healthy individuals lead to the onset of controlled ketosis, a condition in which the body, adapting to the limited availability of glucose, begins to use fats as the main source of energy. The physiological consequence of this process is an increase in the concentration of ketone bodies in the blood, such as (R)-β-hydroxybutyric acid, acetoacetic acid (AcAc), and acetone [ 17 18 In the same year, Wilder suggested that the beneficial effect of fasting on the reduction of epileptic seizures could be directly related to the induction of a state of ketosis. He proposed replacing fasting with a more sustainable method of achieving ketosis—by following a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet, which he called the “ketogenic diet”. The dietary protocol developed by Peterman called for an intake of 1 g of protein per kilogram of body weight, 10–15 g of carbohydrates per day, and the remainder of the caloric requirements to be covered by fat. This protocol, in an almost unchanged form, remains the basis of the classic KD used to this day [ 19 20 21 22 The 1920s and 1930s were a period of intensive use of the KD in clinical practice as a treatment for epilepsy. However, with the discovery and spread of new antiepileptic drugs—such as diphenylhydantoin (1938) and valproic acid (1967)—the importance of the KD gradually declined. In the following decades, it was mainly used in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy, especially in children with unsatisfactory drug treatment. The renaissance of interest in the KD occurred in the 1990s and was linked to the media-published story of Charlie, the son of film director Jim Abrams. A film documenting the effectiveness of ketogenic therapy in treating the boy’s severe drug-resistant epilepsy and the establishment of the Charlie Foundation provided the impetus for a resurgence of extensive research into the KD—in the context of treating not only epilepsy but also other neurological and metabolic diseases. Since Wilder’s introduction of the classic KD in 1921, a number of modifications to the diet have been developed to increase nutritional flexibility and better adapt to patients’ needs. In 1971, Huttenlocher and co-workers proposed the MCT, based on fats containing medium-chain fatty acids—mainly octanoic and decanoic acid—which show greater ketogenic potential [ 23 24 25 26 27 Figure 3 2.1. Classic Ketogenic Diet There are various approaches to the classic ketogenic diet (CKD). The standard CKD is a 3:1 diet. The CKD is the oldest and most thoroughly researched form of the KD. Extreme ketogenic therapy or therapy used in the initial phase of treatment to quickly achieve ketosis is based on a 4:1 ratio of fat to protein and carbohydrates in the diet, i.e., 4 g of fat for every 1 g of protein and carbohydrates. The 4:1 ratio derives about 90% of the total energy from fat, 6% from protein, and 4% from carbohydrates, which ensures a high level of ketosis. A slightly more flexible variation of the 3:1 ratio is characterized by a reduction in fat content to 87%, with protein and carbohydrates accounting for 10% and 3% of the diet, respectively. This ratio of the CKD is most often used during developmental age because it provides additional protein intake while maintaining control of epileptic seizures. The CKD is highly effective in reducing drug-resistant seizures, but requires strict adherence to dietary and supplementation recommendations, as it is associated with potential side effects such as gastrointestinal symptoms and hyperlipidemia. Close monitoring with regular check-ups and clinical assessment is essential to ensure the safety of the therapy and optimize results. The implementation of a classic ketogenic diet in children, especially infants, always requires hospitalization. Furthermore, fasting, as one of the ways to achieve ketosis, is strictly contraindicated in the youngest children and in patients with mitochondriopathies. Other forms of the ketogenic diet can be implemented on an outpatient basis in close cooperation between the patient, neurologist, and clinical dietitian [ 31 2.2. Modified Atkins Diet The MAD is a more flexible version of the CKD. The ketogenic ratio in the MAD is usually 2:1, similar to the CKD, and consists of approximately 82% fat, 12% protein, and 6% carbohydrates, which allows for moderate ketone body concentrations while improving diet compliance. A modified version of the MAD can be an even less restrictive variation of the 2:1 version and maintain a composition of 77% fat, 17% protein, and 6% carbohydrates, which further facilitates patient compliance. Unlike the CKD, the implementation of the MAD does not require hospitalization, making it suitable for older children, adolescents, and adults. Daily carbohydrate intake is limited to 10–20 g in children and 25 g in adults, with unlimited protein intake. In terms of anti-seizure efficacy, it has an effect similar to the CKD and is associated with fewer side effects [ 31 2.3. Medium-Chain Fatty Acid Diet The MCT diet involves the use of medium-chain triglycerides, which usually come from sources such as coconut oil and palm oil. Medium-chain triglycerides are more easily absorbed and converted into ketones, allowing for higher carbohydrate and protein intake than in the classic KD. In this version, 70% of total energy comes from fat, 10% from protein, and 15–19% from carbohydrates, with 30–60% of fat intake provided by MCT oil. Enriching the KD with MCTs, along with increased supplementation, is beneficial in cases of hypercholesterolemia. However, increased amounts of MCT oil in the diet are often associated with diarrhea and bloating and are therefore not preferred in the youngest patients [ 31 2.4. Low Glycemic Index Diet and Low-Carbohydrate Diet LGIT involves maintaining blood glucose levels by limiting carbohydrate intake to foods with a low glycemic index (GI < 50) rather than adhering to a strict ketogenic ratio. LGIT offers a more balanced macronutrient distribution of 60% fat, 30% protein, and 10% carbohydrates, with a daily carbohydrate intake of 40–60 g. The LGIT diet is significantly less restrictive than other ketogenic variants and is an ideal choice for patients who have not followed dietary recommendations or have experienced severe side effects from the CKD. LGIT will not result in high ketone concentrations, but it is effective in preventing seizures and ensures positive metabolic control, which may be important in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy and metabolic syndrome [ 31 Table 1 3. The Metabolic Perspective in the Context of a KD 3.1. Energy Pathway: ATP and Krebs Cycle The KD is a nutritional intervention characterized by a marked reduction in carbohydrate intake and an increase in fat consumption, leading to profound alterations in energy metabolism, particularly in ATP production, β -oxidation, and mitochondrial function [ 32 33 34 35 36 37 34 35 37 38 2 34 35 39 33 39 40 41 33 36 37 39 42 35 39 43 32 40 44 3.2. One-Carbon Metabolism 1C The one-carbon pathway is a complex network of biochemical reactions involving three major metabolic cycles: the folate cycle, the methionine cycle, and the transsulphuration pathway. These interconnected pathways play a key role in essential cellular processes such as DNA and RNA synthesis, protein and histone methylation, regulation of gene expression, and maintenance of redox homeostasis. The main functions of the pathway include the supply of methyl groups for DNA methylation, the synthesis of nucleotides (particularly purines and thymidine), and the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine [ 45 46 Key components of the pathway include methyl group donors (folate, methionine, choline, betaine), enzyme cofactors (vitamins B2, B6, B12, zinc), and major metabolites (S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), homocysteine, formate) [ 45 47 48 The most important finding regarding the effect of the KD on the one-carbon pathway is the significant inhibition of mitochondrial production of formate, a key carrier of one-carbon units in cells. Studies using a KD enriched in MCT have shown that it leads to inhibition of the activity of the glycine breakdown system (GCS)—the main mitochondrial source of formate. A 19% reduction in the plasma concentrations of formate was observed in mice using MCT-KD. In addition, the KD results in a significant reduction in carbon flux from glycine and serine to formate, whereby glycine is reduced to undetectable levels [ 49 βHB, the main ketone produced during ketosis, shows a direct inhibitory effect on the one-carbon pathway [ 50 49 βHB also affects epigenetic processes by modulating DNA methylation and histone acetylation, which may indirectly affect the one-carbon pathway through changes in gene expression. Changes in methylation status are observed in several important genes, whose methylation is particularly associated with weight loss and/or ketosis induced by a very low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (VLCKD). These genes include ZNF331, FGFRL1, CBFA2TC3ORF38, C3ORF38, JSRP1, and LRFN4 [ 50 46 50 The KD also has a significant effect on the biosynthesis of methionine, a key amino acid in the one-carbon pathway. In the liver of mice on MCT-KD, a 48% decrease in methionine synthesis from the mitochondrial-derived formate was observed. In addition, the contribution of the mitochondrial-derived formate to methionine synthesis (5-methyltetrahydrofolate-dependent) significantly reduced in the liver, by 23% [ 49 Particular attention should be paid to the effect of the KD on homocysteine homeostasis. Deficiencies in components of the mono-carbon pathway, particularly folate and vitamin B12, result in disturbances in the methylation cycle, leading to homocysteine accumulation. High levels of homocysteine are an independent risk factor for many diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, and cardiovascular problems. Research indicates that homocysteine is a marker of disruption in the one-carbon pathway rather than a direct cause of disease. Elevated homocysteine can lead to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuronal death [ 45 51 In the context of vulnerable populations, women of childbearing age should be particularly cautious about the long-term use of a KD. The mono-carbon pathway is crucial for normal fetal development, and folate deficiencies can lead to neural tube defects [ 52 48 Strategies to minimize the risks associated with the effects of a KD on the mono-carbon pathway include targeted supplementation of ingredients that support the pathway. Supplementation with folic acid or its active form (5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF)), vitamin B12 in the form of methylcarbylamine, vitamin B6 as an enzyme cofactor, and betaine as an alternative methyl group donor may help to maintain the normal function of the mono-carbon pathway [ 45 52 Below, Figure 4 3.3. Selected Other Metabolic Pathways Involved in Antioxidant Activity Low levels of insulin initiate an enzymatic reaction whereby two molecules of acetyl-CoA are converted to acetoacetate, which, in the next step, can decompose to acetone or be metabolically converted to βHB. In addition to its function as an energy substrate, βHB also acts as a signaling molecule influencing mitochondrial function and TCA efficiency [ 53 54 55 2 55 56 βHB, as the main ketone metabolite formed during ketosis, is a key factor in modulating redox processes in the body through direct and indirect antioxidant mechanisms. The KD has a significant effect on oxidative stress through a number of related metabolic pathways, in which ketone bodies act directly as free radical scavengers and indirectly modulate redox pathways by increasing the NAD + 57 58 57 Experimental studies confirm the efficacy of the restrictive KD in reducing oxidative stress, as demonstrated in a four-week study on young rats with diet-induced obesity, where the KD reduced oxidative stress through an increase in the activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) and a decrease in malondialdehyde (MDA-a marker of lipid peroxidation) [ 59 60 61 The KD also leads to a significant increase in glutathione (GSH) levels in neural tissue, which has been confirmed in both animal studies and clinical observations in patients with epilepsy [ 62 63 64 62 64 3.4. The Gut–Brain Axis and Neurotransmitters The biochemical mechanisms of the KD in the context of neuroprotection are based on complex interactions between energy metabolism, the composition of the gut microbiome, and neurotransmitter balance in the brain. βHB, as the main metabolite of the KD, is a key signaling molecule that not only modulates neurotransmitter gene expression in the brain, but also has a direct effect on the composition and functionality of the gut microbiome [ 65 The KD induces profound changes in the composition of the gut microbiome, increasing the proportion of beneficial bacterial strains such as Akkermansia muciniphila Bacteroides Bifidobacterium 66 67 Lactobacillus 66 A key metabolic aspect of the KD is its effect on the GABA/glutamate ratio in the brain, where βHB, through inactivation of glutamate dehydrogenase, redirects glutamate metabolism from a catabolic process to the GABA biosynthesis pathway via glutamic acid decarboxylase [ 65 68 3.5. Controversies Surrounding the KD in the Context of Selected Organs Implementing the KD in patients with diverse diseases presents numerous challenges. The diet requires strict adherence to specific macronutrient ratios, which can be demanding in clinical practice and often leads to reduced long-term compliance. Continuous medical supervision and regular monitoring of biochemical parameters are therefore essential to ensure both efficacy and safety [ 69 Long-term KD use is also associated with several controversies, primarily due to the scarcity of studies exceeding 5–6 years and uncertainty about the safety of maintaining such a restrictive diet over extended periods. Limiting the intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can lead to deficiencies in vitamins (A, E, B6, folate) and minerals (magnesium, calcium, potassium), as well as insufficient fiber consumption, which may promote acid–base imbalance and impair gastrointestinal function [ 70 71 71 72 73 70 74 Adherence remains a major limitation, as most patients discontinue the KD within months. While short-term use (several weeks up to one year) can provide meaningful clinical benefits, prolonged implementation (≥2 years) is often associated with increased risk of lipid abnormalities without clear advantages over less restrictive dietary approaches [ 75 76 4. Analytical Challenges and High-Throughput Metabolomic Approaches in KD Research 4.1. Analytical Challenges in KD Metabolomics Over the last few years, the main analytical methods used in metabolomics have undergone significant development. One of the earliest and still widely applied techniques in KD-related research is NMR spectroscopy. This method has been employed for more than 40 years in metabolic studies, profiling of body fluids, and tissue analysis due to its ability to characterize the chemical composition of complex mixtures. However, its role has been partly superseded by more advanced technologies, such as mass spectrometry (MS) and two-dimensional MS, which provide higher sensitivity, broader compound coverage, and compatibility with various separation techniques [ 7 77 8 45 Currently, chromatographic methods coupled with mass spectrometry are most commonly used, with LC-MS and GC-MS combinations selected depending on the specific requirements of a study. These approaches enable both qualitative and quantitative determination of hundreds of endogenous compounds in body fluids and tissues. The challenge, however, is to capture metabolites with highly diverse physical and chemical properties. This can be addressed through the careful selection of chromatographic columns, detectors, solvents, mobile phases, analysis parameters, and sample preparation methods, thereby increasing the number of metabolites identified in a single run from hundreds to thousands. Table 2 Table 3 In addition to MS-based techniques, other bioanalytical assays continue to play a supportive role in metabolomics. These include kinetic and enzymatic colorimetric tests (e.g., for urea, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoproteins), immunological electrochemiluminescence assays (for hormones such as cortisol, insulin, and C-peptide) [ 78 79 80 5 11 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 4.2. High-Throughput Metabolomic and Imaging Approaches While analytical barriers exist, recent high-throughput studies have demonstrated how these methods directly contributed to uncovering KD mechanisms. Over the past decade, targeted and untargeted LC-MS/GC-MS studies have mapped KD-driven pathway remodeling in humans and patients with epilepsy, firmly anchoring clinical effects to biochemistry. In healthy adults, a three-week KD consumed without caloric restriction produced a marked shift toward mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation with elevations in free fatty acids and acylcarnitines, a redistribution of serum amino acids (reduced glucogenic amino acids, higher BCAA), and changes in tryptophan–kynurenine metabolism consistent with anti-inflammatory signaling—metabolic features that co-occurred with lower insulin and triglycerides [ 78 86 87 1 88 NMR-based metabolomics has extended this system’s view into the central nervous system by simultaneously profiling serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during controlled interventions. In a cross-over trial of individuals at risk for Alzheimer’s disease, a modified Mediterranean ketogenic diet (MMKD) selectively altered CSF amino acids and increased CSF BCAA-degradation products while reprogramming serum lipoprotein composition and lowering systemic inflammatory signatures; cross-compartment correlation networks further showed coordinated shifts between serum ketone bodies and CSF metabolites, supporting a diet-to-brain metabolic relay [ 89 In vivo MRS/MRI studies provide mechanistic, tissue-resolved readouts that align with the biochemical profiles above. Longitudinal 1H-MRS in adults with intractable epilepsy documented pronounced increases in absolute brain GSH—particularly in gray matter—alongside ~50% seizure reduction during KD with emulsified MCT oil, strengthening the case that KD augments neuronal redox capacity as part of its anticonvulsant action [ 62 63 64 42 Stable isotope tracing has been pivotal for quantifying pathway fluxes that static metabolite levels cannot resolve. Dual-tracer (C 13 13 13 90 Miller and colleagues conducted a 12-week intervention in 29 active adults using targeted analyses of mitochondrial function in skeletal muscle biopsies and blood serum. The ketogenic diet significantly improved metabolic parameters, increasing fat oxidation at rest and reducing insulinemia. Mitochondrial analyses showed improved efficiency in the utilization of fatty acid substrates, with minimal utilization of ketone substrates and a significant increase in muscle triglycerides. The study aimed to understand the mechanisms of action of the ketogenic diet in combination with physical training [ 56 In animal model studies, Mayengbam and colleagues performed an untargeted metabolomic analysis using LC-QTOF-MS on brain tissue from young mice of three strains fed a ketogenic or standard diet. The analysis revealed significant changes in the brain’s metabolic profile, including a decrease in methionine and carnitine concentrations, an increase in glutathione, pantothenate, and glutamine concentrations, and changes in metabolites of nucleotide, bile acid, and folate pathways. The aim was to understand the mechanisms of action of the ketogenic diet on brain structure development [ 91 Castro and his team used targeted metabolomics with the MxP Quant 500 platform in ApoE − − 92 Finally, integrated microbiome–metabolome studies have started to bridge dietary composition, host metabolism, and clinical response. In children with drug-resistant epilepsy, three months of KD produced broad serum metabolomic remodeling; importantly, specific lipids (plasmalogens) correlated with seizure reduction and with beneficial gut microbes, while potentially unfavorable taxa showed opposite associations—suggesting that metabolite–microbe networks may modulate, or even predict, therapeutic response to the KD [ 93 94 Collectively, these examples demonstrate that high-throughput platforms are not ancillary, but mechanistically decisive: LC-MS/GC-MS delineate pathway targets of the KD (fatty-acid oxidation, BCAA, and kynurenine metabolism), NMR metabolomics exposes coordinated blood–CSF remodeling, in vivo MRS/MRI verifies redox and neurotransmission changes within brain tissue and maps structural adaptations, and C 13 Table 2 Table 3 4.3. Clinical and Safety Considerations Implementing the KD across diverse patient populations presents significant challenges related to adherence, tolerability, and long-term safety. Short-term benefits are often accompanied by transient side effects, such as fatigue, constipation, gastrointestinal discomfort, and electrolyte disturbances, which can be particularly burdensome in older patients or those with comorbidities [ 70 71 Long-term use of the KD raises more complex concerns. Restrictive macronutrient ratios and the exclusion of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can contribute to deficiencies in vitamins (A, E, B6, folate) and minerals (magnesium, calcium, potassium), along with insufficient dietary fiber [ 70 71 95 96 70 97 98 97 99 Taken together, these observations underscore that the safety and efficacy of the KD are highly individualized and dependent on patient characteristics, diet composition, and intervention duration. Continuous clinical supervision with regular monitoring of biochemical and nutritional status is therefore essential [ 100 94 5. Potential of the KD in the Treatment of Various Diseases and Disorders The spectrum of therapeutic use of the KD covers a wide range of conditions. The KD has long been recognized as an extremely effective dietary approach for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy and has increasingly attracted researchers’ attention over the past decade for a variety of diseases beyond epilepsy, from obesity to malignancies [ 101 102 103 104 61 67 105 103 5.1. Drug-Resistant Epilepsy For years, significant improvements have been observed in children with drug-resistant epilepsy following diets designed to put the patient into a state of ketosis. In a 2022 study [ 28 What is problematic in studies on the efficacy of the KD is that some patients do not maintain the dietary regime throughout the follow-up period. This affects the results by reducing the study group and missing long-term results, including side effects. Modifications that are more patient-friendly and have similarly effective anticonvulsant effects may be the answer. An example is the MAD. The results of studies on the efficacy of this therapy are inconclusive. There are studies that show little difference in the effect of the cited diets, but there are also publications that discuss the superiority of the classical KD. However, even if one observes the superiority of the KD over the MAD in terms of reducing and alleviating epileptic seizures, it is a minor difference. Given the greater flexibility and easier-to-follow principles, there is some advantage of the MAD over the KD [ 26 62 The KD was primarily developed for the treatment of children suffering from drug-resistant epilepsy. The exact mechanism has not been determined. The antiepileptic effect of ketogenic therapy is pleiotropic and includes several levels that determine its anticonvulsant and anti-neurodegenerative effects. These include, first and foremost, a change in the acquisition of energy from glucose to ketone bodies. The conversion of fats to free fatty acids allows hepatic β-oxidation to produce ketone bodies (acetone, AcAc and βHB) actively involved in the Krebs cycle, which determines ATP production. There is a change in cellular energy acquisition with a doubling of ATP production when ketones are on the substrate side, followed by a reduction in oxidative stress, regulation of the neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate, and an improvement in mitochondrial function through the supply of substrates (acetyl-CoA) to the Krebs cycle. This energetically beneficial conversion in combination with chronic ketosis appears to directly and indirectly modulate neuronal and neuroglia function, which is responsible for key neuroimmune processes in epilepsy. The result is a neuroprotective effect of the KD with promotion of inhibitory (GABAergic) transmission and inhibition of excitatory (NMDA-dependent N-methyl-D-aspartate) neurotransmission. Furthermore, a favorable energy balance stabilizes the synaptic system, which plays a key role in epileptic seizure propagation [ 30 106 107 Figure 5 5.2. Obesity, Type 2 Diabetes, and Insulin Resistance The KD shows significant benefits in controlling blood glucose levels, HbA1c, and insulin sensitivity in patients with type 2 diabetes [ 101 108 67 109 110 67 101 61 111 67 101 67 109 p p 112 The biochemical mechanisms responsible for these benefits are complex and multifaceted. Mechanisms of benefit of the KD include increased satiety, decreased lipogenesis, and increased fat oxidation. A key element is that the production of ketone bodies, particularly βHB, act to suppress hunger and cravings, making it easier to maintain a caloric deficit. On a metabolic level, the KD acts by lowering insulin levels, increasing fat oxidation, reducing lipogenesis, and potentially inducing epigenetic changes that protect against oxidative stress and inflammation [ 67 101 In the context of lipid profile, the KD shows beneficial effects, having a better impact on lipid profiles compared to low-fat diets. Meta-analyses show a significant decrease in triglycerides with an SMD of −0.36 ( p p 112 109 112 113 111 5.3. Neurodegenerative Diseases (Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s Disease) The KD is attracting increasing interest as a potential therapeutic support in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). A diet based on high fat intake and carbohydrate restriction leads to the production of ketone bodies, which can provide an alternative source of energy for the brain, bypassing the impaired glucose metabolism characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases [ 114 115 The basis of the action of the KD is the metabolic switch from glucose to ketones as the main source of energy for the brain. Ketone bodies, mainly βHB and acetoacetate, can cross the blood–brain barrier and provide alternative fuel for neurons. This mechanism takes on particular importance given the impaired glucose metabolism observed in neurodegenerative diseases. Schematically, the mechanism of KD action at the cellular level in neurodegenerative diseases is presented in Figure 6 30 34 116 117 118 119 The positive effects of the KD on neurodegenerative diseases such as PD and AD have been confirmed by numerous studies. In PD, there is a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the black matter, leading to characteristic motor symptoms. Preclinical studies suggest that a KD may protect dopaminergic neurons by improving mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress. Mitochondrial deficits and increased oxidative stress are also observed in PD, which may be partially mitigated by ketone metabolism [ 120 121 122 123 124 125 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 AD is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration associated with, among other things, β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic brain inflammation. The KD, which induces the production of ketone bodies, is being investigated as a potential metabolic intervention that may modify the course of the disease by improving neuronal function, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting neuroinflammatory processes [ 132 133 134 135 29 132 136 137 137 138 p p p 139 140 140 141 87 89 5.4. Cancers Numerous studies are being conducted on various types of cancer and the impact of the KD on their treatment. The use of the KD in cancer patients is based on the Warburg effect, which means that many cancer cells have an increased demand for glucose and a limited ability to use ketone bodies as an energy source. As a result of the lack of readily available glucose, the main energy substrate, cancer cells undergo apoptosis as a consequence of starvation [ 35 142 Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to increased expression of certain oncogenes associated with the signaling pathway, which plays a key role in regulating cancer cell metabolism. Activation of this pathway, also associated with insulin signaling, promotes metabolic changes that favor cancer cell survival, including increased resistance to apoptosis, decreased β-oxidation of fatty acids, and increased lipogenesis in the cytosol. Therefore, the hypothesis that a very low-carbohydrate diet may limit the progression of certain cancers seems reasonable, although current data remain at the stage of preliminary observations [ 143 144 145 In preclinical models of pancreatic cancer in mice, the KD caused a decrease in glucose and insulin levels and reduced phosphoinositide 3-kinaze (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation in pancreatic islet cells, which limited the proliferation and development of neuroendocrine tumors [ 146 147 148 148 149 It should also be noted that there is evidence that the KD may enhance the immune response against tumors in the context of immunomodulatory therapy. In their study, Ferrere et al. (2021) demonstrated that both KD and oral administration of βHB restored the efficacy of antibody against programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy in mice in which PD-1 blockade alone was ineffective [ 150 150 p 35 By “starving” cancer cells of glucose and reducing the direct effects of insulin on cell growth, the KD appears to be promising as an aid in certain types of cancer therapy and deserves further and more in-depth research. The KD may be a promising strategy to support cancer treatment, especially in combination with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Its use should be considered on an individual basis, taking into account the type of cancer, the stage of the disease, and the patient’s ability to adhere to a restrictive dietary regimen. Further well-designed randomized trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety. Implementing the KD in a population of patients with various diseases presents numerous challenges. The diet requires strict adherence to macronutrient ratios, which can be challenging. The long-term safety of the KD in patients has not been fully documented. There are concerns about the diet’s impact on the cardiovascular system, kidney function, and bone density. Continuous medical supervision and regular monitoring of patients’ biochemical parameters are necessary [ 69 5.5. Ketogenic Therapy in Developmental Neurological Disorders The development of neurogenetic diagnostics with increasingly frequent molecular diagnosis enables personalized treatment, including ketogenic therapy. Genetic diagnosis has a strong influence on the efficacy and safety of the KD, and absolute indications for its implementation are glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (GLUT1DS) and pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency (PDCD). Preferred additional applications of the KD include genetic epilepsies and associated developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE), such as Dravet syndrome, associated with a pathogenic variant of the SCN1A gene (sodium voltage-gated channel alpha subunit 1), as well as other sodium channelopathies (SCN2A, SCN8A) or potassium channelopathies (KCNQ2). Increasing clinical data indicate the effectiveness of ketogenic therapy in other severe DEEs, such as cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) deficiency disorder, DEE-STXBP1 (syntaxin-binding protein 1), PCDH19-related epilepsy (protocadherin 19), and GRIN2A-related epilepsy (glutamate receptor, ionotropic, N-methyl D-aspartate 2A). The high effectiveness of the KD is also observed in mTOR pathway disorders represented by tuberous sclerosis, associated with pathogenic variants in the TSC1/TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis complex) genes, and GATORopathies, dependent on pathogenic variants in the DEPDC5, NPRL2, and NPRL3 genes. The list of other neurometabolic disorders in which the inclusion of the KD may bring the desired effect and which for years were considered contraindicatory to the inclusion of the KD is also systematically expanding. These include, in particular, energy disorders from the group of mitochondriopathies (Leigh syndrome and Leigh-like syndromes, defects of the OXPHOS respiratory chain complex), neurotransmission disorders (NKH—non-ketotic hyperglycinemia), and glycogen storage disorders GSD III and V (Glycogen storage disease). In recent years, argininosuccinate acidemia has been associated with argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) deficiency, which belongs to urea cycle disorders (UCDs) and adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) deficiency, representing purine metabolism disorders. The KD is also highly effective in classic neurogenetic syndromes associated with a high incidence of drug-resistant epilepsy, such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and Angelman syndrome, which is dependent on the rearrangement of the UBE3A (Ubiquitin Protein Ligase E3A) gene. A summary of the above is provided in Figure 7 The current landscape of the KD includes modifications to the CKD and is expanding to increasingly younger patient groups, with the possibility of applying the KD from the neonatal period to late old age ( Table 4 5.6. Critical Methodological Assessment of the Cited Studies Methodological assessment of the studies referred to reveals a number of limitations that need to be taken into account in the interpretation of the findings. The studies are frequently characterized by small patient groups, e.g., comprising only 16 patients [ 63 85 86 116 Another problem is the non-uniform selection of groups and populations, e.g., studies conducted exclusively on infants [ 41 95 118 Animal models were employed in some of the cited research [ 43 95 118 43 Although the above studies provide valuable data on the alleged effects and mechanisms of action of the ketogenic diet, methodological limitations, including small and selective sample sizes, short intervention durations, and the use of animal models, undermine the clarity of results and the ability to draw firm clinical conclusions. Therefore, larger, heterogeneous population studies conducted over a long period are necessary to allow for a legitimate conclusion about the efficacy and long-term safety of the ketogenic diet for different patient populations. 6. Summary Metabolomics has transformed our understanding of the ketogenic diet (KD) from a descriptive dietary intervention into a mechanistically defined therapy. The KD represents a complex therapeutic tool with proven efficacy in refractory epilepsy and growing potential in the management of neurodegenerative, metabolic, and psychiatric disorders. By profoundly reshaping cellular and systemic metabolism—including lipid and amino acid pathways, ketone body fluxes, and mitochondrial function—the KD exerts effects that extend beyond energy provision to encompass signaling, epigenetic regulation, and redox homeostasis. Recent high-throughput metabolomic studies (LC-MS, GC-MS, NMR), in vivo MRS/MRI, and C 13 These insights highlight that KD efficacy and safety are highly individualized and shaped by genetic background, sex, age, dietary composition, and gut microbiome interactions. Large-scale, harmonized high-throughput studies integrating metabolomics, microbiomics, and transcriptomics are essential to establish predictive biomarkers and decision-support tools for precision ketogenic therapy. Future research should also explore ketomimetic strategies capable of reproducing the metabolic and clinical benefits of the KD with fewer dietary restrictions. Ultimately, integrating metabolomic monitoring into clinical practice will be crucial for advancing the KD as a safe, effective, and personalized therapeutic modality.
