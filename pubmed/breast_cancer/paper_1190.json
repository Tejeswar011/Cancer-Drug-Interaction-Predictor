Around 50% of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) cases exhibit HR deficiency, but understanding the remaining half, referred to as homologous-recombination-proficient (HRP) tumors, is limited. This review explores existing knowledge regarding HGSOC patients with HRP tumors and offers insights into potential targets for innovative treatments. Patients with HRP tumors do not experience the same benefits from PARPi and have poorer survival outcomes compared to those with HRD tumors.

Introduction Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy and the fifth in cancer deaths among women in the United States [ 1 2 3 BRCA1 BRCA2 BRCA1 BRCA2 4 EOC has six main histotypes: (1) high-grade serous (HGSOC) cases that account for up to 70% of all cases, (2) endometrioid (ENOC) (~10%), clear cell (CCOC) (~10%), mucinous (MOC) (~3%), low-grade serous carcinomas (LGSOCs) (<5%), and carcinosarcoma which is a mixed epithelial and mesenchymal malignancy (1–4%) [ 5 6 TP53 7 BRCA 8 9 9 In the context of ovarian cancer susceptibility, having a family history of breast or ovarian cancer remains the most significant risk factor for EOC. Among genetic risk factors, germline mutations in the high-penetrance susceptibility genes BRCA1 BRCA2 10 BRCA1 BRCA2 11 Due to the treatment advances of PARPis, HRD tumors have been extensively explored over the last two decades. The main principle involved in this therapy is the synthetic lethality mechanism, where the inhibition of PARP (enzymes involved in DNA repair), combined with the inability to repair double-strand breaks in HRD tumors, results in the accumulation of DNA damage and ultimately leads to cell death [ 12 Approximately 50% of all HGSOC cases have tumors with HRD [ 9 Figure 1 13 2. Homologous Recombination Deficient Tumors Germline mutations in BRCA1 BRCA2 5 8 11 13 ATM PALB2 RAD51 CHEK2 9 11 13 14 BRCA1 9 11 13 14 13 14 5 9 11 13 14 9 11 13 14 9 11 13 14 BRCA1/2 9 13 14 3. Homologous-Recombination-Proficient Tumors HRP ovarian carcinomas are likely to be a heterogeneous group of diseases, and genetic alterations in signaling pathways that regulate the cell cycle are a common feature ( Figure 1 15 16 Approximately 20% of the HGSOC tumors present CCNE1 Figure 1 15 17 18 19 20 RB1 NF1 15 More recently, it has been shown that fold-back inversions are another potentially prevalent molecular characteristic in HRP tumors, and tumors with this structural variation are associated with inferior survival [ 21 Whole-genome doubling, a hallmark of genomic instability, has been increasingly recognized in homologous-recombination-proficient tumors. This phenomenon may contribute to tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance, emphasizing the need to explore its clinical and prognostic significance further [ 22 Focusing on HGSOC patients with HRP tumors is extremely important and an enormous clinical need to avoid unnecessary toxicity and increase disease control. In the PAOLA trial, patients received olaparib plus bevacizumab as maintenance treatment following a response to first-line platinum chemotherapy [ 23 BRCA1/2 23 24 p 24 24 In the era of precision medicine, selecting the appropriate patients likely to benefit from the targeted therapy is crucial. Therefore, new targeted treatments must be identified for HGSOC patients with HRP tumors and those with HRD tumors who have acquired HR proficiency. This review examines the current understanding of HGSOC patients with HRP tumors and provides insights into potential new targets for novel therapies. 4. CCNE1 Amplification CCNE1 9 15 CCNE1 CDK2 RB1 25 26 27 CCNE1 BRCA1 BRCA2 9 11 28 29 14 CCNE1 8 11 14 CCNE1 CCNE1 9 CCNE1 CCNE1 9 CCNE1 14 CCNE1 CCNE1 14 CCNE1 14 Identifying other biological candidates for targeting CCNE1 BRCA1/2 BRCA1/2 CCNE1 CCNE1 CDK2 CDK2 CDK2 17 28 Table 1 Co-amplification patterns could also be of interest for clinical applications [ 18 AKT2 CCNE1 18 19 20 18 30 31 30 31 A promising class of drugs to treat patients with CCNE1-amplified tumors is the Wee1 inhibitors. Adavosertib, a Wee1 inhibitor, plus gemcitabine, was evaluated in platinum-resistant or platinum-refractory recurrent advanced ovarian cancer [ 32 Table 1 32 33 Table 1 33 34 Table 1 34 34 5. Replication Stress Tumors enriched for biomarkers of replicative stress, such as CCNE1 amplification, are characteristic of HRP tumors and have also been suggested to be more likely to respond to ATR inhibitors [ 35 NCT02595892 Table 1 35 35 35 36 Table 1 36 NCT03682289 NCT04491942 Table 1 6. High Fold-Back Inversions Fold-back inversions (FBIs) represent a relatively rare but potentially crucial structural variation in HRP tumors. Mechanistically, FBIs in ovarian cancer tumors may be due to rearrangements during the breakage–fusion–bridge cycles [ 37 38 Wang et al. analyzed whole-genome point mutation and structural variation patterns of 59 HGSOCs and identified a high prevalence of FBIs associated with inferior survival [ 21 n CCNE1 21 38 BRCA1/2 CCNE1 MECOM/MYC PTEN MECOM/MYC RB1 21 Unfortunately, new therapies targeting fold-back inversions remain unknown ( Table 1 7. Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADCs) Targeting Folate Receptor-Alpha An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) consists of a monoclonal antibody that is chemically bonded to a cytotoxic drug through a linker [ 39 39 It has been known for years that increased folate receptor-alpha expression is characteristic of EOC, particularly in HGSOC, as opposed to normal adult tissues, which typically show limited folate receptor-alpha expression [ 40 41 Combined with chemotherapy, a clinical trial using a folate receptor-alpha inhibitor named vintafolide showed improved progression-free survival in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer [ 42 43 41 Table 1 41 44 NCT04209855 Table 1 45 46 8. ADCs Targeting NaPi2B The sodium-dependent phosphate transport protein 2B (NaPi2B) plays a key role in maintaining phosphate homeostasis, and its dysfunction may contribute to the development of certain pathologies, including hyperphosphatemia. Elevated inorganic phosphate concentrations within the tumor microenvironment, compared with normal tissues, have been identified as a potential marker of tumor progression [ 47 45 47 48 48 49 NCT06303505 49 Table 1 50 Table 1 45 50 Table 1 9. ADCs Targeting HER-2 Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a key role in promoting cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival, and HER2 expression can occur in a wide range of solid tumors [ 51 51 51 51 51 10. Mismatch Repair Deficiency A small proportion of HGSOC cases might have germline mutations in MMR genes, which would explain the rationale for exploring immunotherapy [ 52 53 MMR deficiency (MMRd) typically arises from mutations in genes encoding MMR proteins such as MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. These proteins are responsible for identifying and correcting mismatches in nucleotides or through the methylation of the MLH1 gene promoter. These MMR errors result in microsatellite instability (MSI) and short repetitive sequences in DNA. Tumors characterized by a high degree of MSI (MSI-H) exhibit a significantly increased number of somatic mutations, leading to the expression of many neoantigens and making them potentially more responsive to immunotherapy when compared to tumors with fewer mutations [ 54 54 Immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated significant efficacy in treating solid tumors with MMR deficiency. In ovarian cancer, they could represent a therapeutic option for MMRd tumors that are refractory to standard treatment [ 55 55 52 52 52 Immune checkpoint inhibitor trials have yielded dismal results regarding its effectiveness in HGSOC [ 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 11. Other Molecular Alterations and New Emerging Therapies Finding better alternatives for patients with HRP tumors has been challenging because previous well-known analyses of independent TCGA datasets did not find any significant type or frequency of driver mutations in this group of tumors or no patterns of methylation or miRNA expression [ 9 11 BRCA1/2 BRCA1 11 BRCA1/2 11 BRCA1 BRCA1/2 BRCA1 11 HRD tumors may also evolve into HRP via secondary genomic or epigenomic alterations that restore HRR activity due to selective pressure primarily from prior platinum and/or PARPi therapy [ 16 BRCA1 RAD51C BRCA1 RAD51C BRCA1 RAD51C BRCA1 RAD51C Table 1 64 BRCA1/2 65 More recently, CARM1 66 CARM1 CARM1 BRCA1 BRCA2 66 CARM1 67 MAD2L2 67 CARM1 MAD2L2 EZH2 MAD2L2 67 CARM1 67 CARM1 CCNE1 68 CARM1 CCNE1 CARM1 CCNE1 68 Studies using epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors have presented controversial results. While some studies have shown improved response rates and progression-free survival when using EGFR inhibitors alone or in combination with chemotherapy, others found results that suggested that these drugs may worsen outcomes in specific patient populations. Other therapies such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) [ 69 70 71 It was also shown that the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) entinostat enhanced the effect of olaparib in reducing cell viability and clonogenicity in HR-proficient ovarian cancer cells [ 72 73 Lastly, exploratory analysis showed that HIPEC may benefit HRD patients. In the OVHIPEC trial, a stratified analysis revealed that HIPEC provided the greatest benefit in HRD/ BRCA BRCA BRCA1/2 74 BRCA1/2 74 12. Additional Considerations Regarding Homologous Recombination Status in HGSOC Patients with HRP tumors face many more challenges that need to be addressed. One such challenge is that determining HR deficiency or proficiency can be complex [ 75 76 77 78 79 13. Discussion Ovarian cancer treatment has faced significant advances in recent years by exploring HRD and the consequent genomic instability it causes. However, around 50% of the HGSOC patients are HRP, and further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms that drive carcinogenesis and develop personalized treatment strategies for patients with HRP tumors. Identifying key driver mutations and pathway alterations in HRP tumors would be incredibly helpful in discovering new targeted treatments. Substantial advances have been made in the past few years concerning targeted treatment options for HGSOC patients, such as PARPis, but these new therapies are not focused on patients with HRP tumors. Other targeted therapies have been studied in HGSOC patients but have yet to be analyzed regarding HR status. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, for instance, were expected to show promise in treating ovarian cancer, particularly in patients with tumors exhibiting MMR deficiency and/or high levels of immune cell infiltration, but results have been disappointing [ 57 58 59 80 63 Throughout this review, we highlighted numerous HGSOC molecular features directly or indirectly associated with HRP tumors, many of which also present potential new emerging therapies that could target this group of neglected patients. CCNE1 BRCA1/2 BRCA1 RAD51C BRCA1/2 CARM1 BRCA1/2 We also explored the role of ADCs targeting additional molecular features in HGSOC associated with HRP tumors. High folate receptor-alpha expression has been associated with platinum and PARPi resistance. In cases where resistance develops, numerous HRD tumors may ultimately regain HR proficiency following platinum-based or PARPi treatments. Folate receptor-alpha inhibitors have demonstrated promising results in recent clinical trials. NaPi2B and HER2 expression were also explored in this review in the context of ADCs. In addition, acquired treatment resistance in HGSOC is a common challenge in managing this disease. Resistance mechanisms involve the restoration of HR proficiency, intratumoral heterogeneity, and BRCA-independent pathways, leading to a lack of effective treatment options for patients with resistant tumors. Due to individual variations in resistance, tailored treatment plans are essential, and ongoing research aims to uncover resistance mechanisms for the development of more effective therapies. Encouraging clinical trial participation for platinum-resistant patients has shown improved survival and should be prioritized. The importance of better understanding HRP tumors goes beyond HGSOC and even beyond ovarian tumors. The non-HGSOC histotypes (low-grade serous, endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, and carcinosarcomas), for instance, can be classified as HRP tumors. Therefore, tailored treatments targeting these tumors with unique underlying biology are also needed. In addition, the prevalence of HRP tumors in various cancers poses a challenge. An analysis of pan-cancer cohorts recently showed data in other tumors where BRCA1/2 81 14. Conclusions HRP is a large, heterogeneous subset with distinct molecular drivers that are potential therapeutic targets. Understanding cancer biology and developing new treatment options for this group of neglected ovarian cancer patients is a critical clinical need to avoid unnecessary toxicity and improve ovarian cancer disease management.
