Introduction Lung cancer (LC) remains one of the most prevalent and deadly malignant diseases worldwide. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the global cancer statistics for 2022 estimated approximately 20 million new cancer cases and 9.7 million cancer-related deaths. Alarmingly, one in five individuals will develop a malignant tumor during their lifetime, and nearly one in nine men and one in twelve women will die from cancer-related causes [ 1 According to GLOBOCAN 2020 data, LC accounted for 17.6% of all cancer cases in Turkey, with age-standardized incidence rates of 41.7 per 100,000 in men and 8.7 per 100,000 in women [ 2 2 3 4 5 LC is broadly classified into two main categories, namely small-cell LC (SCLC) and non-small-cell LC (NSCLC), with the latter accounting for approximately 85% of all cases. NSCLC is further subdivided into adenocarcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma [ 6 1 The burden of cancer is projected to rise significantly over the next five decades due to global demographic shifts, particularly population aging and growth [ 7 1 NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) is an enzyme involved in cellular detoxification and protection against oxidative stress. NQO1 belongs to the quinone oxidoreductase family and is present in various tissues, including the lungs, thyroid, colon, heart, kidneys, liver, cornea, and lens [ 8 9 10 11 11 12 13 This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the NQO1 C609T polymorphism and LC risk and to evaluate the distribution of NQO1 genotypes among histopathological LC subtypes. Additionally, this study aimed to assess whether this polymorphism could serve as a potential genetic marker for LC susceptibility in Turkey. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Ethical Approval All procedures performed in this study involving human participants followed the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments, or comparable ethical standards. The Trakya University Hospital Ethics Committee approved this study for clinical studies (approval number: 09.082007; date: 12 March 2007). 2.2. Data Collection This prospective study included 75 patients diagnosed with LC and 65 healthy controls, evaluated during routine outpatient visits at Trakya University Hospital between September 2007 and June 2008. All participants met the study eligibility criteria. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) provision of informed consent, (2) age between 18 and 79 years, (3) absence of chronic diseases other than LC, (4) histopathological confirmation of cancer diagnosis, and (5) newly diagnosed patients who had not yet received chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) refusal to participate, (2) presence of chronic diseases other than LC, (3) history of a genetic disorder affecting the NAD(P)H reductase enzyme, (4) pregnancy or breastfeeding, and (5) advanced organ failure. Histopathological data were obtained for each LC patient to support clinical characterization. The C > T polymorphism at position 609 in the NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) gene was analyzed in Turkish patients with LC. Demographic characteristics and laboratory findings were collected from patient records and the hospital’s laboratory information system. Genotyping of the NQO1 C609T polymorphism was performed using the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. For this purpose, 2 mL of peripheral blood was collected from each of the 75 LC patients and 65 healthy controls. Genomic DNA was isolated using a commercial isolation kit and the salt precipitation method and stored at −20 °C. DNA quality was assessed via electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify a 212-base pair (bp) region encompassing the polymorphic site at position 609 of the NQO1 gene, using specific primers listed in Table 1 Agarose gels were prepared at different concentrations according to the type of analysis: 0.8% for DNA quality assessment, 2% for PCR products, and 3% for restriction enzyme digestion products. The gels were prepared in 30 mL of 0.5× TEB buffer and supplemented with 10% ethidium bromide before being poured into casting trays fitted with 13-tooth combs. Electrophoresis was performed in 0.5× TEB buffer at 110 V for 30 min, after which the bands were visualized under UV illumination. For PCR product analysis, 10 μL of each sample was loaded per well. For restriction digestion products, 13 μL of each sample was loaded. The C > T polymorphism at position 609 of the NQO1 gene was detected by digesting PCR amplicons with the HinfI restriction enzyme at 37 °C for 3 h, followed by electrophoretic separation and UV visualization. 2.3. Statistical Analysis The data was analyzed using SPSS version 21. Categorical variables, including clinical and demographic parameters as well as genotype distributions, were compared between the patient and control groups using the chi-square test. A p 3. Results The mean ages of the 75 LC patients and 65 healthy controls included in this study were 62.69 ± 9.36 and 52.72 ± 16.26, respectively. The patient group consisted of 72 males and 3 females; the control group consisted of 61 males and 4 females. No significant result was found between the patient and control groups in terms of gender in the chi-square test ( p Table 2 The DNAs that were run on a 0.8% agarose gel after isolation and visualized under UV light are shown in Figure 1 Table 3 The frequencies and percentages of NQO1 genotypes and histopathological types were examined to determine whether there was a relationship between the genotypes of the patient groups and the type of LC ( Table 4 The C > T base change seen in the 609th base pair of the NQO1 gene created an enzyme-cutting site. No cutting was seen in the normal type, and a single fragment was formed in the 211 bp region (CC). Cutting occurred in two regions in the homozygous variant type, and two fragments of 165 and 45 bp were observed (TT). Both alleles were seen in the heterozygous variant type, and three fragments were observed in the 211, 165, and 45 bp regions (CT). The enzyme-cutting results are shown in Figure 2 Figure 3 When the participants’ smoking status was examined, all participants had a history of smoking. According to the data obtained, the average smoking duration was 38.45 ± 12.14 years, with an average of 1.63 ± 0.64 packs of cigarettes per day (mean pack-years ≈ 62.7). The NQO1 genotype distribution was also examined with the chi-square test. The distribution of CC, CT, and TT genotypes in the patient group was 66.7, 32.0, and 1.3%, respectively, and the distribution in the control group was 60.0, 35.4, and 4.6%, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the patient and control groups in the distribution of the CC, CT, or TT genotypes ( p Table 3 In our study, no association was found between variant genotypes and LC risk. 4. Discussion NQO1 has been reported to participate in the bioactivation of certain environmental procarcinogens found in tobacco smoke and various foods, including nitroaromatic compounds and heterocyclic amines [ 14 15 In our study, the distribution of histopathological subtypes among LC patients was as follows: adenocarcinoma (14.0%), squamous-cell carcinoma (26.0%), small-cell carcinoma (14.0%), non-small-cell carcinoma (38.0%), and unknown subtype (8.0%). The genotype frequencies of NQO1 C609T (CC, CT, and TT) did not show significant variation across these subtypes. This lack of association suggests that the NQO1 C609T polymorphism may not differentially influence susceptibility to specific histopathological forms of LC within the Turkish population studied. However, given the relatively small sample size for each subtype, especially for rarer forms, these findings should be interpreted cautiously. Larger studies with more balanced subtype representation are warranted to more definitively assess potential genotype–phenotype correlations. Globally, LC remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and has been among the most diagnosed cancers for decades [ 16 LC remains the leading cause of cancer death. Globally, LC has been the most commonly diagnosed cancer for the last several decades [ 16 17 15 18 19 20 All cases in our series had a substantial history of cigarette smoking (mean pack-years ≈ 62.7). Because smoking is a strong risk factor for LC, the high and relatively homogeneous smoking exposure in our case group may have obscured small/moderate effects of the NQO1 C609T polymorphism. This limits our ability to disentangle the independent effect of the genotype from the dominant effect of smoking in this cohort; we have added this as an explicit limitation of this study. Masroor et al. [ 21 Banerjee [ 22 Our findings highlight the importance of population-specific genetic studies in cancer research. While NQO1 polymorphisms have been implicated in other ethnic groups, their role in the Turkish population appears to be limited or absent, at least within the sample size we evaluated. This result also raises the possibility that alternative molecular mechanisms or other genetic polymorphisms may play a more prominent role in LC susceptibility among Turkish individuals. Furthermore, the differences in findings across populations underscore the need for larger multi-centered studies involving Turkish subpopulations and possibly matched healthy controls. Such studies may clarify whether the absence of NQO1 polymorphisms in this study is representative of the general Turkish population or specific to the cohort analyzed. Previous studies conducted in Turkish populations have investigated the role of the NQO1 C609T polymorphism in various cancers. Ergen et al. [ 23 19 24 Recent studies continue to explore the complex role of NQO1 in cancer pathogenesis and its clinical implications. Ghorbani et al. [ 25 26 Regarding the potential association between the NQO1 C609T polymorphism and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), none of the patients included in our study had a COPD diagnosis. Therefore, we were unable to evaluate any relationship between this polymorphism and COPD presence or severity. Given the well-established link between smoking, COPD, and LC, future studies including patients with coexisting COPD may provide valuable insights into shared pathophysiological mechanisms and the role of NQO1 genetic variants in these overlapping conditions. Although this study focused on the NQO1 C609T polymorphism, LC susceptibility is known to result from complex interactions between multiple genetic variants and environmental exposures [ 27 28 29 30 This study has some limitations. The relatively small sample size may have limited the detection of modest genotype effects. Additionally, since all participants were smokers, we could not assess gene–environment interactions between NQO1 polymorphisms and smoking. The uniform heavy smoking exposure may have masked potential associations. Other environmental factors and comorbidities were not evaluated. Finally, as a single-center study in a Turkish population, the results may not be generalized to other groups. Larger studies with more diverse populations are needed to confirm our findings. Our study provides preliminary insights into the association between NQO1 C609T polymorphisms and LC risk, highlighting the limited clinical utility of routine genotyping for risk stratification in the Turkish population. The application of the PCR-RFLP method, a well-established and reliable genotyping technique, supports the robustness of our findings. Nevertheless, the relatively small sample size constitutes a limitation. Therefore, larger-scale studies encompassing diverse cohorts from multiple regions and ethnic backgrounds within Turkey are warranted to validate and extend these results. In conclusion, while the NQO1 C609T polymorphism does not appear to be a major biomarker for LC susceptibility among Turkish individuals, our research provides an important foundation for future investigations into the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors in LC pathogenesis. Future, larger studies should include non-smoking cases and detailed environmental exposure data to permit formal gene–environment interaction testing.
