Introduction Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a serious mold disease caused by Aspergillus 1 Aspergillus 2 3 4 Healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and costs associated with treating IA can be substantial and result from intensive diagnostic testing, specialized care, supportive treatments for managing its complications, as well as underlying comorbidities, and costly antifungal therapeutics [ 4 5 6 7 We therefore sought to assess all-cause HCRU, total treatment costs, readmissions, and all-cause mortality or need for hospice for up to six-months after hospitalization for IA among patients with hematologic or non-hematologic malignancies, or a history of bone marrow transplant/hematopoietic cell (BMT/HCT) or solid organ transplantation (SOT). 2. Methods This was a retrospective, observational cohort study that utilized nationwide US claims data from IQVIA’s New Data Warehouse [ 8 Adults admitted for IA (index date) were identified based on International Classification of Diseases-10th-Revision (ICD-10) codes (B44.0, B44.1, B44.7) in any position during the patient selection period of October 2015–November 2022. The first hospitalization for IA during the patient selection period was utilized, and the admission date for this IA hospitalization was defined as the index date (time 0). Data within the database from January 2010 to the index date minus one day for each patient were used to assess patient baseline comorbidities (details regarding the billing codes used are available from the corresponding author upon request). In order to be included within the study, patient data needed to link to the professional fees and pharmacy claims data during the study period, have evidence of any systemic antifungal therapy (any combinations of triazoles, polyenes, or echinocandins) for ≥3 days during the hospitalization, have activity denoted as ≥1 medical claim in the professional fee data set and ≥1 pharmacy claim in the pharmacy claim data set during the six-month baseline period, and exhibit pharmacy stability (consistent reporting of data from the pharmacy most frequently visited by the patient during each month of the baseline period). The only exclusion criterion applied was evidence of non-IA invasive fungal infection during the index hospitalization. Patients with IA were stratified into ICD-10 defined cohorts based on presence of hematologic (C81–C96) or non-hematologic malignancies (C00–C80) during a baseline period of six-months prior to the index date. Patients were stratified into ICD-10 defined cohorts of BMT/HCT (Z94.81, Z94.84, T86.0x, T86.5) or SOT (Z94.0–Z94.7, Z94.82, Z94.83, Z94.89, T86.1x–T86.9x) based upon a prior history of, or complication due to, BMT/HCT or SOT identified during a baseline period spanning January 2010 to the index date. Patients were allowed to fall into more than one cohort, if applicable, and counted in both (not mutually exclusive). Other comorbidities were identified using corresponding billing codes (available from the corresponding author upon request). All results were determined separately for each of the four at-risk cohorts of interest. Median and interquartile range (IQR) all-cause total HCRU (total hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length-of-stay (LOS)) and all-cause total costs in 2023 USD during index hospitalization were assessed. All-cause re-admission at one- and six-month post-discharge, all-cause cumulative total hospitalization and outpatient costs (office visits, emergency department visits, pharmacy, laboratory, pathology, and radiology), up to six months after the index date, and all-cause mortality through end of study follow-up also were assessed. To be included in the post-index IA admission analyses, patients were required to have at least the duration of follow-up of that outcome, i.e., only patients with at least six months of post-index admission follow-up data were included in the estimation of six months re-admission and cost analyses. As only charges were available in the data set, a national cost-to-charge ratio was applied to charges to convert them into costs. All analyses were performed in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The data were accessed in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Institutional review board approval was not required for this retrospective analysis of deidentified secondary data. The data utilized are available only by license through IQVIA. 3. Results 3.1. Overall Population We identified 1190 patients in total with an IA admission, with 317 having hematologic malignancy, 155 having non-hematologic malignancy, 133 having BMT/HCT and 173 having SOT ( Table 1 Figure 1 Table 2 Figure 2 3.2. Hematologic Malignancies Among the 317 patients with hematologic malignancies, 82% (260/317) had leukemia. Common baseline comorbidities found in this cohort included neutropenia (55.5%), immunodeficiencies (39.1%), and diabetes mellitus (27.1%). These patients were found to have protracted total and ICU median LOSs (18 and 12 days, respectively), and costly hospitalizations (USD 151,489) that were associated with an inpatient mortality or need for hospice in 28.1% (89/317) of patients ( Figure 3 Table 3 3.3. Non-Hematologic Malignancies Patients with non-hematologic malignancies who were admitted for IA (N = 155) most frequently had cancers of the lungs, trachea, or bronchi (54.2%, 84/155), followed by breast, urinary tract, and colorectal neoplastic disease (prevalence all ≥11.0%). Common baseline comorbidities in this cohort included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (51.6%), diabetes mellitus (29.0%), and neutropenia (20.0%). Median total and ICU LOSs were 12 and 10 days, respectively, and total index hospital costs were USD 79,058. One- and six-month re-admissions occurred in 22.2% (24/198) and 53.1% (34/64), respectively. One-third of this cohort (52/155) had died by the end of follow-up with a median time to death of 20 days. 3.4. BMT/HCT Recipients BMT/HCT was observed in 133 of the IA-admitted patients. Immunodeficiencies and neutropenia were present in 52.3% and 69.9% of patients in this cohort. The median total and ICU LOSs for BMT/HCT recipients were 18 and 12 days, respectively, while 36.1% either died during hospitalization or were transferred to hospice. In those surviving to discharge, 13.6% (15/110) and 60.0% (36/60) were readmitted for any cause at one and six months, with total six-month healthcare costs of USD 389,296. By the end of follow-up, 40.6% of BMT/HCT recipients died with a median time to death of 51 days. 3.5. SOT Recipients Within the cohort of all patients admitted for IA, 173 were SOT recipients. Lung and kidney were the most common transplanted organs. Diabetes mellitus (53.2%), immunodeficiencies (38.7%), COPD (30.1%), and neutropenia (20.2%) were the most frequent comorbidities. The median total and ICU LOSs for SOT recipients were 15 and 13 days, respectively, with 27.2% either dying during index admission or being transferred to hospice. In those surviving to discharge, 26.1% (36/138) and 62.8% (59/94), respectively, were re-admitted for any cause at one and six months, with total six-month healthcare costs of USD 246,717. By end of follow-up, 35.3% of SOT recipients died with a median time to death of 31 days. 4. Discussion In this study of high-risk patients hospitalized for IA, including those with hematologic and non-hematologic malignancies, BMT/HCT and SOT, each cohort was found to have protracted total length-of-stay (12–18 days) and ICU stay (10–13 days) and costly (USD 79,058–USD 172,342) index IA hospital stays that resulted in death or need for hospice in 28.1–36.1% of patients. Among those surviving to discharge, more than 50% and up to two-thirds were re-admitted for any cause by six months, with six-month all-cause total treatment costs ranging from USD 213,378 to USD 397,857. At the end of follow-up, all-cause mortality in these at-risk populations was 33.6–40.6%. Patients with hematologic malignancies and BMT/HCT recipients had the longest LOSs and highest total index hospital and 6-month follow-up treatment costs, as well as the highest all-cause mortality rates at the end of follow-up. While studies reporting on in-hospital outcomes and short-term re-admission rates associated with IA in high-risk subgroups have been published [ 4 5 6 7 9 Our study also provides the first comparative HCRU analysis of the four major cohorts at-risk for development of IA. The detailed comorbidities provided in Figure 1 While patients with hematological malignancies, BMT/HCT, and SOT are well recognized as having risk factors for development of IA [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 The long and costly IA hospitalizations, and high inpatient mortality observed in IA patients with malignancy or transplantation in our study are generally consistent with findings from a retrospective study of Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), National Inpatient Sample (NIS) 2018 data by Rayens and colleagues [ 5 5 Our study also found the IA patient cohorts with a history of BMT/HCT and hematologic malignancy were the most likely of the four cohorts to experience hospital re-admission at six months. In a retrospective study using US National Readmission Database (NRD) data (2013–2019) which reported all-cause re-admission rates in HCT patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) (a group often comprised substantially of patients with hematologic malignancies), Khalil and colleagues found one-month re-admission rates of 36.2% [ 9 This study has several limitations. First, as with all claims database studies, misclassification bias is a concern [ 18 19 20 21 8 In conclusion, hospitalizations for IA in patients with malignancies or transplantation are long, costly, and end with readmission, hospice, or death in more than one-third of patients. Novel antifungal agents with improved effectiveness against IA are needed to reduce time in hospital, complications, need for re-admission, and overall cost of care.
