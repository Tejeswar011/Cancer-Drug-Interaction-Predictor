Furthermore, the ability to combine multiple treatment modalities either concurrently or at different stages of the disease is enhancing both the safety and effectiveness of therapies. This, in turn, leads to improved patient outcomes, not only in terms of overall survival (OS) but also in physical well-being. Nevertheless, oncologic therapies can induce both local and systemic changes, as well as complications that are closely related to the type of treatment administered. Accurate interpretation of post-treatment imaging is therefore essential for timely and appropriate patient management. In this context, it is evident that radiologists specializing in oncology must be well-versed not only in the effects of various therapies but also in the different assessment criteria used to evaluate treatment efficacy accurately. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the various response evaluation criteria, beginning with conventional, size-based methods and progressing to functional approaches that rely on metabolic activity and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), while highlighting the respective advantages and limitations of each.

This article aims to support understanding of the different evaluation criteria for assessing treatment response, beginning with conventional size-based methods and progressing to functional criteria that rely on metabolic imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), highlighting the respective limitations and benefits of each approach. Dimensional criteria: World Health Organization (WHO) and the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) The evaluation of treatment response is a fundamental aspect in the management of cancer patients and plays a critical role in therapeutic decision-making—whether to continue or adjust the therapeutic regimen. The most commonly used traditional response criteria are those defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The WHO criteria rely on two-dimensional measurements, assessing tumor response by calculating the sum of the orthogonal diameters of the lesion. In contrast, RECIST 1.1 criteria are based on one-dimensional measurements, focusing on the largest diameter of target lesions, with a maximum of five lesions (and no more than two per organ) considered. The initial RECIST guidelines, first introduced in 2000 [ 9 10 Today, RECIST 1.1 is the standard for evaluating treatment efficacy in clinical trials, offering a unified and reproducible methodology for tumor measurement. This standardization helps facilitate comparisons across studies by reducing inter-observer variability and ensuring objectivity in response assessment [ 11 12 13 Another recognized limitation of RECIST 1.1 is the lack of specificity regarding the imaging phase—arterial, venous, or hepatobiliary—during which lesions should be assessed, particularly relevant in MRI evaluations. This omission can be significant when a lesion is best visualized in a specific contrast-enhancement phase. Arguably, the most critical shortcoming of RECIST is its sole reliance on dimensional criteria, which fails to account for biological effects of certain therapies—such as necrosis following targeted or ablative treatments [ 14 15 16 17 18 20 21 24 1  Table 1 Morphological and functional response criteria BIOMARKER MODALITY PARAMETERS RESPONSE CRITERIA Conventional Imaging Biomarkers WHO RECIST 1.1 CT, MR Lesion size (2D or 1D) and pathological lymph nodes Complete resolution or shrinkage of the lesion New Imaging Biomarkers mRECIST CT, MR + contrast agent Lesion size (1D) Complete resolution or shrinkage of the vital target lesion Choi CT Lesion size (1D) and HU density Reduction in lesion size > 10% or reduction in density > 15% MD Anderson XR, SS, CT, RM Lesion size (2D), density, metabolic activity Qualitative and quantitative assessments obtained from different imaging modalities Functional Imaging Biomarkers Metabolic Activity Cheson, EORTC, PERCIST PET SUV, SUL, TLG Complete resolution or shrinkage of metabolic activity > optimal Δ Perfusion DCE-CT CE-US DCE-MRI AUC, WI, WO, TTP, Ktrans, kep, ve, SIS Reduction > optimal Δ Diffusion DW-MRI ADC Reduction > optimal Δ EASL, m-RECIST, RECICL and LI-RADS liver assessment criteria Ablation therapies represent a highly effective option in the management of various tumors, and in cases of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC < 3 mm), they are considered the first-line treatment [ 25 27 1 16  Fig. 1 HCC patient treated with RFA; necrotic lesion (with arrow) and new HCC lesions (yellow arrows). MRI assessment the necrotic lesion appears iso-hyperintense on T2-W sequence, with restricted diffusion on b800s/mm2 ( B C D B C D To address this limitation, the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) introduced specific criteria in 2000 for evaluating viable tumor tissue, based on WHO’s two-dimensional assessment approach. These criteria focus on the residual portion of the treated area that displays arterial phase hyperenhancement. A lesion is considered necrotic (indicating complete response) if no contrast enhancement is observed in the ablated zone. A partial response is defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in the sum of the enhancing areas, as seen in the arterial phase. Conversely, disease progression is identified by a ≥ 25% increase in the enhancing area or by the appearance of new lesions. A lesion is deemed stable if it does not meet the criteria for either partial response or progression [ 28 In 2010, the modified RECIST (mRECIST) system was introduced [ 16 2  Table 2 Comparison of RECIST, mRECIST, and PERCIST criteria Response Type RECIST 1.1 mRECIST PERCIST Complete Response Disappearance of all lesions 4 weeks after treatment (all previously identified pathological lymph nodes must have a diameter less than 10 mm), normalization of serum tumor markers Complete disappearance of arterial enhancement in all target lesions Complete resolution of FDG uptake in all lesions Partial Response Reduction in the sum of diameters of all lesions by at least 30% At least 30% reduction in the sum of the diameters of the viable portions of target lesions ≥ 30% reduction in SULpeak and an absolute decrease of 0.8 units in SULpeak Disease Progression Relative increase in the sum of diameters of at least 20% and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm, appearance of at least one new lesion, unequivocal progression of a non-target lesion (in RECIST 1.1, the appearance of a new FDG-PET-avid lesion must be confirmed by an analogous CT finding) At least 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of the viable portions of target lesions ≥ 30% increase in FDG uptake SULpeak and an absolute increase of 0.8 SULpeak, or appearance of new lesions with increased FDG uptake Stable Disease All cases not fitting the previous descriptions, or persistence of a non-target lesion, or serum markers above the normal range even in the absence of radiologically evident lesions No criteria for complete response, partial response, or disease progression No criteria for complete response, partial response, or disease progression The Response Evaluation Criteria in Cancer of the Liver (RECICL) were developed by the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan in 2015 [ 29 30 31 Similar to RECIST 1.1, RECICL identifies target lesions from measurable ones—up to two per organ and a maximum of five in total. If there are three or more hepatic lesions, three nodules are selected as targets. Lesion area is calculated by multiplying the major axis by the maximum orthogonal diameter, and the sum of these areas serves as a reference. All other lesions are considered non-target. RECICL defines four Treatment Effect (TE) categories:  TE4: Complete necrosis or 100% reduction in tumor size.  TE4a: Necrotic area exceeds original tumor size (adequate ablative margin). TE4b: Necrotic area matches original tumor size (inadequate margin). TE3: 50–100% necrosis or reduction in size. TE2: Intermediate effect, not meeting TE1 or TE3 criteria. TE1: Tumor enlargement > 50%, excluding necrotic regions post-treatment. The Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) is a comprehensive classification system developed to standardize terminology, imaging techniques, interpretation, reporting, and data collection for liver findings in individuals at high risk for HCC. It is endorsed by the American College of Radiology (ACR) [ 32 35 36 The LI-RADS treatment response (LR-TR) algorithm, introduced in 2017, is applicable to lesions treated with loco-regional therapies, though it does not apply to systemic treatments. It may be cautiously applied when both systemic and ablation therapies are used, provided ablation effects dominate. These criteria primarily rely on vascular characteristics as indicators of viability [ 37 A lesion is assigned the LR-TR non-evaluable category if image quality is insufficient, technique is inadequate, or the time since therapy is too short for reliable interpretation. The nonviable LR-TR category applies to treated lesions lacking enhancement or exhibiting enhancement consistent with expected post-treatment patterns, such as marginal enhancement. The viable LR-TR category is used for treated areas showing nodular or irregular arterial phase hyperenhancement (APHE), or enhancement patterns similar to the pre-treatment state. Equivocal LR-TR is assigned when enhancement characteristics do not clearly indicate viability or nonviability [ 36 According to LI-RADS guidelines, viable and equivocal LR-TR lesions should be measured. Measurements are taken along the longest diameter of the enhancing (viable) portion of the lesion, excluding non-enhancing areas. This one-dimensional measurement is used in the report to document viable tumor size. In cases where no enhancement is present or when enhancement is consistent with post-treatment expectations, the lesion is categorized as nonviable LR-TR, and no size measurement is required [ 37 CHOI criteria The Choi criteria [ 17 The response definitions are as follows: Complete Response (CR) - disappearance of all known lesions with no emergence of new ones; Partial Response (PR) - either a ≥ 10% reduction in tumor size (sum of longest diameters as per RECIST) or a ≥ 15% decrease in tumor density (HU), with no new lesions or clear evidence of progression in non-measurable lesions; stable Disease (SD) does not fulfill the criteria for CR, PR, or PD, and is not associated with symptomatic deterioration due to tumor progression; Progressive Disease (PD) - a ≥ 10% increase in tumor size that does not meet the PR density criteria, presence of new lesions, emergence of intra-tumoral nodules, or growth of existing nodules. Cheson, EORTC and PERCIST criteria In recent years, the Cheson, EORTC, and PERCIST criteria have been introduced, all based on functional imaging techniques from nuclear medicine. The Cheson criteria [ 18 The EORTC and PERCIST criteria focus on changes in FDG uptake, calculated through different methodologies. The PERCIST criteria (Table 2 19 20 PERCIST relies on the Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) as a semi-quantitative parameter of metabolic activity, calculated by dividing the radioactivity concentration in the tumor by the injected dose normalized to body weight. Among various SUV metrics (e.g., maximum SUV, mean SUV), the SUV adjusted for lean body mass (SUL) was selected for PERCIST, as it is less influenced by weight changes during therapy. According to PERCIST, the peak SUL should be measured from the single most metabolically active lesion on each scan. This value is defined as the average SUL within a 1.2 cm diameter spherical region (corresponding to a 1 cm³ volume) centered in the area of highest uptake. An alternative metric used in PERCIST is Total Lesion Glycolysis (TLG), which quantifies the total FDG uptake of a tumor above a given threshold. TLG is calculated by multiplying the mean SUV by the lesion’s total volume (in mL), offering a combined measure of metabolic activity and tumor burden. PERCIST defines four primary response categories and incorporates a time component for tracking tumor activity from the beginning of therapy: Complete Metabolic Response: Complete resolution of FDG uptake in both target and non-target lesions. Partial Metabolic Response: A reduction of over 30% in peak SUL, with an absolute decrease of at least 0.8 units. Progressive Metabolic Disease: An increase of more than 30% in peak SUL, with at least a 0.8-unit rise, or the appearance of new lesions or visibly increased FDG uptake. If new FDG-avid foci are present without corresponding CT evidence of progression, a follow-up scan is recommended after one month for confirmation. Stable Metabolic Disease: No significant changes, or changes that do not meet criteria for either partial response or progression. Although PERCIST is based on metabolic imaging, anatomical changes in tumor size remain relevant and should be assessed in accordance with RECIST 1.1. When discrepancies arise, such as size variation without metabolic change, confirmation via additional follow-up imaging is advised to determine true progression or response. MD Anderson criteria In 2004, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center proposed a set of revised criteria for evaluating the therapeutic response of bone metastases in breast cancer patients [ 38 3  Table 3 MDA response criteria Response Type MDA Criteria Complete Response Complete sclerosis of all lytic lesions detected by CT or X-ray, with normal density on CT, normalization of the MR signal, and normalization of osteotropic radiopharmaceutical uptake on bone scintigraphy Partial Response Formation of a sclerotic rim at the site of lytic lesions detected by CT or X-ray, or incomplete sclerosis. Osteosclerotic flare (temporary appearance of a sclerotic rim or new sclerotic lesions without signs of bone disease progression), at least 50% reduction in lesion diameter and 50% reduction in radiopharmaceutical uptake Disease Progression Appearance of new lesions, increase of at least 25% in diameter, or increase in osteotropic radiopharmaceutical uptake by at least 25% Stable Disease No new lesions, less than 25% increase or less than 50% reduction in diameter or osteotropic radiopharmaceutical uptake A complete response (CR) is defined as: complete sclerotic filling of previously lytic lesions on radiograph or CT; restoration of normal bone density on radiograph or CT; disappearance of abnormal tracer uptake on bone scintigraphy; and normalization of signal intensity on MRI. For the partial response (PR) category, the criteria recommend excluding rapid lesion regression observed on bone scans, as this could reflect either a true therapeutic effect or increased osteolytic activity indicative of progression [ 38 Specifically, PR may include: Development of a sclerotic rim or partial sclerosis of lytic metastases on radiograph or CT; ≥50% reduction in the sum of perpendicular diameters of measurable lesions on radiograph, CT, or MRI; Subjective reduction of ≥ 50% in the perpendicular dimensions of non-measurable lytic or blastic lesions on radiograph, CT, or MRI; Subjective reduction of ≥ 50% in tracer uptake on bone scintigraphy. Progressive disease (PD) is defined by: A > 25% increase in the sum of perpendicular diameters of any measurable lesion on radiograph, CT, or MRI; A > 25% subjective increase in the size of non-measurable lytic or blastic lesions on radiograph, CT, or MRI; A ≥ 25% subjective increase in tracer uptake on bone scan; The emergence of new metastatic lesions. Criteria for evaluating the efficacy of immunotherapy: ir-RC, ir-RECIST and i-RECIST To evaluate the effectiveness of immunotherapy, specific assessment criteria have been proposed (Table 4 39  Table 4 Criteria for immunotherapy evaluation Response Type irRC irRECIST iRECIST Complete Response Complete disappearance of all lesions in 2 repeated examinations 4 weeks apart Complete disappearance of all non-lymph node lesions (lymph nodes must have a short-axis diameter of less than 10 mm, no confirmation examination required) Complete disappearance of all lesions in 2 repeated examinations 4 weeks apart Partial Response At least 50% reduction in tumor burden confirmed after 4 weeks At least 30% reduction in tumor burden compared to the staging examination At least 30% reduction in tumor burden compared to the staging examination, no new lesions should appear, and there should be no progression of non-target lesions Stable Disease Not defined Not defined Not defined Disease Progression At least 25% increase in tumor burden confirmed after 4 weeks from the first assessment At least 20% relative increase in tumor burden and an absolute increase of at least 5 mm compared to staging, confirmed after 4 weeks from the first assessment Not confirmed: appearance of new lesion or 20% increase in tumor burden; confirmed: new lesions or further increase in their size after 4–8 weeks from the first assessment At baseline, TTB is calculated by summing the products of the longest perpendicular diameters (SPD) of the target lesions. A maximum of 10 visceral lesions and 5 cutaneous lesions may be included, with no more than five per organ and a minimum lesion size of 5 × 5 mm. At each follow-up, newly measurable lesions are added to the existing TTB (new TTB = sum of SPDs of original target lesions + SPDs of new measurable lesions). Thus, under irRC, the appearance of new lesions alone does not constitute progressive disease. The irRC defines four response categories: Immune-related Complete Response (irCR) that is the disappearance of all lesions; Immune-related Partial Response (irPR) that is the reduction of ≥ 50% in TTB from baseline; Immune-related Progressive Disease (irPD) that is the increase of ≥ 25% in TTB from the nadir, confirmed by a follow-up scan at least four weeks later, provided there is no rapid clinical decline; Immune-related Stable Disease (irSD) that is the responses that do not meet criteria for irCR, irPR, or irPD. Despite its innovation, irRC has some limitations. It was initially developed for melanoma and may not generalize to other tumor types. Furthermore, lymph node evaluation remains uncertain, and the use of two-dimensional measurements and inclusion of a high number of lesions can reduce reproducibility, increase error potential, and be time-consuming when compared to RECIST. To improve consistency and reproducibility, the immune-related RECIST (irRECIST) was introduced in 2013 [ 40 IrRECIST includes the following response categories: irCR - no detectable measurable or non-measurable lesions; lymph nodes must be < 10 mm in short axis. No confirmation is required; irPR - reduction of ≥ 30% in TMTB from baseline, with no progression in non-measurable lesions; irSD - Tumors that do not meet the criteria for irPR or irCR and do not qualify as irPD; irPD - increase of TMTB by ≥ 20% from nadir, or unequivocal progression of non-target or new non-measurable lesions. Confirmation must occur within 4 to 12 weeks after the initial irPD assessment. To promote consistency across clinical studies using immunotherapy, the immune RECIST (iRECIST) was proposed in 2017 by the RECIST working group [ 41 2 3  Fig. 2 Lung cancer patient treated with immunotherapy; CT scan assessment: A B C  Fig. 3 Lung cancer patient treated with immunotherapy; CT scan assessment during portal phase of constrast study in A B New lesions are assessed independently and are not included in the total tumor burden sum. If new lesions are found but the patient remains asymptomatic or shows no clinical worsening, treatment is not discontinued, and the patient is classified as iUPD. If subsequent imaging reveals further new lesions, measurable growth of target or non-target lesions, an increase > 5 mm in the sum of new lesion measurements, or progression of non-target new lesions, the classification changes to iCPD. A distinctive feature of iRECIST is its flexibility in reclassifying response: if a tumor reduces in size after previously showing progression, the baseline is reset. This approach accommodates atypical response patterns such as pseudoprogression. While the main objective of these immune-related criteria is to unify and standardize tumor response assessments in immunotherapy trials, they are not yet widely adopted in routine clinical practice. Moreover, none of these frameworks adequately address all atypical responses, such as hyperprogression or dissociated responses. RANO criteria The most recently published and currently widely adopted criteria are those established by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Working Group [ 42 Progressive disease is diagnosed when there is either an increase of more than 25% in tumor diameter, the development of a new enhancing lesion, or clinical deterioration accompanied by an increase in corticosteroid dosage. Stable disease includes all cases that do not meet the criteria for the above categories, and particularly includes lesions considered “non-measurable”—those with predominantly cystic composition, visible in only one imaging plane, with indistinct margins, or with a maximum perpendicular diameter of less than 1 mm. The RANO criteria incorporate data from Magnetic Resonance Imaging, particularly using T2-weighted FLAIR sequences, to better assess non-enhancing tumor components. More recently, specific guidance for evaluating immunotherapy effects in patients with neuro-oncologic diseases has been introduced through the i-RANO criteria [ 43 It is expected that the i-RANO criteria will continue to evolve, potentially incorporating advanced imaging modalities, as more experience and clinical data become available across the different classes of immune therapies used in neuro-oncology. Previous response criteria for gliomas have been based primarily on expert recommendations. The RANO working group felt it was important to update the response criteria informed by available data. The following recommendations for RANO 2.0 [ 45 44 45 Functional magnetic resonance criteria Several functional parameters, derived from MRI, have also been proposed [ 46 48 Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced-MRI (DCE-MRI) Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) enables the acquisition of information related to tissue perfusion and microvascular architecture [ 49 50 51 56 trans trans 57 58 Diffusion-Weighted imaging (DWI) Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) offers quantitative insights into tissue microstructure by assessing variations in water proton mobility and cellular density. The random motion of water molecules is influenced by the number of cells present in the tissue (cellularity) as well as the integrity of cell membranes. The apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is the primary parameter used for quantitative evaluation in this context [ 59 64 65 69 Conventional DWI is grounded in the assumption that water diffusion within voxels follows a Gaussian distribution. However, in biological tissues, molecular barriers and structural heterogeneity often distort this diffusion pattern. To account for such deviations, Jensen proposed a mathematical model called Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) [ 70 70 BOLD-MRI Hypoxia represents a crucial factor in tumor biology and plays a significant role in resistance to both conventional and targeted therapies [ 71 72 Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent (BOLD) imaging is a functional MRI (fMRI) technique that captures changes in regional blood concentrations of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, thus providing an indirect measure of tissue oxygenation [ 73 74 75 76 MR spectroscopy Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is an imaging technique that provides metabolic insights by detecting electromagnetic signals in the radiofrequency spectrum, which are emitted by atomic nuclei within molecular structures [ 77 80 Despite its utility, MRS presents several technical challenges. A homogeneous magnetic field is essential, as the resonance frequencies of various metabolites are often closely spaced, and even minor inhomogeneities can compromise spectral resolution. Moreover, acquiring high-quality, reliable data from certain anatomical regions—such as near air-bone interfaces remains difficult due to susceptibility artifacts. Additionally, because metabolites exist in much lower concentrations than water, their signals are inherently weak, requiring a minimum threshold of concentration to be detectable with sufficient accuracy [ 80 MR elastography Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) is an MRI technique based on phase-contrast imaging that enables the measurement of tissue displacement resulting from the propagation of mechanical waves. From this displacement data, the mechanical properties of the tissue can be inferred [ 81 Various methods have been developed for generating mechanical waves in MRE [ 82 83 A range of MRI sequences can be used in MRE, including gradient-recalled echo sequences with or without echo-planar imaging (EPI), spin echo sequences with or without EPI, balanced steady-state free precession (SSFP), and spiral sequences. Of these, gradient-recalled echo and spin echo-EPI sequences are most commonly applied to the liver and brain. Magnetic field strength is another important factor. While 3T scanners provide a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and improved contrast-to-noise ratio compared to 1.5T, the longer T1 relaxation times at 3T (approximately 30–40% greater) may require longer repetition times to achieve comparable contrast. T2 relaxation is relatively unaffected by field strength, but T2* increases significantly at 3T. Thus, for patients with iron overload in the liver, 1.5T is typically preferred; however, for most MRE applications, 3T remains the recommended field strength [ 84 A variety of inversion algorithms have been created to estimate tissue mechanical properties from MRE data, each based on different assumptions and computational strategies. Common assumptions include that the tissue is linear, elastic or viscoelastic, and isotropic. These assumptions may not always hold true across various tissue types or pathological conditions, which highlights the importance of selecting regions of interest (ROIs) that are as small and homogeneous as possible. In some cases—such as in small tumors or lesions with limited viable tissue—this may result in very few voxels being available for reliable analysis. Furthermore, tissue heterogeneity and sharp interfacial boundaries can introduce bias into algorithms that assume local homogeneity. Due to the broad variation in acquisition sequences and processing methods, standardization is essential to ensure consistent interpretation and to allow for meaningful comparison across different clinical studies. Radiomics Radiomics has recently garnered significant attention in the field of oncology, as radiomic features have been shown to correlate with histological grade, TNM classification, therapeutic response, and patient prognosis [ 85 90 When radiomics-derived data are integrated with clinical variables and linked to patient outcomes, they can contribute to the development of accurate and robust clinical decision support systems grounded in evidence-based medicine. An important extension of radiomics is radiogenomics, which seeks to associate imaging features with genetic markers that predict therapeutic response and metastatic behavior, potentially offering valuable prognostic insights [ 51 91 93 Through this approach, radiogenomics may enable the most personalized level of risk assessment to date, enhancing the capabilities of precision medicine. It offers the potential to optimize patient selection for specific oncologic treatments, forecast therapy response and resistance, and guide individualized therapeutic strategies. MET-RADS criteria for whole-body MRI in metastatic disease Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) is being employed with increasing frequency to evaluate a broader spectrum of patients with diverse types of cancer and for cancer screening purposes [ 94 The MET-RADS-P and MY-RADS guidelines (published in 2017 and 2019, respectively) demonstrate a high degree of overlap in their recommended imaging protocols. A “core” protocol, suggested in both guidelines for initial disease evaluation, requires approximately 30 min to complete [ 64 MET-RADS-P assesses disease burden in 14 specific body regions, including the primary tumor site, bone, lymph nodes, lung, liver, and other soft tissues. The evaluation is based on the morphological and signal appearance of disease on WB-MRI at baseline and follow-up. All DW images with ADC values should be evaluated alongside corresponding anatomical and relative fat-fraction percentage (FF%) images. Generally, normal bone marrow ADC values are less than 600–700 µm2/s. Viable tumor tissue, on the other hand, typically exhibits ADC values ranging from 700 to 1400 µm2/s. ADC values greater than 1400 µm2/s are commonly observed in treated or necrotic disease [ 95 95 95 MET-RADS-P guidelines served as a model for the development of MY-RADS. MY- RADS assesses disease burden in eight specific bone regions, including the spine, pelvis, long bones, skull, and ribs [ 96 96 Functional MRI evaluation: clinical applications It is increasingly recognized that visual assessment alone provides only a partial understanding of tumor response to pharmacologic and local therapies. The integration of functional imaging parameters introduces quantifiable data on lesion characteristics and their treatment-induced changes, representing one of the emerging challenges in modern radiology. These functional criteria, although not yet standardized, are typically derived from the percentage changes in diffusion metrics obtained through DWI (e.g., ADC, Dp, Dt and pf) and from perfusion-related parameters obtained via DCE-MRI (e.g., wash-in rate, wash-out rate, time to peak, perfusion fraction, and K trans 4 5  Fig. 4 Rectal cancer patient. DWI-MRI assessment post treatment: complete response (arrows). In A B C  Fig. 5 Rectal cancer patient. DWI-MRI assessment post treatment: residual viable tumor (arrows). In A B C Among functional techniques, DWI and DCE-MRI have already entered clinical routine [ 97 98 7 50 54 Conventional chemotherapy induces tumor cell death primarily via necrosis or apoptosis. On DWI, this is reflected by increased water diffusion, resulting in higher ADC values. These increases are proportional to the extent of cell death and associated inflammatory response, and often precede measurable changes in tumor size, making them suitable for early response evaluation [ 99 125 100 101 102 In DCE imaging, effective cytotoxic chemotherapy typically leads to a reduction in the rate and extent of contrast enhancement across several tumor types. The antiangiogenic effect detected by DCE-MRI during neoadjuvant treatment has been linked to improved OS and disease-free survival (DFS), not only in solid tumors but also in hematologic malignancies [ 103 104 105 In MRS, response to conventional chemotherapy or radiotherapy is typically reflected by a reduction in choline-containing and other tumor-associated metabolites. For instance, in breast cancer, a significant decrease in total choline within 24 h after the initial chemotherapy dose has been correlated with later tumor shrinkage [ 106 DWI has also demonstrated clinical utility in assessing tumor response following radiotherapy (RT) in cancers of the brain, rectum, prostate, head and neck, and gynecologic sites [ 107 111 110 Targeted therapies and antiangiogenic treatments can be monitored using DCE-MRI, conventional DWI, and IVIM models. DCE-MRI helps track therapy-induced vascular changes, although no validated biomarkers or consistent outcome correlations currently exist. AAT typically causes reductions in perfusion and permeability, improved blood flow, and signs of devascularization. DWI may show a transient decrease in ADC values early on, linked to cellular swelling or reduced extracellular space, followed by an increase due to necrosis. The IVIM model is a promising tool for separating and quantifying diffusion and perfusion effects during treatment [ 111 112 TACE induces cystic and necrotic changes in treated lesions. DWI shows an initial drop in ADC values within hours post-treatment, followed by a significant increase after 1–2 weeks, coinciding with necrosis. ADC values typically return to baseline within four weeks. DCE-MRI reveals a sustained reduction in enhancement shortly after therapy [ 113 114 In the context of radioembolization, DWI has proven more effective than PET/CT for evaluating early treatment response (within 6 weeks) in patients treated with yttrium-90 microspheres for hepatic metastases. Following RFA, ADC maps of ablation zones often appear heterogeneous, reflecting edema, hemorrhage, charring, necrosis, and fibrosis. Hypointense regions typically correspond to coagulative necrosis. ADC values increase significantly in ablated areas compared to viable tumor, peaking between 1 and 6 months post-treatment [ 115 With electroporation, experimental data suggest that both ADC and kurtosis values, along with semi-quantitative DCE-MRI parameters, may detect treatment effects. However, in clinical settings—such as HCC—no significant ADC changes have been observed between baseline and 1-month post-treatment assessments [ 116 As for immunotherapy, the application of functional MRI to monitor response remains largely investigational. In lymphoma, whole-body DW-MRI has emerged as a potential alternative to PET-CT [ 117 118 120 A summary of the various response criteria across different clinical scenarios is provided in Table 5  Table 5 Response criteria based on anatomical site Anatomical Site Response Criteria Functional Analysis Head and Neck CT/MRI RECIST 1.1 DCE-MRI DWI Breast CT/MRI RECIST 1.1 CHOI PERCIST  Perfusion CT DCE-MRI DWI Spectroscopy Bone CT/MRI/PET RECIST 1.1 MD Anderson PERCIST DWI DCE-MRI Cerebral CT/MRI RECIST 1.1 RANO Densitometric criteria DWI Spectroscopy Sarcoma CT/MRI RECIST 1.1 CHOI DWI Upper and Lower Abdomen CT/MRI RECIST 1.1 mRECIST CHOI PERCIST  Perfusion CT DCE-MRI DWI Renal Cancer CT/MRI RECIST 1.1 CHOI  Perfusion CT DCE-MRI DWI Hematology CT/MRI Dimensional criteria iRECIST DWI TOTAL BODY Conclusion Although RECIST 1.1 remains the standard reference for assessing treatment response in many clinical trials, its limitations have become increasingly evident. As a result, it is essential that radiologists tailor their evaluation strategies to the specific therapeutic context. Depending on the expected biological effects of the treatment, the use of complementary functional imaging criteria may provide a more accurate and meaningful assessment of therapeutic efficacy.
