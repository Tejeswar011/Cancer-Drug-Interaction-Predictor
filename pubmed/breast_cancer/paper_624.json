Tumor acidity was initially proposed to be a “by-product” of hypoxia, which results from abnormal vasculature and excessive oxygen demands. It is now recognized that acidity has its unique function in TMEs, as it can exacerbate abnormal cellular energy metabolism, inhibit cellular carcinogen metabolism, impede DNA damage repair mechanisms, and suppress immune cell activation, all of which play crucial roles during carcinogenesis. Acidic TMEs are also major contributors to the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells, and participate in the mechanisms underlying resistance to cancer treatments including immunotherapy. Therefore, the development of novel anti-cancer agents that target acidic TMEs may have considerable clinical benefits. This article reviews the updated information in this rapidly growing field, including the influence of acidic TMEs on cancer progression, resistance to current treatments and anti-cancer immunity, and their association with hypoxia and aerobic glycolysis. It also summarizes the key molecules that contribute to acidic TMEs and highlights the development of anti-cancer agents targeting tumor acidity, primarily inhibitors of carbonic anhydrases, monocarboxylic acid transporters, vacuolar-type adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase), and Na + + Graphical Abstract  Tumor microenvironments acidity glycolysis hypoxia antineoplastic agents National Key Research and Development Program of China https://doi.org/10.13039/501100012166 2017YFC1308602 Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University 2022-002 2023-001 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes INTRODUCTION Cancer cells grow rapidly and induce pronounced molecular, cellular, and physical alterations within their host tissues, resulting in a complex and continuously evolving entity known as the tumor microenvironment (TME). Although TMEs differ in the composition among cancer types, they exhibit common hallmarks consisting of cancer cells along with blood vessels, lymphatic capillaries, stromal cells, immune cells, and extracellular matrices. 1 2 3 The acidic TME was initially thought to be a “by-product” of hypoxia, which indeed exacerbates abnormal cellular energy metabolism, but it has its own unique function during cancer progression. Under physiological conditions, the extracellular fluid in normal tissues is maintained at a slightly alkalotic pH (7.40±0.02), regulated and balanced by the excretion of volatile and non-volatile acids and the body’s buffering system. Volatile acids, such as H 2 3 2 4 5 4 6 4 Recent studies indicate that acidic TMEs inhibit cellular carcinogen metabolism and impede DNA damage repair mechanisms by inducing extracellular matrix remodeling. 7 2 THE INFLUENCE OF ACIDIC TMES ON CANCER PROGRESSION Unlike normal cells, cancer cells harbor metabolic machinery for their survival in low pH environments, have a higher glycolytic activity, and express proton transporters that normalize intracellular pH. 8 8 Fig. 1 9 10 Fig. 1 11 THE INFLUENCE OF ACIDIC TMES ON RESISTANCE TO CANCER TREATMENTS Acidic TMEs contribute to the resistance of cancer to many chemotherapeutic drugs through different mechanisms ( Fig. 1 12 13 14 12 13 15 THE INFLUENCE OF ACIDIC TMES ON ANTI-CANCER IMMUNITY Although the mechanisms remain unclear due to practical difficulties in measuring tumor acid-base status, many studies show that acidic TMEs can inhibit anti-tumor immunity by affecting many aspects ( Fig. 1 16 17 18 19 20 21 19 22 23 18 The recently developed immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting T cell checkpoint molecules, such as CTLA-4, programmed death 1 (PD-1), or its ligand known as programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), is regarded as one of the most promising strategies for cancer treatment. Acidic TMEs can influence the effectiveness of this immunotherapy in many ways. The acidity in solid tumors can increase the oxidation and aggregation of the antibody Fc fragment, resulting in the reduction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). 19 24 25 TUMOR HYPOXIA AND ACIDIC MICROENVIRONMENTS In solid tumors, oxygen delivery to cancer and stromal cells is reduced due to structural abnormalities of microvessels and poor microcirculation, resulting in frequent hypoxic regions with very low oxygen pressure, which are heterogeneously distributed within tissues, even in areas adjacent to vessels. 3 26 3 Fig. 2 27 Overexpression and stabilization of HIFs in hypoxic TMEs increase glycolysis, leading to a subsequent decrease in extracellular pH. 28 Fig. 2 27 28 + + + Fig. 2 29 2 2 30 31 Fig. 2 AEROBIC GLYCOLYSIS AND ACIDIC TMES Unlike normal cells that mainly rely on the TCA cycle to obtain ATP, cancer cells depend upon glycolysis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) acts as the gatekeeper enzyme between these two pathways since it converts pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which is processed further in the TCA cycle. 32 Fig. 2 33 11 34 34 + 6 34 KEY MOLECULES PARTICIPATING IN TUMOR ACIDICITY AND THE CORRESPONDING INHIBITORS In a broad sense, many molecules involved in hypoxia-inducible pathways, glycolysis, and the TCA cycle contribute to tumor acidity ( Fig. 2 + 35 36 + + 37 + - + + Fig. 2 5 Table 1 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 Carbonic anhydrases and their inhibitors CAs form a large family of zinc metalloenzymes that catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate ions and protons, and play a crucial role in maintaining the cellular and subcellular acid-base homeostasis in almost all biological processes. 69 38 70 CAIX has a unique proteoglycan fragment near the active site, which is absent in other CAs, rendering it the highest catalytic activity among all membrane-bound CAs. In non-cancerous tissues, the expression of CAIX is rare and generally restricted to cells of the gastrointestinal tract; whereas it is strongly and extensively expressed in tumor tissues, associated with the activation of oncogenic signalings, and, therefore, regarded as a biological marker for cancer. 30 70 71 30 71 38 40 72 41 71 42 CAXII shares a similar molecular structure with CAIX, but the main structural variations between them demonstrate that they have different inhibitory activities of ureido-substituted benzene sulfonamides. 71 73 43 44 73 Monocarboxylic acid transporters and their inhibitors MCTs constitute the SLC16 family of 14 members, among which MCT1-4 facilitate the transportation of lactate and H + 74 75 74 76 77 16 The first non-specific MCT inhibitor, 4’-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid (CHC), was discovered in 1974, and often serves as a positive control for the later development of MCT inhibitors. 78 79 45 47 48 49 50 45 47 48 49 50 46 51 52 V-ATPase and its inhibitors V-ATPase is a highly conserved enzyme with remarkably diverse functions in eukaryotic organisms. V-ATPase acts as an ATP-hydrolysis-driven proton pump that is widely distributed in endometrial systems and is essential for acid secretion by many types of cells, including cancer cells. 80 + Numerous studies indicate that V-ATPase is involved in the progression of many diseases, including cancer. Commonly overexpressed V-ATPase helps cancer cells maintain cytoplasmic alkalinity, promoting cell survival in acidic TMEs, and reducing the sensitivity to weak base drugs. 81 82 83 84 Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as lansoprazole, esomeprazole, vonoprazan and omeprazole, are the most widely investigated V-ATPase inhibitors. The anti-tumor activities of PPIs have been verified in cell culture and in animal models, and have exhibited abilities to inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis, and to induce apoptosis of many types of cancer cells. 53 85 86 87 54 53 Bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A are V-ATPase inhibitors and have shown anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects against primary acute myeloid leukemia cells derived from patients in a dose-dependent manner. 55 56 57 58 59 Na + + NHEs are a group of ATP-independent membrane transporters that remove intracellular acid, exchanging a proton for an extracellular sodium ion. In mammals, there are 13 isoforms that are the product of distinct genes. 88 NHE1 is involved in the formation of acidic TMEs by regulating cell volume and shape, cytoskeletal organization, and cell adhesion. 79 89 89 90 63 65 91 60 64 79 65 66 67 Additionally, NHE5 is highly expressed in colorectal cancer. A lead compound known as UTX-143 exhibits NHE5-specific inhibitory activity and selective cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, and reduces their migration and invasion. 68 92 61 62 93 OTHER THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES TARGETING TUMOR ACIDITY As discussed above, acidic TMEs provide a hostile milieu that promotes cancer progression, and cancer cells adapt to these microenvironments by increasing glycolytic activity and the expression of proton transporters that normalize intracellular pH. This acidosis-driven adaptation stimulates the emergence of aggressive tumor cell subpopulations with stronger abilities to invade, proliferate, and evade immune attack. 6 94 95 96 CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES The development and clinical application of anti-cancer agents targeting acidic TMEs are still in their early stages. Employing cutting-edge techniques, such as computational molecular modeling, mathematical oncology, and artificial intelligence, 97 98 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by grants from the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFC1308602), and the Research Funds by the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University (No. 2022-002 and No. 2023-001).
