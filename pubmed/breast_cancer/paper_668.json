Keuthan et al. Alternative RNA Splicing in Retinal Disease Keuthan Casey J. 1 Karma Sadik 1 Zack Donald J. 2 1 2 Correspondence: donzack@gmail.com 10 2023 13 10 446576 a041313 01 10 2025 01 10 2025 04 10 2023 01 10 2025  Copyright © 2023 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press; all rights reserved 2023 Alternative splicing is a fundamental and highly regulated post-transcriptional process that enhances transcriptome and proteome diversity. This process is particularly important in neuronal tissues, such as the retina, which exhibit some of the highest levels of differentially spliced genes in the body. Alternative splicing is regulated both temporally and spatially during neuronal development, can be cell-type-specific, and when altered can cause a number of pathologies, including retinal degeneration. Advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies have facilitated investigations of the alternative splicing landscape of the retina in both healthy and disease states. Additionally, innovations in human stem cell engineering, specifically in the generation of 3D retinal organoids, which recapitulate many aspects of the in vivo retinal microenvironment, have aided studies of the role of alternative splicing in human retinal development and degeneration. Here we review these advances and discuss the ongoing development of strategies for the treatment of alternative splicing-related retinal disease. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
