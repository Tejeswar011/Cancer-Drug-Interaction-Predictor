Among its types, those with changes in a gene called P53 tend to be more aggressive and harder to treat. Current treatment options are often not effective for these patients, and new strategies are urgently needed. In this study, we aimed to find new treatment targets for this aggressive form of cancer. Using advanced protein analysis techniques, we discovered that a molecule called IL4I1 is much higher in these tumors than in normal tissue. We then showed that this molecule helps the cancer grow and avoid the body’s immune system. When we blocked this molecule in laboratory experiments and animal models, tumor growth slowed down, and immune response improved. These findings suggest that IL4I1 could serve as a useful marker to identify high-risk patients and as a new target for future therapies. This research may help improve treatment for women with aggressive endometrial cancer and lead to more personalized and effective care.

Introduction Endometrial cancer is one of the most common gynecological malignancies worldwide, with an increasing incidence in recent years [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 IL4I1 (Interleukin 4-Induced Protein 1) is a key L-amino acid oxidase encoded by a gene located on human chromosome 19. It is primarily expressed in certain immune cells such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells [ 10 11 11 12 13 14 In the field of cancer research, the widespread application of proteomics provides a new opportunity for precision medicine. By identifying biomarkers and molecular subtypes, proteomics promotes the exploration of personalized cancer diagnosis and treatment [ 15 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Patient Samples This study initially screened 495 endometrial cancer patients treated at Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital between 2010 and 2018. All patients provided written informed consent. Clinical information, including age, FIGO staging, tumor grade, histological type, depth of myometrial invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and lymph node metastasis, was retrieved from the hospital’s electronic information system. 2.2. Laser Capture Microdissection for Cancer Tissue Purification Paraffin-embedded tissue samples were sectioned into multiple 10-μm thick slices. For smaller samples, the number of slices was increased as needed. The laser capture microdissection system was used, with tissue slices from the survival and death groups of P53 mutant endometrial cancer placed into collection tubes. Under the precise guidance of a pathologist, an appropriate magnification was selected to accurately target specific cells. After carefully delineating the selected target cells, adjustments were made to the laser aperture size, cutting speed, and laser power to ensure precise cutting and collection of the target cells into the designated tubes [ 16 2.3. Protein Extraction and Digestion Samples were lysed and proteins extracted using SDT buffer (containing 4% SDS, 100 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM DTT, pH 7.6). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Protein digestion followed Matthias Mann’s filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) technique. The resulting peptides were desalting treated using a C18 column (Empore™ SPE Cartridges C18, 3 ml, 7 mm i.d., Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA), followed by concentration under vacuum conditions. Finally, the peptides were reconstituted in 40 μL of 0.1% formic acid solution for quantification using OD280 measurement. 2.4. LC-MS/MS Analysis Samples were separated using the NanoElute HPLC system, equipped with a nano flow rate. Buffer A was a water solution containing 0.1% formic acid, and buffer B was a solution of 0.1% formic acid in 84% acetonitrile. The column was first equilibrated with 95% buffer A, followed by sample loading onto the loading column (Thermo Scientific Acclaim PepMap100, Waltham, MA, USA) using an automatic sample loading system. The samples were then separated through an analytical column (Thermo Scientific EASY column) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. The separated samples were subsequently analyzed using the timsTOF Pro mass spectrometer in positive ion mode, with an ion source voltage set to 1.5 kV. MS and MS/MS data were collected via TOF for further analysis. The raw mass spectrometry data for each sample were integrated and analyzed using MaxQuant software (version 1.6.14) for database searching, identification, and quantification. 2.5. Bioinformatics Analysis Bioinformatics analysis was performed using the ComplexHeatmap R package (compatible with R version 4.0.3) to carry out clustering analysis of the samples and protein expression levels in two dimensions and generate hierarchical clustering heatmaps. Differential protein expression analysis was conducted using the Bioconductor package in R Studio (version 4.0.3). Venn diagram analysis was performed to assess the overlap of identified proteins across different groups. The Limma R package (version 3.40.6) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). For significant differential protein screening, a fold change (FC) >2.0 (upregulated more than 2.0-fold or downregulated less than 0.5-fold) and p p p 2.6. Immunohistochemistry Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) uterine cancer tissue sections (4 μm) were subjected to immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The specimens were deparaffinized and rehydrated, then incubated with the following primary antibodies: IL4I1 (1:1000 dilution, ab222102, Abcam, Waltham, MA, USA), p53 (1:100 dilution, ab32389, Abcam, USA), MLH1 (1:100 dilution, MAB-0838, Maixin, Tongliao, China), MSH2 (1:100 dilution, MAB-0836, Maixin, China), MSH6 (1:100 dilution, MAB-0831, Maixin, China), and PMS2 (1:100 dilution, RMA-0775, Maixin, China) ( Table S1 Supplementary Figure S1 17 18 19 Supplementary Figure S2 2.7. POLE Mutation Analysis Pathogenic mutations in the proofreading domain of POLE, specifically in exons 9-14, were assessed through Sanger sequencing [ 20 Table S2 ® 2.8. Western Blotting Proteins were extracted using RIPA lysis buffer, and their concentrations were determined using the BCA assay. Approximately 20 µg of protein was loaded into each lane, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk at room temperature for 1 h, followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies. The primary antibodies used were anti-IL4I1 (ab222102, Abcam) and anti-GAPDH (ab8245, Abcam). Afterward, the membrane was incubated with secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Western blots were developed using an ECL Western blotting substrate and quantified with ImageJ software (version 1.53). 2.9. IL4I1 Expression in Endometrial Carcinoma from TCGA The TCGA Endometrial Carcinoma (EC) database includes data from 546 EC samples and 35 normal tissue specimens. The UALCAN portal ( http://UALCAN.path.uab.edu 2.10. Cell Culture and Lentiviral Infection The human endometrial carcinoma cell lines HEC-1b and KLE, both identified as P53 mutant, were obtained from the Translational Medicine Center at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Tongji University. These cell lines were cultured in DMEM medium (Hyclone, Beijing, China) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO 2 21 2.11. Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion Assays Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion assays were conducted as previously described [ 22 2.12. In Vivo Tumor Model Nude mice (female, 4 weeks) were obtained from the Animal Experimentation of Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital (Shanghai, China). HEC-1b and KLE cells were both identified as P53 mutant type and sourced from the Translational Medicine Center Laboratory of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Tongji University. 1 × 10 7 3 n 2 2 2.13. Single-Cell RNA-Seq Analysis Single-cell RNA-seq data (UCEC_GSE139555) were downloaded from the Tumor Immune Single-cell Hub web service ( http://tisch.comp-genomics.org/home/ 23 2.14. Data Analysis For comparing categorical variables, the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test was used. Kaplan–Meier (KM) survival curves were generated, and the log-rank test was employed to assess survival differences between groups. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 25.0, R software (version 3.6.3), and GraphPad Prism software (version 9.2). All statistical tests were two-sided, and p 3. Results 3.1. Molecular Subtyping of Endometrial Cancer We examined samples from 495 high-grade endometrial cancer patients ( Table 1 24 3.2. Selection of FIGO Stage I P53 Mutant Endometrial Cancer Samples In this study, we selected cases of FIGO Stage I P53 mutant endometrial cancer from 62 patients and conducted comprehensive follow-up to gather detailed prognostic information. As of 30 June 2022, we classified the patients into two groups based on their survival status: the survival group ( n n Table 2 3.3. Proteomic and Bioinformatics Analysis The proteomic analysis identified a total of 52,235 peptides, of which 50,332 were unique peptides, leading to the identification of 6810 proteins, with 6148 proteins being quantified ( Figure 1 Figure 1 In the differential expression analysis, the bar plot ( Figure 1 p Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 3.4. IL4I1 Expression in Endometrial Cancer Tissue The expression levels of IL4I1 in cancer and adjacent normal tissues were analyzed using the Pan-cancer dataset from the TCGA database. As shown in Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Additionally, this pattern was consistent across different cancer stages ( Figure 2 Figure 2 3.5. Differential Expression of IL4I1 in TP53-Mutant Endometrial Cancer To explore IL4I1 expression differences in TP53-mutant EC, we performed immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis comparing IL4I1 levels between survival and death groups. Results indicated that IL4I1 was significantly upregulated in the death group ( Figure 3 Figure 3 3.6. IL4I1 Expression and Prognostic Analysis in TP53-Mutant Endometrial Cancer To assess the prognostic significance of IL4I1 expression, we stratified 33 TP53-mutant endometrial cancer (EC) patients into high- and low-expression groups based on the median IL4I1 expression level. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis revealed that patients with high IL4I1 expression had significantly lower overall survival (OS) compared to the low-expression group ( Figure 3 p 3.7. Generation of Stable IL4I1 Knockout HEC-1B and KLE Endometrial Cancer Cell Lines To investigate the functional role of IL4I1 in TP53-mutant EC progression, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing was employed to establish IL4I1-knockout (KO) HEC-1B and KLE cell lines. Western blot analysis confirmed the successful depletion of IL4I1 in the knockout cells ( Figure 4 3.8. IL4I1 Knockout Suppresses Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion in TP53-Mutant Endometrial Cancer To evaluate the effects of IL4I1 depletion on tumor cell behavior, CCK-8 proliferation assays were performed. Results showed that IL4I1 knockout significantly inhibited the proliferation of both HEC-1B and KLE cells ( p Figure 4 p Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 5 Collectively, these findings suggest that IL4I1 plays a critical role in promoting tumor aggressiveness in TP53-mutant EC, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for this highly invasive cancer subtype. 3.9. IL4I1 Expression Profiling and Its Potential Role in the Tumor Microenvironment Based on the single-cell RNA-seq data from GSE139555 Figure 6 Further correlation analysis using the TCGA database on TP53-mutant EC samples revealed that IL4I1 expression was significantly positively correlated with tryptophan metabolism and tumor inflammation features, while exhibiting a negative correlation with tumor mutational burden (TMB) ( Figure 6 4. Discussion The role of IL4I1 in tumor progression has become increasingly complex. Its expression in the tumor microenvironment is considered an integral part of the immune evasion mechanism. Overexpression of IL4I1 can promote tryptophan catabolism [ 25 26 27 The expression of IL4I1 across various tumor types reveals a complex relationship with disease prognosis. In cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, clear cell renal carcinoma, glioblastoma, and low-grade lymphomas, IL4I1 expression levels correlate closely with tumor progression, clinical-pathological features, malignancy, and patient survival, making it a promising prognostic biomarker for various cancers [ 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 Endometrial cancer, one of the most common malignancies in women globally, has seen a rising incidence in recent years. While imaging technologies and molecular diagnostic techniques have been applied clinically, traditional therapeutic strategies are still limited for certain poor-prognosis subtypes of endometrial cancer. Particularly, P53-mutant endometrial cancer remains challenging due to its aggressive nature and poor prognosis, highlighting the urgent need for new therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers. Based on our findings, IL4I1 is highly expressed in P53-mutant endometrial cancer and is closely linked to poorer prognosis. While this correlation does not establish causality, it supports the hypothesis that IL4I1 may contribute to tumor progression. Functional experiments demonstrated that IL4I1 knockout significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of P53-mutant endometrial cancer cells, suggesting a tumor-promoting role in this context. These findings are further supported by xenograft models, which confirmed the suppressive effects of IL4I1 loss in vivo. However, we acknowledge that these data reflect phenotypic consequences rather than direct molecular mechanisms, and that IL4I1 likely operates as part of a broader regulatory network. Future studies are warranted to delineate the specific pathways through which IL4I1 exerts its effects. Taken together, our study contributes to the growing evidence that IL4I1 may modulate the tumor microenvironment and influence cancer aggressiveness. Given the importance of immune evasion and inflammation in endometrial cancer metastasis [ 35 36 5. Conclusions In summary, this study identifies IL4I1 as a significantly upregulated protein in TP53-mutant endometrial cancer and demonstrates its association with poor prognosis. Functional assays confirmed that IL4I1 promotes tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and is correlated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. While mechanistic pathways remain to be fully elucidated, our findings suggest that IL4I1 may serve as a candidate prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in this aggressive EC subtype. Future studies involving pathway-specific interventions and interaction mapping are needed to clarify IL4I1’s mechanistic role and assess its translational utility in precision oncology.
