This case report describes a 50-year-old male with stage 4 colon cancer, undergoing cytarabine chemotherapy, who presented with sepsis, altered mental status, and melena. A CT scan revealed gastric pneumatosis and portal venous air, prompting urgent diagnostic laparoscopy and intraoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which showed patchy mucosal ischemia without transmural involvement.

The patient met sepsis criteria, exhibiting hypotension with a systolic blood pressure of 84 mmHg and a heart rate of 102 bpm, along with a lactic acid level of 6.2 (0.4-2.0 m/mol) and a white blood cell count of 18.7 × 10^9/L (4.5-10.9 k/uL). On examination, the patient was soft, distended, and non-tender, with melena in his ostomy bag. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics were initiated to cover the most likely gas-forming organisms, and the patient received 5.5 liters of fluid over the first 12 hours. An initial CT scan of the abdomen demonstrated gastric pneumatosis with accompanying portal venous air, prompting urgent surgical consultation (Figure 1 Figure 1 The CT scan demonstrating the coronal (A) and axial (B) views. Red arrows: Air within the stomach wall secondary to gas-producing bacteria. Green arrows: Portal venous gas translocation of air from the stomach wall into portal hepatic circulation. Due to concern for acute gastric ischemia, the patient was taken urgently to the operating room for diagnostic laparoscopy, which revealed no acute findings. An intraoperative EGD was performed, showing patchy mucosal ischemia of the stomach and lower esophagus (Figure 2 Figure 2 Intraoperative EGD revealing patchy ischemic necrosis of mucosa of the stomach in the retroflexed position (black arrows). EGD: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy Discussion In the literature, EG has historically been a rare pathology, with only 57 case reports published between 1980 and 2018 [ 3 4 1 5 6 Table 1 Comparison of cited EG cases EG: Emphysematous gastritis Author Malignancy Chemotherapy agents Causative organism Management Outcome Johnson et al.

[ 6 Breast Cancer Paclitaxel Clostridium ventriculi Total gastrectomy Survived Chemotherapy can contribute to the development of EG through mechanisms such as immunosuppression and direct damage to the gastric mucosal barrier, thereby facilitating invasion by gas-producing bacteria. Agents like cytarabine, which the patient in this case was receiving, are known to cause neutropenia and gastrointestinal toxicity, potentially exacerbating vulnerability in already immunocompromised individuals with advanced malignancies. For instance, bevacizumab has been implicated in a case of EG in metastatic colon cancer, possibly due to its anti-angiogenic properties leading to mucosal ischemia and impaired healing [ 5 C. ventriculi, 6 7 Emphysematous gastritis is diagnosed by observing gas in the stomach wall, but the classification can be confusing due to overlapping diagnoses. Gas within the stomach wall is a rare occurrence. When air or gas is present on imaging, gastric emphysema, EG, or pneumatosis intestinalis may be diagnosed. The presence of gas must originate from the environment or be produced within the gastric wall [ 8 Emphysematous gastritis is a form of phlegmonous gastritis in which the bacteria embedded in the stomach wall produce gas. These microorganisms penetrate the local mucosa or spread through hematogenous dissemination from another source, causing this condition. The stomach is an uncommon site of involvement due to its abundant blood supply, gastric acidity, and mucosal barrier [ 9 10 Patients typically present with fever, acute abdominal pain, shock, and often hematemesis. A late presentation may include vomiting necrotic casts of stomach mucosa, which is considered a pathognomonic sign. The gas-forming organisms infiltrate the stomach wall diffusely. The necrotic cast results from dissection along the plane of the muscularis mucosa by invading organisms, leading to mucosal erosions, acute inflammation, edema, and intramural gas. Over time, the inflammation of the wall of the stomach causes granulation tissue formation by fibroblasts [ 10 13 Characteristic radiographic findings for EG include a thickened wall with intramural gas and a dilated stomach. The gas from the wall of the stomach is also often seen in the portal venous system within two days of symptom onset and can be present for months after symptom resolution. The gas in the stomach wall may sometimes be appreciated on abdominal x-ray, but the best method for detecting a smaller amount of intramural air is CT, which also allows for localization of the gas as well [ 10 14 15 Early recognition and treatment of EG play a crucial role in survival. This condition carries a mortality rate of 55% to 61%. Acute-phase treatments include hemodynamic stabilization with resuscitative intravenous fluids, empiric antibiotics covering anaerobes and gram-negative organisms, bowel rest, and identification and resolution of predisposing factors. Current recommendations advise avoiding surgery in the acute phase unless perforation is present, but optimal therapy has not been definitively established. The existing literature does not support gastric resection during the acute phase of EG as standard therapy [ 3 10 13 16 Conclusions This case report highlights the successful conservative management of EG in a 50-year-old patient with stage 4 colon cancer undergoing cytarabine chemotherapy. Despite the high mortality rate associated with EG, prompt diagnosis through imaging, targeted antibiotic therapy, and supportive care led to the patient’s recovery without complications related to EG. The rarity of EG in the context of chemotherapy, particularly in colon cancer, suggests a potential link warranting further investigation. This case underscores the importance of early recognition and non-surgical treatment strategies in managing EG, especially in immunocompromised oncologic patients.
