PI3Kα is the second\nmost mutated oncogenic protein, and its overactivation initiates a\nsecondary signaling cascade that enhances, among others, the activity\nof mTOR complexes 1 and 2. Despite the importance of this pathway,\nthere is a gap in identifying dual inhibitors targeting both PI3Kα\nand mTOR, which could potentially overcome the limitations of single-target\ntherapies. In this study, advanced computational tools were employed\nto identify plant-derived compounds with selective or dual inhibitory\npotentials against PI3Kα and mTOR enzymes. Compounds were obtained\nfrom the NuBBe database, a catalogue of Brazilian natural compounds.\nAmong the 1745 compounds docked against the PI3Kα and mTOR enzymes,\nfour bioflavonoids (2–5) displaying atropisomerism stood out.\nThese compounds were further investigated for their binding profile\ninto the catalytic sites of PI3Kα and mTOR, considering the\ninfluence of their sense of chirality ( Ra Sa Sa Ra Ra Sa Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 10.13039/501100002322 NA Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 10.13039/501100003593 305148/2023-0 Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 10.13039/501100003593 408135/2023-9 Fundação Cearense de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 10.13039/501100005283 BMD-0008-01997.01.20/22 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes document-id-old-9 ao5c06196 document-id-new-14 ao5c06196 production-flag-MathML-config-version 3 production-flag-journal-citation-display-style acs-titles production-flag-journal-date-display-style dates-used-rcd-rvd-acc production-flag-si-avail yes document-id-alt-64 ae5c5d6553956e32fd973da90c4dc2ac99cf78a08222305ad8eb7fe9aed2aa32 Published\nas part of ACS Omega special issue 1 Introduction The phosphoinositide 3-kinase\n(PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway plays a critical\nrole in regulating key metabolic processes, including cell proliferation,\nsurvival, and growth.  In recent decades, significant efforts have focused on developing\nPI3Ks/AKT/mTOR-targeting drugs for anticancer therapy.    One of the primary advantages of using multitarget inhibitors\nwithin\nthis pathway is the potential reduction in toxicity. Targeting multiple\nenzymes with a single inhibitor may allow for lower dosages, potentially\nreducing the toxicity. Moreover, sustained inhibition associated with\nmultitarget inhibitors may reduce the likelihood of resistance development,\nas they act at multiple points along the same pathway.  Among the sources of molecular scaffolds for the development\nof\nnew drugs, natural products are highlighted as a rich source of secondary\nmetabolites displaying a large spectrum of biological activities,\nincluding cytotoxicity against human tumor cells.   Biflavonoids, a subclass\nof flavonoids, have also shown important\npharmacological properties, such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer,\nantiviral, antimicrobial, and antithrombotic activity by acting in\nthe PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.  Ra Sa Ra Sa Given the potential advantages of enantioselective\nmultitarget\ninhibitors in reducing toxicity and enhancing therapeutic efficacy,\nbiflavonoids emerge as promising candidates for the dual inhibition\nof PI3K and mTOR. Despite their pharmacological potential, flavonoids\nface well-documented challenges in drug development, including limited\ntarget selectivity, complex structure–activity relationships,\npoor bioavailability, and metabolic instability frequently linked\nto cytochrome P450 interactions. These hurdles have historically limited\ntheir clinical advancement. In this context, recent advances in computational\nmethodologies facilitate systematic evaluation of binding selectivity,\ninteraction stability, and pharmacokinetic properties of identified\ncompounds, enabling the prioritization of natural biflavonoids with\nfavorable drug-like profiles. Accordingly, this study employs an integrated\napproach combining ensemble-based virtual screening, molecular dynamics\nsimulations, and MM-PBSA free-energy calculations to identify biflavonoids\nwith a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitory potential. This workflow supports\nthe selection of compounds with robust interaction profiles and provides\nstructural insights that may guide future optimization toward multitarget\nactivity and improved pharmacokinetics. To achieve this, we\nemployed an ensemble-based virtual screening\nprotocol to assess the binding potential of 1745 plant-derived compounds\nfrom the NuBBE database to the ATP-binding sites of PI3Kα and\nmTOR. Promising hits were subjected to molecular dynamics simulations,\nfollowed by MM-PBSA calculations to estimate binding free energies\nand decompose the energetic contributions of key interacting residues.\nThis integrative strategy identified biflavonoid scaffolds with potential\nas enantioselective dual inhibitors of PI3K/mTOR, offering a pathway\ntoward improved therapeutic profiles. 2 Results and Discussion In this work,\nfour biflavonoid molecules displaying dual PI3K/mTOR\ninhibitory behavior were identified among 1745 phytochemicals from\nthe Brazilian database (NuBBE). To avoid bias from experimental geometries\nduring virtual screening, the docking of each compound was simulated\nagainst a conformational ensemble. After the top-score compounds showing\natropisomeric properties were identified, the enantiopreference of\neach of them was evaluated through ensemble docking followed by molecular\ndynamics simulations. Finally, their binding geometries and interaction\nprofiles were described using free-energy calculations. 2.1 Ensemble Generation One of the main\npitfalls when performing virtual screening simulations against biological\ntargets is underestimating the degree of freedom such targets might\npresent. Figure S1 x y z Figure S7 Cross-docking simulations\nidentified the smallest set of experimental structural targets required\nto recover the experimental geometries of the ligands. Using a search\narea of 20 × 20 × 20 for both proteins, we selected structures\nwith the smallest deviation in ligand binding geometries compared\nto experimental crystallographic data. For PI3Kα, nine crystallographic\nligands were docked into each of the nine crystallographic structures.\nAs shown in Figure S2 5XGI 4YKN 4L23 3HIZ 4LIB 4JSV 4JSX 4JSP 3JBZ 4JT5 4JT6 Figure S3 4JSN The observation that distinct PI3Kα and mTOR conformers preferentially\nreproduce different subsets of ligands supports the well-established\nnotion that ensemble-based docking enhances pose prediction accuracy\nand reduces false negatives by accounting for binding-site plasticity. 2.2 Ensemble-Based Virtual Screening A total of 1,745 phytochemical compounds from the NuBBE database\nwere docked against conformational ensembles of both PI3Kα and\nmTOR.

To investigate the interaction between the selected\nligands and\nthe target proteins, we analyzed the fluctuation of the interaction\nenergy considering residues located at radial distances up to 10Å.\nFor this purpose, the radial distance of each residue from the nearest\natom of the ligand was measured, and the individual interaction energy\nwas calculated and added up in 0.5Å increments. To avoid losing\nrelevant residues, the convergence was considered when the total energy\nvaried by less than 10% over a 2Å. Such an approach has been\nwell established in previous publications and circumvents the use\nof arbitrary thresholds as it accounts for the stability of energy\nfluctuations along the distance from the binding pocket.

Future studies\nshould focus on synthesizing the prioritized biflavonoids and evaluating\ntheir efficacy through in vitro 3 Conclusions In this study, we identified\nfour bioflavonoids with dual inhibitory\npotential for PI3Kα/mTOR, derived from a virtual screening of\n1745 phytochemicals from the Brazilian NuBBE database. All selected\ncompounds exhibited enantioselective binding, highlighting the influence\nof their atropisomeric configurations on the binding affinity. Among\nthem, compound 4 stood out for its dual inhibitory activity in both\nconfigurations (( Sa Ra Sa 2 Ra 3 Sa 4 Ra 4 Sa 3 Sa 5 Ra 2 Ra 5 Binding\nenergy analyses and residue-level interaction mapping revealed\nthat dual inhibition was supported by key stabilizing interactions\nwithin 2.5 to 4.5 Å of the active sites. For PI3Kα, hydrophobic\ncontacts with Ile800, Ile848, and Ile932, π–π stacking\nwith Trp780, and π–sulfur interactions with Met772 and\nMet922 were particularly important, while Asp933 consistently contributed\nto repulsive interactions. In mTOR, stabilizing contacts were primarily\nmediated by Trp2239, Ile2356, Leu2185, Ile2237, and Ile2163, whereas\nrepulsive interactions involving Asp2357, Glu2190, Lys2187, and Gly2238\nvaried by configuration. These findings reveal distinct binding modes\nand highlight the structural basis for selectivity and dual-target\npotential. Altogether, these findings underscore the importance\nof chirality\nin modulating enzyme inhibition and provide a solid foundation for\nthe rational design of dual PI3Kα/mTOR inhibitors. Furthermore,\nthis study supports the potential of plant-derived natural products\nas promising leads for anticancer drug development. Experimental validation,\nincluding selectivity profiling, SAR analysis, and pharmacokinetic\nstudies, will be crucial in the next stages. 4 Computational Details Ensemble-based\nvirtual screening targeting human PI3Kα and\nmTOR was performed by using a conformational set based on crystallographic\ngeometries of both enzymes. For the sake of completeness, states representing\nboth enzymes in the bound and unbound (APO) states were employed during\nthe screening. A total of 1745 natural compounds of plant origin were\ndocked against each enzyme’s ensemble. Among the compounds\nwith a dual inhibitory profile, 11 showed significantly high binding\nenergy. Of these, four exhibited atropisomerism and underwent stereoselectivity\ntests. Subsequently, the resulting binding geometries were subjected\nto molecular dynamics simulations to enhance the binding interactions.\nFor this purpose, energy decomposition calculations were performed. 4.1 Structural Data The following crystallographic\nstructures were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB): 4JPS 4L23 4L2Y 4YKN 4ZOP 5DXH 5DXT 5XGH 5XGI 3JBZ 4JT5 4JT6 4JSX 4JSV 4.2 Protein and Ligand Preparation Prior\nto simulations, all protein structures were aligned by α carbons\nand protonated at pH 7.0 using the ProPKA code on the PDB 2PQR 4.3 Ensemble Generation For system validation,\nself-docking and cross-docking techniques were used. The results of\nself-docking and cross-docking were considered satisfactory when the\nlowest energy poses had a root mean square below 3Å when compared\nto the position of the reference structure. Self-docking consists\nof making the molecular docking between a protein with an experimentally\nresolved structure and the ligand crystallized along with it. For\nthe study, nine structures of PI3Kα enzyme obtained from the\nPDB (PDB codes: 4JPS 4L23 4L2Y 4YKN 4ZOP 5DXH 5DXT 5XGH 5XGI 3JBZ 4JSV 4JSX 4JT5 4JT6 4JSP 2PQR The molecular docking\nwas performed on a search space (box) comprising\nthe active site of the protein. In this space, the software tries\nto dock the ligand in a position and conformation that results in\nthe lowest binding energy between the receptor and ligand. The AutodockTools\nalgorithm was used for the preparation of molecular docking. A box\nwas generated; the box sizes 20 × 20 × 20 ( x y z x y z x y z The cross-docking\nanalysis was important to evaluate a possible\ninfluence of the different conformations of the enzymes on the proposed\nbinding mode of molecular docking for the tested inhibitors and to\npropose sets of enzyme structures. The cross-docking experiment was\nperformed with 9 inhibitors of PI3Kα and 6 inhibitors for mTOR,\nusing the representative structures. 4.4 Ensemble-Based Virtual Screening For the molecular docking study, a total of 1745 compounds were selected.\nThe three-dimensional structures of these inhibitors were taken from\nthe NuBBE database in mol2 format. The compounds were converted into\nthe PDBQT format and protonated using the automation of the Open Babel\nprogram. The molecular docking\nexperiment was performed with the aid of the AutoDock Vina program. Of the 1745 compounds, 10% (174) with the\nlowest Δ G Supporting Table S1 4.5 Induced Fitting Simulation Molecular\ndynamics simulations were used to evaluate the stability of the selected\ncompounds. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with the\naid of the GROMACS 2019 package. Prior to the\nDM production step, total energy minimization was performed by combining\nthe steepest algorithm and the conjugate gradient method in sequence.\nIn total, each system was balanced using integration steps from 1\nfs to 2 ns, following gradually decreasing constraint forces over\n4 steps of 250 ps each. The long-range electrostatic interaction calculation\nwas modeled with the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method For the complexes (protein–ligand)\nof the conformational\nassembly with compounds of plant origin, a 10 ns trajectory was obtained,\nwhich was subsequently used to calculate the interaction energy of\nthe complex (receptor–ligand) system, calculated using the\nMM-PBSA method. Conformations for MM/PBSA calculations were sampled\nfrom two distinct points along the simulation time: the first, immediately\nafter the stabilization of all structures (from 90 to 100 ns), and\nthe second at the end of the simulation (from 190 to 200 ns). 4.6 MM-PBSA Molecular Mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann\nSurface Area (MM-PBSA) is an efficient method used to estimate the\nbinding free energy in protein–ligand complexes throughout\na DM simulation. eq 1 Δ G bind = G complex − ( G protein + G ligand ) where Gcomplex is the total free energy\nof the protein–ligand complex and Gprotein and Gligand are\nthe total free energies of the isolated protein and ligand in solvent,\nrespectively.
