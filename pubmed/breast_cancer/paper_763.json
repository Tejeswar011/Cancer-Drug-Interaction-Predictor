Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) has been shown to suppress TNBC proliferation and metastasis. G protein–coupled receptor 173 (GPR173), known to regulate GnRHR in neuroendocrine cells, has an undefined role in TNBC. This study aimed to determine whether GPR173 modulates TNBC progression through GnRHR-mediated signaling. Methods: GPR173 and GnRHR expression levels were analyzed in TNBC tissues and correlated with patient prognosis. In vitro, TNBC cell lines were modified to knock down or overexpress GPR173 and GnRHR. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and expression of dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), phosphorylated/total protein kinase B (AKT), phosphorylated/total extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), and matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2) were evaluated. Results: GPR173 and GnRHR expression was significantly reduced in TNBC tumors compared to normal breast tissues. Low expression of either protein correlated with poorer overall survival and increased lymph node metastasis. In vitro, GPR173 knockdown promoted TNBC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and reduced GnRHR expression. These changes were accompanied by increased phosphorylation of AKT and ERK, and elevated MMP2 expression. Notably, the pro-proliferative, pro-migratory, and pro-invasive effects of GPR173 knockdown were reversed by rescue overexpression of GnRHR. This GnRHR overexpression was accompanied by upregulation of DUSP1, dephosphorylation of AKT and ERK, and decreased MMP2 levels. Conclusions: Based on these in vitro data, GPR173 likely constrains the pro-proliferative, pro-migratory, and pro-invasive phenotypes of TNBC cells by enhancing GnRHR signaling. These findings highlight GnRHR and GPR173 as potential therapeutic targets for TNBC.

However, its expression has also been documented in a variety of nonpituitary tissues and cancer cells, including those of the breast, ovary, and prostate.  4  5  6 7 8 Another GPCR, G protein–coupled receptor 173 (GPR173), is a member of a receptor subfamily primarily expressed in the central nervous system. GPR173 has been implicated in a diverse range of physiological processes, including reproduction, mood regulation, and appetite control. 9 11  12  13 Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the precise role of GPR173 in TNBC. Specifically, we sought to systematically evaluate the expression characteristics and prognostic significance of GPR173 and GnRHR in TNBC tissues, and to explore the impact of the GPR173–GnRHR signaling axis on tumor cell proliferation and metastatic potential and its molecular mechanisms, thereby providing new potential approaches for targeted therapy of TNBC.

(Catalog No. CL-0150; RRID: CVCL_0062). This cell line was originally derived from the pleural effusion of a patient diagnosed with metastatic breast adenocarcinoma. According to the manufacturer, the identity of the cell line was authenticated through short tandem repeat profiling, and the cells were confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination. The culture medium was MEM (Wuhan Pricella Biotechnology Co., Ltd., PM150410P) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Wuhan Pricella Biotechnology Co., Ltd., PB180120 2 Transfection Both the GPR173 siRNA and the GnRHR-overexpression plasmid constructs were designed and purchased from General Biologicals (Chuzhou, Anhui, China). The siRNA sequences targeting GPR173 were 5′-GGACUGAUUAUGUGCGUGATT-3′ (sense) and 5′-UCACGCACAUAAUCAGUCCTT-3′ (antisense).

After discarding the paraformaldehyde, 1 mL of crystal violet staining solution (Genview, DC079-25G) was added to stain the cells for 15 minutes. The cells were dried, photographed, and counted. The experiment was independently performed 3 times. Wound healing assay Cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 3 × 10 5 Transwell A total of 1 × 10 5 Western blotting Cells were lysed on ice using lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors.

Results indicated that GPR173 and GnRHR expression levels were significantly lower in TNBC than in normal breast tissues ( Figure 1A Figure 1B Figure 1.

Below is a revised version of the description: The study shows that GPR173 and GnRHR mRNA expressions are higher in normal tissues than in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissues, correlating with lower overall survival rates in TNBC patients.

Graph 2 presents Kaplan-Meier plots comparing overall survival in TNBC patients based on GPR173 and GnRHR expression levels. Both genes are associated with poorer survival in TNBC patients with low expression. Low expression of GPR173 and GnRHR was associated with lymph node metastasis To investigate correlations of GPR173 and GnRHR expression with the clinicopathological characteristics of TNBC, we used immunofluorescence to examine a TNBC tissue microarray composed of paraffin-embedded cancer tissues and their corresponding adjacent normal tissues from 80 patients with TNBC. However, due to technical issues, only 38 patients were included in the analysis ( Figure 2A Tables 1 2 Figure 2B Table 3 Table 3 Figure 2.

Expression of GPR173 and GnRHR in TNBC cell lines The expression levels of GPR173 and GnRHR in the TNBC cell lines BT-20, BT-483, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-468 were obtained from the CCLE website. The results indicated that both genes exhibited higher expression in BT-483 cells and lower expression in BT-20 cells, with intermediate expression levels observed in MDA-MB-231 cells ( Figure 3 Figure 3.

Western blotting analysis confirmed that GPR173 expression was reduced in the si-GPR173 group, indicating effective interference by GPR173 siRNA ( Figure 4A Figure 4B Figure 4C Figure 4D Figure 4E Figure 4.

The study includes Western blot quantification for GPR173 levels, viability assessment via CCK-8 assay, colony formation, migratory capacity in a wound healing assay, and invasion capacity via a transwell assay, all comparing wild-type and si-GPR173. Findings show that si-GPR173 knockdown leads to reduced GPR173 protein levels, increased cell viability, higher colony numbers, enhanced cell migration, and increased cell invasion.

In a 4-group design as described above, Western blotting was performed to assess p-AKT, AKT, p-ERK, ERK, and MMP2. Interference with GPR173 increased p-AKT, p-ERK, and MMP2 relative to NC, whereas GnRHR overexpression in the si-GPR173 background attenuated these changes ( Figure 6C Supplemental Table S4 Discussion Triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with limited actionable targets. Chemotherapy remains the mainstay, yet responses are modest and toxicities are substantial. Identifying novel proteins involved in TNBC proliferation and metastasis would deepen our understanding of TNBC’s biological behavior and aid in discovering potential therapeutic targets. Our previous study showed that GnRHR inhibits TNBC cell proliferation and metastasis.  6 In seeking to identify upstream regulators of GnRHR, we focused on GPR173, a putative upstream regulator. However, no studies have reported on GPR173 regulation in TNBC. Bioinformatics analysis showed lower GPR173 expression in TNBC than in normal breast tissue, and patients with higher GPR173 expression had better prognoses than those with lower expression. These findings suggest that GPR173 may play a role in inhibiting TNBC progression. To select a suitable cell line for this study, we first examined GPR173 and GnRHR expression levels in various TNBC cell lines using the CCLE database. Expression levels of both genes were moderate in MDA-MB-231 cells, suggesting that these cells are appropriate for further research. We transfected MDA-MB-231 cells with siRNA targeting GPR173, and WB analysis confirmed decreased GPR173 expression, indicating successful GPR173 knockdown. Additionally, GnRHR expression decreased following GPR173 knockdown, consistent with a positive regulatory relationship between GPR173 and GnRHR in vitro. This finding aligns with previous studies in hypothalamic cells, where GPR173’s regulatory mechanism may involve activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway.  19 Since GnRHR expression decreased following GPR173 interference, we conducted a rescue experiment by overexpressing GnRHR to investigate the regulatory relationship between GnRHR and GPR173. We found that GPR173 inhibition increased cell proliferation as well as migratory and invasive phenotypes, which were subsequently attenuated by GnRHR overexpression. These observations suggest that GnRHR may act downstream of GPR173 to partially counter the in vitro pro-proliferative, pro-migratory, and pro-invasive changes observed upon GPR173 inhibition. This mechanism has not been previously reported. To investigate GnRHR downstream pathways, we performed RNA sequencing after GnRHR overexpression, which indicated that DUSP1 transcripts were increased in the GnRHR-overexpression group. Previous reports indicate that DUSP1 expression also increased upon GnRHR activation in cultured mouse pituitary cells, 20 21 22 24  25 A limitation of this study is that all experiments were conducted in vitro using the MDA-MB-231 cell line only. Future studies are necessary to validate these findings across additional TNBC cell lines and in vivo models. The precise regulatory relationship between GPR173 and GnRHR also remains incompletely defined and warrants further investigation. While DUSP1 upregulation accompanied the GnRHR-mediated rescue, a causal role for DUSP1 in mediating these effects remains to be established. Future studies will test this directly by combining GPR173 knockdown and GnRHR overexpression with DUSP1 silencing (si-DUSP1) and by validating DUSP1 changes at both mRNA and protein levels. In addition, in vivo models (eg, orthotopic implantation or tail-vein colonization assays) across multiple TNBC cell lines will be employed to evaluate metastatic dissemination and to substantiate the translational relevance of the GPR173-GnRHR-DUSP1 axis. Conclusions Our findings suggest that GPR173 may constrain the pro-proliferative, pro-migratory, and pro-invasive phenotypes of MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells by upregulating GnRHR. These in vitro effects were accompanied by reduced AKT/ERK phosphorylation and lower MMP2 levels. Further studies, including in vivo validation and targeted loss-of-function approaches, are required to establish causality and to evaluate the translational relevance of the GPR173-GnRHR axis.
