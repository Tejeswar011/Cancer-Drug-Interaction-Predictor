Liposomal doxorubicin (Lip-DOX) was designed to reduce this toxicity compared to conventional doxorubicin (Con-DOX). This study utilized the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database to compare the cardiotoxicity profiles of the two formulations through disproportionality analysis and to explore potential mechanisms using network pharmacology. We analyzed 10,695 adverse event reports for Con-DOX and 13,164 for Lip-DOX. Disproportionality analysis, measured by the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidence intervals, demonstrated that Con-DOX was associated with a higher risk of cardiomyopathy (ROR 34.07) and cardiac failure (ROR 5.88) compared to Lip-DOX (ROR 18.39 and 3.80, respectively). Furthermore, Con-DOX generated safety signals for arrhythmias and myocarditis, while Lip-DOX did not. The rates of serious adverse events were high for both formulations (Con-DOX: 98.74%; Lip-DOX: 98.61%), with reported mortality rates of 26.21% and 23.15%, respectively, indicating no significant difference in the overall severity of reported cardiotoxicity or mortality. Network pharmacology analysis identified 113 overlapping targets associated with DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC), which were refined to 10 core targets. Key enriched Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes included ‘response to oxidative stress’ and ‘regulation of apoptotic signaling pathway’. Significant Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways encompassed the HIF-1 signaling pathway, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, and the fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis pathway. Our study indicates the cardiotoxic profiles and underlying mechanisms of the two DOX formulations, providing valuable insights for drug safety monitoring and clinical practice.

Since its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1974, it has been widely used as a first-line treatment, either alone or in combination with other agents, for various solid and metastatic tumors 1 2 DOX has been widely reported to induce dose-dependent, progressive, and potentially lethal myocardial damage. A large-scale study involving 4,018 patients reported an overall incidence of DOX-induced congestive heart failure of 2.2% 3 4 2 2 2 5 While Lip-DOX is designed to reduce drug exposure in normal tissues, the fundamental mechanism of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) remains dose-dependent. Therefore, a comparative investigation into the specific characteristics of cardiotoxicity induced by conventional doxorubicin (Con-DOX) and Lip-DOX is warranted to more effectively guide the rational clinical application of these chemotherapeutic agents. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) offers a unique resource for investigating these associations at scale, enabling a comprehensive analysis of real-world, post-marketing drug safety data 6 7 Although previous studies have indicated that DOX may induce cardiotoxicity, systematic analyses focusing on the interactions between DOX and cardiotoxicity-related genes remain scarce. Furthermore, numerous studies have investigated the mechanisms of DIC. Kong et al. reviewed the mechanisms of DIC, focusing on free radical generation and related cell death pathways 8 2 3 9 In the present study, we leveraged the FAERS database to identify and compare cardiotoxicity events associated with Con-DOX and Lip-DOX formulations. Building on this pharmacovigilance analysis, we utilized network pharmacology to further explore the potential multifactorial mechanisms of DIC. This integrated approach was used to identify key molecular targets and mechanisms. Ultimately, our findings provide critical safety evidence to guide the clinical use of DOX, enhance the understanding of its cardiotoxic mechanisms, and improve medication safety for cancer patients. Results Descriptive analysis A total of 56,321,150 adverse event (AE) reports were collected from the FAERS database from the first quarter of 2004 to the first quarter of 2025. From this dataset, 100,936 AE reports identified DOX as the primary suspected (PS) drug, involving 32,960 patients. These reports originated from six continents (excluding Antarctica), with the majority Submitted from North America, Europe, and Asia. Females accounted for a higher proportion of patients than Males. Regarding age distribution, the Majority of patients were aged 45 to 64 years, while those aged 65 years and older accounted for 20% of reports. Physicians submitted the highest number of reports (41.35%), whereas the proportion submitted by consumers was relatively low (5.16%). Geographically, the most reports were submitted from the U.S. The detailed characteristics of all reports are shown in Supplementary Table S1 To specifically investigate the cardiotoxicity of the two DOX formulations, we extracted reports from the U.S. to ensure consistent and complete reporting information. This approach facilitated accurate drug identification and minimized potential bias. This analysis included 10,695 AE reports involving 4,186 patients treated with Con-DOX and 13,164 AE reports involving 3,941 patients treated with Lip-DOX. The detailed characteristics of these patients are shown in Table 1 Table 1 Demographic and reporting characteristics of Con-DOX and Lip-DOX AE reports in FAERS.

Using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) method, we identified 1,272 positive signals covering 26 System Organ Classes (SOCs) after excluding the ‘Social circumstances’ SOC. Preferred Terms (PTs) with positive signals were ranked by ROR value.

We conducted chi-square tests to explore the association between gender and the reporting of cardiac disorders. The analysis compared the proportion of male and female patients with cardiac disorder AEs to the gender distribution in all other AE reports for each drug.

First, potential DOX-binding targets were predicted using online servers: 298 targets were obtained from PharmMapper, 113 from SuperPred, and 22 from SwissTarget Prediction. After removing duplicates, 418 unique targets were identified as DOX-associated targets. Next, cardiotoxicity-related targets were sourced from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and the GeneCards database, yielding 879 and 481 targets, respectively. After merging these results and removing duplicate entries, 1,197 unique targets were designated as cardiotoxicity-associated targets. Finally, the DOX-associated targets and the cardiotoxicity-associated targets were compared to identify common elements. A Venn diagram analysis revealed 113 common targets at the intersection of these two sets (Fig. 2 2 Fig. 2 Identification of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) targets and doxorubicin-targets-cardiotoxicity network construction: ( A B PPI network construction The 113 overlapping targets were imported into the STRING database to construct a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, which was then analyzed and visualized using Cytoscape software ( version 3.6 3 3 Fig. 3 PPI Network Construction: ( A B Enrichment analysis and DOX-Targets-Cardiotoxicity-Pathway network construction Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed on the 113 common targets using the Metascape database. The top 10 significantly enriched terms of GO-BP, GO-CC, and GO-MF and the top 20 KEGG (all with p Biological Process (BP) terms were primarily enriched in cellular response to hormone stimulus, cellular response to lipid, response to xenobiotic stimulus, positive regulation of cell migration, regulation of establishment of protein localization, response to molecule of bacterial origin, and response to oxidative stress. Cellular Component (CC) terms were significantly associated with the receptor complex, ficolin-1-rich granule lumen, membrane raft, transcription regulator complex, protein kinase complex, and glutamatergic synapse. Molecular Function (MF) terms were predominantly enriched for kinase binding, kinase activity, nuclear receptor activity, protein domain-specific binding, carboxylic acid binding, and kinase regulator activity (Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Enrichment analysis and doxorubicin-target-cardiotoxicity-pathway network construction: ( A B C The top 20 significantly enriched KEGG pathways are displayed in Fig. 4 Finally, an integrated DOX-targets-cardiotoxicity-pathway network was constructed and visualized using Cytoscape to illustrate the complex interactions between the drug, its targets, the disease, and the involved pathways (Fig. 4 Discussion DOX remains a core chemotherapeutic agent in oncology nearly 50 years after its introduction, though its clinical use is limited by significant cardiotoxicity. To enhance therapeutic efficacy and reduce toxicity, researchers have developed liposomal encapsulation strategies for DOX—an approach that has achieved significant success. Our research showed that compared with Con-DOX, Lip-DOX had fewer PT signals and lower ROR values for cardiotoxicity. This finding is consistent with numerous previous studies, including real-world analyses 7 10 11 12 13 P 14 15 16 5 The descriptive analysis of DIC reveals important epidemiological characteristics. Age-related factors should not be overlooked.The role of age in DIC remains controversial. Some studies suggest that the risk of cardiotoxicity increases with patient age 17 18 19 20 21 10 22 23 19 24 25 Building on the clinical observations of DIC, our network pharmacology analysis dissected its molecular underpinnings by identifying core targets and their interactive signaling pathways. We integrated data from the CTD, GeneCards, PharmMapper, SwissTargetPrediction, and SuperPred databases to systematically identify 113 potential targets associated with DIC. Using the STRING platform and Cytoscape software, we constructed a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network and identified 10 core targets—TP53, EGFR, AKT1, SRC, HSP90AA1, STAT3, ESR1, HSP90AB1, NFKB1, and ERBB2—that play critical roles in DIC. Existing literature supports the central role of these targets. Regarding TP53, McSweeney et al. found that the p53 protein is a key regulator of DOX-induced transcriptome changes that upregulate death receptors and activate the extrinsic apoptosis pathway 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 The classic mechanisms of DIC are mainly oxidative stress and inflammation. For oxidative stress, DIC is strongly associated with oxidative stress, primarily mediated through several key pathways. The Nrf2/Keap1/ARE pathway is a central regulator: under normal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered by Keap1 and degraded, but DOX disrupts this interaction, impairing the activation of antioxidant genes (e.g., SOD, HO-1) by inhibiting Nrf2 and upregulating Keap1 39 40 41 42 2 43 44 45 46 47 In our KEGG enrichment analysis, we focused primarily on the HIF-1 signaling pathway. The HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) signaling pathway plays a key role in cellular responses to hypoxic environments and is widely involved in physiological and pathological processes such as angiogenesis, energy metabolism, cell survival, and apoptosis 36 48 36 49 49 50 50 36 36 37 The limitations of this study should be interpreted within the context of pharmacovigilance methodologies. First, reliance on the FAERS database inherently introduces biases, including widespread underreporting of adverse events (particularly for mild/moderate cases), indication bias (e.g., preferential use of Lip-DOX in patients with pre-existing cardiac risk factors), geographical reporting disparities, differences in concomitant medications, and variations in reporters’ professional backgrounds. Therefore, when analyzing cardiotoxicity across DOX formulations, we restricted patient regions to mitigate geographical bias; however, this approach cannot resolve fundamental limitations like underreporting or indication bias. Second, although ROR provides valuable signal detection capabilities, its performance is sensitive to low reporting counts and arbitrary threshold selection, which may lead to the exaggeration of false-positive signals for rare events or drugs with limited exposure 51 Conclusion Through disproportionality analysis of data from the FAERS, we found that in terms of both signal frequency and intensity, DIC is a severe adverse reaction that should not be overlooked in clinical practice. Both formulations pose a risk of causing cardiac disorders; however, Lip-DOX is associated with fewer cardiac adverse event signals. Notably, there was no significant difference between the two formulations in terms of the incidence of serious adverse events or mortality rates attributable to cardiotoxicity. In addition, our gender-based analysis of DIC revealed that females have a higher risk of developing DIC compared to Males. Through network pharmacology, we identified 10 core targets and several key signaling pathways closely associated with DIC, especially the HIF-1 signaling pathway, and revealed the multi-target, multi-pathway synergistic regulatory mechanism underlying DIC. These study findings provide valuable insights and references for drug safety monitoring and clinical medication safety. The discovery of new pathways offers novel ideas for reducing the toxicity of DOX and conducting research on related drugs. However, due to the inherent limitations of this study, our conclusions require further validation through prospective investigations. Materials and methods Data source and processing This study utilized data from the FAERS database ( https://fis.fda.gov/extensions/FPD-QDE-FAERS/FPD-QDE-FAERS.html S1 Adverse event and drug identification Cardiotoxicity-related adverse events were identified using the following Standardized MedDRA Queries (SMQ): Cardiomyopathy (SMQ code: 20,000,150), Cardiac failure (SMQ code: 20,000,004), Shock-associated circulatory or cardiac conditions (excluding torsade de pointes/QT prolongation) (SMQ code: 20,000,067), Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SMQ code: 20,000,057), Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (SMQ code: 20,000,047), Other ischaemic heart disease (SMQ code: 20,000,168), Cardiac arrhythmia terms, nonspecific (SMQ code: 20,000,162), Ventricular tachyarrhythmias (SMQ code: 20,000,058), Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SMQ code: 20,000,059), Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation (SMQ code: 20,000,001), Torsade de pointes, shock-associated conditions (SMQ code: 20,000,068), Noninfectious myocarditis/pericarditis (SMQ code: 20,000,239), Arrhythmia-related investigations, signs and symptoms (SMQ code: 20,000,051). DOX is commercially available in two main formulations: Con-DOX and Lip-DOX. However, as FAERS is a spontaneous reporting system (SRS), data quality varies by country. Many reports lack the critical information (e.g., generic drug name, formulation type) required to accurately distinguish between Con-DOX and Lip-DOX. Analyzing all DOX-related reports without reliable formulation classification would introduce significant misclassification bias. Therefore, to ensure accurate formulation identification, the analysis was restricted to reports where the reporter country was the United States. Reports were first categorized as Con-DOX or Lip-DOX based on the generic name and formulation type fields. For reports where this information was missing, the formulation was determined by cross-referencing the reported manufacturer name with official FDA drug labeling databases. Signal detection and data analysis This study utilized disproportionality analysis, a standard pharmacovigilance approach for detecting potential associations between drugs and AEs. ROR was used to quantify the relative reporting frequency of a specific AE for the target drug compared to all other drugs in the database. Signal thresholds were defined as follows: ROR signals required both a lower 95% confidence interval (CI) > 1.0 and at least 3 case reports 51 version 9.4 S2 Identification of common targets for DOX and cardiotoxicity First, to identify potential molecular targets of DOX, its Canonical SMILES notation was obtained from the PubChem database ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ http://www.swisstargetprediction.ch/ http://prediction.charite.de/ http://lilab.ecust.edu.cn/ https://ctdbase.org/ https://www.genecards.org/ https://jvenn.toulouse.inrae.fr 52 54 Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network construction The common targets were imported into the STRING database ( https://cn.string-db.org 55 Functional and pathway enrichment analysis The common targets were imported into the Metascape platform ( https://metascape.org/gp/ 56 57 p https://www.bioinformatics.com.cn 58 59 Supplementary Information  Supplementary Information 1.
