In this study, we combine experimental nanoprecipitation and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to optimize PLGA nanoparticle formulation using both traditional batch and microfluidic methods. While Design of Experiments (DoE) was used to optimize the batch process, microfluidic mixing was systematically explored by varying flow parameters such as the flow rate ratio (FRR) and total flow rate (TFR). We compared two microfluidic mixer designs with Y-junction and three-inlet junction geometries to evaluate their impact on the mixing efficiency and nanoparticle formation. Experimental results revealed that the three-inlet design produced smaller, more uniform nanoparticles with superior post-lyophilization stability. CFD simulations confirmed these findings by displaying velocity fields and PLGA concentration gradients, demonstrating significantly more homogeneous mixing and efficient interfacial contact in the three-inlet configuration. Furthermore, simulated outlet concentrations were used to predict the nanoparticle size via theoretical modeling, which closely agreed with the experimental data. This integrated approach highlights the importance of microfluidic geometry in controlling nanoparticle nucleation dynamics and provides a framework for rational design of scalable nanomedicine production systems.

Introduction Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) have been increasingly recognized as transformative tools in drug delivery. Their ability to enhance drug bioavailability, protect labile compounds from degradation, and minimize systemic toxicity through targeted delivery has positioned them at the forefront of personalized medicine [ 1 2 3 Polymeric NPs based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particularly stand out due to the biocompatibility, tunable degradation times, and regulatory approval of PLGA for clinical use [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 PLGA NPs can be prepared in a variety of ways, including emulsion, nanoprecipitation, spray drying, and solvent diffusion [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 13 16 17 In parallel, the advent of microfluidics has introduced a promising alternative for the controlled formation of nanoparticles [ 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 19 25 26 27 In this study, we present two complementary strategies for PLGA nanoparticle formulation via nanoprecipitation: a traditional batch method guided by Design of Experiments (DoE) and a microfluidic system designed for precise control over mixing parameters. We also included a systematic comparison of two microfluidic mixer geometries, Y-junction and three-inlet junction, to investigate the role of inlet design on the mixing efficiency and nanoparticle formation. To deepen our understanding of the underlying flow dynamics, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were made to visualize velocity fields and concentration profiles within each mixer. By integrating experimental optimization with numerical modeling, we aim to provide a robust framework for selecting and designing nanoparticle manufacturing platforms depending on the resource availability, throughput requirements, and formulation goals, and thus propose standardized conditions for the reproducible production of PLGA-based nanoparticles suitable for drug delivery applications. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials PLGA (Resomer RG 502 H), Mw 7000–17,000 Da, was obtained from Evonik GmbH (Darmstadt, Germany). Acetonitrile (ACN, 99.95%) was purchased from VWR International (Radnor, PA, USA). Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA, 9000–10,000 Mw, 80%, hydrolyzed) was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). 2.2. Batch Preparation of PLGA Nanoparticles with DoE For the batch preparation of PLGA NPs, an organic phase comprising PLGA dissolved in ACN was added every three seconds dropwise to the aqueous phase containing PVA surfactant while continuously stirring at 660 rpm with a magnetic stirrer bar (3 mm × 10 mm) in a glass vial with a 17 mm outer diameter. After the complete evaporation of the organic solvent following overnight incubation, the NPs were washed twice by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min and lyophilized using a Kühner Alpha 2-4 LD freeze-drier (Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany). The design of experiments (DoE) tool Stavex was utilized to design the experiments with a focus on controlling the NP size and polydispersity index (PDI). The target values for the NP size and PDI were 200 nm and 0.1, respectively, selected based on commonly accepted criteria for enhanced circulation time, stability, and cellular uptake in drug delivery applications [ 19 w v w v 2.2.1. Hydrodynamic and Statistical Analysis To characterize the mixing regime and interpret particle formation trends, we performed dimensionless number analysis and regression modeling using data from three experimental iterations of batch nanoprecipitation. Hydrodynamic Characterization Mixing during nanoprecipitation was conducted in 5 mL cylindrical glass vials (outer diameter ≈ 17 mm) using a 10 mm × 3 mm PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar at 660 rpm. Based on this setup, the Reynolds number ( Re Re i 28 (1) R e i = N i D i 2 ρ μ 3 −3 D i N i The Damköhler number ( Da t mix t react t mix N i t react Regression Modelling of Formulation Variables Each of three iterations consisted of eight batch formulations prepared using varying ratios of PLGA, PVA, and solvent volumes. For each run, the following derived variables were computed: PLGA/ACN (mg/μL): PLGA concentration in organic phase % PVA: w/v Aq/Org ( v v Multiple linear regression was performed independently for each iteration using PLGA/ACN ratio, %PVA, and aqueous/organic volume ratio as predictors of particle size and polydispersity index (PDI). Models were fitted using ordinary least squares (OLS) in Python (statsmodels v0.14.0). p 2.3. Preparation of PLGA Nanoparticles Using Microfluidic Mixing A commercial microfluidic platform (Tamara, Inside Therapeutics) supplied with microfluidic chips featuring herringbone and baffle mixers were used for the preparation and optimization of PLGA NPs. In this study, the herringbone configuration was selected due to its ability to generate chaotic advection and micro-vortices within the channel, significantly enhancing mixing efficiency. This configuration incorporates a three-inlet junction, in which the organic phase flows through the central channel and is flanked by two aqueous streams, allowing for focused and rapid mixing. In parallel, a custom-built microfluidic system utilizing two syringe pumps connected to a commercial mixing chip (Fluidic 1460, Microfluidic ChipShop, Jena, Germany) was tested to prepare PLGA NPs. While the custom-made setup also utilized a microfluidic chip with herringbone configuration, the mixing of organic and aqueous phases took place through a Y-junction. The microchannel dimensions in both setups were very similar: 300 µm × 600 µm, with a herringbone groove depth of approximately 100 µm. For the preparation of PLGA NPs using microfluidics, a 1% PVA aqueous solution was filtered through a 0.45 µm membrane. The organic phase was prepared by dissolving 10 mg of PLGA in 1 mL of acetonitrile (ACN). For the optimization of NP size and PDI, different aqueous-to-organic flow rate ratios (FRRs) and total flow rates (TFRs) were tested. While the FRRs were varied between 2:1–6:1, the tested TFR range was 2.5–15 mL/min. Following mixing, the product streams were collected in individual glass vials containing magnetic stir bars and placed on a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm overnight to evaporate residual ACN. The following day, the nanoparticle suspensions were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 15,000 rpm. The resulting supernatants were discarded, and the pellets were redispersed in 1 mL of Milli-Q water (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and sonicated in a bath sonicator to ensure complete dispersion. This washing step was repeated three times. Finally, the NPs were reconstituted in 1 mL of Milli-Q water and lyophilized at −80 °C for 24 h using a Kühner Alpha 2-4 LD freeze-dryer (Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Osterode am Harz, Germany). 2.4. Colloidal Characterization of PLGA Nanoparticles 2.4.1. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) The hydrodynamic diameter and polydispersity index (PDI) of the nanoparticles were determined using dynamic light scattering (DLS) on a Malvern Zetasizer ZS Nano instrument (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK). Measurements were performed at a NP concentration of 0.01 mg/mL, with samples prepared in MQ water and placed in disposable cuvettes. The mean and standard deviation of three measurements were used to report the NP size distribution and PDI. 2.4.2. Atomic Force Microscopy The morphological characterization of NPs was made using a multi-mode NanoScope atomic force microscope (AFM) (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). For sample preparation, 100 μL of 1 mg/mL particle suspension was dried on clean glass substrates, and particles were imaged in the peak-force tapping mode. Silicon nitride cantilevers with nominal spring constants of 0.4 N/m (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) were used for imaging at 1 Hz scan rate. 256 lines with 256 points per line were recorded during image acquisition. AFM images were analyzed using the NanoScope analysis software v3.0 (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA). The entire schematic for the microfluidics-based preparation and characterization of PLGA NPs is illustrated in Figure 1 2.5. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Analyses CFD simulations were performed to predict the mean diameter of PLGA nanoparticles produced by both the three-inlet-junction and Y-junction mixing geometries. Figure 2 The fluid motion in both mixers is governed by the full Navier–Stokes equations coupled with mass conservation [ 29 (2) ρ D u D t = − ∇ p + ∇ · 2 μ S (3) D ρ D t + ρ ∇ · u = 0 D D t = ∂ ∂ t + u · ∇ ρ u p μ S S = 1 2 ∇ u + ∇ u T − 1 3 ∇ · u I To predict PLGA concentration fields (and ultimately nanoparticle size), the flow field u (4) ∂ c ∂ t + ∇ · − D ∇ c + u c = 0 c D 30 The laminar flow and species transport boundary conditions were specified as follows. At both the organic and aqueous inlets, a velocity inlet was imposed corresponding to 0.625 mL/min and 1.875 mL/min flow rates, respectively. The outlet boundary was set to 0 Pa gauge pressure, and all channel walls were treated as no-slip. For the Transport of Diluted Species interface, the organic inlet was held at a constant PLGA concentration of 0.83 mol/m 3 2.6. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism 5.1 program. Unpaired t-test was used to compare two groups, and ANOVA followed by Dunnett multiple comparison tests were used to compare more than two groups to determine the significance of the difference in the mean particle size ( p 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Batch Preparation of PLGA NPs Using DoE Batch nanoprecipitation remains one of the most accessible and widely used methods for the development of polymeric NPs due to its simplicity, low cost, and minimal equipment requirements [ 31 32 FX1 FX8 X Table 1 The first iteration explored a broad range of PLGA concentrations (5–15 mg), PVA concentrations (1.5–2.5%), and volume ratios. Particle sizes ranged from 132 nm ( F1.5 F1.6 (F1.1 F1.5 F1.4 F1.8 F1.5 F1.1 F1.4 F1.6 The second iteration round aimed to refine the formulation space based on promising conditions obtained from Iteration 1. Particle sizes spanned a wide range, but most formulations now yielded sizes between 134 nm ( F2.7 F2.1 F2.1 F2.3 F2.4 F2.5 In the final iteration, the PLGA concentration range was slightly narrowed (5–12 mg), while holding other parameters similar to previous iterations. The results highlighted the sensitivity of the system to organic loading, with F3.1 F3.2 F3.3–F3.6 F3.5 F3.6 The general trends for all three iterations suggest that higher PLGA concentrations (>10 mg per 100 µL ACN) led to excessive particle growth and poor uniformity, consistent with fast supersaturation and inadequate stabilization. On the other hand, higher PVA concentrations (2.5%) often yielded lower PDI values, reflecting better surface stabilization during nucleation. A comparison of formulation compositions shows that F1.1 F2.8 F3.6 To better understand the role of formulation parameters and mixing dynamics on nanoparticle characteristics in the batch method, we conducted hydrodynamic and statistical analyses of the results obtained in three DoE iterations. Based on the dimensions of stir bar (10 mm × 3 mm), and a stirring speed of 660 rpm, we first estimated the Reynolds number ( Re Re i Da Da The subsequent regression analysis reveals that the PLGA/ACN ratio (mg/µL) was consistently the most influential predictor of both particle size ( Table 2 Table 3 Table 3 p p p p Table 2 Table 3 p Table 2 2 2 2 Table 2 Table 3 These results highlight the dominant role of the polymer concentration at the phase boundary in controlling the nanoprecipitation outcomes, suggesting that local supersaturation dynamics, rather than the bulk stabilizer content, is the primary influencer in particle size and uniformity in batch-stirred systems. Across the three DoE iterations, a progressive improvement in the model performance was observed, particularly for particle size prediction. This trend reflects refinement in the experimental design; as such, Iteration 1 likely explored a broader and more variable parameter space, capturing both optimal and suboptimal conditions. In contrast, Iterations 2 and 3 appear to have focused on a narrower, more effective range of formulation parameters. As a result, the predictive power of the models improved, especially in Iteration 3, where both the particle size and PDI were strongly correlated with the PLGA/ACN ratio ( Figure 3 Overall, the DoE method allows for efficient evaluation of multiple variables, including the PLGA concentration, PVA content, and organic-to-aqueous phase ratio, while minimizing the number of experimental runs. This strategy not only provides statistical insight into the relationships between formulation parameters and NP properties but also enables the development of an optimized batch protocol that approaches the precision typically achieved with microfluidic systems. 3.2. Microfluidic Preparation of PLGA NPs The microfluidic-based preparation of PLGA nanoparticles via nanoprecipitation is based on the same principles as the batch method [ 33 34 35 36 37 38 27 The compositions of the organic and aqueous phases were fixed at 10 mg/mL of PLGA in ACN and 1% PVA, respectively, while the FRR and TFR were systematically varied. Initially, the TFR was held constant at 5 mL/min, and FRRs of 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, and 6:1 (aqueous:organic) were evaluated. As shown in Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 The lyophilization process itself contributes to an increase in the particle size and PDI due to nanoparticle aggregation and heterogeneous redispersion upon rehydration [ 39 40 FRR, defined as the ratio of aqueous to organic flow rates, plays a crucial role in nanoprecipitation. As the FRR increases, the organic phase is diluted more rapidly, accelerating polymer precipitation and nucleation, which can initially favor monodisperse particle formation [ 41 42 The total flow rate (TFR), defined as the sum of the aqueous and organic flow rates, is a critical parameter influencing the PLGA nanoparticle size, size distribution, and production efficiency in microfluidic systems [ 43 44 45 Figure 5 15 42 Figure 5 46 47 48 Overall, the formulation prepared at FRR of 3:1 and TFR of 2.5 mL/min exhibited the smallest size and most uniform size distribution. It should be noted that we used DLS as the primary technique for rapid measurement of nanoparticle populations in their native dispersed state; however, this method has well-recognized limitations [ 49 49 Figure 5 Figure S1 The Impact of Mixer Inlet Geometry on the Colloidal Properties of PLGA NPs To evaluate the effect of mixer inlet geometry on the colloidal properties of PLGA NPs, we compared particles formulated using a three-inlet junction mixer with those produced using a Y-junction mixer. Both setups used the same formulation parameters (10 mg/mL of PLGA in ACN with 1% PVA) and identical flow conditions (FRR 3:1, TFR 2.5 mL/min). As shown in Table 4 These differences can be attributed to the influence of the inlet geometry on the mixing dynamics. To better understand these effects, we performed simulations for both mixers under the optimal operating conditions (flow rate ratio [FRR] = 3:1 and total flow rate [TFR] = 2.5 mL/min), while imposing atmospheric pressure condition at the outlet. The mesh characteristics used for both geometries are summarized in Table 5 To estimate the mean diameter of PLGA nanoparticles from the outlet concentration obtained in our CFD simulations, it is necessary to combine the molar concentration with the particle number concentration under the assumption of monodisperse, spherical particles [ 50 c m k g m 3 N  p a r t i c l e s / m 3 (5) V p = c m N ρ p ρ p  k g m 3 (6) V p = π 6 d 3 Combining these two above expressions gives the following working formula [ 50 (7) d = 6 π c m N ρ p 1 / 3 In applying Equation (7), we set a baseline particle number concentration of N ≈ 7 × 10 17  p a r t i c l e s / m 3 Supplementary Information Table 6 A mesh-independence study was conducted by refining the discretization to approximately 6 million elements for the three-inlet junction mixer and 20 million elements for the Y-junction system. Despite this substantial increase in the mesh resolution, the predicted outlet molar concentration—and hence the computed mean nanoparticle diameter remained essentially unchanged (the difference was less than 2%). These results confirm that the original mesh densities were sufficient, and the solution is mesh-independent. To further investigate these effects, the velocity distributions and PLGA concentration contours in both devices were obtained using CFD simulations. Figure 6 In Figure 6 Figure 6 Furthermore, velocity profiles at six geometrically different (yz) sections throughout the channel (x = 1, 3, 6, 14, 24, and 30 mm) shown in Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 6 Figure 7 3 Figure 7 Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 8 Figure 9 Figure 8 At the central plane (z = 0.1 mm) in Figure 9 3 Figure 9 Figure 9 To summarize, the three-inlet junction provides more symmetrical and efficient mixing, enhancing interfacial contact between the aqueous and organic phases, which promotes rapid and uniform nanoprecipitation, resulting in smaller and more stable nanoparticles. In contrast, the Y-junction geometry might result in less efficient mixing and uneven flow convergence, leading to broader particle size distributions and reduced structural stability after lyophilization. While our results highlight a significant difference between the Y-junction and three-inlet junction systems, we note that this comparison also involves secondary variations in channel length and spacing. Thus, the performance differences cannot be attributed solely to the number of inlets but to the overall inlet design and associated flow geometry. Future studies should control these parameters more rigorously to isolate the effect of inlet number. These findings highlight the critical role of microfluidic design in achieving clinically desirable nanoparticle features. 4. Conclusions This study employs systematic experimentation and advanced computational modeling to optimize PLGA nanoparticle formulation through both batch and microfluidic nanoprecipitation methods. Design of Experiments (DoE) guided the identification of key formulation parameters in the batch process, while microfluidic preparation enabled precise control over mixing conditions, leading to smaller and more uniform nanoparticles. A detailed comparison between two microfluidic mixer geometries, namely Y-junction and three-inlet junction mixers, revealed that the inlet design significantly affects colloidal outcomes, particularly following lyophilization. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations offered critical insights into these differences, proving how symmetrical flow fields and enhanced mixing in the three-inlet system led to superior concentration homogenization and controlled nanoparticle formation. Due to the agreement of simulated outlet concentrations with experimentally ones, the computational model validated its predictive capacity. Overall, our study highlights the importance of combining experimental optimization with fluid dynamics simulations to offer valuable guidelines for microfluidic device design and nanoparticle engineering. The findings establish a scalable and reproducible framework for producing clinically relevant PLGA nanoparticles using both batch and microfluidic nanoprecipitation approaches.
