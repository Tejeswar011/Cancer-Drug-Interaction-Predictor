Our prior research has revealed that polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs), these specialized dormant cells, are capable of triggering cancer recurrence and widespread metastasis. Once awakening, these PGCCs give rise to daughter cells (DCs) through asymmetric division, which has been hypothesized as the primary driver of tumor recurrence and metastasis. Nevertheless, the precise role of DCs in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains elusive. In this study, we have elucidated the characteristics of PGCCs and DCs in HNSCC. Furthermore, we have confirmed that the anoikis-resistance of DCs serves as a crucial mechanism for HNSCC recurrence and metastasis following treatment. Utilizing RNA-seq, we discovered that ITGB6 is upregulated in DCs. Additionally, through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrated that ITGB6 promotes HNSCC metastasis by activating the FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby inhibiting anoikis in DCs. Taken together, these findings suggest a potential therapeutic approach targeting DCs in HNSCC.

We confirmed the role of ITGB6 playing in anoikis-resistance by In vitro and in vivo experiments. In addition, we determine the downstream molecular mechanisms of ITGB6 using a series of molecular experiments. Together, our findings suggest that ITGB6 enhances DCs resistance to anoikis and promotes HNSCC metastasis. Result The formation of PGCC and DCs in HNSCC To examine the role of PGCCs and DCs on HNSCC progression, we calculated the number of PGCCs in tissues of patients with HNSCC based on morphological features (Fig. 1 1 1 p Fig. 1 Morphologic characteristics, and function analysis of PGCCs and DCs. ( A B C p D E F G H I Similar with previous reports, we induced PGCCs formation from normal cancer cells by paclitaxel (PTX). When Fadu cells were exposed to the drug (5–50 μg/ml), cell death increased with paclitaxel concentration, and almost all the cells were killed when the concentration up to 50 μg/ml (Fig. 1 1 1 1 Consistent with prior reports, both PGCCs and DCs exhibit distinct morphological characteristics. PGCCs possess a vast cytoplasmic region and either a solitary giant nucleus or multiple nuclei, and the diameter of PGCCs measures about 170 μm (Fig. 1 1 To delve deeper into the biological behavior of DCs, we selected C666-1, another nasopharyngeal cell line, and induced the formation of DCs using the established protocol according to the methods established by our team before 8 1 8 DC cells are capable of resisting anoikis and achieving metastasis To assess the anoikis-resistance capacity of DCs, we plated normal cells, PGCCs, and DCs on poly-HEMA coated plates for 48 h and subsequently conducted a colony formation experiment. Notably, DCs formed significantly more colonies compared to normal cells (Fig. 2 2 2 2 Fig. 2 DC cells can resist anoikis and metastasize. ( A B p , *** p C F E F G H p I J p p K L p 1, *** p We then injected the same number of normal cells and DCs into nude mice via tail vein injection, and monitored distant metastasis by measuring the resulting bioluminescence. We found that the formation of DCs significantly enhance the metastatic ability of cancer (Fig. 2 The overexpression of ITGB6 in DCs contributes to the poor prognosis of HNSCC The cancer progression and distant metastasis‐promoting role of DCs has been known extensively, but the mechanism has not been elucidated yet. Therefore, we performed whole‐transcriptome sequencing of normal Fadu cells and DCs induced from Fadu cells. A total of 5437 genes with differential transcript expression were detected (Figure S2A, Fig. 3 3 26 28 3 Fig. 3 Clinical characteristics of ITGB6 in HNSCC. ( A B C D E F G H p , I p , J K J K Integrins, a significant class of transmembrane proteins, serve as critical conduits for transducing extracellular signals into intracellular responses 29 30 33 3 34 In order to elucidate the significance of ITGB6 in the progression of HNSCC, we analyzed its expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCCs) ( n n 3 To further validate this observation, we performed immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis on 46 HNSCC tissue specimens (Fig. 3 3 The high expression of ITGB6 was notably associated with poor tumor differentiation (Fig. 3 3 p 3 p ITGB6 promotes metastasis of HNSCC by inhibiting anoikis Based on the aforementioned results, we formulate a hypothesis that ITGB6 has the potential to facilitate metastasis of HNSCC. Then, we transfected Fadu cells and C666-1 cells with shITGB6 lentivirus or the vector virus, and then proceeded to subsequent experiments (Fig. 4 4 4 Fig. 4 ITGB6 promotes metastasis of HNSCC. ( A B C D E F H G I p p p To attempt to identify the function of ITGB6 in HNSCC, we tried to knockdown ITGB6 in HNSCC cells and induce it to be PGCCs and DCs. However, what is interesting, PTX killed cells quickly even in an extremely low concentration, and DCs dead quickly after knockdown ITGB6 (data not shown). Therefore, we speculate that ITBGB6 is critical for sustaining life and cellular homeostasis of PGCCs and DCs. ITGB6 enhances anoikis-resistance and metastasis of HNSCC via the FAK/ PI3K/AKT pathway FAK/PI3K/AKT pathwayplay a primary role in human growth and development, progression of benign and malignant diseases. Marie-Josée Demers et al. reported that the FAK/PI3K/AKT pathway can promote anoikis resistance of cancer. The role of integrins in activating FAK is well known. Our previous research confirmed that ITGB6 can promote nasopharyngeal metastasis via FAK pathway. We speculate that ITGB6 may inhibit anoikis in DCs by activating FAK/ PI3K/AKT pathway. Thus, we examined the phosphorylation level of FAK, PI3K and AKT. ITGB6 knockdown significantly inhibited the activity of FAK, PI3K and AKT (Fig. 5 5 5 5 Fig. 5 ITGB6 enhances anoikis-resistance and metastasis of HNSCC via the FAK/ PI3K/AKT pathway ( A B C D E F H G J p p p Discussion The enduring struggle between humans and malignant tumors has been ongoing for a long time. With continuous research on malignant tumors, scientists have made remarkable progress in understanding their genesis and progression 35 2 4 16 36 39 8 40 41 8 Anoikis, a specialized type of apoptosis, serves as a potential obstacle to cancer cell metastasis. It occurs when individual cells detach from their original microenvironment, triggering apoptosis 42 45 45 46 The ability for cancer cells to evade the immune system is critical at every stage of cancer progression. Thus, the capability of immune tolerance or immune escape is essential for DCs to maintain efficient metastasis. However, we did not find common immune-related protein expression abnormalities, such as PD-L1. An interesting finding is that the expression of PD-L2 was markedly up-regulated in DCs, which regulate immune system bidirectionally. Due to the technical limitations, we cannot construct a HNSCC model in mice with fully functional immune systems. DCs may have a unique mechanism of immune tolerance or immune escape. And our future studies will continue to explore this direction. Currently, the efficacy of treatments in patients with HNSCC remain deplorable. Our` data offer a significant advancement in understanding the mechanism of DCs in induced metastasis. Therefore, our finding provides a novel prognostic indicator for patients with HNSCC and pave the way for innovative therapeutic approaches. Materials and methods Human HNSCC specimens Based on the approval granted by the ethics committee of the Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University (approval number 2023-L131), 46 tumor tissues were surgically obtained from consenting patients in accordance with established operative guidelines. Prior to biopsy, all patients provided informed consent and refrained from any cancer treatments. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study. For participants who are minors or lack the capacity to provide consent, informed consent was obtained from their legal guardians. All procedures involving human participants were conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (HE) was conducted to assess the quantity of PGCCs, a specific cellular component of interest. For the survival analysis of ITGB6 in HNSCC using data from the HPA database ( https://www.proteinatlas.org/ Cell culture The FaDu cells were cultured in DMEM High Glucose medium containing 10% FBS, and the C666-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS. Cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. FaDu cells and C666-1 cells were purchased from Shanghai Guandao Bioengineering Co., Ltd., and underwent DNA verification. Transfection with lentiviral vectors Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 10^4 cells/well. 24 h prior to transfection, ensuring ~ 30–40% confluence at the time of virus addition. Lentiviruses were added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 with 8 μg/mL Polybrene to enhance transduction efficiency. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium. At 48 h post-transfection, puromycin selection was initiated at a pre-determined optimal concentration 2 μg/mL, determined by a kill curve assay in untransfected cells. Selection was maintained for 48 h to eliminate untransfected cells. The efficiency of ITGB6 knockdown was verified by western blot. Plasmids, lentiviral vectors, and their corresponding negative controls were constructed and produced by GeneChem (Shanghai, China). The sequence of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) is as follows: shITGB6: gcCTCCAAACATTCCCATGAT. Flow cytometry experiment Determination of DNA ploidy and cell cycle phase distribution of HNSCC-PGCC and HNSCC-DC by flow cytometry analysis. Cell pellets were obtained by digesting cells and washed with 1 × PBS. The cells were then fixed in 70% pre-cooled ethanol at 4 °C overnight; then centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded, and the cells were washed three times with 1 × PBS to remove ethanol. The cells were resuspended in 1 ml of propidium iodide (PI) staining solution containing RNase A and stained at room temperature for 15 min; finally, the cell DNA content was analyzed using a flow cytometer, and the results were analyzed using Flowjo software v10.8.1 ( https://www.flowjo.com/ Cell adhesion assay Cells were dissociated using trypsin without EDTA. The dissociated cells were then resuspended in a suitable medium to create a cell suspension with a concentration of 5 × 10 4 BALB/c nude mice models To assess the ability of tumor cells to metastasize to the lungs in vivo, cells were transfected with lentivirus. Next, 2 × 10 6 Anoikis quantitative assay The cells were digested with trypsin, counted, and seeded in ultra-low adsorption culture plates at 10 5 RNA sequencing GENEWIZ conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and bioinformatics analysis. Initially, total RNA was extracted from samples with utmost precision, followed by rigorous quality assessment and quantification to guarantee the integrity and purity of the RNA. Subsequently, next-generation sequencing libraries were constructed strictly according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA-seq was then performed on an Illumina HiSeq platform, adhering strictly to the manufacturer’s instructions. The resulting clean data were processed using Hisat2 (v2.0.1, https://daehwankimlab.github.io/hisat2/ https://htseq.readthedocs.io/en/release_0.11.1/ Immunoblotting Immunoblotting was conducted on whole-cell lysates to assess protein levels. The protein content was accurately measured using a BCA kit from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The protein samples were then resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated with specific antibodies overnight at 4 °C (indicated in the Table 1), after blocking with the blocking buffer for an hour. The original pictures are stored in Figure S4. Cell fluorescence staining Cells were plated in 15-mm glass-bottomed dishes at a concentration of 5 × 10 4 Quantification and statistical analysis The statistical analysis in this study was conducted using GraphPad Prism 6 software 6.01 ( https://www.graphpad.com/ p Supplementary Information Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
