The implementation of CRC screening has decreased CRC incidence in adults older than 65 years. However, among young adults who experience more aggressive disease progression, CRC incidence has been increasing for decades. Immunotherapy represents a collection of innovative and promising approaches with greater efficacy and safety. In this review, we discuss modalities and selected targets of immunotherapies for CRCs that are guided by precision medicine. Areas covered: The following review focuses on immunological approaches for CRCs, including therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, immune checkpoint blockade, cancer vaccines, and adoptive cell therapies. Expert opinion: Metastatic and refractory CRCs are significant causes of cancer-related mortality and remain difficult to treat with current standard therapies. Following multiple FDA approvals for hematologic malignancies, research into solid tumor immunotherapies has substantially increased. Several chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cell therapies are showing promise in CRC. Moreover, immune checkpoint blocking antibodies are transforming care for a subset of CRC patients. With advances in our understanding of oncogenic mechanisms and development of novel treatment approaches, personalized immunotherapies are poised to dramatically change the landscape of CRC treatment.

Introduction Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and lethal cancers [ 1 2 1 2 2 3 The mainstay curative approach for local, early-stage CRC is surgery. However, the management of patients with advanced stage CRC is more complex and challenging [ 4 5 6 10 4 5 While traditional chemotherapeutics treat all patients the same way, precision medicine focuses on a particular trait of the patient, their tumor, or other factors. This mitigates off-target toxicity to normal tissues and/or improves anti-tumor activity. Precision medicine involves tailored methods for detection, prevention, and treatment, with the goal of improving patients’ outcomes. CRC immunotherapies have been extensively investigated in laboratories and clinic trials for decades. Although there are currently a limited number of FDA-approved CRC immunotherapies, incremental progress in our understanding of cancer biology and immunology has led to advances in developing innovative, more precise CRC immunotherapies. Antibodies were the first major immunological molecules to be explored for precision medicine because of their unique ability to bind specific targets and directly inhibit cancer growth or initiate immune-mediated antitumor activity. The first promising therapeutic monoclonal antibody for CRC, cetuximab, was first described in 1995 and became the first therapeutic monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA as a first-line therapy in 2004 [ 11 14 + In this review, we focus on immunological approaches for precision medicine in CRC. We discuss modalities of precision immunotherapy, including antibody-based targeted therapies, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), cancer vaccines, and adoptive cell therapies. We also discuss a variety of targets that are being actively investigated in clinical trials, including EGFR [ 15 17 18 21 22 24 25 27 28 30 31 32 2. Immunotherapy modalities 2.1. Antibody-based targeted therapy Traditional chemotherapy is associated with substantial systemic toxicity [ 33 35 36 37 38 39 42 43 46 Decades of mAb research and advancements in chemistry and gene engineering have allowed the production of mAb variations, such as immunotoxins (ITs) and bispecific antibodies. ITs are mAbs or fragments of mAbs that are chemically conjugated with potent toxins to deliver them precisely to tumor cells [ 47 49 50 51 52 54 52 55 56 Following the FDA approval of cetuximab for CRC in 2004, five therapeutic mAbs were approved over the next 20 years for CRC. Numerous targets and variations of antibody-based therapies are being studied in clinical trials and preclinical settings. We discuss prominent tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) used as targets to direct therapeutic mAbs, bispecific antibodies, and ITs for CRCs. 2.2. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) Immune checkpoint blocking (ICB) antibodies are mAbs, but rather than blocking tumorigenic signaling pathways or engaging ADCC, they disrupt adaptive immune evasion processes employed by immunogenic tumors [ 57 59 PD-1 and CTLA-4 are inhibitory receptors expressed on the surface of immune cells. PD-1 is a transmembrane protein expressed on activated innate and adaptive immune cells, including T cells, natural killer cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells [ 60 64 62 63 65 68 66 67 69 70 71 75 Pembrolizumab and nivolumab, two different anti-PD-1 mAbs, were approved by the FDA as first-line therapies in 2017 for patients with advanced or metastatic MSI or dMMR CRC. Clinical trials evaluating the antitumor activity of pembrolizumab for MSI CRC patients measured efficacy using objective response rate (ORR), the percentage of patients who achieved partial or complete response with treatment within a time span, as the primary endpoint. In two clinical trials, significant ORRs were achieved with the pembrolizumab treatment [ 76 77 78 high 79 80 high 81 CD47 is a transmembrane protein, and the interaction of its extracellular domain with SIRPα on macrophages induces ‘don’t eat me’ signaling [ 82 83 84 85 86 90 91 92 93 ICB disturbs one of the physiological mechanisms maintaining tolerance to self-antigens, which leads to toxicities [ 94 95 96 2.3. Cancer vaccines While immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) seeks to invigorate endogenous immune responses, cancer vaccines seek primarily to stimulate de novo 97 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 + + 106 107 108 + + 109 + + 110 de novo 111 112 Cancer vaccines can be prophylactic or therapeutic [ 113 114 97 114 115 116 117 118 122 2.3.1. Cancer cell vaccines Cancer cell vaccines are composed of whole cancer cells or cancer cell lysates [ 123 124 126 127 2.3.2. Antigen vaccines Antigen-targeted vaccines are designed to induce adaptive immune responses targeting the antigen(s) of interest. They may consist of peptides, polypeptides, or DNA or RNA - containing vectors or particles [ 98 100 113 114 2.3.3. Peptide and polypeptide vaccines Peptide and polypeptide vaccines are designed to contain epitopes that generate a robust immune response. Depending on their composition, peptide antigen vaccines are categorized as full-length or truncated. Full-length peptide vaccines contain the entire peptide sequence of the antigen, allowing for its entire sequence to be processed via the endocytic pathway [ 101 128 Table 1 129 133 2.3.4. Vector vaccines Viral and bacterial vectors have been a common approach to cancer vaccines. Typically, genes encoding antigens of interest are inserted into the vector genome. Administration of the recombinant vector results in antigen expression and delivery to APCs. Moreover, PAMPs and DAMPs from the vector provide innate immune activation leading to APC maturation and induction of robust adaptive immune responses to the vector and the tumor antigen. However, the vector immunogenicity is also a limitation. Preexisting or vaccine-induced immune responses to the vector can prevent tumor antigen gene delivery, expression, and immunity in vivo 134 135 136 Table 1 29 137 138 2.3.5. DNA vaccines DNA vaccines introduce DNA sequences encoding antigens. DNA vaccines must pass through the APC’s cell membrane, migrate to its nucleus, and ensure the initiation of transcription using the APC’s cellular machinery. After transcription and translation of the coding sequence, the antigens are processed via the endogenous pathway, which involves their degradation by cytosolic proteasomes, the transport of antigen fragments by TAP into the endoplasmic reticulum, and eventual presentation on MHC class I [ 139 140 Table 1 29 138 2.3.6. RNA vaccines RNA vaccines introduce mRNA sequences encoding tumor antigens. Like DNA vaccines, RNA vaccines are processed in APCs via the endogenous pathway [ 139 141 Table 1 142 2.4. Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) is an innovative and promising strategy to robustly target cancer cells for elimination. Specific ACTs include chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T-cell (CAR-T) and NK cell (CAR-NK) therapies, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and TCR-engineered T-cell (TCR-T) therapy ( Figure 1 143 148 2.4.1. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are tumor-infiltrating and tumor-reactive lymphocytes that are extracted from the tumor and its microenvironment [ 149 150 151 152 153 154 ® NCT02360579 155 TIL infiltration strongly correlates with disease progression and disease outcomes in CRC patients undergoing conventional therapies with surgery ± adjuvant chemotherapy. Although a clinical trial conducted between 1995 and 1998 in Italy showed no efficacy of IL-2 expanded TILs in 47 enrolled CRC patients [ 156 157 158 + 159 Table 2 2.4.2. T cell receptor-engineered T (TCR-T) cell therapy T cell receptor-engineered T (TCR-T) cell therapy utilizes genetically engineered autologous T cells expressing TCRs that recognize a tumor antigen peptide presented by MHC class I [ 160 161 162 ® ® 163 164 2.4.3. Chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy Chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy employs engineered autologous T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that recognize surface tumor antigens, independent of MHC [ 145 165 159 166 167 CAR-T therapy has revolutionized therapy for patients with certain end-stage hematologic malignancies following the first FDA approval in May 2018. Since then, there have been several approved CAR-T therapies directed against the surface antigens CD19 and BCMA. These approved CAR-T therapies are highly efficacious in controlling an array of B cell leukemias, B cell lymphomas, and multiple myeloma [ 144 147 168 169 170 171 172 2.4.4. Chimeric antigen receptor-natural killer cell (CAR-NK) therapy NK cells are a major subset of immune cells with cytotoxic capabilities and roles in antiviral and antitumor immunity via adaptive and innate immunity [ 173 172 177 178 NCT05213195 NCT02839954 NCT06358430 3. CRC immunotherapy targets 3.1. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) EGFR is a well-studied transmembrane glycoprotein overexpressed in 25–80% of CRC tumors [ 15 17 179 183 184 187 188 189 184 185 Cetuximab and panitumumab are anti-EGFR mAbs approved by the FDA in 2004 and 2006, respectively. Both bind the extracellular domain III of EGFR [ 190 192 193 194 196 11 13 14 197 198 199 201 12 191 202 EGFR-directed CAR-T therapy has been investigated in multiple phase I and II clinical trials for glioblastoma and non-small lung cancer. These trials have all demonstrated clinical safety, yet the efficacy and survival benefits of said therapeutics are thus far ambiguous [ 203 205 NCT03542799 NCT03152435 3.2. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and VEGFR-2 VEGF-A and its receptor VEGFR-2 are overexpressed in 90% and 80% of CRC patients, respectively [ 18 206 19 20 207 208 209 20 209 210 215 216 219 The anti-VEGF-A mAb bevacizumab was approved in 2004 for metastatic CRC as a first-line therapy 14 days after cetuximab. A phase III trial of 813 patients completed in 2004 comparing bevacizumab alone to a regimen of irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, and leucovorin showed significantly improved OS and PFS with the bevacizumab alone regimen [ 220 221 225 226 Ramucirumab is an anti-VEGFR-2 mAb that is approved for metastatic CRC patients as a second-line therapy in combination with 5-fluorouracil. A phase III trial concluded in 2015 showed improved OS and PFS by adding ramucirumab to FOLFIRI compared to adding a placebo to FOLFIRI [ 227 Aflibercept, a fusion protein of the extracellular domains of VEGFR-1/2 with the human IgG1 Fc domain, is another FDA-approved VEGF-targeted therapy for metastatic CRC [ 228 229 230 Cancer vaccines inducing immunologic responses to VEGFR for CRC patients have also been investigated in clinical trials [ 21 231 231 232 3.3. Guanylyl cyclase C (GUCY2C) GUCY2C is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed exclusively on the apical side of normal intestinal epithelium [ 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 241 234 242 243 134 243 245 243 246 254 NCT04111172 NCT05287165 NCT04171141 NCT05779917 Given that multiple studies have demonstrated that GUCY2C expression is retained in tumors [ 236 237 242 245 253 255 256 253 257 252 247 253 258 248 GUCY2C has also been explored as a target for bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) containing two antigen-recognizing domains: one against GUCY2C and one against CD3 [ 259 259 259 GUCY2C is an attractive target for cancer vaccines and CAR-T therapy as well. A phase I clinical trial in 10 early-stage CRC patients demonstrated the safety and immunogenicity of an adenovirus-based GUCY2C cancer vaccine [ 260 NCT04111172 23 244 261 3.4. HER2 HER2 is a receptor tyrosine kinase in the same family as EGFR [ 183 186 262 25 262 ® 26 27 263 264 265 266 HER2 is one of the first CAR-T therapy targets to be explored for metastatic CRC. This is in large part due to Herceptin’s efficacy and safety profile in other solid malignancies. However, the first clinical trial testing a HER2-directed CAR-T therapy employing the Herceptin-derived scFv was terminated after the death of a CRC patient due to respiratory distress induced by the infusion of CAR-T cells [ 267 268 269 3.5. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) CEA is a glycoprotein belonging to the family of carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecules (CEACAM) family. CEA was thought to be an oncofetal target expressed during embryonic development and overexpressed in cancers, including CRC, but it is now known to be expressed in the adult intestine as well [ 270 271 28 30 164 3.6. NKG2D ligands NKG2D is a type C lectin-like receptor that is expressed by NK cells, CD8 + + 31 32 32 Unlike most other CAR-T therapies in which the extracellular domain relies on scFvs derived from monoclonal antibodies to recognize antigens, NKG2D CAR-T cells are engineered to express NKG2D or NKG2D ectodomain fused to conventional CAR signaling domains to recognize NKG2D ligands on CRCs. A phase I clinical study of NKG2D CAR-T therapy for metastatic CRC concluded in 2019 and demonstrated no severe adverse events [ 31 NCT05213195 4. Conclusion Immunological therapeutics represent promising modalities for precision medicine for CRC. Therapeutic mAbs with anti-tumor efficacy were studied in the 1990s, and several have shown considerable success in improving patient outcomes, achieving FDA approval for CRC. More recently, FDA-approved ICBs have further improved CRC patient outcomes, though this is limited to only a small subset of CRC patients whose tumors have high neoantigen densities (MSI or dMMR). Although no cancer vaccines or adoptive cell therapies have obtained FDA approval yet, both modalities continue to attract attention for preclinical and clinical research. Cancer vaccines and adoptive cell therapies are highly personalized approaches that reprogram or engineer patients’ autologous T cells or other immune components to identify and destroy CRC cells. With a better basic scientific understanding and continuing preclinical development and clinical investigation of these highly complex and delicate immunotherapy modalities, there is great potential to significantly improve survival and quality of life for CRC patients. 5. Expert opinion CRC continues to be a substantial burden on public health. Regular colonoscopy screening in the adult population enables the identification of pre-cancerous lesions and early-stage cancers, which are often cured with surgery. However, metastatic CRC is challenging to manage, as demonstrated by the substantial difference in 5-year survival in patients with localized disease (90%) compared to those with distant metastasis (14%). Current therapies available for metastatic CRC patients include surgery, systemic cytotoxic chemotherapies, EGFR and VEGF blocking antibodies, and ICB. The latter three targeted therapies allow for more precise targeting of CRC cells. However, anti-EGFR and anti-VEGF therapeutics are restricted to patients with the target expression, and resistance often develops through 1) target downregulation, 2) downstream signaling pathway mutations that allow ligand-independent activation, and 3) alternative compensatory signaling pathway amplification. ICB benefits an even more selective MSI CRC patient population, and only tumors with checkpoint upregulation and high neoantigen burden are likely responsive to ICB. Immunotherapies, especially the FDA approved CD19 and BCMA targeted CAR-T therapies, have revolutionized the standard care and outcomes for patients with liquid malignancies. Although no cancer vaccines or adoptive cell therapies have shown sufficient safety and efficacy for CRC, there are ample reasons to be optimistic about the future of these immunological approaches. First, the FDA has approved three cancer vaccine or adoptive cell therapies for solid malignancies: the therapeutic cancer vaccine Sipuleucel-T for castration-resistant prostate cancer in 2010; the TCR-T therapy afamitresgene autoleucel for metastatic synovial sarcoma in 2024; and the TIL therapy lifileucel for metastatic melanoma in 2024. These approvals, especially the two in 2024, are encouraging with respect to the development of CRC immunotherapies. Second, for cancer vaccines, rapid advances in genomic manipulation allow for the production of more personalized therapeutics that target a combination of tumor antigens. These advances are also allowing us to develop a more refined understanding of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. This enables us to better select target antigens and adjuvants that will, in turn, improve therapeutic efficacy. Third, for adoptive cell therapies, a better understanding of barriers to their efficacy in solid malignancies, such as T-cell trafficking, T-cell persistence, and the immune tumor microenvironment, will allow for strategies to overcome those barriers and improve immunotherapy efficacy. Over the next 5 to 10 years, we expect that an improving understanding of cancer vaccines and adoptive cell therapies will allow for innovative approaches to overcome their challenges. The current known challenges on the tumor cell side remain largely unchanged: target identification, antigen escape, and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. In preclinical models and clinical trials, there are already innovative approaches being proposed to overcome these barriers. For example, CAR-T cell engineering to express cytokines to help with persistence and prevent exhaustion, novel adjuvants to improve immunogenicity of cancer vaccines, and new antigens currently under investigation. With the very first TILs being FDA-approved for melanoma in 2024, it can be reasonably speculated that TILs for CRCs with high mutation burdens may soon be used for CRC. Moreover, combination therapies of adoptive cell therapies or cancer vaccines with ICB may also be promising approaches to improve outcomes in CRC.

Article highlights The immunological approaches to precisely target CRC include therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, immune checkpoint blockade, cancer vaccines, and adoptive cell therapies. There are several FDA-approved immunological approaches for CRC. These include monoclonal antibodies directed toward EGFR and VEGF and its receptor and immune checkpoint blocking antibodies. Immune checkpoint blockade has demonstrated promising efficacy and safety profile in recent clinical trials for microsatellite instable CRC patients. Although no cancer vaccines or adaptive cell therapies are FDA approved for CRC, many are the subject of vigorous clinical studies. Notable targets include GUCY2C, HER2, CEA, and MUC-1. Adoptive cell therapies include TILs, TCR-T-cell therapy, CAR-T cell therapy, and CAR-NK cell therapy. These therapeutics represent the most active and promising class of therapies to target CRC with high precision and efficacy. ",
