However, the lengthy pharmaceutical approval process in Japan has contributed to what is known as “drug lag.” Although recent efforts to promote international multi‐regional clinical trials (MRCTs) involving Japan and to advance strategies for concurrent approval in Japan and the United States have helped shorten time to approval, the individual effects of these approaches have not been fully quantified. This study analyzed trends in the timing of drug application, review, and approval for anticancer agents approved in Japan and the United States, and evaluated the influence of MRCT participation, concurrent approval, company origin, cancer type, and regulatory programs through multivariate analysis. We examined 142 anticancer agents approved between October 2004 and March 2025 by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The median approval lag was 774 days (interquartile range: 217–1370), but decreased markedly to about 100 days by the 2020s. Approval lag was significantly shorter for drugs developed through MRCTs and those approved concurrently in both countries (both p p clinical trials oncology regulatory pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:02.10.2025  H.

Recent efforts such as promoting multi‐regional clinical trials and international synchronization strategies have been proposed to address this issue, but their individual impact has not been fully quantified. What question did this study address? ○ This study investigated annual trends in approval lag between Japan and the United States for anticancer drugs and quantitatively assessed the independent impact of multi‐regional clinical trial (MRCT) implementation and concurrent international approval. What does this study add to our knowledge? ○ This study quantitatively demonstrated that MRCT implementation and concurrent international approval contribute independently to reducing the approval lag for anticancer drugs between Japan and the United States. It adds novel insights by using recent data and applying multivariate analysis to isolate independent effects. How might this change clinical pharmacology or translational science? ○ Promoting early participation in MRCTs and synchronized international development strategies could facilitate earlier patient access to innovative therapies and strengthen global competitiveness in drug development. 1 Introduction The expeditious approval of novel anticancer pharmaceutical agents is crucial, as it directly correlates with the facilitation of prompt treatment opportunities for patients [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 In line with these developments, recent studies have explored long‐term trends and subgroup‐specific disparities in oncology drug lag. Maeda et al. [ 9 10 8 The recently introduced “international synchronization strategy”, which involves participation in international clinical trials from the early development stage and synchronizing submission timings between Japan and the United States, has been identified as a key approach for reducing drug lag [ 8 11 12 13 14 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Study Subjects and Data Collection The present study encompassed anticancer drugs approved in Japan (Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency [PMDA]) and the United States (Food and Drug Administration [FDA]) between October 2004 and March 2025. A total of 142 drugs were included, comprising drugs initially approved for the primary indication in both Japan and the US. Approval date information was collected from PMDA regulatory review reports, the FDA Drugs@FDA database, and other documents publicly available in each country. Subsequent approvals for expanded indications or new formulations were excluded. Each drug was confirmed as identical in Japan and the United States, and consistency in terms of drug names and approval dates was verified during data collection. 2.2 Definition of Indicators MRCTs were classified according to whether approval was granted based on an international collaborative study that included Japan. Concurrent approval was defined as a difference of ≤ 90 days between the approval dates in Japan and the United States [ 13 15 In this study, application lag, review lag, and approval lag were defined as follows. Application lag was defined as the difference in the number of days between the submission date in the United States and that in Japan. Review lag was defined as the difference in the number of days between the review period in the United States and that in Japan. Approval lag was defined as the difference in the number of days between the approval date in the United States and that in Japan. These definitions were designed to differentiate whether observed differences in approval timing between Japan and the United States were primarily attributable to differences in submission timing (application lag) or to differences in the duration of the regulatory review process (review lag). 2.3 Statistical Analysis Overall trends in application lag, review lag, and approval lag were initially evaluated by calculation of descriptive statistics (e.g., median, interquartile range, minimum and maximum values). Approval lag was calculated by determining the difference between the FDA approval date and the PMDA approval date; a negative lag indicated that approval in Japan preceded that in the US. Simple linear regression analysis using the year of PMDA approval as the explanatory variable and approval lag as the dependent variable was conducted to examine changes in approval lag over time. In subgroup analyses, differences in approval lag were assessed according to various factors (i.e., MRCT implementation, concurrent approval classification, company attributes, cancer classification, and regulatory designation). For classification of concurrent approval, drugs were categorized into three groups: “Japan‐first”, “US‐first”, and “concurrent approval”. For comparisons between two groups, the Mann–Whitney U For multivariate analyses, linear regression was performed with approval lag as the dependent variable and MRCT implementation, concurrent approval classification, company attributes, cancer classification, Priority Review Designation, Sakigake Designation, Conditional Early Approval, Orphan Drug Designation, and year of PMDA approval as explanatory variables. To classify concurrent approval in the multivariate model, the drugs were regrouped into two categories: not delayed (Japan‐first or concurrent approval) and delayed (US‐first), based on whether Japan did or did not lag behind the United States. These explanatory variables were selected based on their potential effect on international drug approval timelines from both regulatory and developmental strategy perspectives. The forced entry method was used for model construction. All statistical analyses were two‐tailed, with the significance threshold set at p 2.4 Ethical Considerations This study was conducted solely using existing public databases and published materials; no new data collection involving personal information was undertaken. Therefore, ethical review was not required. 3 Results This study analyzed 142 anticancer drugs that received initial approval based on the primary indication in both Japan (PMDA) and the United States (FDA) between October 2004 and March 2025. Descriptive statistics (median, interquartile range) for application lag, review lag, and approval lag were calculated, and the results are presented in Table 1 TABLE 1 Median and interquartile ranges for application lag, review lag, and approval lag. Item Median (interquartile range Q1–Q3 [days]) Application lag 678 (169 to 1255) Review lag 90 (−5 to 181) Approval lag 774 (217 to 1370) The annual trends in approval lag are illustrated in Figure 1 p FIGURE 1 Trends in Median Approval Lag, by Year of PMDA Approval (2005–2025).

This trend coincides with major regulatory changes in both Japan and the United States. In Japan, the restructuring of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in the mid‐2000s and the implementation of accelerated programs such as the Sakigake Designation since 2015 likely contributed to improved efficiency in regulatory review. In the United States, successive amendments to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) have similarly refined timelines and expanded expedited pathways. This observation is consistent with previous studies [ 16 17 In addition, Tachibana et al. [ 18 Subgroup and multivariate analyses identified MRCT implementation and concurrent approval as pivotal independent factors contributing to the reduction in approval lag. It should be noted that “approval lag,” as used in this study, serves as a descriptive metric for temporal differences in approval timing between countries. It is not intended as a direct indicator of regulatory efficiency or predictability. In fact, regulatory review timelines in Japan are well‐established and consistently applied. Therefore, approval lag should be interpreted in the context of development and submission strategy alignment rather than as a reflection of deficiencies in the regulatory system. These findings corroborate previous suggestions by Maki et al. [ 12 19 20 21 22 Compared with previous studies, this study adds value by incorporating recent data up to 2025 and by simultaneously evaluating multiple influencing factors through multivariate analysis. Specifically, it is the first to quantitatively isolate the independent effects of MRCT implementation and concurrent approval on approval lag using multivariate regression. Furthermore, unlike earlier studies that described approval lag as a single metric, this study distinguishes between application lag, review lag, and approval lag, providing a more granular understanding of where delays occur. By including data from 2018 onwards, the study may also partially reflect the early impact of the ICH E17 guideline, which facilitated the broader adoption of MRCTs in Japan. While Japan has participated in Project Orbis in an observer capacity, this involvement has not yet extended to full joint reviews for initial anticancer drug approvals. As such, although Orbis‐related practices may have informed certain regulatory efficiencies, the direct impact of Project Orbis is unlikely to be reflected in the present study's dataset. The results of the present study also suggest that disparities in approval lag based on company origin (Japanese vs. foreign) and cancer type (hematologic malignancy vs. solid tumor) have diminished in recent years. This trend may reflect advancements in the international standardization of clinical development practices and regulatory harmonization within the global drug development framework [ 5 Although this study categorized cancer types into solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, it is increasingly recognized that modern oncology is shifting toward molecular and biomarker‐based classifications. This paradigm shift reflects the growing role of precision medicine, in which genotypes and specific oncogenic drivers often shape drug development and regulatory decisions. While some biomarker‐defined subtypes (e.g., “ALK‐positive,” “MSI‐High”) can be inferred from approved indications, such information is not uniformly reported across drugs and indications, precluding systematic analysis in the present study. Given limitations in data availability and comparability, conventional cancer‐type classifications were adopted. To enable more granular and clinically relevant analyses, future research should incorporate molecular classifications aligned with precision oncology frameworks. It should be acknowledged that the implementation of MRCT often leads to synchronized submission timing across regions, which may contribute to concurrent approval. Notably, the implementation of the ICH E17 guideline [ 23 In this study, MRCT participation and concurrent approval were analyzed as independent variables; however, their potential interdependence is recognized and should be further explored in future research. The results of the present study reinforce the perspectives of previous studies [ 13 14 24 25 In the univariate analysis of the present study, Priority Review Designation was associated with a statistically significant reduction in approval lag ( p 26 27 28 The clinical and societal significance of this study rests not only in the facilitation of earlier patient access to anticancer therapies but also in the offering of strategic insights for Japan that would enable the country to strengthen its competitiveness in the global pharmaceutical development arena. Recent cases where Japan was the first to approve innovative oncology treatments, such as male breast cancer indications under the Sakigake pathway using real‐world data, underscore the country's evolving leadership in select therapeutic areas. Such examples highlight the importance of continued regulatory innovation and global collaboration. This aligns with perspectives emphasizing the need for international integration, as discussed by Noguchi et al. [ 15 Notable examples include the use of real‐world data in Japan's regulatory approval of pertuzumab (Perjeta) [ 29 30 11 31 Several limitations of this study must be acknowledged, however. First, the study was limited to lags related to anticancer drugs; thus, extrapolation to other therapeutic areas should be approached with caution. This study intentionally focused on oncology drugs to ensure comparability, yet the observed trends should be re‐evaluated in other therapeutic areas in future research. Second, the analysis focused solely on the initial approval based on the primary indication and did not include subsequent indications or formulation approvals. Third, the data collection methodology relied exclusively on public databases and did not account for specific queries during the review process or case‐specific factors. Fourth, although this study spans a period of substantial regulatory evolution, such as the introduction of the Sakigake Designation and successive PDUFA amendments, we did not conduct a formal sub‐analysis stratified by policy era. Future research should incorporate stratified temporal analyses to evaluate how specific regulatory reforms have influenced approval timelines. Furthermore, because certain products received multiple regulatory designations, it would be difficult to isolate the effects of individual programs without substantial risk of confounding. Future research should therefore extend to a broader range of therapeutic areas and incorporate qualitative assessments of submission strategies and clinical trial design. Fifth, this study focused on approval lag as the primary metric, owing to the availability and consistency of public data. However, a more holistic measure of drug development efficiency would consider the full timeline from development initiation to regulatory approval. Future studies should aim to capture and analyze such comprehensive development data. Finally, this study did not consider qualitative procedural factors such as requirements for local pharmacokinetic studies, the need for Japanese‐language documentation, or timelines for PMDA consultations. These aspects may contribute to delays and should be explored in future mixed‐methods research. Although we considered conducting sub‐analyses based on the implementation periods of regulatory programs such as the Sakigake Designation and Conditional Early Approval, the small number of applicable cases (e.g., two for Conditional Early Approval and three for Sakigake Designation) made meaningful statistical analysis infeasible. Future research may revisit this issue as additional data become available. Compared with previous studies, the present study offers novel insights by quantitatively isolating the independent effects of MRCT implementation and concurrent international approval using multivariate regression analysis. In addition, this study distinguished between application lag, review lag, and approval lag, allowing for a more detailed understanding of the approval process. These methodological distinctions contribute to the originality and added value of this research. In summary, this study demonstrated a progressive reduction in approval lag for anticancer drugs between Japan and the United States, particularly since 2016. The results of the multivariate analysis identified MRCT implementation and concurrent international approval strategies as major independent factors contributing to this reduction. By contrast, company origin and cancer type were not independently associated with approval lag, and no significant independent effects were observed for regulatory designations such as Priority Review, Sakigake Designation, Conditional Early Approval, and Orphan Drug Designation. These findings suggest that merely obtaining a regulatory designation is insufficient; rather, early participation in international clinical trials and synchronized submission strategies are essential for further shortening approval lag. Moreover, strengthening international collaboration frameworks such as Project Orbis could play an important role in shaping the future global drug development landscape.
