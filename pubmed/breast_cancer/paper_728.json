Adolescence represents a key opportunity for breast cancer prevention, as the rapid proliferation of breast tissue during puberty creates a critical window of vulnerability for the development of cancerous cells. With increasing research on adolescent dietary factors and breast cancer risk, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the associations between adolescent diet and risk of breast cancer in adulthood, as well as benign breast disease (BBD) and high mammographic breast density, which are markers for breast cancer. We searched Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Embase for epidemiological studies assessing dietary intakes in adolescent girls (aged 10–18 y), published through 16 October, 2024, with no language or time restrictions. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and results were pooled using random-effects models. The review included 51 studies, mostly from the United States, with the majority relying on adult recall of adolescent diet, and only 20 studies were assessed as high quality. Higher adolescent intakes of fruits and vegetables [relative risk (RR): 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.82, 0.99; n n n n n n This systematic review and meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024532597).

Current dietary strategies for breast cancer prevention are largely informed by epidemiological evidence from studies involving adult populations. Our findings offer preliminary insights into potential pathways linking dietary exposures during adolescence to breast cancer development. We also identify critical gaps in adolescent research, emphasizing the need for continued high-quality research targeting the formative years to inform future prevention efforts. Introduction The global burden of breast cancer is continuing to rise rapidly, and there is an important need for national breast cancer programs to go beyond a focus on screening and consider primary prevention strategies [ 1 2 In addition, there is a significant corpus of literature examining the role of diet and breast cancer risk. A recent umbrella review revealed that adherence to a prudent dietary pattern, characterized by high intakes of vegetables, fruits, legumes, cereals, and seafood, confers a decreased risk of breast cancer [ 3 4 Intriguingly, previous epidemiological studies have suggested that dietary exposures during critical periods across the lifespan, such as from menarche to first childbirth, may have a greater impact on breast cancer risk accumulation. The leading hypothesis is that the rapid proliferation of breast tissue during puberty makes adolescence a critical period of vulnerability for the development of subsequent cancerous cells, suggesting that adolescence represents a key window for breast cancer prevention [ 5 6 7 8 In parallel, some studies have examined the role of adolescent diet in benign breast disease (BBD) and high mammographic breast density, both of which are well-defined markers of breast cancer [ 9 10 1 2 3 11 12 7 10 13 [14] [15] [16] 11 13 To our knowledge, the associations between adolescent diet and risk of breast cancer have been summarized in 2 narrative reviews (published in 2013 and 2016) [ 17 18 19 20 21 Methods This systematic review and meta-analysis followed the PRISMA reporting guidelines [ 22 Search strategy A systematic search was conducted in Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Embase for articles published through 4 March, 2024, with no restrictions on language or time. The search was updated on 16 October, 2024 to identify any newly published relevant articles. The search strategy combined keywords “adolescent,” “youth,” “diet,” “breast cancer,” “breast neoplasm,” “breast density,” and “benign breast disease.” Reference lists of the selected publications were also hand-searched for identification of additional relevant studies. The full search strategy is detailed in Supplemental Table 1 Selection criteria We used the Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcomes, Study design criteria to identify eligible studies. Studies were included if the following criteria were fulfilled: 1 2 3 1 2 3 Three authors (CKYL, GHL, and NK) independently screened the titles and abstracts of articles for eligibility, and full texts of the potentially relevant studies were retrieved and evaluated. Disagreements were resolved by discussion with 2 senior investigators (AC and MF-FC). Data extraction and synthesis The following data were extracted using a standardized template which consisted of the following: 1 2 3 4 5 Risk of bias assessment We evaluated the quality of studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) [ 23 1 2 3 Data synthesis and statistical methods Dietary variables, that is, food, food groups, or nutrients, were categorized and meta-analyzed. When there were multiple dietary variables from a single publication grouped under the same category, for example, red meat and poultry, we pooled the individual effect estimates using a fixed-effects model to obtain an overall estimate for use in the meta-analysis of studies examining “meat and poultry.” If similar dietary variables were identified within the same study cohort, results from the publication with a longer follow-up and/or larger number of cases were included in the main analysis, whereas the other studies on the same cohort were considered in sensitivity analysis by alternate inclusion to determine the robustness of the result. As studies included in this meta-analysis reported measures of association based on a mixture of equal-sized groups (i.e., tertile/quartile/quintile) and unequal-sized groups (i.e., servings/level or frequency of intake), we transformed the effect estimates from each study to a standard scale of effect to facilitate comparison between the top and bottom tertile using methods that were previously described [ [24] [25] [26] [27] 1 2 3 x x RR, OR, and HR were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. To account for between-study variations, random-effects models were used to calculate the pooled effect estimates, which were expressed in RR with its corresponding 95% CI for the association between adolescent dietary variables and breast cancer [ 28 29 28 We also used Cochran’s Q test ( P I 2 n 28 I 2 28 30 Further sensitivity analyses were also conducted to examine the robustness of our findings: 1 2 3 Results of the meta-analysis were presented using forest plots, illustrating the pooled and individual study effect estimates with their corresponding 95% CI, weightage of each study, and I 2 P Dietary variables (e.g., dietary patterns) were summarized narratively if there were fewer than 2 studies to meta-analyze [ [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] P 54 42 43 55 43 44 47 [56] [57] [58] Results Study selection The flow chart of the study selection process is shown in Figure 1 FIGURE 1 PRISMA flow diagram of the study selection process.

[ 35 Supplemental Table 5 Benign breast disease When data on adolescent nutrient intake were pooled, higher intakes of dietary fiber and vitamin D (from food and supplement use) were associated with a 36% and 23% lower risk of BBD, respectively, when comparing the top and bottom tertiles (dietary fiber—RR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.82; I 2 I 2 Supplemental Figure 2H, I There were no statistically significant associations between any of the remaining nutrients (i.e., total fat, vegetable fat, animal fat, monounsaturated fat, animal protein, vitamin A, lycopene, carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin) nor food groups (i.e., fruits and vegetables, nuts and legumes, dairy, milk and alcohol) with BBD risk. Similar estimates were observed in the sensitivity analyses when we alternately included similar dietary variables from the same study cohort and performed the analyses using unconverted data ( Supplemental Table 5 Mammographic breast density Existing studies have only examined adolescent dietary intake of red meat, alcohol, and animal fat in relation to mammographic breast density in adulthood [ 43 [79] [80] [81] Because of the limited number of studies on mammographic breast density, we were only able to perform sensitivity analysis using unconverted data, and the results were similar to the original estimates ( Supplemental Table 5 Results of other adolescent dietary variables with breast cancer in adulthood The results of adolescent dietary variables that could not be evaluated in the meta-analysis are summarized in Supplemental Table 6 In studies evaluating breast cancer as the outcome measure [ [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] 46 51 52 54 [56] [57] [58] 31 31 32 [38] [39] [40] [41] 43 53 42 [42] [43] [44] 50 55 43 44 47 [56] [57] [58] Discussion This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the associations between different aspects of dietary intakes during adolescence and subsequent risk of breast cancer, BBD and mammographic breast density in adult females. Greater intakes of fruits and vegetables, soy, dietary fiber, and vegetable fat during adolescence were associated with lower risks of breast cancer later in adulthood. Additionally, greater intakes of dietary fiber and vitamin D during adolescence were associated with lower risks of BBD. We did not find any significant associations between any dietary variables and mammographic breast density. To our knowledge, this review is the first to comprehensively quantify the associations between adolescent intake of various dietary components and breast cancer in later adulthood. Comparison with existing meta-analyses on adult diet and breast cancer Breast cancer Existing meta-analyses on adult diet and breast cancer risk found a 9%–11% lower risk of breast cancer for fruits and vegetables intake [ 82 83 84 85 4 82 84 32 63 64 86 4 87 88 To our knowledge, only 1 meta-analysis has examined the association between adult vegetable fat intake and breast cancer, finding no significant association [ 89 90 35 Benign breast disease To date, no existing meta-analysis has quantified the association between dietary intake during adolescence or adulthood and BBD risk. We demonstrated that greater intakes of dietary fiber and dietary vitamin D were associated with a 36% and 23% decreased risk of BBD, respectively. However, it is important to highlight that our meta-analysis was based on data from 2 main cohorts, Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) II and GUTS, which comprised the offspring of females from NHS II. The NHS II specifically included proliferative BBD that were biopsy-verified (both atypical hyperplasia and nonatypical hyperplasia), but the GUTS cohort did not differentiate between proliferative or nonproliferative BBD. It is therefore unclear whether these findings truly reflect the beneficial effects of vitamin D and dietary fiber on BBD. Given that proliferative forms of BBD are associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent breast cancer, it is important for future studies to ensure clear classification of BBD subtypes to better clarify these associations. Mammographic breast density Along with proliferative BBD, having a high mammographic breast density (i.e., dense breast tissue) is also recognized as an independent risk factor for breast cancer [ 10 91 43 80 42 Biological mechanisms of adolescent diet and breast cancer As abundant sources of fiber and antioxidants, fruits, vegetables, and soy are thought to ameliorate breast cancer risk by suppressing angiogenesis, decreasing oxidative stress and DNA damage, inhibiting cell proliferation, and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells [ 83 4 92 32 34 93 90 94 95 7 94 Although the biological mechanisms for BBD remain less well understood, it is plausible that the protective mechanisms of dietary fiber and vitamin D may be mediated in a similar way as those in breast cancer. Public health implications With the growing body of work from primary studies that suggest potential involvement of dietary exposures during adolescence in the etiology of breast cancer, our review has taken a step forward by demonstrating that even as early as adolescence stage, intakes of fruits and vegetables, soy, dietary fiber and vegetable fat can be associated with lower risks of breast cancer later in life. We have also demonstrated that adolescent intakes of dietary fiber and vitamin D are associated with lower risks of BBD. To date, dietary strategies for preventing breast cancer have been largely informed by epidemiological evidence from studies involving adult populations. Moreover, apart from alcohol, which has been well-documented to have a direct association with both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer, the current evidence on diet and breast cancer prevention as reported in the 2017 Breast Cancer Report by the World Cancer Research Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research is mostly concluded to be limited [ 2 96 97 In our review, we observed that findings are significant even after adjustment for both age at menarche and at first childbirth, suggesting that dietary factors in adolescence could be an independent contributor to breast cancers later in life. Fruit, vegetables, and soy are food groups that make up part of a high-quality diet. However, adolescence is a life stage where poor diet quality can be common, and this often results in compromised intake of nutrient-dense foods and consequently, essential nutrients [ 98 Strengths, limitations, and gaps in adolescent research The present systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to have examined the associations between adolescent diet and breast cancer in adulthood. We comprehensively considered all aspects of dietary intake, including individual nutrients, foods, food groups, and dietary patterns, to provide an extensive and up-to-date review of current available literature. Although the transformation of study-specific effect estimates to a standard scale of tertile enabled fair comparisons across studies, variation in how dietary intake was assessed, whether by frequency, serving size, or grammage, limited our ability to recommend a specific recommended intake range based on existing studies. Nonetheless, we also performed various sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. There are limitations inherent to our review. First, our meta-analysis was limited by the small number of available studies, resulting in lower statistical power compared with existing meta-analyses on adult females and limiting our ability to conduct a dose–response analysis. Consequently, several dietary variables, including dietary patterns, could only be summarized narratively. Although dietary patterns offer insight into the synergy between foods and nutrients, those narratively summarized in our review did not show any significant associations with breast cancer. This may be attributed to adolescence as a transitional period, where dietary habits are constantly evolving, unlike in adulthood when dietary patterns tend to be more stable [ 99 66 67 70 100 In conclusion, evidence from this systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that high intakes of fruits and vegetables, soy, dietary fiber, and vegetable fat during adolescence were associated with lower risks of breast cancer. Additionally, high intakes of dietary fiber and vitamin D during adolescence were associated with lower risks of BBD. Dietary and lifestyle changes often occur during the transition from adolescence to adulthood; therefore, well-designed prospective life course epidemiological studies are essential to substantiate these findings on early life exposures and breast cancer risk. Given the rapidly rising burden of breast cancer, there is an urgent need to raise awareness on the role of adolescent diet and timing of exposures, and to support continued high-quality research during critical developmental periods. Strengthening this evidence is key to better inform effective and timely prevention strategies aimed at reducing the future risk of cancer. As risk factors may vary by molecular breast cancer subtype [ 35 37 45 51 61 69 71 32 33 45 60 61 Author contributions The authors’ responsibilities were as follows – AC, MF-FC: contributed to study conception and design; CKYL, GHL, EL, NK: conducted the literature search, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment; AC, CKYL, GHL, EL: performed statistical analysis and data interpretation; YCRST: contributed expert advice; GHL: drafted the manuscript; and all authors: read, critically revised, and approved the final manuscript.
