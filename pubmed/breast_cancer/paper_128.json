ILD can be caused by anti-cancer treatments (drug-induced [DI] ILD), but also by opportunistic infection, and non-drug-related etiologies. This systematic literature review (SLR) investigated the epidemiology and etiology of non-DI ILD and DI ILD management and outcomes in patients with solid cancers. Methods Databases were searched to August 2023 using terms for ILD and solid cancers. Relevant congresses held 2021–2023 and SLR bibliographies were hand-searched. Records were screened by two independent reviewers. Inclusion criteria comprised ILD epidemiology outcomes, ILD clinical management, and survival outcomes. Results Of 4,519 unique records screened, 55 full texts were included (six from supplementary sources) and 37 were prioritized for extraction. Studies were frequently retrospective cohort studies in Japan (n = 21). Patients mostly had lung cancers (n = 32) and received immune checkpoint inhibitors (n = 24). Reporting of non-DI ILD was limited and associated with radiation therapy (n = 4) or surgery (n = 1). Most studies reported DI ILD outcomes only (n = 31). Conclusion The limited evidence of non-DI ILD indicates that prompt intervention to manage ILD until other ILD etiologies have been ruled out remains key to preventing progression of both cancer and ILD. Protocol registration http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero identifier Plain Language Summary Interstitial lung disease, or “ILD,” is a group of conditions that cause scarring and swelling in the lungs. This makes it harder to breathe and get enough oxygen. New cancer drugs can work well to treat a person’s cancer, but they can sometimes cause ILD as a side-effect (known as “drug-induced” ILD). ILD can have other causes unrelated to cancer treatment. For example, some lung infections can cause ILD. When ILD occurs, a person’s cancer treatment has to be paused until the lung condition improves, which could worsen outcomes. We aimed to find out how commonly these other causes of ILD occur in people with solid cancers (cancers that affect tissues and organs such as breast, lung, and liver) and what these causes are. We also looked at survival outcomes in patients who develop ILD and how ILD is treated. We identified 55 published studies, mostly from Japan and in people with lung cancer. ILD not caused by cancer treatment was rarely reported and was linked to radiation therapy or surgery in all of the studies that we reviewed. No cases of ILD caused by infection were found in these studies, even though some known cases have been reported in medical case reports. We found that people had shorter survival times on average if they had severe ILD or if the ILD developed soon after starting cancer treatment. Although we did not find many studies reporting other causes of ILD in people with cancer, it is still very important that doctors follow guidelines closely to find out whether the ILD has been caused by a person’s cancer treatment or by something else. While doing so, doctors should treat both possible causes until infection can be ruled out. As new cancer treatments that can cause ILD are used more and more widely, doctors need to understand ILD and its different potential causes. Finding out what has caused the ILD is important so that it can be treated appropriately and promptly, and the person can restart cancer treatment once the condition has improved.

Introduction Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is an umbrella term encompassing more than 200 pulmonary disorders characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the lung interstitium [ 1 2 3 4 There are several known risk factors associated with ILD etiology, including exposure to occupational and environmental toxins (including smoking), radiation therapy, opportunistic infections, genetic predisposition, and presence of autoimmune diseases [ 3 5–7 8 9–13 14 15–17 Given the time-sensitive nature of ILD diagnosis, current recommendations are not to discount either infection or DI at first instance, but to initiate management strategies for both while awaiting confirmatory results to rule out infection [ 9 17 18 19 The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to identify and summarize evidence of the wider epidemiology and etiology of ILD among patients with non-hematological malignancies in clinical practice. The primary objectives of the review were to describe the etiology and quantify the incidence of non-DI ILD; secondary objectives included an evidence synthesis on current approaches to ILD management and the impact of ILD on survival outcomes. 2. Methods This de novo 20 Literature was identified by searching electronic databases, manual handsearching of key congress proceedings from the last two years (2021–2023), targeted searches, and manual hand-searching of the bibliographies of any relevant systematic reviews or (network) meta-analyses ([N]MAs) identified during the review. 2.1. Literature identification 2.1.1. Electronic database searching Searches were conducted on 30 August 2023, in MEDLINE (1946 to 28 August 2023), Embase (1974 to 29 August 2023), and Epistemonikos. MEDLINE (including MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Daily, Epub Ahead of Print, InDataReview, and Other NonIndexed Citations), and Embase were searched separately via the Ovid SP platform; Epistemonikos was searched via its online platform. 2.1.2. Search terms The search strategy included comprehensive disease area terms for ILD, solid cancers, and diagnosis of ILD. Of note, “interstitial pneumonitis” and several variations of this term were included in the search syntax within the ILD term group. Complete lists of search terms used in the MEDLINE and Embase electronic databases are provided in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2, respectively. Search terms used in the Epistemonikos platform are presented in Supplemental Table S3. An observational studies filter, an augmented strategy originally published by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network [ 21 2.1.3. Grey literature, targeted, and bibliography searching Conference proceedings from 2021–2023 were manually hand searched to identify any relevant abstracts from six major relevant scientific congresses (listed with full search strategy details in Supplemental Table S4). Time-limited targeted searches of Google, Google Scholar, and PubMed were conducted to supplement the database searches. Search terms were developed using an iterative approach, based on an appraisal of the evidence from the database searches and identification of any gaps in the literature (full search strategy details are listed in Supplemental Table S5). The bibliographies of all relevant SLRs and (n)MAs identified during the SLR were hand searched in order to identify any additional, relevant studies for inclusion. 2.2. Study selection The inclusion and exclusion criteria used to assess the relevance of the titles, abstracts, and full texts are presented in Table 1 22 Table 1. Eligibility criteria according to the PICOS approach. Domain Inclusion Criteria Exclusion Criteria Patient population Adult (≥18 years) patients with a nonhematological malignancy afflicted with any form of ILD, included but not limited to: a ○ Infection-related ○ Interstitial pneumonia ○ Connective tissue disease associated ○Drug associated ○ Inhalation exposure ○ Granulomatous ○ Familial or inherited ILD must have been diagnosed with a radiological modality including: ○ Chest X-Ray ○ PET ○ CT Studies exclusively reporting on patients with other conditions Patients with ILD not diagnosed with a radiological modality including: ○ Biomarker measurement ○ Biopsy ○ Genetic tests ○ Pulmonary function tests Intervention or comparator Any or none N/A Outcomes Priority 1 b Incidence of DI vs non-DI c Etiology of incident non-DI ILD Infection-related incident ILD, including opportunistic infections, prophylaxis, management, clinical outcomes Priority 2 Management of incident non-DI ILD, including anti-cancer treatment changes Risk factors for incident non-DI ILD, by etiology Prevalence of preexisting ILD (prior to anti-cancer therapy, etiology must be known) Etiology of preexisting ILD Priority 3 Incidence of DI ILD by oncology drug class Management of DI ILD, including anti-cancer treatment changes Risk factors for incident DI ILD DI ILD prophylaxis Differential diagnosis of incident ILD Diagnostic accuracy of incident ILD Monitoring for ILD Survival outcomes, by: ○ Presence or absence of preexisting ILD ○ Onset of incident non-DI ILD, by etiology (including infection) ○ Onset of incident DI ILD, by line and type of therapy Studies exclusively reporting other outcomes Study design Non-interventional studies, including: ○ Prospective and retrospective cohort studies and case series ○ Cross-sectional studies ○ Database and registry studies (e.g., claims data) RCTs Interventional non-RCTs including comparative, non-randomized studies and single arm studies Comments, editorials, or conference reviews Narrative reviews Case studies d Relevant SLRs and (N)MAs of observational studies were considered at the title/abstract review stage and hand searched for relevant primary studies, but were excluded during the full-text review stage unless they reported primary research Language Abstract or full text published in the English language No abstract or full text published in the English language Other Congress abstracts published in or after 2021 Studies in humans Any geography Congress abstracts published prior to 2021 In vitro a b c d Abbreviations: CT: computed tomography; DI: (oncology) druginduced; ILD: interstitial lung disease; N/A: not applicable; (N)MA: (network) metaanalysis; PET: positron emission tomography; PICOS: Population, Intervention, Comparators, Outcome, Study design; RCT: randomized controlled trial; SLR: systematic literature review. At both the title/abstract and full-text screening stages, each article was reviewed against the eligibility criteria by two independent reviewers. Where the applicability of the inclusion criteria was unclear during abstract screening, the article was included at this stage in order to ensure that all potentially relevant studies were captured; at full-text review, where the publication did not give sufficient information to be sure it met the eligibility criteria, the publication was excluded to ensure that only relevant articles were ultimately included in the SLR. At both stages of the review, the results of the two reviewers were compared and any disagreements resolved by discussion until a consensus was met. If necessary, a third independent reviewer arbitrated the final decision. 2.3. Evidence prioritization and data extraction Studies were categorized according to the priority of outcomes, divided into three pre-specified groups as detailed in Table 1 To ensure that evidence most pertinent to the focus of the review was included, prioritization parameters were applied to limit eligibility. Studies were deprioritized at the title/abstract screening stage if they included an overall sample size of fewer than 50 patients, were published prior to 2018, reported ILD associated with occupational exposure, or reported on patients with cancer and patients with ILD separately (or reported onset of cancer in patients with ILD). From the final list of included records, studies reporting on DI ILD were prioritized for full data extraction if they reported data on survival outcomes or ILD management; studies that solely reported the incidence/prevalence of DI ILD, or risk factors, prophylaxis, diagnostic accuracy, and monitoring of DI ILD, were included in the SLR but deprioritized for data extraction. A summary of evidence prioritization strategies is provided in Supplemental Table S6. For each included study, key information was extracted into a pre-specified data extraction grid in Microsoft Excel. Extracted data included: characteristics of the included studies (study design, single/multicenter, geographic region[s] where the study was conducted, follow-up period, sample size, methods of patient selection, disease/treatment inclusion and exclusion criteria); characteristics of the included patient population (population size and proportion with ILD, method of ILD diagnosis, age, sex, race and ethnicity, weight/body mass index (BMI), smoking status, malignancy site and characteristics, lung comorbidities, smoking status, and prior and current interventions); and epidemiological outcomes (ILD etiology, infection-related ILD clinical outcome[s], management of ILD [treatment for ILD, change in cancer treatment/treatment regimen, e.g., pausing and re-initiating cancer treatment on resolution of ILD] and survival [progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and proportion of deaths]). Quality assessments were conducted for all included studies prioritized for extraction using a modified version of the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools Checklist for Prevalence Studies [ 23 Data extraction was performed by one reviewer per included study, in accordance with University of York CRD guidelines [ 20 3. Results 3.1. Searches and screening A summary of searches and screening inclusions/exclusions at each review stage is presented in Figure 1 Figure 1. Systematic review PRISMA flow diagram. a Abbreviations: DI: (oncology) drug-induced; ILD: interstitial lung disease; PRISMA: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses; SLR: systematic literature review. In this SLR, 6,998 records were retrieved by the electronic database searches, of which 2,479 were duplicates. Of the 4,519 unique records that were screened at the title/abstract review stage, 577 met the eligibility criteria. In total, 313 records were deprioritized in line with the prioritization strategies, leaving 264 full texts for review. Of these full texts, 49 were included. Most studies excluded during full-text review did not include adult patients with a non-hematological malignancy or any form of ILD diagnosed with a radiological modality (n = 164). Of these, there were 47 studies where the method of ILD diagnosis was unclear (i.e., chest imaging was not confirmed). Additionally, 29 studies were excluded due to unclear etiology of ILD; in 22 of these studies, association or non-association with anti-cancer treatment was implied but insufficiently clarified or discussed. Records excluded at the full-text review stage are listed with brief rationale for exclusion in Supplemental Table S7. Three records were identified from supplementary congress searches, while no relevant records were identified by the targeted searches. The bibliographies of 13 relevant SLRs/(N)MAs were searched, and three relevant records were identified. With 49 records included from the database searches and six from the supplementary searches, a total of 55 publications reporting on 55 unique studies were ultimately included (listed in Supplemental Table S8). Of these studies, 37 were prioritized for extraction. A summary of the quality assessments conducted for each study is presented in Supplemental Table S9. Six out of nine domains were sufficiently addressed, where most studies recruited participants in an appropriate way and reported detailed methodology, sufficient or extensive baseline characteristics and outcomes of interest for included patients and relevant subgroups. A total of 17/37 studies were designed to investigate ILD epidemiology, frequently incidence of and risk factors for DI ILD, although studies scarcely discussed possible non-DI ILD etiologies. Statistical comparisons were used to assess relevant outcomes in 33/37 studies, with analysis methodology described. No studies were considered to have had an appropriate sample frame, as most included patients from a single center with one type of solid cancer, and often investigated a single intervention. With the exception of a national Japanese registry/database study [ 24 3.2. Study and patient characteristics 3.2.1. Study characteristics Characteristics of the included prioritized studies are summarized in Supplemental Table S10. Most studies were conducted in Japan (n = 21), with the rest conducted in China (n = 6), the USA (n = 4), Germany (n = 2), South Korea (n = 2), India (n = 1), and Italy (n = 1). There were 35 retrospective cohort studies, of which most were single-center studies (n = 24). There was one prospective cohort study [ 25 24 Overall sample sizes of patients with solid malignancies varied, with 10 studies including ≥ 500 patients, 4 studies including 250–499 patients, 17 studies including 100–249 patients, and 6 studies including <100 patients. Most studies included <50 patients with ILD (n = 29), although eight studies included ≥50 patients with ILD, of which five studies reported on >100 patients with ILD [ 26–30 31–33 Median duration of patient follow up was reported in 13 studies, ranging from 12 weeks to 5.1 years. Type of cancer therapy was reported in 35 studies; most studies included patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies (n = 24), such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab, or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (n = 6), such as abemaciclib and osimertinib. Fewer studies included patients receiving chemotherapy (n = 5) or other treatment (proton beam therapy [n = 1]; surgery [n = 1]). 3.2.2. Patient characteristics Characteristics of patients included in the prioritized studies are summarized in Supplemental Table S11. Age and sex were reported in most studies for the overall population and/or the cohort with ILD (n = 29 and n = 28, respectively). The majority of studies reported median age between 55–80 years for both groups, except for one study, which reported a comparatively younger median age of patients with ILD (43 years) [ 34 35 36 37–39 40–42 Where reported, most studies had a predominantly male overall population, and generally there were higher proportions of male patients with ILD compared with female patients, with three studies reporting differences [ 32 36 37 32 43–45 32 36 46 47 Smoking status was reported in 31 studies; where reported, the majority of patients both overall and with ILD were current or former smokers [ 25–33 35 36 40 43–46 48–56 31 50 26 33 35 38 39 47–51 57 25 27 32 33 35 43 44 47 26 38 40 42 45 55 57 38 42 55 24 25 28 31 32 35 36 39 40 43 44 47 48 50 51 54 55 57 3.2.3. Evidence identified according to outcome Priority Reporting of the highest priority outcomes sought for the primary objective of this SLR was extremely limited; one study reported the incidence of DI versus non-DI ILD from initiation of anti-cancer therapy [ 24 26 29 36 44 47 29 36 44 29 The majority of studies reported various outcomes related to DI ILD only (n = 31), including management of DI ILD (n = 29), and survival outcomes (n = 25) stratified by onset of incident DI ILD by line and type of therapy. 3.3. Non-DI ILD epidemiology Where cases of non-DI ILD were reported, etiologies were all associated with RT (n = 4) or surgery (n = 1), and all studies were single-center, retrospective cohort studies in patients with lung cancer [ 26 29 36 43 44 47 A summary of the type of epidemiological data reported in each study, with the proportion of patients with non-DI ILD in the overall population and the study follow up period, is provided in Supplemental Table S12. Partial prevalence of radiation pneumonitis, reported in three studies, ranged from 0.004–15.5% of patients with lung cancer during periods of approx. 2 up to 15 years [ 26 29 43 47 44 3.4. Clinical management of DI ILD Approaches to clinical management of DI ILD were reported in 29 studies (Supplemental Table S13). In 21 studies reporting ICI-related ILD, 12 reported discontinuation of the ICI upon ILD diagnosis in all patients [ 27 45 49 52 53 57 58 25 33 35 37 39 26 41 59 40 42 37 40 All 29 studies reported that some (n = 23) or all (n = 6) patients received steroids to manage their ILD. Corticosteroids, including systemic glucocorticoids, were most commonly used (n = 14 studies). Dose ranges and median durations of steroid treatment, where available, are reported in Supplemental Table S13. Studies also reported use of cyclophosphamide (n = 3), antibiotics (n = 3), and infliximab (n = 3) in some patients. In studies reporting discontinuation of anti-cancer treatment upon diagnosis of DI ILD (n = 20), generally a subset of patients [ 25 27 33 39–41 45 46 49 52 53 58 34 25 27 41 45 53 58 Zeng 2022 and Zhang 2020 reported cases of ILD relapse following reinitiation of ICIs in 2/7 (both resolved with subsequent cessation of ICI treatment) and 6/9 patients, respectively [ 39 45 33 41 25 30 37 47 3.5. Survival outcomes in patients with DI ILD In total, 25 studies reported survival outcomes in patients with incident DI ILD. Studies reported number of deaths (n = 13), OS (n = 13), and PFS (n = 10), overall and in patient subgroups, as summarized in Supplemental Table S14. Most studies reported deaths due to any cause (n = 22); three studies reported deaths that were specifically related to, or caused by, ILD [ 28 35 39 3.5.1. Survival outcomes in patients with and without incident DI ILD Survival outcomes in patients with and without incident DI ILD were reported in 13 studies. Where reported, OS from the first administration of anticancer treatment in these patient subgroups was generally similar, with nine studies reporting no differences (six in patients receiving ICIs [ 25 31 32 45 49 56 42 46 55 57 Suzuki 2020 reported 1- and 2-year OS in a cohort of 138 patients with lung cancer receiving ICI therapy, with similar outcomes observed in patients with (1-year OS 55.0%, 2-year OS 31.3%) and without (57.8% and 33.1%) incident DI ILD [ 25 Saito 2021 reported that, in a Japanese, nation-wide, post-marketing study in patients with NSCLC receiving ICI therapy, all-cause mortality was similar in patients with (15.5%) and without (13.5%) DI ILD [ 30 32 46 55 57 42 56 3.5.2. Survival outcomes in relation to time to incident DI ILD onset Survival outcomes were reported in patient subgroups stratified by timing of DI ILD onset in relation to initiation of anti-cancer treatment in three studies [ 30 48 57 57 Huang 2021 reported shorter median OS and a higher proportion of deaths in patients with NSCLC with early-onset (within 6 weeks) versus late-onset (after 6 weeks) pneumonitis after initiation of ICI therapy [ 48 30 3.5.3. Survival outcomes by incident DI ILD severity Survival outcomes were also reported in patient subgroups stratified by DI ILD severity in four studies [ 30 32 37 58 During a median follow-up of 34.5 months, Frost 2023 reported median OS in patients with lung cancer of 25.4 months in patients with grade 1–2 and 28.7 months in those with grade 3–4 ICI-induced pneumonitis; median OS was 0.9 months in patients with grade 5 (fatal) ICI-induced pneumonitis [ 37 47 Two studies reported proportions of deaths in subgroups of patients with NSCLC stratified by ILD severity. In a retrospective analysis of patients with NSCLC who received ICIs during the period of January 2016 to December 2019 at three centers in China, Pang 2023 reported 0% (0/11) in patients with grade 1–2 and 28% (7/25) in patients with grade 3–4 ILD [ 58 30 4. Discussion The low volume of literature reporting on ILD with alternative, non-drug-related etiologies in patients with solid cancers limited elucidation of non-DI ILD epidemiology, which was the primary objective of this review. The larger volume of literature reporting on DI ILD provided outcomes surrounding clinical management of DI ILD and the impact of DI ILD on survival. Other aspects of DI ILD have been described in another recent SLR [ 8 Most included studies were single-center, retrospective cohort studies, largely conducted in Japan in patients with lung cancer. This geographic distribution of included studies may be, in part, due to the ethnic genetic background association with risk of DI ILD, with Asian and Japanese populations having higher susceptibility compared with other populations [ 60 61 8 62 63 Most (31/37) studies reported outcomes related to DI ILD only, with fewer (6/37) studies reporting on non-DI ILD, where cases were entirely associated with radiation therapy, and surgery in one study; no studies reported cases of infection-related ILD. According to clinical practice guidelines, DI ILD should be diagnosed only once all other possible etiologies have been ruled out [ 64 43 43 Various factors may have contributed to the paucity of reporting on non-DI ILD. Mild symptoms of ILD such as gradual shortness of breath may be attributed to common co-existing conditions including asthma, obesity, and general aging. Non-specific symptoms such as exercise intolerance can also be easily overlooked by clinicians, particularly non-specialists who may not be aware of ILD and its symptoms. Equally, patients with initially mild ILD may not consider that their symptoms warrant reporting. Patients may also adapt to their symptoms as non-DI ILD can progress slowly over a period of months, yet significant lung damage may be occurring. Additionally, limited access to high-resolution CT imaging, lung tests, and barriers to lung biopsy may prevent ILD diagnosis in some cases. Inconsistent coding and documentation issues in medical records may also hinder reporting. The exclusion of several studies due to unclear etiology may reflect drug association by default or unconfirmed cause, possibly due to the need for detailed review of patient’s occupation/lifestyle and treatment history, and further investigation to determine presence of infection and contribution to onset of ILD. For example, opportunistic infections such as pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and pneumocystis carinii pneumonia that might be dismissed due to their usually inconsequential disease course (if treated appropriately) could be relevant to ILD etiology in patients with cancer, who often receive immunosuppressants [ 65 66 67 68 67 68 Management of DI ILD mostly involved interruption of anti-cancer treatment and administration of steroid treatment until resolution of ILD, in line with treatment prescribing information; corticosteroids were most frequently used and, as such, remain the mainstay of treatment for ILD in solid cancers. A subset of patients with low-grade ILD resumed anti-cancer treatment upon ILD resolution in all studies, with few or no patients experiencing ILD relapse following re-initiation of anti-cancer treatment in three out of four studies, albeit involving small numbers of patients [ 33 41 45 69 Survival outcomes were mostly reported by onset of incident DI ILD, with OS and PFS data reported in subgroups of patients with early- and late-onset ILD, and with varying ILD severity. Broadly, survival outcomes did not differ substantially between patients with and without incident DI ILD, suggesting that presence of ILD did not increase mortality in most included studies [ 25 31 32 46 49 30 32 37 47 48 57 70 To our knowledge, this is the first review to employ a fully systematic approach to specifically investigate the epidemiology of non-DI ILD and how ILD is being assessed and reported outside of controlled trial conditions. Records were captured from a range of sources and were reviewed and extracted following a pre-defined, PROSPERO-registered protocol that was developed in line with relevant guidelines for the conduct and reporting of SLRs. Infection-related ILD was a key etiology of interest for this SLR, however no cases were reported in the cohort studies included. While case studies of infection-related ILD have been reported, these were not systematically identified as part of the SLR per the protocol. The SLR employed strict eligibility criteria which led to exclusion of potentially relevant studies owing to insufficient information reported on approach to diagnosis and etiology of ILD. To ensure that data from relevant populations were captured, studies had to report onset of ILD in patients with cancer, rather than onset of cancer in patients with ILD, and studies were excluded where the order was unclear. Therefore, the findings of this SLR do not provide a full picture of ILD and cancer outcomes more broadly. Similarly, studies were excluded if they reported ILD exacerbation, triggered by chemotherapy for example [ 71 The findings of this SLR highlight that there remains a need for standardized diagnostic criteria and reporting frameworks for ILD to improve comparability across studies to inform treatment development. The lack of non-DI ILD reporting reflects its under-recognition and the need for greater clinician awareness, which will become increasingly important with further establishment of associated novel anti-cancer therapies; clinicians will be more likely to need to diagnose and appropriately manage ILD cases. In the future, ILD screening methods should be integrated into routine care protocols for at-risk populations. Molecular and imaging biomarkers, potentially incorporating artificial intelligence assistance, could offer a promising avenue for earlier accurate detection of ILD [ 72 69 5. Conclusion In conclusion, given the limited evidence of non-DI ILD identified, our review highlights the need for awareness of alternative ILD etiologies and adherence to diagnostic guidelines. Timely intervention until non-drug-related etiologies have been ruled out allows for appropriate clinical management and may prevent progression of both cancer and ILD. Informed monitoring and effective collaboration across medical specialties will be increasingly important for early detection of ILD as novel anti-cancer therapies that are linked with ILD as an adverse effect become standard-of-care globally.

Article highlights  Interstitial lung disease (ILD) can occur in patients with cancer and may be drug induced (DI) or result from an alternative etiology, such as infection. In this SLR, a paucity of evidence of non-DI ILD was captured, highlighting the importance of close adherence to ILD diagnostic guidelines; namely, initiating prompt intervention to manage ILD until non-DI ILD etiologies have been ruled out. Here, we present an evidence synthesis on current approaches to ILD management and the impact of ILD on survival outcomes.
