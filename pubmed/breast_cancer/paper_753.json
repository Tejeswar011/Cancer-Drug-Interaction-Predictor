Unfortunately, ≈5% of 2 million fracture fixation devices in the US get infected, [  1 ] [  2  3 ] Staphylococcal [  4 ] Diagnosis and treatment of implant‐related infection can be challenging, and a combination of clinical, laboratory, and microbiological findings in conjunction with imaging studies is required to monitor such infection. Inexpensive hematologic tests for inflammation, such as C‐reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), can help to diagnose implant‐associated infection; [  5 ] [  6 ] Sensors at the implant surface, where the biofilm resides, would be expected to provide an earlier detection threshold and potentially the ability to monitor the infection during antibiotic treatment. Probing the local biochemistry and bacterial metabolism can also help researchers develop better biofilm‐targeting anti‐microbial therapies. In particular, low pH regions at the biofilm/substrate interface are believed to indicate persistent antibiotic‐tolerant biofilm regions (e.g., dormant bacteria with low oxygenation and poor vascular clearance of acidic byproducts, and potentially poor antibiotic delivery). [  7  8  9 ] [  10 ] [  11 ] [  12 ] We developed a pH sensor film and employed the X‐ray excited luminescence imaging (XELCI) technique [  13  14  15 ] Figure  1 [  16  17  18  19 ] [  20 ] 2 4 2+ [  21 ] [  22 ] [  23 ] Figure 1 Imaging pH near implant surfaces using XELCI. A) A schematic of a pH‐sensor‐coated titanium implant attached to a fractured bone. The sensor generates a pH‐dependent luminescence when irradiated by X‐rays. B) The Venn diagram shows how XELCI combines high spatial resolution from X‐rays and chemical sensitivity from indicator dyes at the implant surface for detecting local biochemistry during infection. The bone image was created by BioRender. 2 Results and Discussion Below, we describe the design of the sensor‐modified orthopedic implant for in vitro sensor characterization (Section 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.1 Sensor Design The implant was made from a piece of medical‐grade titanium sheet metal cut into a rectangular plate, and the sensor films were attached to the plate. A schematic of the implant is given in Figure  2 Figure 2 Sensor Design. A) Molecular structure of pH‐sensitive bromocresol green dye at high and low pH, respectively. Sensor schematic with B) side and C) top views. The sensor consists of a titanium plate completely covered with a scintillator layer and partially covered with a pH‐sensitive layer. The part of the scintillator film not covered by the pH‐sensitive layer is the reference region. D) Calibration curve of the signal intensity of the pH dye bromocresol green as a function of pH on the log scale. [Note: We found a typo in Fig. 2 dimensionshence attaching a revised Fig. 2 (minor correction) ‐would you please upload the attached Fig.2 and remove the current Fig. 2? Thank you.] The pH‐sensitive layer contains the pH dye bromocresol green (BCG) incorporated into a polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel. The BCG converts between a monoanionic structure with a yellow color at lower pH (when the OH group is protonated) to a dianionic structure with a blue color at higher pH upon deprotonation (Figure 2A S1 [  24 ] S1B + The pH sensor film is placed over the scintillator layer, so that it absorbs some of the scintillator luminescence in a pH‐dependent manner.

[  15 ] [  15 ] Here, we focus on the 11 and 0 mm of chicken tissue to show pH response and analyze the sensor spatial resolution through these thicknesses. An in‐depth characterization of the preliminary PEG sensor including spectra of the aqueous pH dye (bromocresol green), spectra of the pH dye in the gel matrix (PEG) of the sensor in addition to the signal attenuation of the sensor at different pH through different thickness of tissue, reversibility studies, sensor response time, pH range and leaching properties are discussed.

Direct wound irrigation is often used to remove biofilms and necrotic tissue with solutions delivered to the wound by gravity flow (1–2 psi), low‐pressure irrigation (5–10 psi), or high‐pressure irrigation (>20 psi). [  27 ] [  28 ] S2 −1 −1 2.1.3 Sensor Biocompatibility and X‐ray Dose The pH sensor was designed using biocompatible materials to minimize the toxicity associated with the leaching of the indicator dye, photoinitiator, and scintillator particles. The europium‐doped gadolinium oxysulfide (Gd 2 2 [  14 ] 2 2 2 [  29 ] 50 −1 50 [  29 ] The X‐rays are not expected to cause significant damage to tissue either. Based on radiochromic film measurements, we are applying a local surface/skin dose of 0.5 Gy/scan [  30 ] [  31 ] [  32 ] −1 [  33 ] −2 −2 −2 [  34 ] −2 [  35 ] [  36  37 ] 2.2 In Vitro Biofilm Formation Hunter et al. showed the pH heterogeneity in cultured biofilms using a fluorescent pH indicator with values ranging from pH 5.6 (within the biofilm) to pH 7.0 (bulk fluid). [  7 ] [  39  40 ] [  11 ] Since our goal was to measure the pH at the surface of a biofilm‐colonized implant, it was important to demonstrate that biofilms could grow upon the sensor surface. We thus studied the formation of biofilm on our sensor films by culturing bacteria with green fluorescent protein (GFP) encoding S. aureus S. aureus Staphylococcus epidermidis [  38 ] GFP S. aureus Figure  4 GFP S. aureus Figure 4 Confocal scanning laser microscopy images of biofilm grown on PEG sensor films after 24‐h incubation with GFP S. aureus 2.3 In Vivo Study For in vivo study, the PEG‐coated sensors were implanted in three adult New Zealand White rabbits. Rabbit 1 with PEG‐coated sensors (P‐R1) was a control with sterile saline inoculated in each leg over the implant surface. Rabbit 2 (P‐R2) was inoculated with 500 colony‐forming units (CFU) of S. aureus S. aureus 3 5E Figure 5 Example of a preliminary rabbit study with PEG‐coated sensor implants (P‐R3).

The retrieved implants (explants) were then tested for reversibility and visually inspected for any possible leaching of the dye. Tissue samples surrounding the implants were taken to confirm the presence of bacteria. Postmortem images (Figure 5F Based on the postmortem observations, it was observed that unlike vinyl‐PEG sensors used previously, tissue does not attach to these (PEG‐coated) implants, and more importantly, there was no observed leaching with the PEG‐coated (plate) implant sensors. In the case of rabbits where S. aureus Supporting Information 2.4.1 Postmortem Bacterial Count The tissue surrounding the implants was observed for signs of swelling, irritation, and the presence of pus to indicate infection. Abscesses were also observed in the tissue surrounding the implants. To confirm whether the infection was established or not, bacteria were cultured from the surrounding tissue samples, and the results are given in the table below. The recovered bacteria confirmed the presence of infection in the infected legs of P‐R2 and P‐R3 inoculated with 500 and 5000 CFU, respectively. Rabbit 3 inoculated with 5000 CFU did not develop severe illness, and the study demonstrated the safe use of this high inoculum. No bacteria were recovered from the control rabbit, P‐R1, and from the control legs of the infected rabbits, confirming the absence of hematogenous infection. We could not observe fluorescence from the GFP S. aureus Table  2 Table 2 Summary of bacteria recovered from tissue culture and retrieved implants for preliminary rabbit studies with the PEG‐coated sensors.

The PEG sensors did not seem to have any significant leaching and looked saturated with the dye. The sensors were tested immediately after retrieval for reversibility in pH 4 buffer and stored in the same buffer. The sensors were rinsed with water, followed by immersion in PBS, and photos taken at different time intervals as shown in Figure S5 2.4.3 Histology and Imaging Thermal images of both control and inoculated legs of the live rabbits were also taken using an FLIR One handheld thermal camera (Teledyne FLIR LLC, Wilsonville, OR) prior to euthanasia to see if there is a temperature difference in the control versus the infected leg (Figure S6 After euthanasia, the rabbit femurs (some with an implant attached and others without an implant) were stored in a freezer for microCT imaging and in formalin for histological examination. MicroCT was performed on control rabbit P‐R1, Right Femur (implant intact), and Left femur (implant detached) to look for any abnormalities in the bone structure. MicroCT images of the bone of P‐R1 and the attached implant are given in Figure  6 Figure 6 A) MicroCT imaging of the implant fixed on a rabbit femur (P‐R1, right leg) showing the imaging setup and different views from the reconstructed microCT images. B) Histology slides of control (left) and inoculated (right) implants retrieved from Rabbit 3 (P‐R3) showing sections of bone (cortex and cavity) and implant (metal plate, scintillator layer, and pH‐sensitive hydrogel). The following samples were preserved in formalin for preparation of histology slides: P‐R1 right femur, P‐R2 right femur, P‐R3 right and left femur. The prepared slides were stained using H&E (Haematoxylin and Eosin) stain, where eosin is an acidic dye and stains basic structures red or pink, while haematoxylin stains the acidic structures a purplish blue. The prepared slides are shown in Figure 6B S7 GFP S. aureus GFP S. aureus S. aureus 2.4.4 Long‐Term Biocompatibility Study A long‐term biocompatibility study was conducted by implanting the PEG hydrogel‐based sensors in two live rabbits (B‐R1 and B‐R2) for 80 days, followed by implant retrieval and biocompatibility evaluation. Histological examination was conducted to address gross and microscopic observations in tibial tissues from two adult New Zealand White rabbits following the periosteal implantation of two 5 mm titanium discs on each tibia: 1) a reference implant disc and 2) a sensor implant disc.

F‐G) Histology slides showing the two‐disc implants (pH sensor and reference implants) as well as sections of the bone (cortical bone and medullary cavity). Reactive new bone formation can be seen around the implant, indicating good biocompatibility of the implants. Additional images are shown in Figure S6 Sections of tibias, with in situ implants, were collected and immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Specimens were forwarded to the histology lab for processing and embedding in glycol methyl methacrylate so that titanium implants and associated coatings could be examined in situ with light microscopy to evaluate the biompatibility of the implants. Based on the pathology report, no abnormalities were observed in the cortical bone or the medullary cavity, and new bone formation was evident around the implant, indicating good biocompatibility of the implants as seen in Figure 7F,G Staphylococcus epidermidis S8 3 Conclusion The purpose of this study was to show proof of concept for XELCI imaging in live animals and to evaluate sensor performance and suitability, and to establish a protocol for future in vivo studies. The sensor‐modified orthopedic implant demonstrated promising results in terms of sensor design, calibration, mechanical integrity, biocompatibility, and in vivo testing. The sensor was found to be reversible and responded to pH changes within 5–30 min. The sensor was calibrated through tissue and demonstrated successful imaging through ≈1 cm of soft tissue in rabbit studies. In vitro biofilm formation was observed on the sensor films, with a biofilm coverage of 54% after 24 h. In vivo studies were conducted on rabbits, with the sensors implanted and inoculated with S. aureus Two levels of inoculum amounts were tested to establish a minimum concentration of inoculum required to successfully establish infection without proving to be fatal for the animal. A minimum inoculum of 5000 CFU was determined to be used for future inoculations to induce infection, as no fatality was observed. Since no bacteria was recovered from the control legs of the infected rabbits negating the concern of possible spread of infection from infected to non‐infected leg in the same animal, we can eliminate the use of a control animal (with both legs as control) for future studies and designation of one leg as non‐infected in each animal should suffice as control. The study with the vinyl sensor showed that we could image a change in absorption in vivo, although from the implant color postmortem, it was clear that we were imaging sensor leaching rather than a large pH change. For rabbits with the PEG‐coated implant (P‐R1, P‐R2, and P‐R3), no measurable leaching was observed over 10 days. There were clear signs of infection in P‐R2 and P‐R3, while by contrast, the tissue in the control rabbit (P‐R1) was completely healthy. However, we could not observe a clear pH change in the infected animals/legs. This may indicate that the pH did not fall at the implant surface, at least within the pH 3–6 range that the sensor can sense. Therefore, the PEG sensor used in this study will be optimized for increased sensitivity within the biological range of pH (pH 6.0–7.4) and used for further studies. The long‐term biocompatibility study indicated that the coated implants were well tolerated while implanted along the tibial periosteal surfaces of adult rabbits for 80 days. Most implants were partially encased in new bone formation, and there was no evidence of suppuration or inflammatory infiltrates in the sections examined microscopically. Overall, the results of this study provide a foundation for in vivo pH imaging near implanted medical devices. They provide protocols for infection, demonstrate the materials are biocompatible, and show the ability to image in vivo for long periods of time. These findings were the basis of additional animal studies in two Ph.D. dissertations [  41  42 ] 4 Experimental Methods XELCI Scanner Despite the light scattering through tissue, this XELCI study demonstrates a localized means of measuring chemical concentration at the implant surface with the use of a focused X‐ray beam that generates a small spot of light on a scintillator film. Figure  8 8B Figure 8 XELCI experimental setup. A) Photograph of the XELCI setup with a rabbit undergoing imaging under anesthesia. The sample region is positioned under the X‐ray beam using a laser cross beam (two red lines in the photo). B) Schematic drawing of the XELCI setup. The animal is placed on an x‐y‐z motorized stage, and the implanted sensor is irradiated with a focused X‐ray beam. The luminescence signal is transmitted via the light guide to two photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), measuring light intensity at 620 and 700 nm, respectively. The intensities and ratios are monitored as stage scans, with a real‐time image shown on the computer screen. Sensor Coated Orthopedic Implant The sensor‐coated orthopedic implant was prepared by coating a titanium plate with the two sensor layers, a bottom layer of scintillator particles (Gd 2 2 there was no fracture to simplify the model and to avoid unnecessary pain and discomfort to the animals To make a plate, titanium sheet metal, (0.020 inch thick Ti‐6Al‐4 V ELI, implant grade 6‐4 Titanium, M. Vincent & Associates, MN, USA) was cut into 18 × 6 mm plates, polished with 240 grit sand paper, rinsed with alconox detergent and water, and sonicated in acetone followed by ethanol for 15 min each. To attach the scintillator layer to the plate, silicone elastomer and curing agent (SYLGARD 184 Silicone Elastomer base and curing agent, Dow Corning, Midland, Michigan, United States) were mixed in 10:1 (w/w) ratio and ≈8.0 µm diameter Gd 2 2 The pH‐sensitive film was synthesized and placed over the scintillator layer. The pH‐sensitive film consisted of a PEG hydrogel with BCG dye (pH range 3–6) ≈200 µm thick. The hydrogel film consisted of a solution containing 79% (w/w of sol.) 700 MW polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), 9.9% (w/w of sol.) glycerol, 9.9% (w/w of sol.) water, 0.8% (w/w of sol.) photo initiator (2,2‐dimethoxy‐2‐phenylacetophenone) and 0.4% (w/w of sol.) bromocresol green (pH‐indicating dye). This mixture was stirred on a magnetic plate for 30 min, and the resulting solution was polymerized as follows: The polymerizable hydrogel solution was drop‐coated and sandwiched between two clean coverslips and cured under UV light for 2 min. The films were immersed in water to swell and delaminate from the coverslips and washed several times before being cut into 14 × 6 mm pieces. This PEG hydrogel was glued onto the scintillator layer (cured on the titanium plates) using superglue. Sensor Calibration To measure the attenuation of the scintillator emission signal by the pH dye, the sensor (a piece of pH film covered by scintillator film), immersed in standard buffer solution, was placed on the stage of an inverted microscope (DMI 5000, Leica Microsystems, Germany) and irradiated with a focused X‐ray beam. The pH modulated emission of the scintillator film was collected by a 5X objective lens and focused on a spectrometer (DNS 300, DeltaNu, Laramie, WY, USA), equipped with a cooled CCD camera (iDUS‐420BV, Andor, South Windsor, CT, United States). Spectra were collected for each pH after immersing the pH film in the respective buffers. For sensor caibration using XELCI without tissue, the 3D printed holder containing 5 pH sensor discs (in pH buffers 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) and a reference disc as well as a reference strip was placed on top of a 5 mm thick piece of chicken tissue wrapped in plastic and scanned from the top using XELCI. For sensor calibration through tissue, the XELCI imaging was repeated by covering the top of the sensor discs with an 11 mm‐thick slice of chicken breast tissue. From the data, calibration curves could be plotted showing peak ratio and intensity versus pH. Mechanical Integrity for Irrigation and Debridement The PEG hydrogel film was tested for simulation of high‐pressure irrigation during irrigation and debridement (I&D) by placing it under running tap water and increasing the water flow to maximum. The flow of water was determined by measuring the amount of time required to fill a 1000 mL beaker at a given flow. Confocal Imaging of Biofilm on Sensor pH indicating sensor films (PEG hydrogel) were fixed to well trays using agarose. A GFP S. aureus In Vivo Studies All in vivo studies were conducted on the New Zealand White Rabbits with an ideal weight of 4–5 kg and 25–30 weeks old so that they would have at least 1 cm of soft tissue covering the femur. One leg of the animal was kept as a control (no inoculation), and one leg was infected. Surgery was performed by the Clemson University veterinarian, and all animal studies were conducted at the Clemson University Godley‐Snell Research Center after approval of the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Animal anesthesia during imaging and euthanasia at termination was also administered by the Godley‐Snell Research Center staff. Implantation and Inoculation The prepared orthopedic device was implanted in the rabbit femur. For each hind leg of the animal, a 2 cm incision was made and the implant was attached to the femur with either medical glue (cyanoacrylate), and the incision was closed with sutures. Inoculation was done during surgery after fixation of the implant on the bone. The implant and surrounding tissue were inoculated with either 500 or 5000 CFU of S. aureus S. aureus was cultured in tryptic soy broth for 18 h prior to experiments. Bacteria on implant surfaces were detached by submerging the explants in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) and subjecting them to an ultrasound water bath at 40 kHz for 5 min. The recovered bacteria were serially diluted and plated on tryptic soy agar for enumeration. Soft tissue from the area surrounding the implant was placed in pre‐weighed 50 mL sterile centrifuged tubes. These tubes were then weighed again to determine the weight of the recovered soft tissue. 4 mL PBS was added to each tube, and tissues were homogenized (Bio‐Gen PRO200 Homogenizer, VWR) on ice using the maximum setting for 30 s or until they appeared homogenized. They then sat on ice for 5 min to yield supernatant. The supernatant was serially diluted and plated on a tryptic soy agar plate for enumeration. Imaging After surgery, plain X‐rays were taken, under isoflurane, and a preliminary XELCI image was taken of each leg. The implant pH was imaged in vivo using our novel imaging modality, X‐ray excited luminescence chemical imaging (XELCI), at least three times per week for two weeks. The scanning process and signal processing are explained in our other publications. [  13  15  43 ] Termination and Postmortem After two weeks, rabbits were euthanized with commercial euthanasia solution, and a terminal 5 mL blood sample was obtained. Postmortem studies included retrieval of the implanted sensors, visual inspection of the implant and surrounding tissue, culturing of bacteria from the surrounding tissue, and confirming reversibility of the retrieved pH sensor films. The rabbit femurs (some with an implant attached and others without an implant) were stored in a freezer for microCT imaging and in formalin for histological examination. MicroCT (MicroCT SkyScan 1176, Bruker, MA, USA) scans were done at 35 µm resolution with a source voltage of 80 kV and current 313 µA. Long‐Term Biocompatibility Study Titanium discs cut into 5 mm diameter were used as the implants and coated with the scintillator layer prepared as described in the Experimental Section under the heading “Sensor Calibration”. Half of the implants were subsequently attached with a layer of PEG hydrogel loaded with bromocresol green indicator (as described in the Experimental Section under the heading “Mechanical Integrity for Irrigation and Debridement”) using super glue (Loctite, Henkel Corporation, CT). A droplet of the glue was spread on the PDMS, and the PEG hydrogel film was pressed onto the PDMS for ≈2 min to attach. The reference implants without the PEG sensor coating served as spectral references so that tissue effects on the spectrum could be established. To image the scintillator‐coated discs in a live rabbit, we placed the rabbit in an IVIS Lumina‐XR imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA, USA) along with a miniature X‐ray source (mini‐X‐ray tube, Ag target, Amptek Inc., MA, USA). The radioluminescence images were acquired in bioluminescence mode while the X‐ray was turned on, as described previously in ex vivo tissue [  44  45 ] [  22 ] The prepared reference and sensor implants were sterilized by incubation in 2% glutaraldehyde for 8 h and then rinsed with sterilized water three times and saved in sterilized PBS. Both a reference disc and a sensor disc were implanted on the tibia of each leg of two rabbits. Rabbit 1 was a complete control animal, whereas infection was introduced on the left leg of Rabbit 2. To introduce infection in one implant, 3 µL of PBS containing 6 × 10 5 Staphylococcus epidermidis Histological Examination Following implantation for 80 days, the biocompatibility study rabbits were humanely euthanized, and tibial specimens with the implants were collected and immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. Subsequently, specimens were forwarded to the CUBEInc histology laboratory where they were processed, embedded in glycol methyl methacrylate, and cut‐ground into histologic sections ≈80–100 µm in thickness using the Exakt system. Sections were stained with Methyl‐Blue basic Fusion and forwarded to Research Pathology Associates, LLC, Clemson, SC, for examination and reporting.
