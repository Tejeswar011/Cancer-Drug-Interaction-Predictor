Introduction Cancer is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality globally, significantly influenced by the intricate interactions of genetic, environmental, and metabolic factors that collectively lead to the reprogramming of normal cells into a state of uncontrolled growth and spread [ 1 2 3 4 5 Among urological malignancies, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and bladder cancer each exemplify the urgent need for improved molecular diagnostics. RCC, typified by its clear-cell subtype, frequently exploits hypoxia-driven factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), to secure an ample blood supply and support rapid tumor expansion [ 6 7 β 8 The release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) and members of the S100 family, has gained attention for their dual roles in creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment and activating innate sensors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) and receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) [ 9 10 In this review, we focus on describing the emerging evidence for GDF15, VEGF, TGF- β Limitations Other angiogenesis- and DAMP-related molecules (for example IL-33 and calreticulin), as well as immunoregulatory markers with recognized clinical relevance (e.g., PD-L1), were not reviewed in detail in the present manuscript. Their exclusion indicates the intentional limitations in scope and length of this focused review, rather than any deficiency in biological or clinical importance. We recognize these markers as significant candidates for future reviews and systematic investigations. 2. Background on Renal and Bladder Cancers 2.1. Renal Cancer RCC represents a significant and growing public health challenge, accounting for approximately 3–5% of all adult malignancies [ 11 12 13 11 14 15 16 17 18 19 β 2.2. Bladder Cancer According to the GLOBOCAN 2022 study, bladder cancer is ranked as the ninth most commonly diagnosed cancer, with 613,791 incidents and over 3 times the amount in men compared to women. Additionally, it ranks as the 13th leading cause of cancer-related mortality in both sexes [ 12 20 21 22 23 β 3. Cancer Microenvironment and Associated Molecular Factors 3.1. Tumor Microenvironment—Associated Factors with Pro-Angiogenic and Immunosuppressive Activity The serum macrophage inhibitory cytokine–1 (MIC-1) or GDF15 is a product of cells which is a part of the transforming growth factor (TGF- β β 24 25 26 27 28 29 Every of the previously mentioned factors plays a significant role in tumor development and growth. The GDF15 has been mentioned to play both anti-tumorigenic and protumorigenic role, but the VEGF has been identified as having a specific role in tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, the MIC-1 factor was pointed out to be at higher levels in breast cancer cells, pancreatic, gastric, and colorectal cancer cells [ 30 31 32 33 34 VEGF functions as a pro-angiogenic factor in the body, facilitating the formation of new blood vessels, which can contribute to cancer growth and expansion. It includes several isoforms: VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, and VEGF-E, the latter of which is associated with parapoxvirus Orf and placenta growth factor [ Figure 1 35 α α 36 37 VEGF plays a crucial role in various types of cancer. For instance, one of them is breast cancer, where one of the studies showed that VEGF alongside other factors can induce cancer cells stemness [ 38 39 There is also cytokine, that nature has not strictly assigned to tumor suppressive or tumor promoting mechanisms.

Danger Signals: Molecular Patterns of Damage in Cancers DAMPs are molecules released by necrotic or simply damaged cells, which then start the immunological response. By binding to the pattern recognition receptor (PRR), these molecules can stop further breakage by inhibiting damaging factors and initiating healing processes [ 50 β Figure 2 51 52 DAMPs that have garnered increasing attention in the cancer research domain in recent years include the S100 protein family, the heat shock protein (HSP) family, and HMGB1 [ 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 Another member of the DAMP family that is worth mentioning is the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) group. The increased expression of HSP90 is initiated by the activation of corresponding genes in response to heat stress [ 67 68 α α β 69 70 71 72 73 Among the DAMP list, we identified S100A9 protein as an additional subject requiring examination. This protein is part of the S100 leukocyte proteins family, which can be secreted by immune cells, such as monocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and activated macrophages, especially during damaging processes and inflammation, whereas in healthy circumstances, the levels of such proteins are persisting at lower levels [ 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 κ β 83 4. Molecular and Cellular Factors Shaping the Cancer Microenvironment in Kidney and Bladder Tumors 4.1. GDF15 in RCC Few research papers, particularly original studies, address the relationship between GDF15 and RCC. In recent studies, it has been observed in animal models that GDF15 serum levels increase after cisplatin administration, a highly nephrotoxic drug, thus bringing up the supposition that this factor can play a significant role as a nephrotoxicity marker during cisplatin treatment [ 84 85 86 4.2. VEGF in RCC The treatment of RCC with anti-VEGF medicines, such as bevacizumab, a VEGF-A neutralizing antibody, has been known for years, due to their potential as therapeutic agents [ 87 88 + 89 4.3. TGF-β in RCC TGF- β 90 91 92 93 β β β β β β β 94 In another comprehensive study, Takahara et al. demonstrated that TGF- β β β β β β β β 95 4.4. HSP90 in RCC In the context of DAMPs, particularly HSP90 in ccRCC serves as a significant molecular chaperone and an immunologically active DAMP that affects tumor progression and the microenvironment. Comprehensive research analysis of TCGA data managed by Liao et al. revealed that among the HSP families, HSP90B1 is one of eight members significantly upregulated in tumor vs. normal kidney tissue. It is a key component of a six-gene prognostic signature (HSPA8, HSP90B1, HSPA7, HSPA12B, HSPA4L, HSPA1L) that stratifies patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct overall survival outcomes. Elevated HSP90B1 expression is clinically associated with advanced tumor stages and reduced survival, highlighting its role in promoting aggressive ccRCC phenotypes. Functionally, HSP90 family members facilitate ccRCC cell proliferation, invasion, and metastatic potential, as confirmed by in vitro assays, while bioinformatic characterization of the “high-risk” subgroup—marked by HSP90B1 overexpression—demonstrates an immunosuppressive microenvironment: increased infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs), higher PD-L1-positive immune cell counts, and altered cytokine profiles that collectively suppress anti-tumor immunity. This dual role—chaperoning oncogenic client proteins (e.g., HIF-1 α κ 96 Inhibition of HSP90 can also be observed as major step in treatment of another renal tumor, specifically papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC). In the realm of kidney cancer, particularly PRCC, the multifaceted role of HSP90 has garnered significant attention. Research by Pahwa et al. demonstrated that HSP90 inhibition, using the specific inhibitor SNX2112, elicits potent anti-tumor effects in PRCC models, evidenced by the induction of apoptosis, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and suppression of oncogenic pathways such as PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK1/2. Beyond its well-established intracellular chaperone functions, HSP90 is capable of stimulating immune responses when released extracellularly. Although the study primarily focuses on intracellular mechanisms, the established immunogenic properties of HSP90 suggest that its inhibition may also modulate the tumor microenvironment in PRCC, potentially enhancing anti-tumor immunity alongside direct tumor cell suppression. This dual functionality underscores HSP90’s therapeutic significance and highlights the need for further exploration into how its role as a DAMP could inform innovative immunotherapeutic strategies for PRCC and other renal malignancies [ 97 4.5. HMGB1 in RCC There is limited evidence available regarding the correlation between HMGB1 and RCC. A comprehensive search can yield valuable discoveries, such as those made by Solakhan et al. In this study, they demonstrated that urinary HMGB1 is markedly elevated in patients with RCC compared both to healthy controls and to subjects with benign urinary tract infections (median 147.15 vs. 24.8 and 39.45 pg/mL, respectively; p p p p 98 4.6. S100A9 in RCC Few studies elucidate the relationship between the S100A9 protein and RCC. An observational study by Koh et al. involving a cohort of 152 patients (294 evaluable tumor cores) with ccRCC provides significant insights into this connection. The study found high S100A9 expression in 37 cores, which correlated strongly with advanced T stage ( p p p p κ n 99 The comprehensive research by Zhang et al. demonstrated that S100A9 is significantly overexpressed in the serum and tumor tissues of patients with early-stage (T1a) RCC when compared to benign renal lesions and healthy controls. Quantitative proteomics (iTRAQ) and mRNA analyses revealed that S100A9 levels rise in parallel with tumor stage, implicating its involvement in the transition from localized to more advanced disease. Immunohistochemical validation confirmed strong S100A9 staining within RCC cells, underscoring its potential utility as a non-invasive biomarker for early detection. S100A9’s capacity to interact with RAGE and TLR4 receptors on tumor and myeloid cells indicates its role in fostering a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. This interaction promotes leukocyte recruitment, MAPK activation, and the suppression of anti-tumor immunity, thereby facilitating the progression and metastasis of RCC. Taken together, these findings position S100A9 not only as a sensitive indicator of RCC presence and stage but also as a major link between DAMP-mediated inflammation and renal tumor biology, making it a promising target for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in RCC [ 100 Figure 3 4.7. GDF15 in Bladder Cancer Bladder cancer remains one of the most common cancer types among the world population, both men and women combined [ 101 102 4.8. VEGF in Bladder Cancer In addition to GDF15, factors such as VEGF have been associated with bladder cancer. Notably, in recent years, an interesting study by Ayati et al. investigated this connection by assessing VEGF levels in serum and urine from 46 bladder cancer patients and 38 healthy controls. Their findings revealed no significant difference in serum VEGF concentrations across control (478.7 pg/mL), low-grade (518.4 pg/mL), and high-grade (648.1 pg/mL) groups ( p p 103 104 A detailed observational study was conducted by Bardowska et al., which provided evidence that urinary VEGF, among other biomarkers, plays a potentially significant role in stratifying the risk of recurrence and progression in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) following transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Urinary VEGF concentrations were significantly higher in patients who experienced disease recurrence or progression compared to those who remained tumor-free, with a p 105 There was also interesting research provided by Ponukalin et al., who observed simultaneous assessment of Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) and several growth factors and mediators of cell growth, including VEGF and TGF- β β β β β β β 104 4.9.

HSP90 in Bladder Cancer Research on certain DAMP’s has introduced many new developments regarding the relationship between HSP90 and bladder cancer. The research by Song et al. offered a comprehensive analysis of immunogenic cell death (ICD) in bladder cancer, highlighting the crucial function of HSP90AA1 in influencing the tumor immune microenvironment. By classifying 403 bladder cancer patients from the TCGA database into two ICD-based molecular subtypes, the authors demonstrated that patients with a high ICD score exhibited poorer survival, distinct immune profiles, and reduced responses to immunotherapy. Among the differentially expressed genes, HSP90AA1 emerged as uniquely upregulated in both high-ICD score tumors and in bladder cancer tissues compared to normal controls. High expression of HSP90AA1 was significantly associated with reduced disease-free survival, suggesting a link between its expression and aggressive tumor behavior. Intriguingly, HSP90AA1 was enriched in CD4 + 108 A recent study examining a pan-cancer perspective identifies HSP90B1 as a significant molecular chaperone involved in the progression of various malignancies, including bladder urothelial carcinoma. The authors demonstrated that HSP90B1 expression is significantly elevated in bladder cancer tissues compared to normal counterparts at both mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, high HSP90B1 expression in bladder urothelial carcinoma correlates with poor overall survival and disease-free survival, indicating its potential as a prognostic biomarker. Immunohistochemical data confirm cytoplasmic overexpression of HSP90B1 in bladder tumors, reinforcing its functional involvement in tumor pathophysiology. From an oncological perspective, HSP90B1 supports cancer progression by stabilizing oncogenic client proteins and participating in cellular stress responses, particularly endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis—functions that align with the canonical role of DAMPs in sustaining tumor cell survival under hostile microenvironmental conditions. Functional enrichment analysis of HSP90B1-interacting proteins revealed its integration into pathways regulating apoptosis, immune modulation, and ER stress, further suggesting its dual role in promoting oncogenesis and modulating anti-tumor immune responses. The involvement of HSP90B1 in immune cell infiltration, particularly its association with cancer-associated fibroblasts, underscores its broader influence on the tumor microenvironment. Taken together, these findings suggest that HSP90B1 may act as a pro-tumoral signaling and immune evasion molecule in bladder cancer. As such, it represents a promising therapeutic target and biomarker, warranting further investigation in the context of bladder cancer biology and treatment resistance. Two of the previously mentioned analyses show HSP90 family members associate with specific immune/inflammatory tumor microenvironments and with particular molecular subtypes. Extracellular HSP90 can reflect general cellular stress or immunogenic cell death rather than tumor-specific secretion, so comorbid inflammatory states could complicate interpretation. Reporting tumor-subtype specific performance is therefore important [ 108 109 4.11. HMGB1 in Bladder Cancer HMGB1 is another DAMP considered in the evaluation of its role in bladder tumors. Singh et al. analyzed tumor tissues and patient serum, demonstrating that HMGB1 is significantly upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels in cancerous tissues compared to adjacent normal urothelium, implicating it in tumorigenic processes. Immunohistochemical staining revealed concurrent overexpression of HMGB1, RAGE, Beclin-1, and LC3, indicating an activated autophagic pathway within tumor cells, while p62 expression was downregulated, reflecting autophagic flux. These molecular alterations suggest that HMGB1 not only marks cellular stress and damage but may actively participate in autophagy-mediated tumor survival and progression. Importantly, serum HMGB1 levels were markedly higher in UBC patients and showed a positive correlation with tumor stage and tissue expression, underscoring its potential as a circulating DAMP capable of reflecting the tumor’s inflammatory and metabolic state. However, the study was small and cross-sectional (30 patients, 30 controls, limited tissue sample numbers for some assays), which constrains generalizability and prevents assessment of diagnostic performance over time or after treatment. Further large-scale and longitudinal studies are warranted to validate these findings and explore HMGB1 as a biomarker-integrated target in bladder cancer management [ 110 Benlier et al. conducted an accurate study where they underscored the critical role of HMGB1 in bladder cancer. Significantly elevated urinary HMGB1 levels were observed in patients with bladder cancer compared to both healthy controls and those with urinary tract infections, indicating HMGB1’s potential as a discriminative marker. Importantly, HMGB1 concentrations correlated positively with tumor aggressiveness—patients with high-grade tumors, muscle-invasive disease, multifocal lesions, and larger tumor diameters (≥3 cm) exhibited markedly higher urinary HMGB1 levels. These findings suggest that HMGB1 secretion reflects not only tumor presence but also its biological behavior and invasiveness. From a diagnostic perspective, the study reported a urinary HMGB1 cut-off value of 63.3 pg/mL to differentiate bladder cancer from urinary tract infections, with a specificity of 77% and sensitivity of 59%, and an AUC of 0.813 against healthy controls—supporting its clinical potential. Notably, the highest HMGB1 levels were detected in patients presenting with concurrent high-grade, muscle-invasive, large, and multifocal tumors, highlighting its utility in risk stratification. Nevertheless, the sample was modest and from a single institution; sensitivity and specificity estimates were not validated in an independent cohort. The authors themselves note the need for larger, controlled, multicenter validation before clinical application. Given these multifaceted roles, HMGB1 emerges as a biomarker and a therapeutic target in bladder cancer. Benlier et al. compared urinary HMGB1 in bladder cancer vs. UTI very explicitly and found overlapping values, highlighting that infections and other inflammatory uropathies can raise HMGB1, and thus, reduce specificity; Singh et al. further showed tissue/serum correlations but emphasized the need for controls with benign inflammatory conditions. Therefore, future studies should include UTI/inflammatory control arms and adjust for markers of systemic inflammation [ 110 111 The pan-cancer analysis conducted by Guan et al. showed the central role of HMGB1 in the progression and prognosis of various malignancies. In the context of bladder cancer, elevated HMGB1 expression also correlates with advanced tumor stages and poor patient outcomes. The study emphasized that HMGB1 not only serves as a biomarker for disease progression but also actively participates in modulating the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, inhibiting HMGB1 function could disrupt its role in tumor-promoting pathways, thereby enhancing the efficacy of existing treatments and improving patient survival rates. The comprehensive insights provided by this study advocate for further investigation into HMGB1-targeted therapies in bladder cancer management [ 112 4.12. S100A9 in Bladder Cancer The final DAMP of interest is S100A9, which has been the subject of various studies. The study by Wang et al. highlighted the significant role of S100A9 in the progression and prognosis of bladder cancer. Through comprehensive analyses, including single-cell sequencing and functional assays, the research delineated the overexpression of S100A9 in MIBC compared to NMIBC. This overexpression correlates with enhanced tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suggesting that S100A9 contributes significantly to the aggressive phenotype observed in MIBC. The study’s findings also indicate that S100A9 may serve as a valuable prognostic biomarker, with its expression levels potentially guiding clinical decisions regarding patient management and therapeutic approaches. Further experiments demonstrated that reducing S100A9 expression impairs tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness, pointing to its viability as a therapeutic target [ 113 Verma et al. conducted a study that identified S100A9 as a significant gene linked to the progression and prognosis of bladder cancer. Through integrated bioinformatics analyses of multiple gene expression datasets, S100A9 emerged among seven key genes differentially expressed between non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive bladder cancer specimens. Higher expression levels of S100A9 were observed in muscle-invasive bladder cancer tissues compared to non-muscle-invasive forms, indicating its role in tumor advancement. Consequently, tumor invasiveness and subtype significantly influence the levels of this biomarker, which should be considered when evaluating diagnostic specificity. Further validation using quantitative real-time PCR in various bladder cancer cell lines confirmed the elevated expression of S100A9, particularly in those representing advanced disease stages. Survival analyses indicated that increased S100A9 expression correlates with poorer overall survival, underscoring its potential as a prognostic biomarker. These findings highlight S100A9s involvement in bladder cancer pathogenesis and its promise as both a diagnostic and prognostic marker [ 114 Figure 4 Although each marker has some diagnostic or prognostic value individually, the reviewed evidence suggests that combinations are more promising. For bladder cancer, urinary HMGB1 plus VEGF appears particularly attractive, since they capture complementary processes and both are measurable in urine. Adding TGF- β β Table 1 4.13. Barriers to Clinical Implementation Translation of biomarkers into routine clinical practice faces several non-biological but critical barriers. First, assay standardization and pre-analytical variability are major obstacles: different platforms (ELISA vs. multiplex immunoassay vs. mass spectrometry), choice of capture/detection antibodies, sample type (serum, plasma, urine), processing time, and storage conditions can produce systematic differences in measured concentrations and limit comparability between studies. Second, the reproducibility across laboratories is often unproven; few studies report inter-laboratory coefficients of variation or use reference materials that would enable unification. Third, threshold variability and population effects (age, co-morbidity, renal function, inflammation) mean that cut-offs derived in a single center may not generalize to other patient groups. Fourth, cost affects clinical uptake: an assay that is expensive requires specialized equipment is less likely to be adopted for screening or routine surveillance. Ultimately, regulatory and clinical-utility demonstration demands prospective, multicenter studies showing not only association with disease but other clinical benefits (e.g., improved diagnosis, decision making, or patient outcomes). For our six markers, these barriers translate to specific requirements: assay unification and reporting of analytical performance, pre-specified cut-off derivation in large, diverse cohorts, head-to-head comparisons using the same sample sets, and economic analyses of implementation. In addition to analytical and clinical barriers, future implementation of biomarkers must be evaluated in terms of cost-effectiveness in real-world screening and surveillance programs. For bladder cancer, the greatest potential lies in reducing the need for repeated cystoscopies in low- and intermediate-risk patients. Even modest sensitivity improvements, if coupled with lower cost and non-invasiveness, could make urine-based biomarker panels economically favorable at the population level. For renal cancer, where imaging remains the standard, biomarkers could be tested as triage tools to reduce unnecessary imaging in high-risk cohorts. Formal health-economic models are, therefore, required to assess the balance between assay cost, diagnostic performance, and downstream healthcare savings. Another factor to consider is the impact of systemic treatments on biomarker dynamics. VEGF and TGF- β β 5. Conclusions This review synthesizes current experimental and clinical evidence indicating that pro-angiogenic mediators and damage-associated molecular patterns represent complementary domains in biomarker research for urological malignancies. VEGF and TGF- β The accumulated data indicate several practical insights. Firstly, fluid-based measurements—notably urinary HMGB1 and urinary VEGF in bladder cancer and serum or tissue assessments of GDF15, HSP90, and S100A9 in renal tumors—provide viable, minimally invasive opportunities to complement imaging and histopathology. Secondly, single analyses provide useful biological insight but often lack adequate accuracy alone; combined assessments of angiogenic, immunomodulatory, and damage-associated markers yield greater discriminatory and prognostic value. Thirdly, the biological roles of these factors are context-dependent: TGF- β Despite promising signals, important barriers remain before routine clinical adoption. Heterogeneity across tumor subtypes and patient comorbidities, variability in assay platforms and pre-analytical handling, and the predominance of retrospective, single-center series limit generalization. Critical needs include harmonization of laboratory methods, definition of clinically meaningful thresholds, validation of marker performance in prospectively collected, multicenter cohorts, and careful evaluation of intra-individual longitudinal variability during treatment and follow-up. Future work should pursue two mutually reinforcing paths. Future studies must clarify causal links—for example, how modulation of GDF15 influences ferroptosis in ccRCC, or how extracellular HSP90 and HMGB1 alter antigen presentation and local immune composition. Simultaneously, well-designed prospective clinical studies and interventional trials should test whether integrated biomarker assessment can improve detection of early or recurrent disease, refine risk stratification between indolent and aggressive phenotypes, and guide therapeutic choices (including strategies that target angiogenesis, immune suppression, or stress-response pathways). Importantly, the development of validated, clinically applicable multi-marker panels combined with standard imaging offers the most promising route to translate these molecular insights into patient benefit. In summary, angiogenic mediators and DAMP-related factors provide complementary, biologically grounded information about urological tumors. They hold substantial promise as adjuncts to current diagnostic and monitoring pathways, but their clinical value will depend on rigorous standardization and prospective validation. Only through such coordinated translational efforts these biomarkers can move from exploratory studies to reliable tools that improve outcomes for patients with renal and bladder cancer.
