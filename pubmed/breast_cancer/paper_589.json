However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. We aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms of Hyp in the treatment of NSCLC using a combination of network pharmacology and in vitro experiments. Methods Active targets of Hyp and NSCLC-related targets were identified using public databases. The therapeutic targets were predicted based on the intersection of drug and disease targets. A protein–protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING and Cytoscape, and key network modules and targets were identified through network topology analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed using DAVID. Molecular docking between Hyp and therapeutic targets was performed using AutoDock Vina software. These results were further verified by in vitro experiments of A549 cell lines, including the CCK-8 assay, EdU staining, flow cytometry and western blotting. Results A total of 30 therapeutic targets of Hyp against NSCLC were identified. Analysis of the PPI network revealed a key network module and five key targets: MMP9, CASP3, MAPK1, ESR1, and EGFR. These targets were related to cell proliferation and migration, apoptosis, and oxidative stress and may play a role through the FoxO, MAPK, Rap1, Ras, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Molecular docking results showed a strong binding affinity between Hyp and most therapeutic targets. Further experiments confirmed that Hyp inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of A549 cells by regulating the EGFR/ERK/FOXO1 signaling pathway. Conclusions Hyp may be a promising drug for treating NSCLC (especially lung adenocarcinoma), and its therapeutic mechanisms is closely related to the regulation of EGFR/ERK/FOXO1 pathway.

Meanwhile, compared to traditional chemotherapy drugs, traditional Chinese medicines possess fewer adverse reactions and lower drug resistance [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Traditional methods for screening the pharmacological activities of natural monomer components are often achieved by cell experiments or Qualcomm’s method. However, these research methods are time-consuming and expensive, and their accuracy is closely related to the overall conditions of animal models or human bodies [ 11 12 13 1  Fig. 1 Detailed flowchart of this study Materials and methods Network pharmacological analysis Prediction of Hyp active targets The SMILE file and 3D structure file in SDF format of Hyp were downloaded using “hyperoside” as the keyword in PubChem [ 14 https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ 15 https://old.tcmsp-e.com/tcmsp.php 16 http://stitch.embl.de/ 17 http://www.lilab-ecust.cn/pharmmapper/ Acquisition of NSCLC disease targets NSCLC disease targets were collected using the keywords “non-small-cell lung cancer ” in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) [ 18 https://omim.org/ 19 http://db.idrblab.net/ttd/ 20 http://ctdbase.org/ 21 https://www.disgenet.org/ 22 https://www.uniprot.org/ Prediction of therapeutic targets of Hyp against NSCLC The active targets of Hyp and NSCLC disease targets were intersected using Venny (version 2.1.0) ( https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html Construction and analysis of PPI network STRING [ 23 https://string-db.org/ 24 25 26 GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses for the target proteins in the key network module were performed using Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [ 27 https://david.ncifcrf.gov/ p < Construction of “Hyp-Target-Pathway” network Firstly, the above obtained Hyp-target interaction relationships were constructed into a “Hyp-Target” network by Cytoscape, and then the corresponding relationships of target-pathway were built into a “Target-Pathway” network by the same way.

Despite the rapid development of medical technologies, the overall therapeutic effect on NSCLC remains unsatisfactory. Hyp is an important natural product that has attracted considerable attention in the medical field. Hyp, a flavonoid glycoside, complies with the five principles of Lipski, indicating that it has good pharmacokinetic properties [ 8 10 33 34 In this study, we identified 30 therapeutic targets using network pharmacology. After topological analysis of the PPI network, five key targets were identified: MMP9, CASP3, MAPK1, ESR1, and EGFR. These targets have a high degree value, indicating that they may play a crucial role in the mechanism of action of Hyp in the treatment of NSCLC. In addition, the results of the molecular docking analysis showed that Hyp had good binding activity with EGFR, MAPK1, and MMP9. The docking score between EGFR and Hyp was the lowest, indicating the highest binding affinity. EGFR is a cell surface receptor encoded by the ErbB1 gene, and its overexpression or abnormal activation is closely associated with the progression of NSCLC [ 35 36 37 38 39 40 34 41 42 Our GO enrichment analysis results showed that these potential targets were mainly involved in cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and oxidative stress, which were important factors influencing Hyp against NSCLC. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that FoxO and MAPK signaling pathways were closely related to the molecular mechanisms of Hyp against NSCLC. MAPK1, EGFR, and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor(IGF1R) were enriched in the FoxO and MAPK signaling pathways. Among these, MAPK1 and EGFR were key targets and showed satisfactory binding activity with Hyp. FOXO is a member of the forkhead transcription factor family, which includes four members: FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4, and FOXO6. They participate in many physiological and pathological processes such as apoptosis, the cell cycle, and DNA damage repair by regulating the expression of downstream genes [ 43 44 45 10 46 In this study, the potential relationship between Hyp and NSCLC was systematically analyzed by network pharmacology method. To test this hypothesis, we conducted several in vitro experiments. Because A549 cell line was the most widely used adenocarcinoma model in the research of NSCLC, our study chose this cell line as the experimental object, aiming at clarifying the molecular mechanisms of Hyp in the treatment of NSCLC. The CCK-8 assay showed that Hyp reduced the viability of A549 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We observed, through EdU staining, that Hyp effectively inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells and the EGFR activator NSC228155 attenuated this inhibition. We also found that after Hyp treatment, the apoptosis rate of A549 cells increased significantly, and the expression of Cleaved-Caspase-3 and Bax increased significantly, whereas the expression of Bcl-2 decreased significantly, indicating that Hyp could induce apoptosis in A549 cells. Notably, when Hyp and NSC228155 were used simultaneously, the apoptosis rate of A549 cells was significantly reduced. In addition, we studied the effect of Hyp on the EGFR/ERK/FOXO1 pathway using western blotting. The results showed that the ratios of p-EGFR/EGFR and p-ERK1/2/ERK1/2 decreased in A549 cells after Hyp intervention, suggesting that Hyp activates EGFR and ERK1/2 through protein phosphorylation. Following Hyp treatment, the expression level of FOXO1 in A549 cells increased significantly. However, NSC228155 counteracted these changes, indicating that Hyp upregulated FOXO1 expression by inhibiting the activities of EGFR and ERK1/2. Therefore, we believe that Hyp has the potential to treat NSCLC, primarily by regulating the EGFR/ERK/FOXO1 pathway to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells and induce the apoptosis of tumor cells. In this study, several key targets and promising signaling pathways were successfully identified through network pharmacology. However, due to the limitation of research funds, the multi-target and multi-pathway mechanism of Hyp in NSCLC has not been systematically verified by experiments. Our in vitro experiment only used A549 adenocarcinoma cell line, but failed to cover other subtypes of NSCLC, such as squamous cell carcinoma, which may lead to limited universality of the research conclusions. It is worth noting that although Hyp has shown remarkable therapeutic effects in vitro, several in vivo model studies are required to facilitate its clinical application. Conclusion In this study, we identified key targets and signaling pathways of Hyp in the treatment of NSCLC using a network pharmacology method. In addition, our in vitro experiments confirmed that Hyp inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis of lung adenocarcinoma cells through regulation of the EGFR/ERK/FOXO1 pathway. These findings indicate that Hyp is a promising and effective multitarget drug. Our findings also emphasize the critical role of network pharmacology in target screening and pathway prediction for drug development. However, the follow-up work needs to be extended to squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, such as H1703 and SK-MES-1, to verify the universality of this mechanism in different histological subtypes.
