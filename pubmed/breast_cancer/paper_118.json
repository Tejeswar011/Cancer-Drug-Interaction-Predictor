Early differentiation is fundamental in low-resource environments. Objective: The objective of this study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography compared with cytohistopathology in differentiating benign and malignant breast lesions. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Pakistan Health & Research Forum between July 2024 and January 2025. One hundred and twenty-five newly diagnosed cases of breast lesions that had been treated with both ultrasonography and cytohistopathology assessment were included. Parameters of diagnostic accuracy, such as sensitivity and specificity, predictive values, and accuracy, were determined. To test the view of agreement, the chi-square and the McNemar tests were employed. Results: Out of 125 participants (mean age: 43.8 with a standard deviation of 12.4 years), the histopathology of the tumor of 71 participants (56.8%) showed malignant lesions, and 54 participants (43.2%) had benign lesions. The sensitivity was 92.2 percent, specificity 96.7 percent, positive predictive value 96.7 percent, negative predictive value 92.2 percent, and diagnostic accuracy 94.4 percent. The results revealed a statistically significant correlation between malignancy and the increase in age (p < 0.001). There was a significant association in the chi-square test (p < 0.001) and in the McNemar test showing the diagnostic agreement (p = 0.453). Conclusion: Ultrasonography is highly reliable in terms of diagnostics and can be used as a first-line procedure when making a distinction between benign and malignant lesions in the breast, especially where histopathology is not readily available. It can also become a part of the clinical practice to improve early diagnoses and management. benign breast lesions breast cancer breast ultrasonography cytohistopathology diagnostic accuracy pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction Breast diseases can be classified into benign and malignant based on clinical, histological, and imaging modalities. Benign breast diseases are more common than their malignant counterparts [ 1 3 4 5 6 7 According to the latest research, the prevalence of breast cancer in Pakistan is estimated to be 31.5% and rising [ 4 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Early identification and characterization of breast lesions are important for guiding clinical management, especially in resource-poor environments [ 7 6 8 9 Materials and methods After obtaining ethical approval (PHRF/2024/2404), a comparative cross-sectional study was conducted on the utility of ultrasonography and cytohistopathology in the diagnosis of breast disease at Pakistan Health & Research Forum from July 2024 to January 2025. A sample size of 125 was calculated while maintaining 80% power of test and 5% level of significance. A 21.4% prevalence rate of breast cancer in women was expected [ 12 Ultrasounds of patients conducted on Aplio 300 (Canon Medical Systems Corporation, Tochigi, Japan) using a linear probe of 7.5 MHz were collected from the hospital’s radiology department. Likewise, the cytohistopathology samples, which were formalin-fixed tissue blocks stained with hematoxylin and eosin, were collected from patients in the pathology department with the corresponding MR number on the ultrasound report. The sensitivity and specificity of the ultrasound were assessed, keeping cytohistopathology as the gold standard. Statistical analysis IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26 (Released 2019; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States) was used to analyze data. Continuous data were represented by mean and standard deviation, and frequencies and percentages were applied to categorical data. Assessment of normality was performed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. An independent sample t-test was conducted for testing means between benign and malignant groups. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of the ultrasonography were calculated against the gold standard: cytohistopathology. The chi-square and McNemar tests were used for the assessment of the relationships between ultrasound and histopathology results. At < 0.05, p-values were considered to be statistically significant. Results A total of 125 patients participated in the study. The mean age was 43.8 + + + 1 Table 1 Independent Sample T-Test Results of Comparison of Mean Age Between Participants with Benign and Malignant Lesions Group Mean Age (Years) SD n T-statistic P-value Significance Benign Lesions 35.8 11.6 54 7.47 < 0.001 Significant Malignant Lesions 50.0 9.2 71 Most of the participants (45, 36.0%) were between 40 and 49 years, and 34 (27.2%) were between 30 and 39 years. The majority of patients lived in cities (79, 63.2%) and had at least an intermediate-level education (65, 52%). In terms of socioeconomic status, more than half (63, 50.4%) were in the middle-income bracket, 32 (25.6%) were in the low-income bracket, and 30 (24%) were in the high-income bracket. A total of 29 (23.2%) respondents had a family history of breast cancer. The majority of women were married (113, 90.4%) and parous (105, 84.0%), whereas 20 (16.0%) were nulliparous (Table 2 Table 2 Sociodemographic Characteristics of Study Participants (n = 125) Variable Categories Frequency (n) Percentage (%) Age (years) < 30 18 14.4 30–39 34 27.2 40–49 45 36.0 ≥ 50 28 22.4 Residence Urban 79 63.2 Rural 46 36.8 Educational Status Illiterate 21 16.8 Primary to Matric 39 31.2 Intermediate or Above 65 52.0 Socioeconomic Status Low 32 25.6 Middle 63 50.4 High 30 24.0 Family History of Breast Cancer Present 29 23.2 Absent 96 76.8 Marital Status Married 113 90.4 Unmarried/Widowed 12 9.6 Parity Nulliparous 20 16.0 Parous 105 84.0 Among the 125 patients who received a histopathological diagnosis, 71 (56.8%) had malignant lesions, and 54 (43.2%) had benign lesions. Invasive ductal carcinoma was reported as the malignant diagnosis in 61 patients (85.9%), and ductal carcinoma in situ and other malignancies were reported in seven patients each (7.0%). The most reported lesion in the benign group was fibroadenoma (23, 42.6%), followed by breast cysts (8, 14.8%), breast abscesses (6, 11.1%), and other benign lesions (17, 31.5%) (Table 3 Table 3 Distribution of Histopathological Lesion Types (n = 125) Lesion Type Frequency (n) Percentage (%) Benign Lesions Fibroadenoma 23 42.6% Breast Cyst 8 14.8% Breast Abscess 6 11.1% Other Benign Lesions 17 31.5% Total Benign Lesions 54 100.0% Malignant Lesions Invasive Ductal Carcinoma 61 85.9% Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) 5 7.0% Other Malignant Lesions 5 7.0% Total Malignant Lesions 71 100.0% Sixty-one patients had malignant signs according to the ultrasonographic assessment, and 64 had benign signs. The cross-referencing between the ultrasound and cytohistopathology indicated that in the diagnosis of the malignant and nonmalignant lesions, the true positive diagnosis was that of 59 malignant lesions, and the true negative diagnosis was that of 59 benign lesions. The percentage of false positives was 2% and that of false negatives was 5%, which corresponded to an overall diagnostic accuracy of 94.4%. The sensitivity of ultrasonography was 92.2%, the specificity was 96.7%, the PPV was 96.7%, and the NPV was 92.2% (Table 4 Table 4 Diagnostic Accuracy Indices of Ultrasonography (n = 125) Index Value (%) Sensitivity 92.2% Specificity 96.7% Positive Predictive Value 96.7% Negative Predictive Value 92.2% Accuracy 94.4% The chi-square test was statistically significant (p < 0.001), demonstrating consistency between the ultrasonography and cytohistopathology results. The McNemar test demonstrated no significant disagreement between paired diagnostic classifications (p = 0.453), indicating that two modalities were of high consistency (Table 5 Table 5 Diagnostic Performance of Breast Ultrasound Compared to Cytohistopathology (n = 125) Ultrasound Result (n = 125) Histopathology Malignant Histopathology Benign Chi-Square (χ²) P-Value McNemar’s Test P-Value Malignant (Positive) (n = 61) 59 (True Positive) 2 (False Positive) 106.74 < 0.001 0.453 Benign (Negative) (n = 64) 5 (False Negative) 59 (True Negative) Age-stratified analysis indicated that there was a significant association between an increase in age and the possibility of developing malignant lesions. In patients aged more than 50 years, malignant findings were present in 36 (90%) patients. In comparison, 10 malignancies were present in 14.1% of patients aged between 18 and 35 years. This correlation was statistically significant (width = 39.82, p < 0.001), indicating a strong dependence of the malignancy of breast lesions on age (Table 6 Table 6 Association of Age Groups With Malignancy Status Age Group (Years) Malignant (n = 71) Benign (n = 54) Total (n = 125) Chi-Square P-Value Significance 18–35 10 (14.1%) 38 (70.4%) 48 χ² = 39.82 < 0.001 Significant 36–50 25 (35.2%) 12 (22.2%) 37 > 50 36 (50.7%) 4 (7.4%) 40 Discussion Breast ultrasonography has become a valuable method for diagnosing breast lesions because it is noninvasive, cheap, and does not expose patients to harmful ionizing radiation. In this research, ultrasonography showed a sensitivity of 92.2%, a specificity of 96.7%, a PPV of 96.7%, an NPV of 92.2%, and a total diagnostic precision of 94.4%. Such results support its usefulness, especially to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions in the case of a resource-poor environment. Diagnostic accuracy has been discussed in the past, with diverse degrees of accuracy reported. In the meta-analysis by Zhang et al., the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 89% and 84%, respectively. These figures aligned to a large degree with the current analysis results [ 13 14 15 The sensitivity in the current study was high, indicating that ultrasonography is useful in screening and excluding malignancy. This was in line with Uematsu et al., who reported that real-time B-mode ultrasound can successfully identify malignant masses at a sensitivity level of 90% or more [ 16 17 18 The application of fine needle aspiration (FNAC) and cytohistopathology as confirmatory practices allowed stable contrast. The final description was fulfilled by histopathology as the gold standard and FNAC as a rapid cytological reproduction. Triple assessments involving clinical examination, imaging, and cytopathology are important for diagnosing breast diseases and remain the mainstay in this field [ 19 Although the current study, by using sampling covering various kinds of lesions and demographic groups, is based on a strong foundation, it has certain limitations. It is possible that its single-center design reduces its generalizability. Further, blinded interpretations of ultrasound were not conducted, which might have introduced bias. Moreover, the generalizability of ultrasonic findings beyond being operator-dependent must be acknowledged. A multicenter study should be conducted in the future while ensuring the blinding process for generalizability of findings with a larger sample size and by adding a comparison to the male gender. Nevertheless, the current study’s results can be added to the existing evidence base supporting the application of ultrasound in primary diagnostic settings, particularly settings where mammography or MRI is not available at high frequency [ 20 21 Conclusions Ultrasonography showed good sensitivity and fair specificity in the diagnosis of breast lesions, thus indicating its efficiency and convenience as a primary diagnostic method. Although cytohistopathology is still the gold standard for obtaining a definite diagnosis, some of the main benefits of ultrasound are that it is noninvasive, readily accessible, and economical. Additionally, it does not involve ionizing radiation, which is critical in resource-scarce settings and for vulnerable groups like pregnant/lactating women. Ultrasonography used in conjunction with clinical examinations and cytological assessments as a triple diagnostic modality majorly contributes to increasing patients’ confidence in the lesions’ diagnosis and management. Although its performance level is high, the problems of operator dependency and the similar appearance of malignant and benign lesions must be considered. A standardized imaging criterion and training should be offered to ensure a higher level of diagnostic accuracy. A multicentric study should be conducted in the future with more patients and broader populations to narrow down ultrasonographic criteria and formulate clear recommendations for whether and when ultrasonography can be used as an adjunct or alternative function in breast cancer diagnostic algorithms.
