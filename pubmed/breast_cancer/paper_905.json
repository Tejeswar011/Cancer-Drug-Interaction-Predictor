By combining AuNPs with light irradiation, PTT induces localized hyperthermia, triggering cancer cell death [ 19 20 21 Materials and methods This study evaluated the physiochemical properties and anticancer efficiency of Chaga extract, mycosynthesized gold nanoparticles (AuCh-NPs), and citrate-capped gold nanoparticles (AuCit-NPs) combined with photothermal therapy (530 nm LED irradiation) against the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Preparation of Chaga extract 0.5 g of Inonotus obliquus 19 Mycosynthesis of AuCh-NPs AuCh-NPs were synthesized by reducing 10 mL of 0.1 mM HAuCl 4 22 Synthesis of AuCit-NPs AuCit-NPs were chemically synthesized by boiling 5 mL of 0.01 M HAuCl 4 23 Characterization of synthesized nanoparticles UV–visible spectrophotometer Absorption spectra (200–800 nm) were recorded using a Cary-4000 spectrophotometer (PG instrument, UK) with distilled water as a blank [ 25 Fourier Transform-Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Functional groups were analyzed using a NICOLET 6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with KBr pellets (500–4000 cm −1 26 Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) Morphology and size were assessed using a JEOL JEM-1400 (Cairo University Research Park) [ 25 Zeta potential and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) Surface charge and hydrodynamic diameter were measured using Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments, UK). Hence, the diffusion behavior of molecules in nanoparticle solutions was detected by the Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) technique. Then, from their scattering pattern, the hydrodynamic radii were calculated based on the diffusion coefficient of Chaga extract, AuCh-NPS, and AuCit-NPs [ 27 Particle size analysis Nanoparticle sizes were determined via NanoSight NS500 (MalvernPanalytical) [ 19 Cell culture MCF-7 cells (National Centre Institute, Egypt) were cultured in RPMI-1640 (10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 10 µg/mL streptomycin; Gibco) at 37 °C/5% CO 2 19 LED irradiation conditions Cells were exposed to 530 nm LED (142 mW, 5 cm distance; irradiance: 0.181 W/cm 2 2 2 25 2 MTT assay Cell viability was evaluated using a standard MTT colorimetric assay. Briefly, MCF-7 Cells were treated with Chaga extract, AuCh-NPs, or AuCit-NPs at concentrations of 2, 4, 6, and 8 µM for 24 h. Following treatment, 0.5 mg/mL MTT reagent (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each well, and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 4 h in a 5% CO 2 15 Cell viability was calculated as: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\text{Cell viability }}\\left( {{1}00\\% } \\right) = \\left( {{\\text{ODS}}/{\\text{ODC}}} \\right) \\times {1}00 $$\\end{document} Wound healing assay Confluent monolayers of MCF-7 cells from all groups were scratched with a sterile 200 µL pipette tip (Thermo Scientific, USA).

The lysosomal activity was visualized depending on the detection of the acidic pH produced during the autophagy process using a fluorescence microscope (Thermo Scientific, USA) [ 31 Cell cycle arrest MCF-7 cells (10 5 32 Annexin V-FITC analysis Apoptosis and necrosis were quantified using Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) staining (Gibco, USA), respectively, followed by flow cytometry analysis. In viable cells, phosphatidylserine remains localized to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and therefore does not bind Annexin V (hydrophobic). During apoptosis, phosphatidylserine becomes externalized to the outer membrane, where it can be detected by Annexin V-FITC binding. For the assay, cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μL of incubation buffer (Gibco, USA). Then, 2 μL of Annexin V-FITC (1 mg/mL) was added to the test samples. Three control samples were prepared: unstained cells, cells stained with Annexin V-FITC only, and cells stained with PI only (1 mg/mL). Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry without prior washing. Viable cells were identified by negative staining for both Annexin V and PI. Apoptotic cells were Annexin V-positive/PI-negative, while necrotic cells were positive for both stains [ 33 RT-PCR Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The isolated RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Germany), and the resulting cDNA was stored at − 20 °C (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). mRNA expression levels of BCL2 and BAX mRNA were quantified by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) using QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Germany). Each 20 µL reaction mixture contained 3 µL of cDNA template, 10 µL of 2 × QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Germany), and 10 pmol of each gene-specific primer (Table 1 Table 1 Primer sequences for qRT-PCR Genes Primer sequences Annealing temperature BCL2 F: 5 ′ ′ 60 °C R: 5 ′ ′ BAX F: 5 ′ ′ 60 °C R: 5 ′ ′ GAPDH F: 5 ′ ′ 60 °C R: 5 ′ ′ The thermal cycling protocol consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 30 s. Final elongation was performed at 72 °C for 3 min using a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The cycle number was optimized to ensure amplification remained in the exponential phase and did not reach a plateau [ 33 Comet assay DNA damage in MCF-7 cells was evaluated using alkaline and neutral comet assays to detect single- and double-strand breaks, respectively. For slide preparation, a base layer was created using 1% Normal Melting Point Agarose (NMA; HiMedia RM273) dissolved in distilled water (500 mg in 50 mL). A top layer containing 0.5% Low Melting Point Agarose (LMA; Sigma A9414) was prepared in PBS (250 mg in 50 mL). Cell suspensions were mixed with 75 µL of LMA and 10 µL of either Chaga extract, AuCh-NPs, or AuCit-NPs, then layered onto pre-coated slides (Thermo Scientific, USA). After solidification, slides were immersed in a cold lysis solution (146.1 g NACL, 37.29 EDTA, 1.2 mM Tris, pH 10) for 2 h at 4 °C. For electrophoresis, alkaline conditions (pH > 13) used a buffer containing 300 mM NaOH and 1 mM EDTA, while neutral conditions (pH 7.5) employed a 0.4 M Tris buffer. Electrophoresis was performed at 20 V (300 mA) for 30 min in an electrophoresis chamber (Thermo Scientific, USA). Slides were then neutralized in 0.4 M Tris buffer (pH 7.5) for 15 min, dehydrated in cold 70% ethanol for another 15 min, and stained with 85 µL of ethidium bromide (10 µg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, USA). DNA damage was visualized using an epifluorescence microscope (Olympus CKX53 with CX50 camera, Japan) at 200 × magnification. A minimum of 100 nuclei per sample were analyzed in duplicate using Comet Score 2.0 software (Tritek Corp.) for both assay conditions [ 26 Statistical analysis All data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 23). Normality of data distribution was confirmed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Significant differences among groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post-hoc least significant difference (LSD) and Duncan's multiple range tests. A P Results The biological and physicochemical properties of Chaga extract, mycosynthesized AuCh-NPs, and chemically synthesized AuCit-NPs were evaluated against MCF-7 breast cancer cells in combination with LED irradiation (530 nm). Nanoparticle characterization UV–vis spectroscopy Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis revealed characteristic absorption peaks at 520 nm for AuCit-NPs and 525 nm for AuCh-NPs, while Chaga extract showed no distinct peak (Fig. 1 Fig. 1 UV–visible absorption spectra of Chaga extract (Ch), AuCh-NPs, and AuCit-NPs. The Chaga extract (blue line) shows no characteristic absorption peak, while both AuCh-NPs (orange line) and AuCit-NPs (red line) exhibit peaks at 525 nm and 520 nm, respectively FTIR analysis FTIR spectra identified functional groups involved in gold ion reduction (Fig. 2 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 Fig. 2 FTIR spectra showing characteristic peaks of functional groups in Chaga extract (black line), mycosynthesized AuCh-NPs (red line) and chemically synthesized AuCit-NPs (blue line). Key vibrational bands are labeled, demonstrating the involvement of fungal biomolecules in gold ion reduction and nanoparticle stabilization TEM analysis TEM was used to characterize the morphology and size distribution of nanoparticles. TEM analysis revealed predominantly spherical and rod-shaped nanostructures (Fig. 3 Fig. 3 TEM images show the morphology and size distribution of synthesized nanoparticle sizes for synthesized nanoparticles: a b Zeta potential Surface charge measurements showed.

LED irradiation alone caused minimal changes (87.30% G0/G1, 11.04% S phase), confirming its mild photothermal effect. However, combined treatments demonstrated pronounced cell cycle arrest; Chaga extract with LED irradiation increased G0/G1 population to 87.30% while reducing S phase to 11.04%, indicating moderate proliferation inhibition. The most dramatic effects were observed with AuCh-NPs plus LED, which arrested 91.68% of cells in G0/G1 phase and only 7.55% in S phase, demonstrating strong antiproliferative synergy. In contrast, AuCit-NPs with LED showed intermediate effects (86.81% G0/G1, 12.11% S phase). These results demonstrate that AuCh-NPs combined with PTT most effectively induced G0/G1 arrest in MCF-7 cells, suggesting superior cell cycle interference compared to other treatments. The differential responses between nanoparticle types highlight the importance of the synthesis method on biological activity (Fig. 10 Fig. 10 Quantitative analysis of cell cycle distribution in MCF-7 cells following treatment with Chaga extract (6 µM), AuCh-NPs (5.56 µM), or AuCit-NPs (7 µM) combined with LED irradiation 530 nm, 325.8 J/cm 2 n p p 2 Apoptosis analysis by annexin V-FITC/PI staining The mechanism of cell death in MCF-7 was evaluated using Annexin V-FITC and PI staining following treatment with IC 50 2 Our key findings revealed that treatment with AuCh-NPs plus LED irradiation induced the highest proportion of early apoptotic cells (66.64% ± 0.61), significantly exceeding both AuCit-NPs (62.96% ± 0.53) and Chaga extract (64.08% ± 0.33) treatments ( p 6 11 12 Table 6 Apoptotic cell populations in MCF-7 cells following treatment with LED phototherapy with 325.8 J/cm 2 Treatment group Early apoptosis (% ± SEM) Late apoptosis (% ± SEM) Untreated (Control) 3.47 ± 0.24 a 4.80 ± 0.24 a LED only (Control) 59.74 ± 0.75 b 19.66 ± 0.99 e Chaga + LED 64.08 ± 0.33 d 13.92 ± 0.34 c AuCh-NPs + LED 66.64 ± 0.61 e 6.32 ± 0.22 b AuCit-NPs + LED 62.96 ± 0.53 c 16.94 ± 0.41 d Data represent mean percentages ± SEM ( n p p 50 2 Fig. 11 Represented differences in scattered effect of MCF-7 cells at different conditions. a b c d e 2 Fig. 12 Quantitative analysis of apoptosis induction in MCF-7 cells treated with Chaga extract (6 µM), AuCh-NPs (5.56 µM), or AuCit-NPs (7 µM) combined with LED irradiation 530 nm with 325.8 J/cm 2 A B n p p 2 Apoptotic gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR The apoptotic gene expression profile of photothermal therapy was analyzed through qRT-PCR to evaluate BAX (pro-apoptotic) and BCL2 (anti-apoptotic) mRNA levels in MCF-7 cells following various treatments. Untreated control cells showed balanced expression of both genes BAX and BCL2.Combined treatment with Chaga extract and LED irradiation enhanced these effects, elevating BAX expression 1.30 ± 0.04 and BCL2 expression 1.05 ± 0.08 compared to controls. The most significant changes occurred with AuCh-NPs plus LED treatment, dramatically increasing BAX expression by 2.89 ± 0.12 while reducing BCL2 expression by 0.69 ± 0.17, resulting in the highest pro-apoptotic BAX/BCL2 ratio among all groups. AuCit-NPs with LED showed intermediate effects, increasing expression BAX 1.67 ± 0.43 and decreasing expression BCL2 0.81 ± 0.14. These results demonstrate that AuCh-NP-mediated photothermal therapy most effectively promotes apoptotic signaling through coordinated upregulation of pro-apoptotic BAX and downregulation of anti-apoptotic BCL2 compared to other treatments. The distinct gene expression patterns correlate with the observed apoptotic effects and explain the superior anticancer activity of AuCh-NPs with photothermal therapy (Table 7 13 Table 7 Relative mRNA expression levels of BAX and BCL2 in MCF-7 cells following treatment with LED irradiation 530 nm with 325.8 J/cm 2 Treatment group BAX (Fold Change ± SEM) BCL2 (Fold Change ± SEM) Untreated (Control) 1.00 ± 0.00 a 1.00 ± 0.00 bc Chaga + LED 1.30 ± 0.04 ab 1.05 ± 0.08 b AuCh-NPs + LED 2.89 ± 0.12 c 0.69 ± 0.17 a AuCit-NPs + LED 1.67 ± 0.43 b 0.81 ± 0.14 ab Data represents mean fold changes ± SEM ( n p p 2 Fig. 13 Relative mRNA expression levels of pro-apoptotic BAX and anti-apoptotic BCL2 in MCF-7 cells following treatment with Chaga extract (6 µM), AuCh-NPs (5.56 µM), or AuCit-NPs (7 µM) combined with LED irradiation (530 nm, 142 mW, 30 min).

Post-LED exposure, alkaline conditions demonstrated severe double-strand damage in AuCit-NP-treated cells (tail length 13.93) and AuCh-NPs (13.39). In contrast, neutral conditions showed AuCh-NPs induced more single-strand breaks (tail length 19.88) than AuCit-NPs (9.59). Complementary quantitative measures further support DNA damage patterns. Under alkaline conditions, AuCh-NPs consistently showed percentages of DNA in tail (0.49) similar to AuCit-NPs, while in neutral electrophoresis, this pattern reversed, with AuCh-NPs demonstrating higher values (0.50). Furthermore, tail moment measurements revealed that AuCh-NPs (1.01) are higher than those for AuCit-NPs (0.59) in alkaline conditions, and in neutral conditions, AuCh-NPs (1.01) are higher than those for AuCit-NPs (0.86). These findings collectively demonstrate that AuCh-NPs primarily induce DNA fragmentation patterns detected predominantly in neutral comet assays (high tail moment, low %DNA in alkaline assays), characteristic of large-scale apoptotic DNA cleavage (50–300 kbp fragments). In contrast, AuCit-NPs generate widespread damage detectable in alkaline and neutral assays, suggesting non-specific double-strand breaks associated with necrosis or genotoxic stress. The differential effects between nanoparticle treatments became more pronounced following LED irradiation, with neutral comet assays proving particularly effective at distinguishing the apoptotic DNA fragmentation patterns induced by AuCh-NPs. The distinct damage profiles suggest fundamentally different mechanisms of DNA interaction between the two nanoparticle types. Discussion Breast cancer patients undergoing conventional treatments often experience systemic toxicity due to the non-selective targeting of both malignant and healthy cells. In contrast, due to its demonstrated anticancer properties, folk medicine has long utilized Chaga mushroom (Inonotus obliquus) as a dietary supplement for cancer patients. The successful synthesis of AuCh-NPs was confirmed by a characteristic peak closely resembling that of AuCit-NPs, as Chaga mushroom extract alone does not exhibit such a peak. The shift in the AuCit-NPs peak upon AuCh-NP formation can be attributed to differences in particle size, hydrodynamic behavior, and aggregation tendencies in aqueous solution. The synthesis of AuCh-NPs involved the uniform binding of active chemical groups, facilitated by reducing agents in AuCit-NPs, which converted gold ions into metallic gold, confirming successful nanoparticle formation. The resulting AuCh-NPs exhibited nanorod morphology with a crystalline surface, enhancing their stability, cellular permeability, and retention efficacy. Notably, AuCh-NPs displayed superior cellular uptake in breast cancer cells via endocytosis compared to AuCit-NPs, amplifying their anticancer potential [ 24 Our research further demonstrated that exposure to 530 nm LED light (total irradiation: 325.8 J cm −2 3 31 16 Hydrodynamic size distribution analysis revealed that AuCh-NPs had a larger and broader distribution than AuCit-NPs, suggesting a higher surface charge in citrate-stabilized NPs. This property likely reduced nanoparticle aggregation, contributing to the enhanced anticancer performance of mycosynthesized AuCh-NPs [ 24 22 In MCF-7 breast cancer cells, AuCh-NPs combined with LED-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) demonstrated potent anticancer effects, as evidenced by the lowest IC 50 15 35 13 Mechanistically, our approach markedly increased pro-apoptotic BAX expression while decreasing anti-apoptotic factors, correlating with elevated double-strand DNA damage and apoptosis compared to other treatment groups. Our results demonstrated that cancer cells treated with AuCh-NPs and subjected to LED irradiation exhibit a pronounced apoptotic mechanism, corroborated by prior work [ 31 9 Remarkably, the combined regimen of Chaga extract, AuCit-NPs, and LED-PPT at minimal dosages outperformed alternative therapies in anticancer efficacy [ 10 Gene expression analysis revealed that AuCh-NP PTT significantly upregulated BAX and downregulated BCL2 in MCF-7 cells, triggering cytochrome C release and apoptosis initiation. These findings align with Mfouo-Tynga et al., who reported mitochondrial membrane disruption and cytochrome C release in nanoparticle-treated breast cancer cells. Finally, alkaline and neutral comet assays confirmed extensive DNA damage in AuCh-NP PTT-treated cells, indicated by elongated tail lengths, higher DNA percentages, and increased tail moments compared to AuCit-NP PTT. These results parallel Shukurov et al. [ 7 Conclusion Our study demonstrates that AuCh-NPs, combined with LED-mediated photothermal therapy (530 nm, 325.8 J cm −2 Publisher's note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.
