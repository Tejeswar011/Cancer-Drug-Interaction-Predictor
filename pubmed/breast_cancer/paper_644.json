Systemic sclerosis is a pro-inflammatory condition, and inflammation is also a driver of coronary artery disease. We assessed coronary artery calcification prevalence, mortality risk and potential clinical impact on primary prevention in a cohort of patients with systemic sclerosis, differentiated by clinical phenotype including the presence of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Methods: Retrospective analysis of 258 computed tomographies in systemic sclerosis patients from three prospectively maintained clinical and research databases at a single tertiary rheumatology/pulmonary hypertension (PH) service between March 2007 and September 2020 (mean age = 65 ± 12, 14% male). Co-morbidities, statin prescription and all-cause mortality were recorded. Patients were subtyped according to underlying systemic sclerosis complications. Computed tomographies were re-reviewed for coronary artery calcification; severity was graded using a 4-point scale per vessel and summed for total coronary artery calcification score. The impact of reporting coronary artery calcification was assessed against pre-existing statin prescriptions. Results: Coronary artery calcification was present in 58% (149/258). Coronary artery calcification was more prevalent in systemic sclerosis-pulmonary arterial hypertension than in systemic sclerosis subgroups with interstitial lung disease or without pulmonary arterial hypertension, controlling for age, sex, co-morbidities and smoking status (71%; χ 2 p p Conclusions: Coronary artery calcification is common in systemic sclerosis. Coronary artery calcification predicts mortality independently of age and confounding co-morbidities which suggests this finding has clinical relevance and is a potential target for screening and therapeutic intervention.
