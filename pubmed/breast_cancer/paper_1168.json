Introduction Foodborne contaminants represent a substantial global health risk, causing millions of illnesses and deaths annually, with a particular emphasis on children under five years of age [ 1 2 3 4 5 Salmonella Escherichia coli 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Noble nanozymes have been methodically examined and refined in biosensing applications due to their unique nanometer scale, adjustable composition and morphology, exceptional catalytic performance, and outstanding stability, enabling their extensive use in biosensing applications [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Among the diverse Au-based bimetallic combinations, gold–platinum (AuPt) nanozymes have surfaced as notably attractive prospects [ 23 24 25 26 27 2 2 28 29 30 21 31 32 33 34 35 36 25 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 2 2 47 Although AuPt nanozymes have demonstrated exceptional performance in monitoring various food contaminants, comprehensive reviews focusing specifically on the advances of AuPt nanozymes in biosensing applications remain scarce [ 23 19 48 49 50 51 This review systematically introduces the synthesis, characterization, and applications of AuPt nanozymes in food safety, covering diverse structural configurations (plain, magnetic, porous nanomaterial-loaded, and labeled on flexible nanomaterial), synthesis methodologies (seed-mediated growth and one-pot approaches), and reducing agent selection (ascorbic acid, sodium citrate, and sodium borohydride) ( Figure 1 2. Preparation Protocol of AuPt Nanozymes 2.1. Type of AuPt Nanozymes The catalytic activity, stability, and application versatility of AuPt nanozymes are significantly influenced by their structural configuration and composite architecture [ 52 53 54 2.1.1. Plain AuPt Nanozymes Plain AuPt nanozymes, generally fabricated as core–shell or alloy-type nanoparticles without additional carriers, are the most fundamental and well investigated form of Au–Pt-based nanozymes. Their catalytic activity is profoundly affected by the atomic ratio of Au to Pt and the resulting nanostructure morphology [ 45 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 The size of Au NP templates is an important factor in controlling the catalytic characteristics of resultant AuPt nanozymes. Three Au NPs of varying sizes, namely G3, G4, and G5, with dimensions of 22, 28, and 34 nm, respectively, were utilized as templates for the synthesis of the AuPt nanozymes, G5Pt, G4Pt, and G3Pt. The average dimensions of the platinum-coated G5Pt, G4Pt, and G3Pt nanoparticles increased by around 5–10 nm, yielding sizes of 39.1, 28.3, and 25.5 nm, respectively. The unmodified Au NPs exhibited a red hue, while the Pt-modified nanoparticles presented a bluish-brown tint. Moreover, the AuPt NPs had a broader absorption spectrum than the pure Au NPs, which primarily absorbed in the 500–600 nm range. The color of the G5 nanoparticles in the 200-fold diluted mixture significantly contrasted with that of the G5Pt nanoparticles, indicating their superior color generation capabilities relative to the uncoated Au NPs [ 62 Regulating the ratios of Au:Pt in preparing AuPt nanozymes is also beneficial in enhancing their enzyme-like characteristic, offering superior nanozyme options for biosensing purposes.

Magnetic AuPt Nanozymes The integration of Fe 3 4 3 4 64 65 66 67 3 4 68 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 3 4 69 In the synthesis of magnetic AuPt nanozymes, AuPt can be deposited in situ or sequentially attached on the magnetic core, resulting in magnetic nanozymes with tunable shape. The prior technique utilizes 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane or ionic liquid functionalization on the magnetic core, facilitating electrostatic adsorption for the deposition of Au and Pt ions [ 70 71 72 73 2 3 4 74 2.1.3. Porous Nanomaterials with AuPt Deposition Depositing pre-synthesized or in situ synthesized AuPt nanozymes into the interior surface of porous nanostructures is also beneficial in enhancing the catalytic performance of resultant nanocomposites. Specifically, AuPt nanozymes have been anchored inside the channels of various porous nanocarriers, including dendritic SiO 2 75 76 77 78 Owing to the highly porous three-dimensional mesh structure, these porous nanostructures enhance the efficient immobilization, diffusion, and stabilization of AuPt nanozymes [ 79 75 29 80 81 82 2.1.4. AuPt Nanozyme-Anchored Flexible Nanomaterials Affixing AuPt nanozymes to flexible nanomaterial substrates significantly enhances their dispersion, stability, and integration into biosensors, thereby facilitating the development of remarkable biosensing systems for food hazard detection. Extensively employed flexible nanomaterials—specifically graphene oxide (GO) [ 83 84 3 2 85 3 2 x 42 86 2 87 88 89 83 90 3 2 3 2 86 91 92 93 94 95 2.2. Synthesis Methods 2.2.1. Seed-Growth Methods Seed-mediated growth is a prevalent method for synthesizing AuPt nanozymes, commonly utilizing Au NPs as nucleation centers owing to their specified morphology, superior colloidal stability, and modifiable surface chemistry ( Figure 2 96 2 6 2 4 97 The seed-mediated growth method offers significant advantages in the fabrication of AuPt nanozymes, particularly for morphology regulation, reproducibility, and catalytic performance [ 61 98 99 100 30 101 102 57 103 104 105 Alongside spherical Au NPs, gold nanorods (AuNRs) have recently been investigated as anisotropic seeds to facilitate the epitaxial development of Pt domains, yielding AuPt nanozymes with elongated structures and facet-dependent catalytic characteristics [ 57 106 107 108 109 24 39 110 Recent breakthroughs have explored composite templates that integrate Au NPs with supporting matrices, enhancing structural stability and multifunctional properties beyond typical gold nanostructures. For this target, dendritic silica nanospheres/Au NP [ 75 111 112 113 2.2.2. One-Pot Synthesis Compared to the sequential process of seed-mediated growth, one-pot preparation methods offer efficient preparation routes that enable the simultaneous reduction and assembly of Au and Pt precursors into bimetallic AuPt nanozymes [ 85 The template-free one-pot method is the most direct approach for synthesizing AuPt nanozymes, depending on the simultaneous co-reduction of Au and Pt precursors under meticulously regulated conditions [ 114 4 2 6 2 4 21 28 39 24 115 29 Template-assisted one-pot approaches integrate the efficacy of concurrent reduction with the structural regulation afforded by supporting matrices. MOFs, benefiting from their well-defined porous structures, tunable surface chemistry, and ability to confine nanoparticle growth within their cavities, have been utilized as templates for one-pot AuPt nanozyme synthesis [ 116 117 118 77 29 76 84 Importantly, the efficacy of one-step self-reduction techniques is fundamentally reliant on the availability of suitable surfactants and polymeric stabilizers, which fulfill several vital roles such as particle size regulation, morphological guidance, and colloidal stability [ 56 119 120 78 121 122 123 89 124 125 126 87 127 128 129 130 2.3. Reducing Agents The choice of suitable reducing agents is a crucial factor in the controlled synthesis of AuPt nanozymes, since these agents directly affect nucleation kinetics, growth processes, particle morphology, and the final structural properties of the bimetallic system [ 131 132 133 Table 1 The reduction mechanism of AuPt nanozymes generally occurs in several specific stages [ 28 29 152 153 2.3.1. Ascorbic Acid Due to the mild and pH-responsive reduction ability, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) has emerged as one of the most commonly employed reducing agents in the preparation of AuPt nanozymes, owing to its gentle reduction characteristics, biocompatibility, and pH-dependent reduction kinetics [ 43 59 72 97 145 154 155 The pH-dependent characteristics of ascorbic acid reduction present both a benefit and a significant factor in synthesis design. Under acidic conditions (pH < 4), ascorbic acid demonstrates limited reducing capacity, facilitating a gradual reduction that promotes consistent nucleation and development [ 155 156 In the manufacture of AuPt nanozymes, the mild characteristics of ascorbic acid render it especially appropriate for seed-mediated growth techniques, wherein regulated Pt deposition onto pre-existing gold seeds is sought [ 60 62 63 127 143 2+ 2 47 2.3.2. Sodium Citrate Sodium citrate holds a distinctive role among reducing agents in preparing AuPt nanozymes since it functions as both a reducing and a stabilizing agent. The citrate ion possesses many carboxylate groups that can align with metal surfaces, offering electrostatic and steric stability while also acting as an electron donor for the reduction of metal ions [ 46 69 148 149 150 45 114 136 The reduction mechanism of citrate entails the oxidation of the hydroxyl group next to the carboxylate moiety, generally taking place at elevated temperatures (80–120 °C) [ 129 136 157 The chelating characteristics of citrate in bimetallic AuPt synthesis can affect the reduction sequence by generating complexes with metal ions of varying stabilities. The enhanced complexation with Pt ions relative to Au ions can vary the effective reduction potentials, potentially changing the inherent thermodynamic preference for Au reduction [ 131 158 Citrate adsorption on the surfaces of resulting nanoparticles stabilizes them, preventing aggregation during synthesis while ensuring adequate surface accessibility for ongoing growth [ 159 160 2.3.3. NaBH 4 Sodium borohydride (NaBH 4 70 71 4 – – 2 – 2 – 58 75 137 The potency and speed of borohydride reduction offer both benefits and difficulties in the synthesis of AuPt nanozymes [ 161 In sequential reduction procedures, the application of excess borohydride may result in the concurrent reduction of both metal precursors, necessitating meticulous stoichiometric regulation to attain the intended architectural results [ 162 163 The selection of reducing agent significantly influences both the synthesis results and the ultimate characteristics and efficacy of AuPt nanozymes in food safety applications. Therefore, comprehensively comparing and evaluating the characteristics of those reducing agents are crucial in obtaining desired AuPt nanozymes. In comparison between those three agents, ascorbic acid is ideal for regulated, sequential reduction procedures where moderate conditions and biocompatibility are essential. The pH-dependent activity facilitates facile temporal control strategies, rendering it especially appropriates for seed-mediated development methods aimed at precisely specified core–shell architectures. Sodium citrate presents benefits in one-pot synthesis techniques where simultaneous reduction and stabilization are required, since its modest reducing capability ensures a balance between control and efficiency. NaBH 4 3. Different Detection Modes of AuPt Nanozyme-Based Biosensing Methods 3.1. Colorimetric Mode Nanozyme-mediated colorimetric sensing has emerged as a prominent technique for detecting food hazards owing to its simplicity, speed, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use [ 164 165 56 58 142 134 151 166 151 120 Lateral flow assays (LFAs), or immunochromatographic assays, utilize AuPt nanozymes as signal tracers, are distinguished by their simplicity, rapid and real-time analysis, visual recognition, high specificity, and low cost [ 167 Staphylococcus aureus S. aureus 138 97 104 40 63 73 83 143 144 59 43 62 125 14 143 144 Alternatively, AuPt nanozyme-assisted colorimetric sensor arrays have exhibited exceptional capability in simultaneously detecting and distinguishing various foodborne risks [ 114 123 168 2 K m V max −8 −1 28 169 3.2. Electrochemical Mode Leveraging the inherent electrocatalytic properties and improved electrical conductivity of Au and Pt components, AuPt nanozymes demonstrate considerable synergistic effects that markedly improve charge transfer efficiency and catalytic kinetics at the electrode–electrolyte interface [ 88 170 171 172 173 88 1 130 1 124 76 2 2 135 78 To enhance the sensitivity of AuPt nanozyme-assisted electrochemical sensors, various nanomaterials have been integrated to function as signal nanotracers or surface modifiers. The “confinement effect” of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) was employed for the incorporation of Au NPs, resulting in Au@ZIF-8 nanocomposites used for electrode deposition on multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs), while toluidine blue (TB)-loaded hollow spherical cerium dioxide (CeO 2 130 76 2 2 1 124 61 Alternatively, AuPt NPs have been modified on the electrode surface in preparing those electrochemical sensors. AuPt NPs were utilized as electrocatalysts on screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE) owing to their superior electrocatalytic reduction efficiency for H 2 2 2 2 −1 −2 2 2 135 88 3.3. Other Detection Methods Magnetic relaxation switching (MRS) biosensors, which leverage the state fluctuations of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to change the transverse relaxation time (Δ T 2 174 175 176 2+ 3+ 177 2 2 2 2 T 2 141 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing has evolved as a potent analytical method for food safety assessment, attributed to its little background signal, elevated sensitivity, and straightforward equipment [ 178 179 180 1 107 An electrochemiluminescence system was introduced employing SnS 2 2 2 2 8 2 111 3.4. Dual and Multiple Modes The integration of dual or multiple detection modes into a unified nanozyme-based sensing platform has proven to enhance analytical robustness, sensitivity, and adaptability in several food safety applications [ 181 182 183 The bifunctionality of oxTMB molecules, resulting from the AuPt oxidation process, has enabled the advancement of dual-mode approaches employing colorimetric indicators and Raman reporters. Incubating glucose oxidase (GOx) with Au@Pt/Fe-DACDs initiates a cascade reaction, converting glucose into H 2 2 147 71 3 4 3 4 –9 –13 129 Leveraging the exceptional optical density and fluorescence quenching properties of oxTMB molecules, a colorimetric and fluorescence dual-mode enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) biosensor was developed for the detection of imidacloprid. Employing rhodamine 6G dyes as fluorescence indicators, oxTMB diminished the fluorescence signal, achieving LODs of 0.88 μg/L and 1.14 μg/L in colorimetric and fluorescence modes, respectively, surpassing conventional ELISA (1.21 μg/L). Furthermore, this method demonstrated satisfactory applicability for detecting imidacloprid in samples of Chinese cabbage, cucumber, and zucchini [ 148 140 4.

Mycotoxins Mycotoxins, secondary compounds from fungi, influence food safety and health. Grain, nut, fruit, and processed foods contain these chemicals, especially under high humidity and poor storage [ 189 Aspergillus 1 190 Fusarium 1 191 192 193 194 195 A competitive “signal-on” PEC aptasensor was developed for the sensitive detection of AFB 1 107 2 3 2 3 2 − + 1 2 3 2 3 2 Figure 4 Targeting the portable detection of mycotoxins, a paper substrate-based electrochemical aptasensor was developed for the detection of FB 1 124 1 Figure 4 Aiming to enhance the detection sensitivity of AuPt nanozyme-assisted biosensors, different methods have been constructed. A colorimetric aptasensor was created for the detection of deoxynivalenol (DON), utilizing the aptamer-modulated nanozymatic activity of Pt/Au nanoparticles functionalized with metal–organic frameworks (Pt/Au/MIL-100(Fe)). In the presence of DON, the aptamer dissociated from the Pt/Au/MIL-100(Fe) surface, reinstating the peroxidase-like activity of the nanozyme and producing a measurable colorimetric signal. The sensor demonstrated an advantageous linear detection range (50–5000 ng/mL) and a low LOD of 44.14 ng/mL, with findings exhibiting strong agreement with those acquired using HPLC in detecting DON in real samples. Furthermore, the nanozyme exhibited remarkable storage durability, preserving catalytic efficacy with an RSD < 3% after 21 days at 4 °C ( Figure 4 76 Figure 4 4.3. Heavy Metal Ions Heavy metal ions in the food chain can harm people, even at low amounts. Lead ions (Pb 2+ 2+ 2+ 3+ 196 197 198 199 200 201 By incorporating AuPt into the pores of dendritic silicon nanospheres featuring central-radial porous structures, the resultant AuPt@DSN nanocomposite exhibits remarkable peroxidase-like activity and dispersibility [ 75 2+ 2+ 2+ + 2 2 + 106 + To satisfy the need of multiplexing detection of several heavy metal ions, a sensor array consisting of three signal recognition components (AuPt@Fe-N-C, AuPt@N-C, and Fe-N-C) was developed for the rapid, precise, and high-throughput identification of Hg 2+ 2+ 2+ 6+ 3+ 114 4.4. Antibiotic and Veterinary Drug Residues Due to their harmful effects and role in the global antimicrobial resistance epidemic, antibiotic and veterinary medicine residues in food threaten public health and food safety [ 202 203 204 205 206 A label-free electrochemiluminescence aptasensor was developed for the sensitive detection of lincomycin using SnS 2 111 Figure 5 Improving the number of AuPt nanozymes on the nanostructure, the resulting nanoprobes is prone to exhibit an enhanced detection sensitivity. Employing polyethyleneimine as a linker, a substantial quantity of Au@Pt nanoflowers was affixed to the lamellar CoSe 2 61 Figure 5 Multiplexing LFAs are crucial in simultaneously revealing the co-existence of many food hazards, providing higher portability and rapidity [ 207 3 4 73 3 4 Figure 5 83 Figure 5 4.5. Pesticide Residues Pesticide residues in food can cause endocrine disruption, neurotoxicity, and cancer [ 208 209 210 211 212 AuPt alloy nanoparticles decorated on CeO 2 2 54 2 Alternatively, an enzyme-free bio-barcode immunoassay was developed for detecting parathion, utilizing the catalytic ability of Au@Pt nanozymes [ 41 AuPt nanozyme-assisted dual-mode detection methods have also been proposed to enhance detection reliability. For instance, carbendazim fungicide competed with cDNA-labeled Fe 3 4 46 148 To improve the portability of pesticide detection, Mao et al. developed a lateral flow test for acetamiprid detection using a bivalent triple helix aptamer with two 10 nt arms, resulting in a sixfold higher binding rate than the original aptamer [ 144 Figure 6 4.6.

The Au@Pt-decorated MoS 2 87 A colorimetric sensor array was created utilizing Au@Pt, Au@Os, and Au@Pd nanozymes, which demonstrated distinct peroxidase-like activities, aimed at the screening and differentiation of various phenolic acids [ 123 Figure 6 A competitive biomimetic ELISA utilizing Au@Pt@Au nanoparticles as signal tracers was proposed for the sensitive detection of histamine in a 96-well plate format [ 150 Figure 6 5. Perspective Bimetallic AuPt nanozymes have emerged as promising candidates for food safety research owing to their distinctive structural characteristics, remarkable catalytic efficiency, and compatibility with various sensing systems. Their applications encompass different targets and enable multiple signal output modalities. Nonetheless, several significant challenges persist, such as limited structural controllability during synthesis, insufficient catalytic activity, and the lack of standardized performance evaluation methods. Future research should concentrate on resolving these challenges. 5.1. Developing and Optimizing Protocols of Synthesizing AuPt Nanozymes with Higher Controllability and Greenness One-pot synthesis methods for AuPt nanozymes are frequently adapted due to their simplicity and scalability; yet, they often demonstrate insufficient control over nanoparticle morphology, surface structure, and shell uniformity, all of which are critical for catalytic activity and reproducibility. The seed-mediated synthesis of prepared Au NPs as cores enables meticulous control over the thickness, content, and spatial arrangement of the Pt shell, resulting in extremely homogeneous core–shell nanostructures with varied catalytic characteristics. However, seed preparation, surface functionalization, and controlled Pt deposition are generally required, consequently increasing operational complexity and reducing synthetic throughput. Therefore, there is a growing focus on sustainable and regulated synthesis methods to tackle these challenges. The synthesis of AuPt nanozymes using microfluidic chip technology enables continuous, automated, and precisely regulated manufacturing under mild reaction conditions [ 31 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 5.2. Integration of Other Nanomaterials for Preparing Superior AuPt Nanozymes Although AuPt nanozymes have demonstrated promising catalytic activity, integrating additional nanomaterials with AuPt has been frequently employed to enhance the nanozyme characteristics of nanocomposites [ 223 2 83 224 225 2 73 3 4 226 227 228 137 5.3. Exploring Au or Pt Alternatives to Expand Nanozyme Diversity and Adaptability AuPt nanozymes exhibit superior catalytic performance and stability; however, the scarcity and high cost of noble metals necessitate the integration or substitution of these elements with more cost-effective transition metals—such as Ag, Cu, Co, or Ni—thereby presenting a feasible strategy for developing next-generation nanozymes that enhance economic viability and catalytic diversity [ 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 28 5.4. Establishing Multiple Signal Integration Methods with High Portability and Applicability Meanwhile, the enhancement of device-level integration is essential for translating nanozyme performance into functional analytical platforms [ 146 139 148 239 240 241 99 124 242 120 243 244 74 245 246 247 248 Considering the multiplexing analysis, sensor arrays exhibit significant benefits in the concurrent identification and quantification of several analytes at varying concentrations, using the “fingerprinting” attributes derived from nanozyme-catalyzed products [ 249 250 251 252 5.5. Standardization of AuPt Nanozyme Definition and Activity Assays Recent advancements in validated testing protocols for nanozyme activity facilitate the standardization of AuPt nanozyme activity evaluation across various production methods and surface morphologies [ 253 254 255 256 257 6. Conclusions Due to continuous progress in interdisciplinary research in materials science, nanocatalysis, and device engineering, AuPt nanozymes are set to become vital elements in the future of biosensing systems. Their remarkable catalytic activity, stability, and adaptability, together with the capacity for integration with diverse nanomaterials including magnetic, porous, and flexible substrates, render them very efficient for food safety monitoring. Magnetic AuPt nanozymes have demonstrated significant potential for improving analyte recovery and improved detection sensitivity in intricate food matrices. Furthermore, porous AuPt nanozymes exhibit exceptional efficacy in signal amplification, rendering them optimal for the detection of low-concentration pollutants. Core–shell architectures provide the most substantial enhancements in catalytic performance, while advancements in synthesis techniques, including as seed-mediated growth and one-pot approaches, have enhanced control over size, morphology, and activity. These developments, especially when combined with multi-modal sensing platforms, have facilitated more dependable and economical solutions for food safety monitoring. Consequently, although all structural kinds and methodologies enhance detection capacities, emerging AuPt nanozymes have produced the most promising outcomes, particularly for real-time and on-site food safety applications. To improve, it is essential to tackle issues including the standardization of synthesis techniques, the scaling of production, and the integration with sophisticated sensing platforms to fully harness the potential of AuPt nanozymes in food safety, thereby enhancing food security and public health globally.
