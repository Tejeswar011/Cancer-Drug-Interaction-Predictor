Background Mental disorders are the leading cause of global non-fatal disease burden, with rising prevalence among children, adolescents, and youth. This study analyzed location-, age-, and sex-specific estimates for nine mental disorders from 1990 to 2021 using GBD 2021 data, projecting burden to 2050. Methods Methods included calculating average annual percentage change (AAPC) and annual percentage change (APC) for age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) and disability-adjusted life years rate (ASDR), alongside decomposition, inequality, frontier, comparative risk, and Bayesian age-period-cohort analyses. Results Compared to 1990, the 2021 global burden significantly increased among youth [the AAPC of ASPR = 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.14 to 0.16; the AAPC of ASDR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.51], accelerating sharply after 2019 (the APC of ASPR = 4.74, 95% CI 4.55 to 4.93; the APC of ASDR = 6.64, 95% CI 4.88 to 8.42). Males experienced a higher burden than females, with variations in sex-specific patterns across age groups. Burden varied substantially by socio-demographic index (SDI), being highest in high-SDI regions [ASPR = 12913.13, 95% uncertainty interval (UI): 11135.82 to 14874.98; ASDR = 1750.41, 95% UI: 1253.46 to 2328.87]. We found that the burden changes of nine mental disorders vary at the global, regional, and national levels. Decomposition analysis highlighted that the changes in prevalence and the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were predominantly driven by population growth (84.86% and 57.92%), with the most significant improvements observed in higher SDI regions. Frontier analysis revealed the potential for burden reduction in higher income countries and territories. Globally, key risk factors included childhood sexual abuse, bullying, intimate partner violence, and lead exposure were identified for anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and idiopathic developmental intellectual disability, respectively. Projections indicated that the burden of mental disorders is likely to continue its decline in 2050 (ASPR = 6120.71 per 100,000, 95% CI: 3973.57 to 8267.85; ASDR = 844.71 per 100,000, 95% CI: 529.48 to 1159.94). Conclusion Despite projected rate declines by 2050, the global burden of mental disorders is increasing, with significant disparities across populations and a recent surge demanding intensified prevention and equitable healthcare expansion worldwide. mental disorders disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) health inequality global burden projections to 2050 The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

It serves as a vital resource for studying the burden of mental disorders in children, adolescents, and youth at global, regional, and national levels. Many studies based on the GBD framework have explored the burden of mental disorders, focusing on specific time points ( 6 1 7 8 9–11 2 12 2 12 2 6 To address these significant gaps, this study aims to generate comprehensive evidence for optimizing early-life mental health interventions globally by quantifying the disease burden, health inequities, and evolving trajectories of major mental disorders across critical developmental stages from infancy to young adulthood (<5 to 24 years). By leveraging the GBD 2021, our study estimates to (i) evaluate the global burden and health equity of several major mental disorders in children, adolescents, and youth across five critical developmental age groups (<5, 5–9 years, 10 to 14 years, 15–19 years, and 20–24 years) according to the WHO definition, (ii) identify critical temporal shifts in disease trends, (iii) ascertain the relative importance of various risk factors for key mental disorder subtypes across different global regions, and (iii) forecast the global prevalence and disability burden of these disorders in children, adolescents, and youth up to the year 2050. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Data source and definition All data of mental disorders were obtained from the Global Health Data Exchange (GHDx) online resource ( https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/ 13 13 14 2.1.1 Socio-demographic index (SDI) The GBD 2021 study assessed the socio-demographic status of each location using a composite indicator called the SDI, which is calculated using three key indicators: educational attainment for individuals aged 15 and older, the total fertility rate for women under 25, and average income per person. The SDI is represented on a scale from 0 (low SDI) to 100 (high SDI), with categorizing into low, low-middle, middle, high-middle, and high SDI. Additionally, for administrative and data analysis purposes, all countries and territories were divided into 21 GBD regions based on their epidemiological similarities and geographic proximity. 2.1.2 Risk factors for mental disorders The GBD 2021 evaluated the health impacts of various behavioral, metabolic, environmental, and occupational risk factors, as well as their combinations, across 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2021 ( 14 15 2.2 Data processing 2.2.1 Descriptive analysis The burden of mental disorders was assessed based on the annual number of cases for prevalence and DALYs. Our analysis focused specifically on nine mental/neurodevelopmental disorders for which the GBD 2021 study provides comprehensive, age-stratified burden estimates: depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, conduct disorder, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), eating disorders, IDII, and ADHD. The selected nine disorders adhered to GBD 2021’s rigorous protocols for mental disorder inclusion: (1) clinical significance: conditions with International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes ( Supplementary Table 1 ASR = ∑ i = 1 n ( r i × w i ) ∑ i = 1 n w i r i i w i p 2.2.2 Temporal trend analysis For temporal trend analysis, we employed Joinpoint Regression Program (Version 5.3.0) ( 16 2.2.3 Decomposition analysis Decomposition analysis was utilized to visually quantify the contributions of three independent factors to the overall changes in disease burden, i.e., age structure, population growth, and epidemiological changes. The methodology of decomposition has been elaborated in prior studies ( 17 2.2.4 Cross-country inequalities analysis In our study, slope index of inequality (SII) and concentration index (CII) were employed for quantifying the distribution inequality in the burden of mental disorders across different countries, utilizing the SDI for ranking purposes ( 18 19 y x 2.2.5 Frontier analysis Frontier analysis delineates countries and regions exhibiting the optimal health outcomes (e.g., life expectancy, mortality rates, or disease burden) relative to their specific levels of social and demographic development (e.g., SDI). We implemented non-parametric data envelope analysis to generate a nonlinear frontier, guided by detailed methodologies outlined in previous literature ( 20 2.2.6 Projection analysis For forecasting, we implemented a Bayesian age-period-cohort (BAPC) model ( 21 3 Results 3.1 Overview global burden An overview of the global burden in population aged under 24 years reveals a slight increase in the prevalence and DALYs related to mental disorders. The age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) of mental disorders increased from 10075.76 (95% UI 8578.00 to 11697.92) per 100,000 in 1990 to 10433.45 (95% UI 8925.95 to 12104.94) per 100,000 in 2021 ( Table 1 Figure 1A Supplementary Table 2 Table 1 Table 1 Figure 1B Table 1 The burden and temporal trends of mental disorders by sex, SDI, and global in 1990 and 2021.

Color legends are included for both maps indicating data range. In a word, the global ASPR and ASDR of mental disorders in population aged under 24 years increased slightly from 1990 to 2021. Both metrics declined moderately until 2019 but surged sharply during 2019–2021, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. High SDI regions bore the highest burden, with Australasia having the highest rates and Western Sub-Saharan Africa the lowest in 2021. 3.2 The sex and age pattern In 2021, The ASPR among individuals aged under 24 years was higher in males [10558.42 (95% UI 9035.42 to 12206.62)] compared to females [10292.05 (95% UI 8728.78 to 12017.74)] globally ( Supplementary Figure 3 Table 1 Supplementary Figure 4A Supplementary Figure 4B Table 1 Supplementary Figures 4C,D Supplementary Figure 4 Supplementary Figure 5 Globally, males aged under 24 years had higher ASPR, while females aged under 24 years had higher disability burden. This sex difference varied regionally, that females aged under 24 years in Western Europe and parts of Latin America had higher ASPR. The burden escalated with age, rising faster in females. Males under 15 had higher burden than females, but females aged 15–24 faced the greatest burden. 3.3 The burden of nine major mental disorders From 1990 to 2021, the burden of nearly all nine mental disorders in population aged under 24 years was increase, except for ADHD, IDII, and Schizophrenia ( Figure 3 Supplementary Figure 6 Figure 4 Figure 5 Supplementary Figure 7 Supplementary Figure 7 Supplementary Figures 8, 9 Supplementary Figures 10–12 Figure 3 Global and five SDI regions changes of age-standardized DALY rates of nine mental disorders from 1990 to 2021.

The ASPRs of anxiety disorders, ADHD, and depressive disorders among children, adolescents, and youth are anticipated to constantly rise over the next three decades ( Supplementary Figure 26 Supplementary Figure 29 Figure 5 Figure 11 Figure 5 Substantially, global ASPR and ASDR among population aged under 24 years are projected to decline significantly by 2050, despite rising cases due to population growth. Anxiety, ADHD, and depressive disorders will increase in prevalence, while IDII will decline. Conduct disorder will become a top 4 disorder by prevalence by 2025. DALYs will remain highest for anxiety/depression, but rankings for other disorders (e.g., conduct disorder, bipolar) will shift. 4 Discussion The international community has increasingly recognized mental disorders as a significant and growing public health challenge that poses substantial difficulties for healthcare systems worldwide, especially among children, adolescents, and youth. To contribute in this endeavor, we explored and predicted the burden of mental disorders across children, adolescents, and youth, stratified by geographical and demographic factors. Over the previous three decades, there has been a notable increase in the burden of mental disorders globally among children, adolescents, and youth. In 2021, it was over 346 million children, adolescents, and youth worldwide grappled with at least one identifiable mental disorder, resulting in more than 40 million DALY cases. The age of onset for mental disorders peaks at approximately 15 years, which underscoring a critical neurodevelopmental window. This heightened vulnerability stems from the asynchronous development of key brain regions, specifically the emotion-processing limbic system and the prefrontal cortex, which governs impulse control and decision-making, combined with intense psychosocial pressures such as academic performance and social integration ( 22 23 24 25 Our projections to 2050 reveal a complex future landscape for the global burden of mental disorders among children, adolescents, and youth. While the overall burden is predicted to decline significantly by 2050, this aggregate trend masks critical divergent trajectories among specific disorders. Crucially, our projection of persistently rising burdens for anxiety disorders, ADHD, and depressive disorders over the next three decades finds strong support in recent literature. In a comprehensive meta-analysis, an increases trend in the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and ADHD among youth projected to continue absent major intervention shifts ( 26 27 28 Our analysis observed a troubling shift in the burden of mental disorders among population aged under 24 years around 2019, when previously decreasing prevalence rates began to surge sharply until 2021. This trend reversal coincided with the pandemic period of COVID-19 and suggested a possible deterioration in youth mental health during this time. A number of studies have documented the increases in anxiety, depression, and related symptoms among young people during 2020–2021, especially in high-income countries. For example, Racine ( 29 30 31 32 The results showed that the burden of mental disorders among population aged under 24 years was significantly associated with the social and economic development status. Across 21 GBD regions, Australasia, High-income North America, and Western Europe, including countries like Portugal, Greenland, and Ireland, reported increasing burdens. This pattern, showing higher burdens in many high-income regions, contrasts with some earlier assumptions that lower-income settings bear the greatest absolute burden. Some researchers contend that pronounced inequality within high-income areas fosters “relative poverty,” creating significant social hierarchies that promote social differentiation and comparison, ultimately leading to detrimental mental health outcomes ( 33 34 35 17 Our findings regarding sex differences indicate that females aged under 24 years were more prone to anxiety and depressive disorders, whereas disorders such as ADHD, conduct disorder, and ASP were more prevalent among males. Prior studies have suggested that these sex differences may be influenced by a combination of biological, hormonal, genetic, and socio-cultural factors ( 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 Our projection of a declining IDII burden is strongly supported by documented successes in lead abatement programs. These initiatives, such as the global phase-out of leaded gasoline, have demonstrably reduced blood lead levels and subsequently lowered intellectual disability burden. However, these policies were effectively implemented only in high-income countries. Lead exposure remains a profound environmental risk factor for neurodevelopmental and physical health in LMICs. In 2021, 85% of global IDII DALYs concentrated in low-resource regions (South Asia and North Africa/Middle East), where mean blood lead levels (BLL) in children exceed 7.8 μg/dL, which was 7-fold higher than WHO safety thresholds ( 47 48 49 This study offers a thorough analysis of the global burden of mental disorders using GBD 2021 data, with the following limitations inherent to GBD methodology: First, the imperfection of healthcare systems in low-income countries may result in under-diagnosis, misdiagnosis, and thus, the miscalculation of disease burden. Second, although the GBD study collaborators engaged in meticulous data cleaning and sophisticated statistical modeling, the study’s reliance on indirect data and assumptions may introduce unknown biases that could further influence the present evaluation. Third, definitions, diagnostic criteria, and assessment methods for mental disorders and their specific causes have evolved and differ across time and contexts. Although the DSM and ICD classifications have been employed to maintain consistency in case definitions across studies, they may not adequately reflect all cultural contexts. Therefore, it is essential to enhance the cross-cultural applicability of case definitions. Moreover, continuously evolving classifications must be taken into account in forthcoming research endeavors. In addition, several limitations from our analytical choices persist within our current research. First, two epidemiological indicators, namely prevalence and DALYs, provide only approximate assessments regarding the burden of mental disorders. Since these disorders are not acknowledged as primary causes of mortality, data on death rates are not reported here. Second, the current analysis was conducted at a national scale without delving into specific variations at the sub-national level. Consequently, the findings may not necessarily extend to sub-national contexts. Third, the risk factors examined for each mental disorder in our research may not be exhaustive, as our criteria for inclusion were restricted to risk-outcome pairs with compelling or probable evidence of a causal association, consistent with GBD standards. Furthermore, uncertainty in PAF estimates was quantified through GBD’s 1,000 posterior draws, reflecting sampling and model stochasticity. However, formal sensitivity analyses of parameter assumptions (e.g., TMREL bounds) were not feasible within the scope of this secondary analysis. Fourth, while our projections captured the overall trend up to 2021, they do not explicitly model the unique causal pathways and magnitude of impact attributable solely to the COVID-19 pandemic on the burden of mental disorders during 2020 and 2021. Finally, this investigation relied exclusively on the GBD database and did not incorporate data from other global databases, thereby limiting the diversity of data sources. 5 Conclusion This study combines decomposition, frontier, and Bayesian modeling to quantify the global mental health burden in population aged under 24 years, revealing significant mitigation potential even in high-resource settings. Adolescents and young adults (15–24 years) are identified as the most vulnerable group, with sharp rises in anxiety, depressive, and behavioral disorders. LMICs face exacerbated burdens due to resource constraints and social disparities. Critical interventions include LMIC-focused lead-abatement programs, school-based anti-bullying initiatives in high-SDI regions, and dynamic, age-specific resource allocation, particularly digital supports for youth. Future research should prioritize understanding drivers of youth mental health disparities and evaluating real-world interventions in marginalized populations. We highly appreciate the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, the GBD collaborators, and all staff who provided data for this study.
