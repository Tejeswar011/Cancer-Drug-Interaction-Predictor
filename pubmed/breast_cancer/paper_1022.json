These compounds feature a diarylphosphine oxide (DAPO) substituent at the β-position relative to both the carbonyl and the phosphoryl groups. Various derivatives with halogens, phosphorus, and/or aromatics substituents were synthetized and their thermal stability and flammability were evaluated at the microscale by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and pyrolysis–combustion flow calorimetry (PCFC) in order to identify the most promising molecules for use as flame-retardant (FR) additives or comonomers. FTIR-coupled PCFC analysis was also carried out to study the combustion profiles of the molecules. Beyond the confirmation of some expected trends, such as the char promotion of phosphorus and flame inhibition of halogens, the study revealed some unexpected findings that warrant further investigation. These include the prominent role of the chlorine substitution position on the aromatic ring, as well as significant differences in FR performance between diastereoisomers. coumarin isophosphinoline phosphorus pyrolysis–combustion flow calorimetry flame retardancy fire behavior This research received no external funding. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Polymers are generally highly flammable and, in the event of a fire, they tend to release a large amount of heat. This promotes flame propagation and increases the hazard of a fire. To mitigate this risk, flame retardancy is typically achieved by incorporating FR additives or by integrating FR building blocks directly into the polymer backbone. While some elements, such as halogens and phosphorus, are well known for their FR properties, research on new FR polymeric structures or additives still remains a hot topic. However, this process often relies on an expensive and time-consuming trial-and-error approach, since the flame-retardant performance of a specific additive or structural unit cannot be accurately predicted prior to its incorporation into the host polymer. For example, the thermal stability of a small molecule is usually much lower than that of the polymer: for the former, evaporation can occur before pyrolysis. Similarly, the ability of a FR group to promote charring or to inhibit combustion needs to be assessed within the context of the whole macromolecular structure. However, methods have been developed at the microscale to predict the flammability of polymers based on their chemical composition [ 1 2 3 4 It is well recognized that microscale tests (i.e., thermogravimetric analysis and pyrolysis–combustion flow calorimetry) do not accurately correlate with performances at bench scale (i.e., cone calorimetry, limiting oxygen index, or UL94 tests, among others) [ 5 6 Among the wide variety of molecular structures available for synthesizing new FR compounds, biobased building blocks are particularly attractive in light of growing environmental concerns. Coumarin, also known as 2H-1-benzopyran-2-one, is a naturally occurring biobased molecule found in many plants ( Figure 1 7 8 9 10 The phosphorylation of the coumarin ring at the C-3 position has been extensively studied. Notable examples of diethylcoumarin-3-phosphonate synthesis were reported by Singh et al. (1985) and Janecki et al. (2010) [ 11 12 13 14 Scheme 1 15 Fewer syntheses have been reported for 4-phosphonated or 4-phosphinylated coumarins. A notable example is the work by Lenker et al. (2011) [ 16 Scheme 2 Additionally, Brahmachari et al. (2020) [ 17 Scheme 3 Structures based on such aromatic moieties and heteroatoms have high flame-retardant potential [ 18 Scheme 4 19 There have been few studies focusing on the flame-retardant properties of coumarin or isophosphinoline derivatives. In a recent paper, Roncucci et al. prepared a new bioFR combining coumarin and diphenylphosphine oxide (DPPO) [ 20 Built on previous studies involving phosphoryl-containing natural products, and in continuation of our recent work devoted to the development of compounds bearing phosphoryl groups as substituents incorporated into natural products or isophosphinolines as substituents, this study focuses on the regioselective phosphorylation of coumarins at the C-3 position and of isophosphinoline at the β-position relative to the phosphoryl group. The flame-retardant potential of these new molecules was assessed by evaluating their thermal stability and heat release properties, using thermogravimetric analysis and pyrolysis–combustion flow calorimetry. The goal of this work is to examine the influence of different substituents, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, phosphorus, and aromatic moieties, when linked to these two building blocks (i.e., isophosphinoline and coumarin). By analyzing their thermal and flammability behavior, we aim to identify the most promising molecules for future application as efficient flame retardant additives or as key components in the design of innovative, intrinsically flame-retardant polymers. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Synthesis of Diarylphosphine Oxide Various phosphine oxides were synthesized to demonstrate the Michael addition at either the C-3 position of the coumarin ring or at the β-position relative to the phosphoryl group. The crude products were isolated and compared with those described in the literature. Diarylphosphine oxides were obtained in good yields through a two-step reaction sequence ( Scheme 5 Table 1 Electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) and electron-donating groups (EDGs) were introduced on the aryl halide precursors to assess the impact of these substituents on the flame-retardant properties of the resulting coumarin and isophosphinoline derivatives. 2.2. Synthesis of 4-Phosphorylated Coumarins COUM-R and 3-Phosphorylated Isophosphinolines ISOP-R We employed a similar reaction strategy to synthesize the target compounds COUM-R and ISOP-R, which were first described by Knochel in 2002 [ 21 22 Scheme 6 Table 2 Under optimized reaction conditions developed by one of us, acetonitrile was used as the solvent instead of dioxane. This enabled the Michael reaction to afford the corresponding coumarin derivatives in yields ranging from 58% to 97% and isophosphinoline derivatives in yields ranging from 70% to 88%. Post-reaction analysis of the isophosphinoline derivatives by 31 More details, including synthesis conditions and NMR data, can be found in the Supporting Information S1 and S2 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 Supplementary Materials All the molecules synthetized from coumarin and isophosphinoline studied in this paper are divided into two groups (named group 1 and 2) and compared with a third group (group 3) of compounds that have already been studied in detail in a previous article [ 19 Scheme 7 Group 1 gathers 4-phosphorylated coumarins, where the substituent group is linked to carbon 4 (called modified coumarins COUM-R, with R referring to the substituent group). Group 2 gathers 4-phosphorylated isophosphinolines grafted with a group linked to carbon 4 that is not directly bound to the phosphorus atom (called modified isophosphinolines ISOP-Ra,a′, with R referring to the substituting group). Note that some molecules in this group are diastereomers or a mixture of diastereomers. Group 3 gathers isophosphinolines that are modified by grafting of a group linked to carbon 3. This carbon atom is directly bound to the phosphorus atom (called ISOB-R, with R referring to the substituting group). These molecules have already been studied in detail in a previous article [ 19 All the molecules are listed in Table 3 2.3. Characterizations 1 31 13 1 31 1 3 4 31 High-resolution mass spectroscopic (HRMS) analysis was performed on a Xevo G2 Q TOF spectrometer using the electrospray method by the Laboratoire de Mesures Physiques of the University of Montpellier (Montpellier, France). Flame retardancy was assessed at the microscale using pyrolysis–combustion flow calorimetry (PCFC) and thermogravimetric analysis. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGAs) were carried out using a TGA Q50 (TA instrument, New Castle, DE, USA) at a heating rate of 20 °C·min −1 −1 Pyrolysis–combustion flow calorimetry tests were performed using a device provided by Fire Testing Technologies (FTT, UK), according to method A proposed by the ASTM D7309 standard. Briefly, a 2–5 mg sample is heated in a first chamber under a nitrogen flow (100 mL/min) at 1 K/s up to 750 °C. Pyrolytic gases are sent to a second chamber (called a combustor) at 900 °C in the presence of an excess of oxygen (N 2 2 33 f r e s i d u e ∆ h −1 (1) ∆ h = T H R 1 − f r e s i d u e  with  T H R  is  the  total  heat  release  ( in  kJ · g − 1 ) Standard deviations were assessed to equal 54 W/g, 4 °C, 0.8 kJ/g, 0.01, and 1 kJ/g, respectively, for the pHRR, TpHRR, T H R ∆ h Thermogravimetric analysis and pyrolysis–combustion flow calorimetry are two useful techniques for studying decomposition behavior at a very small scale (a few mg). In most cases, both techniques may provide similar information (see Supporting Information S3 34 Supplementary Materials Since some molecules contain halogen atoms, which are well known as flame inhibitors (i.e., they disturb oxidation in the gas phase), additional analyses were conducted using PCFC-FTIR coupling [ 35 4 2 In most cases, carbon released in the gas phase is fully transformed into CO 2 2 2 2 −1 −1 2 2 2 2 5 2 36 3. Results In the first part, data from TGA and PCFC (according to method A, i.e., anaerobic pyrolysis and complete combustion) are discussed for the three groups of molecules. In the second part, some selected molecules are tested by PCFC-FTIR coupling under incomplete combustion conditions in order to assess the so-called “flame inhibition” mode-of-action. Figure 2 Supporting Information Figure 3 For group 2, for which all substituting groups are aromatic groups, sometimes substituted with methyl or methoxy groups, fluorine atoms, or chlorine atoms, thermal stability is also strongly improved. The temperature at the main peak increases from 343 °C for pure isophosphinoline to 400 °C and 397 °C for ISOP-Ha and ISOP-Ha′, respectively (367–402 °C depending on the molecule from group 2). Decomposition occurs in one main apparent step, but very small peaks can be observed for some molecules at low or high temperature (ISOP-pCla or ISOP-o,mCla, for example). The pHRR tends to strongly increase (up to 1033 W/g for ISOP-Ha), or, at best, remains close to the value for pure isophosphinoline (422 W/g), when aromatic rings are substituted by chlorine atoms. Another observation is the width at mid-height, which indicates the temperature range in which decomposition occurs. This width is around 60 °C for pure isophosphinoline, but decreases strongly for the modified molecules of group 2 (up to 22 °C for ISOP-Ha, for example). In other words, the decomposition starts later, but when it starts, it is very fast. Aromatic groups usually improve the thermal stability of molecules. But when the temperature is high enough to allow the release of aromatic compounds, the destabilization of the molecule probably leads to its fast decomposition. Group 3 contains molecules substituted with different chemical groups, including one bringing aromatic rings (ISOB-3b). The HRR curve is very different for all of these molecules in comparison to group 2. Molecules from group 3 show a large decomposition range, with most often two apparent pHRRs. For molecules with only one pHRR, such as ISOB-3b, the width at mid-height also increases strongly (92 °C). As the decomposition occurs over a wider range of temperatures, the pHRRs are much less intense (105–230 W/g). Figure 2 Figure 2 ∆ h p H R R = p M L R × ∆ h The heats of complete combustion of pure coumarin and isophosphinoline are high (around 30 kJ/g), while their residue fractions are null ( Figure 4 The presence of halogenated atoms reduces the heat of combustion. Indeed, these atoms have a negligible contribution to heat release (in the models based on molar group contributions, their contributions can be even negative [ 2 3 5 2 36 The THR can be reduced for both reasons. In the case of group 1, a decrease in the heat of combustion is observed mainly for halogen-containing molecules. This decrease is more significant for bromine (Mw = 81 g/mol) than for chlorine (Mw = 35 g/mol), and very limited for fluorine (Mw = 19 g/mol). It can also be observed that molecules containing three chlorine atoms on each aromatic ring release less heat than those containing two chlorine atoms, which also release less heat than those containing only one chlorine atom. Interestingly, COUM-2mCl releases little heat, despite the presence of only one chlorine atom. This can be ascribed to its very strong and unusual ability to produce char (residue fraction 0.33), which stores a high amount of carbon. Under standard PCFC conditions, combustion is complete. Nevertheless, for some molecules, combustion can be incomplete even when the combustor temperature is as high as 900 °C [ 4 For group 2, the ability to char is reduced (residue fraction < 0.1 in all cases). Therefore, a decrease in the heat of combustion is observed only for molecules containing chlorine atoms. On the contrary, the heat of combustion is only slightly reduced (in the range 24–28 kJ/g) for most molecules from group 3. But these molecules often have a high ability to char, especially phosphonate-containing molecules, allowing for a significant reduction in the THR. On the contrary, ISOB-3b is the only molecule from group 3 with a negligible char content. It can be assumed that the presence of aromatic rings (as pendant groups) has a detrimental effect on char promotion. The ratio between the heat release rate and mass loss rate corresponds to the heat of combustion. Comparing the pHRR and pMLR, measured respectively using PCFC and TGA, is another way to assess the heat of combustion (at peak decomposition). Figure 4 Figure 5 Beyond the general trends discussed above, some specific features can be drawn. In the following, we highlight three points concerning, respectively, diastereomers, the role of phosphorus atoms, and the impact of halogens on combustion efficiency. - Diastereomers Some molecules from group 2 are diastereomers. ISOP-Ra,a′ molecules correspond to a mixture of two diastereomers. ISOP-Ra and ISOP-Ra′ constitute, after purification, only one diastereomer. Interestingly, most diastereomers exhibit different fire performances. Figure 6 Table 3 R e l a t i v e  d i f f e r e n c e  % = 100 × 2 × P a − P a ′ P a + P a ′ With P a P a ′  Figure 6 The relative difference (in %) between the pHRR, TpHRR, and THR of the two diastereomers (or mix of diastereomers). The temperature at pHRR, which corresponds to thermal stability, is similar for both diastereomers for all couples. But a huge difference is observed in the pHRR (up to 40%). For example, ISOP-Ha and ISOP-Ha′ exhibit a pHRR equal to 1033 W/g and 684 W/g, respectively (the same observation can be made for pMLR). The variation in total heat release is intermediate. Some diastereomers have the same THR, but some other ones show some differences (up to 19%). Other differences are noticeable: in particular, the char content is significantly different for the two diastereomers of ISOP-pCla,a′: 0.11 versus 0.02 in PCFC, and, similarly, 0.14 versus 0.04 in TGA. Detailing the decomposition pathway for each molecule is beyond the scope of the present paper. Nevertheless, these results provide evidence that the precise structure of a molecule (including stereochemistry) may impact the pyrolysis, and therefore the fire behavior, of the molecule. Computational modeling may be useful in future work to address this point. - Phosphorus Phosphorus is a well-known flame-retardant element. Its effect depends mainly on its oxidation level [ 37 38 From the overall results, it can be concluded that the phosphorus atom with a low oxidation level is not able to improve char formation. Most molecules from group 2 and pure isophosphinoline have a residue fraction close to 0. While flame inhibition could not be properly assessed in these experiments, it can be assumed that this phosphorus atom is not effective in improving flame retardancy. The better thermal stability of isophosphinoline in comparison to coumarin may be related not to the presence of phosphorus, but rather to the presence of an additional aromatic ring. On the contrary, if most molecules from group 3 exhibit a high char content, ISOB-P3d and ISOB-P3e have the highest value. Therefore, phosphonate groups have an influence on flame retardancy by promoting char formation. - Halogens Standard test conditions in PCFC do not allow for the assessment of some flame-retardant modes-of-action. In particular, flame inhibition—when a FR releases, in the gas phase, some molecules that are able to disturb the oxidation of carbon-based gases—is usually not effective, because the combustor temperature and residence time (900 °C and 10 s, respectively) are high enough to ensure complete combustion [ 4 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 9 For non-halogen-based molecules (namely COUM-H and ISOP-Ha′), the combustion remains complete at 900 and 800 °C ( Figure 10 35 2 −1 For fluorine-based molecules (namely COUM-2mF and COUM-2pF), the same characteristics can be highlighted ( Figure 10 −1 39 −1 FTIR spectra at the peak(s) of Gram–Schmidt curves for chlorine- and bromine-based molecules can be found in the following figures ( Figure 11 Figure 12 Interestingly, at 700 °C, the CO band is the lowest (in comparison to the CO 2 Hydrogen chloride is clearly identifiable from bands at 2700–3000 cm −1 2 −1 −1 2 Figure 13 2 2 2 37 38 2 The temperatures of 700 and 800 °C seem to be the best conditions for discriminating the ability of the different molecules to disturb combustion. 4. Conclusions The influence of different parameters on the thermal stability and flammability of molecules is highlighted in this work. Some of the parameters are rather well known, namely the following: - Substituting groups most often tend to increase the thermal stability of both building blocks, namely, coumarin and isophosphinoline. This effect is more prominent for coumarin. In isophosphinoline, it depends on the location of the substituting group. - The oxidation level of phosphorus has an impact on char promotion. Phosphonates are highly efficient groups for enhancing charring, while low-oxidation-level phosphorus is unable to promote charring. - Aromatic rings as pendant groups (and without the presence of heteroatoms) increase the peak of heat release rate and do not promote charring, especially when they are not substituted by halogen atoms. This is not surprising, and previous work has shown that these aromatic rings have a high contribution to the pHRR and THR and a negligible contribution to charring [ 3 18 - Fluorine atoms have very little effect on flammability, while chlorine and bromine groups strongly reduce heat release through a decrease in the heat of combustion and char promotion (to a certain extent). Moreover, the combustion efficiency is highly reduced when the combustion temperature is low, and in some cases, even when the temperature is as high as 900 °C. Moreover, the greater the quantity of halogen atoms, the more significant this effect is. Other parameters are new findings, or are unexpected and have not been proved yet to be influential, and need further study: - The influence of halogen atoms as flame inhibitors is strongly dependent on the building block structure. In particular, the combustion is much more disturbed at a low temperature for coumarin than for isophosphinoline, despite the presence of a phosphorus atom in the structure of the latter. - The location of the substituting group on isophosphinoline (on carbon 3 or 4) completely changes the decomposition pathway. In particular, the grafting of the substituting group on carbon 3 (group 3) leads to decomposition over a wide temperature range, and, consequently, a low pHRR. - The location of halogen atoms on the aromatic ring has a huge effect on the decomposition pathway. In one case, only one chlorine atom in meta position leads to a strong charring. Such an effect is not observed when the chlorine atom is in para position or when several chlorine atoms are present. - In some cases, diastereomers exhibit different flammability properties, mainly in terms of their pHRR. Next steps will consist of selecting some of these molecules as FR additives or monomers in order to prepare polymeric materials and to test their fire-retardant behavior. The objective will then be to check whether the findings listed above remain suitable.
