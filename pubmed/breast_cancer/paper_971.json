Introduction Although early detection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has improved internationally, late detection is still common, especially in countries with limited economic resources [ 1 2 3 4 5 Until the HIV/AIDS epidemic, KS was considered a relatively rare disease worldwide, with a variable incidence across geographic regions, with its endemic forms in sub-Saharan Africa having the highest incidence rates. However, since the 1980s, following the identification of HIV infection and the consequent increase in the number of PLHIV, a different and more aggressive KS variant than the variants previously described in other populations began to be observed, as well as an association between the incidence of KS and HIV infection, especially in patients with AIDS in advanced stages [ 6 7 5 Since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996, a reduction in the incidence of KS has been observed, which is more evident in high-income countries with access to treatment; for example, in the United States of America during the pre-HAART era (1991–1995), KS in patients with HIV was 500 to 2000 times more common than in the general population, particularly in those with high HIV viral loads and low CD4+ T-cell counts; after the advent of HAART, a consistent decrease of up to 6% of KS cases per year was observed [ 7 8 9 7 8 9 Although the overall incidence of KS has decreased, this decrease occurred because of the lower incidence in Europe and North America [ 6 10 11 Epidemic KS presents with a highly variable clinical course. It can present as an indolent disease limited to the skin with few lesions, but unlike other subtypes, up to 30–40% of patients have mucosal involvement, and 20–40% of patients have rapid spread to the gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, lungs and bones, which is characterized by an aggressive course and fatal outcome in many cases [ 12 13 14 15 16 Since 1982, visceral involvement of KS has been associated with a poor prognosis, with a reduction in survival to only 1–2 years as opposed to the 10 to 25 years observed in KS with exclusively cutaneous involvement [ 17 18 19 Despite the increased knowledge of KS, there is still little information from countries with limited resources. In the case of Mexico, to our knowledge, there are no studies that describe the prevalence and characteristics of epidemic visceral KS in the Mexican population. The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of epidemic visceral KS in this population, as well as its clinical and biochemical characteristics. 2. Materials and Methods To calculate the prevalence of KS and visceral KS, all patients over 18 years of age, regardless of sex, who sought care at the La Raza National Medical Center between March 2020 and February 2023 and who had a diagnosis of HIV infection confirmed by a positive result from at least two rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) were included [ 20 5 The prevalence was calculated as follows: P r e v a l e n c e = #  o f  p e o p l e  i n  s a m p l e  w i t h  c h a r a c t e r i s t i c  ( e p i d e m i c  K S  o r  v i s c e r a l  K S ) T o t a l  #  o f  p e o p l e  i n  s a m p l e  ( p e o p l e  w i t h  H I V  d i a g n o s i s ) For the remainder of this study’s analyses, only patients diagnosed with HIV infection and KS treated at the La Raza National Medical Center between March 2020 and February 2023 were included. The inclusion criteria were as follows: patients of either sex over 18 years of age who sought medical care during the study period; a diagnosis of HIV infection confirmed by a positive result from at least two rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) [ 20 The clinical information and laboratory results of the patients included in the study were collected from their digital medical records. The data collected for analysis included the following: sex, age, weeks since HIV diagnosis, clinical and laboratory variables associated with the management and follow-up of HIV infection, sites of involvement of the KS lesions, and results of relevant laboratory tests performed during hospitalization. Patients who were classified as having visceral KS were those diagnosed as such in their medical history, based on histopathological confirmation of visceral involvement; specifically, patients were not considered for the study if the diagnosis of visceral KS did not explicitly mention in the admission medical note or subsequent follow-up that the diagnosis had been confirmed by a biopsy of the visceral site with compatible histopathological results. While all records mentioning a diagnosis of visceral KS met these criteria, most lacked a complete description of the biopsy procedure or detailed histopathological results corresponding to visceral involvement. Data from the clinical records were compiled into a database created in Microsoft Office Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). SPSS Statistics (version 29, IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data analysis. For descriptive statistics of qualitative variables, absolute frequencies were calculated, and the data are presented as proportions and percentages. For quantitative variables, measures of central tendency and dispersion (median and interquartile range) were used for nonnormal distributions. For the inferential statistics of the qualitative variables, the proportions of the categorical variables were placed in a contingency table to compare them using the Chi-square test. The odds ratio (OR) was also obtained with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated using the Baptista–Pike method. With respect to the inferential statistics of the quantitative variables, their normality within the Gaussian distribution was first assessed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, and comparisons between groups were then made using the Mann–Whitney U test. A multivariate analysis was performed using binary logistic regression with a backward stepwise entry model with likelihood ratios and the Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, which uses the clinical and biochemical variables that were significant in the bivariate analysis, as well as variables of relevance in other studies. The magnitude of the association between the variables and the development of visceral KS was determined by calculating ORs and their corresponding 95% CIs. In all analyses, differences with p This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Clinical Research and Bioethics Local Committee 3502 of the Centro Medico Nacional La Raza (approval code: R-2023-3502-021). Given the retrospective nature of the study, the requirement for informed consent was waived by the ethics committee. 3. Results During the study period, 1314 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of HIV infection evaluated at La Raza were identified. Among these patients, 74 were diagnosed with KS, resulting in a prevalence of epidemic KS of 0.056 (5.6%). Among the 74 patients with epidemic KS, 38 (51.4%) were diagnosed with visceral KS, resulting in a prevalence of epidemic visceral KS of 0.028 (2.8%). For analysis, the patients were divided into two groups: patients with nonvisceral epidemic KS (n = 36, 48.6%) and patients with visceral epidemic KS (n = 38, 51.4%). Patients with epidemic visceral KS had greater oral mucosal involvement and lower serum hemoglobin levels, both of which were statistically significant ( p p Table 1 Among the patients with epidemic visceral KS (n = 38), 14 (36.8%) had lung involvement, 27 (71%) had upper gastrointestinal involvement, 9 (23.7%) had colon involvement, 13 (34.2%) had lymph node involvement, and 3 (7.9%) had involvement at sites other than those mentioned above. Figure 1 Coinfections in addition to KS were identified in 44 (59%) of the patients included in the study, the most common being syphilis, followed by cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection; 19 (25.7%) patients had more than one coinfection. Table 2 Table 3 4. Discussion The primary objective of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of epidemic KS and epidemic visceral KS in our patient population, as well as to evaluate the proportion of visceral KS in patients with HIV infection and KS. In this cohort, we reported a prevalence of epidemic KS of 5.8%, which is very similar to that reported by Tancredi et al. [ 11 21 8 10 22 Regarding visceral epidemic KS, we found a prevalence of 2.8%, and the proportion of patients having visceral involvement was 51.4% (38 of 74 patients) among all patients diagnosed with epidemic KS. Although visceral involvement in KS is considered rare, it occurs more frequently in epidemic KS; however, the reported frequencies are highly variable. In the study by Bower et al. [ 23 19 24 25 In this study cohort, the most frequent site of visceral involvement was the upper gastrointestinal tract (71%), followed by the pulmonary tract (50%). This finding is similar to that reported by Parente et al. [ 24 19 19 25 26 Regarding clinical and laboratory characteristics, we found that patients with visceral involvement appeared to have less cutaneous involvement (9.8 times lower) than patients with epidemic nonvisceral KS did (97% vs. 78%, p 25 Patients with epidemic visceral KS in our study also had a greater frequency (0.68 times greater) of oral mucosal involvement than patients without visceral involvement in both bivariate ( p p 27 p p 25 28 Grabar et al. and the aforementioned work by Rezende et al. revealed that a CD4+ T lymphocyte count <200 cells/mm 3 26 29 3 3 29 Regarding coinfections, in our patient population, we found no significant differences between patients with nonvisceral epidemic KS and those with visceral epidemic KS. This may be related to the fact that both groups had similar levels of CD4+ T lymphocytes. The high incidence of epidemic visceral KS in our patient population makes it relevant to evaluate the need for a deliberate search for visceral involvement in all patients with epidemic KS. However, due to the limitations of working in a setting with limited healthcare resources, the necessary diagnostic procedures are not always feasible [ 30 Our study has several limitations, which are important to mention. Due to the retrospective study design, we were limited by the information available in patients’ medical records and we did not perform a sample size calculation, which would have given us greater certainty regarding the statistical power of the results presented. Therefore, any differences between groups do not necessarily indicate a causal relationship and must be confirmed in subsequent studies. Furthermore, we cannot guarantee that all patients were studied with the same laboratory test profile or that biopsies were obtained uniformly from sites of possible visceral involvement, which could have been influenced by disease severity; therefore, since there is no histopathological description and method used for biopsy collection in the majority of medical records of patients diagnosed with visceral involvement in our study, the prevalence of visceral KS in our patient population may be under- or overestimated, this is because the diagnostic confirmation information was based solely on the description in the admission or follow-up medical note. Importantly, although early detection of HIV has been increasing in Mexico, our national limitation in health care resources makes it likely that KS and HIV are underdiagnosed [ 1 8 19 23 24 31 5. Conclusions The prevalence of epidemic (HIV-related) KS in our patient population was 5.6%. Among these patients, 51.4% had visceral KS involvement, resulting in an overall prevalence of 2.8%. Patients with visceral epidemic KS had significantly greater oral mucosal involvement and lower serum hemoglobin levels than patients with nonvisceral epidemic KS did. Our results should be confirmed in future studies with larger sample sizes and a design aimed at identifying possible variables associated with visceral epidemic KS; however, these results highlight the importance of performing diagnostic studies to detect visceral involvement in patients with epidemic KS.
