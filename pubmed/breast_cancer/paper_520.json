However,\nstudying cellular response to therapeutics in complex 3D cell models\nwith spatial and temporal control remains challenging and requires\ntechniques with high sensitivity. In this regard, surface-enhanced\nRaman spectroscopy (SERS) allows for the identification of relevant\nbiomarkers in complex biological settings.   Following a similar rationale,\nwe hypothesized that plasmonic hydrogels,\ndesigned for in situ e.g Results\nand Discussion Gold nanorods were chosen as\nthe plasmonic substrate because of\ntheir tunable localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) through defined\nsynthesis parameters. In particular, our AuNRs have an aspect ratio\nof 2.9 ± 0.5, which leads to an LSPR mode at 785 nm ( Figure S1A,B 2+  Figure 1 Figures S2 and S3 1 (A) Schematic representation of the thiol–ene reaction\nto\npromote orthogonal photo-cross-linking of the thiolated alginate-methacrylated\ncarboxymethyl cellulose (TALG-MCMC) ink.

(C) In situ For the preparation of the plasmonic ink (TALG-MCMC\nink), TALG\nand MCMC, both at 2% (w/v) concentration, were added to a colloidal\ndispersion of AuNRs ([Au 0 Figure Figure S4 2 Figure S5A 2+ Figure S5B To ensure printability, the rheological properties of the resulting\nmixture were assessed, including viscosity and ink flow, kinetics\nof the photoinitiated thiol–ene reaction (photorheology), and\nviscoelastic behavior.

(D) SEM micrograph of a selected area in a plasmonic\npillar, showing the presence of well-defined AuNRs (inset) within\nthe material. The sensing performance of plasmonic\npillars embedded\nin dECM was\nfirst tested by incubating the whole system with different concentrations\nof 6-TG in cDMEM. To do so, the different solutions were added on\ntop of the models and incubated at 37 °C. The mechanism of action\nof 6-TG is represented in Figure 3 (A) MTAP metabolic pathway in normal cells (top) and MTAP-deficient\ncells (bottom), resulting in the increased incorporation of 6-TG into\nDNA in the latter.

The structure of 6-TG comprises a purine ring bearing\nan amino and a thiol group that can coordinate with Au, favoring chemical\ninteraction with AuNRs and resulting in a well-defined SERS profile\n( Figure –1 –1 Table S1  –1 Figure Figure Figure Figure S8 Next, we aimed to print the\nplasmonic pillars while preserving\nthe core/shell architecture of the core-stroma model, as well as the\nviability of the cells embedded in the dECM ( Figure 2 Figure Figure S9 Figure Figure Figure S10 Figure S11 4 (A) Design of the 3D\nbreast cancer model with integrated hydrogel\npillars containing plasmonic AuNR sensors.

HBFs\nare labeled with Deep Red (in pink); MDA-MB-231 cancer cells are labeled\nwith CMF 2 Finally, we aimed to demonstrate the application\nof SERS to monitor\nthe consumption of the antitumoral drug 6-TG. Therefore, the 3D core/stroma\nmodel including the sensing pillars was incubated with a 400 μM\n6-TG solution (1% v/v DMSO/cDMEM). This concentration was chosen considering\nthe cytotoxicity observed in 2D cell cultures ( Figure S8 Figure –1 Figure –1 Figure Figures S12 5 (A, B) Representative SERS intensity maps for\nthe 1303 cm –1 –1 P P P Conclusions The present work showcases\nthe use of plasmonic\nhydrogels to introduce\nsensors into complex 3D in vitro via in situ via Experimental\nsection Materials Acetone (≥99.5%), alginic acid sodium\nsalt (alginate, MW 150,000 g/mol), l 2 4 2 2 4 2 4 2 4 2 4 3 2 Synthesis of Gold Nanorods AuNRs\nwere prepared according\nto well-established procedures. 4 4 3 4 Synthesis of Functionalized Polymers Synthesis of Thiolated\nAlginate (TALG) Thiolated alginate\n(TALG) was prepared following a reported procedure with some modifications. 2 Synthesis of Methacrylated Carboxymethyl\nCellulose (MCMC) Methacrylated carboxymethyl cellulose (MCMC)\nwas obtained following\na reported protocol. 2 Preparation TALG-MCMC Ink The preparation of the ink\nrequired further purification of AuNRs by centrifugation at 8000 rpm\nand redispersion in MilliQ water to remove excess CTAB. Then, 40 mg\nof methacrylated carboxymethylcellulose (MCMC) and 40 mg of thiolated\nalginate (TALG) were dissolved into 1.6 mL of AuNRs colloidal dispersion\n(1.9 mM). Then, 400 μL of CaCl 2 0 Characterization of AuNRs Ultraviolet–Visible\nAbsorbance Spectroscopy The colloidal dispersions of AuNRs\nwere characterized by UV–vis\nspectroscopy, using a Cary 60 UV–vis spectrophotometer from\nAgilent. Transmission Electron Microscopy The morphology and\ndimensions of AuNRs were characterized by TEM with a JEOL JEM-2100F\n(UHR) transmission electron microscope. All samples were prepared\nby placing a drop of 3 μL of the colloidal solution onto a TEM\ngrid and drying at RT before imaging. Characterization of the\nPolymers Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( 1 The chemical structure of the synthesized polymers was determined\nthrough 1 2 Fourier Transform-Infrared\nSpectroscopy (FTIR) FTIR\nstudies were conducted using ATR-FTIR Bruker INVENIO X. The spectrometer\nis equipped with an accessory featuring a single-reflection monolithic\ndiamond for measuring attenuated total reflectance (ATR). Both polymers\nwere characterized by directly placing a small amount of the dried\nsample on the ATR crystal, ensuring full coverage of the crystal surface.\nThe background was automatically corrected by the software and the\nspectrum was collected from 450 to 4000 cm –1 Ellman’s Test To determine the number of thiols\nincorporated to alginate, Ellman’s test was performed. First,\n40 mg of TALG was diluted into 250 μL of reaction buffer. In\nparallel, three test tubes were prepared, each containing 50 μL\nof Ellman’s reagent solution (4 mg DTNB/mL reaction buffer)\nand 2.5 mL of reaction buffer. Then, the TALG-containing solutions\nwere added into the previous test tubes for incubation for 15 min\nat room temperature. Finally, 200 μL of each solution were added\nto a 96-well plate to record the absorbance at 412 nm using Synergy\nH1 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader from BioTek. The absorbance\nvalues were used to calculate the amount of free thiols according\nto a calibration curve obtained using cysteine as standard. Characterization of the TALG-MCMC Hydrogel Rheology Rheological\nmeasurements were performed using\na Physica MCR 302 rheometer equipped with a UV curing lamp (Anton\nPaar). Two different geometries and measurement configurations were\nused for the TALG-MCMC ink and TALG-MCMC cross-linked hydrogel. A\nconventional parallel plate (geometry PP25, Ø25 mm) was used\nfor the TALG-MCMC ink measurements, and 200 μL of the ink was\nplaced between the plate and the measuring plate with 0.1 mm gap.\nIn contrast, a sandblasted parallel plate (geometry PP08/P2, Ø8\nmm) was used instead in the case of the TALG-MCMC hydrogel, to prevent\nslipping. The hydrogel disc (Ø8 mm) was placed between the fixed\nplate and the measuring plate with a 2 mm gap. In all cases, a solvent\ntrap device was employed to prevent water evaporation. The assays\nwere conducted at 37 °C to reproduce the behavior of both the\nink and the hydrogel in cell culture conditions. The amplitude\nsweep was performed on the TALG-MCMC ink to identify the linear viscoelastic\n(LVE) region over a shear strain range of 0.01 to 100%. To study gelation\nkinetics, the TALG-MCMC ink was subjected to a shear strain of 0.1%\nwithin the LVE range and a frequency of 1 Hz. The measurement was\nperformed over 170 s, with gelation initiated by exposure to a UV\ncuring lamp at 365 nm after initial 40 s. For the TALG-MCMC hydrogel,\nfrequency sweeps were conducted in triplicate to determine the storage\nmodulus ( G G –1 Swelling Test Swelling tests were performed by first\nfreeze-drying three TALG-MCMC hydrogel samples. These were weighed\nbefore immersing them in cDMEM during 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation\nunder static conditions, the gels were removed and dried with adsorbent\npaper to remove excess of water before being weighed to determine\ntheir mass. This process was repeated at intervals of 2 h, 1 day,\n2 days, and 1 week. Throughout the process, it was ensured that the\nhydrogels were always fully immersed in cDMEM for optimal diffusion\nand the experiments were made in triplicate. The swelling ratio (SR%)\nwas calculated according to the following equation SR ( % ) = W WET − W DRY W DRY · 100 Bioprinting Fabrication\nof the 3D Breast Cancer Model A multihead\n3D Discovery bioprinter (RegenHU) was used to print the core/shell\nmodel with integrated plasmonic sensors. The tumoral compartment of\nthe model contained MDA-MB-231 cells while the stroma was built with\nHBF. Before bioprinting, both cell types were fluorescently labeled\nwith two different cell trackers: MDA-MB-231 were labeled with Cell\nTracker Blue CMF 2 6 6 3 Bioprinting\nof the Pillars in the 3D Tumor-Stroma Model The previous\nmodel was heated at 37 °C for 15 min to allow the\nextruded dECM to pre-cross-link. Subsequently, the TALG-MCMC ink was\nused to print the sensors in the tumoral and stromal compartments.\nThe sensors were printed as a cylinder (6 layers) of 0.4 mm in diameter,\nusing a high-precision dispenser plunger through a dispensing needle\nwith an internal diameter of 0.6 mm (20GA) (Nordson), at a plunger\nvelocity of 0.0172 mm/s with no retraction distance (0 mm) and a volume\nflow rate of 0.780 μL/s. The cylindrical sensors were cross-linked\nwith UV light during 2.4 s upon deposition of the entire cylinder\nusing a light curing cartridge at 405 nm wavelength with a power density\nof 25.3 mW/cm 2 Incubation\nof the Models with 6-TG For the incubation\nof 6-TG within the sensors embedded in dECM, 6-TG (50 mM in DMSO stock)\nwas diluted in dECM (270 μL) to the desired final concentration\n(5 μM to 1 mM), prior to printing the sensors. After the printing,\nthe models were swollen in complete DMEM to reproduce the conditions\nof the cellular incubation. For the incubation of breast cancer cell\nmodels with 6-TG, 1 day after being printed, the models were either\ntreated with the drug or its vehicle. The treated models were swollen\nwith a solution of 400 μM 6-TG in 1%(v/v) DMSO-containing cDMEM.\nControl models were incubated with vehicle (1% (v/v) DMSO-containing\ncDMEM). Both control and treated types of models were kept on culture\nfor over 6 days and subjected to the SERS/fluorescence microscopy\nmeasurements. To investigate the differences in drug uptake between\nthe core and the stroma, we calculated the average spectra of the\nintensity maps at the top of the sensors (highest signal). From these\naverage spectra we calculated the area under the peak at 1303 cm –1 Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) Prior to\nstarting the bioprinting process, homemade holders were arranged on\ntop of quartz slides. Measurements were made using the backscattering\nconfiguration of the instrument and a Renishaw 1014 CCD Camera using\na 1024 × 256 detector with a grating of 1200 l/mm and slit opening\nof 65 μm. All measurements were conducted through a Leica 40×\nimmersion objective, with a working distance of 3 mm and a numerical\naperture of 1.4. The spectra were collected using a 785 nm laser at\n100% power (205 mW/μm 2 Figure Figure r 3 Figure r Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy\nImaging Confocal laser\nscanning fluorescence microscopy imaging was performed with a LSM880\nmicroscope (Zeiss), equipped with Ar + Scanning Electron Microscopy Sample\nPreparation TALG-MCMC hydrogels were freeze-dried.\nThe dECM samples were collected at different time points as indicated\n(1, 7, or 11 days in vitro 4 Safety Warning Osmium tetroxide\nsolutions and their\nvapors are highly toxic and severe irritants. All skin and eye contact\nmust be strictly avoided by following safety precautions: Osmium tetroxide\nmust only be handled in a fume hood and with full PPE (double gloves,\nlab coat, and chemical splash goggles). Furthermore, all waste should\nbe neutralized with oil (seed oil, corn oil, etc Lastly, the sample was washed again with\nMilli-Q water three times at 30 min each. While such long formaldehyde/glutaraldehyde\nfixations and high concentrations of osmium tetroxide can lead to\noverfixation, causing cell shrinkage and various artifacts relevant\nto histology or light microscopy characterization, we applied these\nquantities and incubation times to ensure that the fixative penetrated\nthe entire 3D volume of the sample. In fact, when shorter fixation\ntimes were used, difficulties were encountered identifying cells deep\nwithin the sample, and cells appeared damaged. SEM Measurements SEM images of the freeze-dried dECMs\nwere obtained with a JSM-IT800HL from JEOL (Tokyo, Japan), equipped\nwith a backscatter electron detector (BSE detector, scintillator-photomultiplier\ndetector design) and an elevated side-view position a detector (SE\ndetector, Everhart–Thornley (E-T) detector design) using 3–5\nkV, under high vacuum.
