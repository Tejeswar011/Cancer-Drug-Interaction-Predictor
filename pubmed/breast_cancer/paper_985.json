Introduction Throughout biological evolution, the dynamic interplay between viruses and their hosts constitutes an incessant molecular arms race. Virus-neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) serve as the primary defense armament of the immune system, leveraging their exquisite molecular specificity to fulfill irreplaceable roles in both innate and adaptive immunity [ 1 2 3 3 Currently, the preparation strategies for VNAs are becoming increasingly diversified. One approach involves isolating specific memory B cells from the peripheral blood of convalescent patients and directly cloning the naturally paired fully human heavy and light chain genes using single-cell PCR technology [ 4 9 11 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 We synthesize the molecular mechanisms of the action of VNAs and comprehensively dissect multifaceted viral escape strategies—including epitope occultation, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), and mutation accumulation under population immune pressure—while discussing cutting-edge optimization approaches such as AI-driven antibody engineering, multi-specific antibody design, and novel delivery platforms. Crucially, we integrate conformational dynamics revealed by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), AI-predicted conserved epitopes, and clinical translation case studies. By unifying the structural–functional principles of VNAs, viral evasion mechanisms, and associated challenges with emerging innovations, this work establishes a dual-pronged framework encompassing theoretical foundations and actionable development roadmaps. Our synthesis aims to catalyze synergistic advancements in precision medicine and interdisciplinary immunology–engineering convergence for next-generation VNAs development. 2. The Action Mechanisms of VNAs 2.1. Direct Neutralization Mechanisms VNAs constitute a core defensive strategy bridging innate and adaptive immunity by disrupting critical viral entry steps through targeted engagement of functional surface proteins. These mechanisms depend not only on antibody structural architectures but also on epitope accessibility, conformation dynamics, and host–pathogen interfacial interactions. Notably, virus lysis or aggregation induced by antibodies such as 8C11 and ZIKV-117 constitutes an irreversible process; even after antibody dissociation, the virus permanently loses its infectivity [ 12 13 2.1.1. Mechanisms Targeting Viral Entry Steric Blockade of Receptor-Binding Sites Steric blockade represents the canonical mechanism of antibody neutralization, wherein high-affinity Fab binding to critical functional domains of viral surface proteins physically occludes host receptor engagement. At the molecular level, complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) exploit multivalent interactions to induce epitope conformational changes, manifested through hydrogen bond network remodeling, hydrophobic core perturbation, and allosteric signal propagation ( Figure 1 CDRs establish specific binding interfaces via hydrogen bonding networks. SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody REGN10987, for instance, inserts its CDR H3 loop into the ACE2-binding site of the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Tyr102 forms a pivotal hydrogen bond with Gly485, while Asp99 engages Asn487 via salt bridge formation [ 14 15 16 17 18 19 Allosteric propagation enables antibody binding to induce cooperative conformational changes in distal domains. Influenza HA-stem antibody CR8020 binds near the fusion peptide in HA2, transmitting allosteric signals to HA1′s RBD via β-sheet hydrogen bond rearrangement, thereby inhibiting sialic acid receptor engagement [ 20 21 22 23 Polyvalency in Enhancing Neutralization Beyond conventional steric blockade, certain VNAs leverage multivalent binding sites to enhance affinity and neutralization potency through cooperative antigen engagement—a mechanism of particular significance against rapidly evolving viruses. This enhancement operates through two distinct yet interconnected dimensions ( Figure 1 Spatially, IgM pentamers form cross-linking networks via simultaneous engagement of repetitive viral epitopes by ten Fab domains [ 24 25 26 25 Conformationally, bispecific antibodies trigger allosteric communication through cooperative multi-epitope engagement. SARS-CoV-2 antibody SA55, for instance, concurrently targets the RBD and N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike trimer. NTD binding (residues 14–305) induces β-barrel rearrangement, while RBD engagement collectively elevates the spike’s conformational free-energy barrier by 1.8-fold [ 27 Inhibition of Conformational Changes Required for Fusion Notably, selected VNAs achieve irreversible functional disruption by inducing conformational locking of viral proteins—a mechanism not restricted to specific viral contexts but conserved across diverse pathogens. This paradigm reveals fundamental principles of antibody-mediated neutralization and informs next-generation antiviral strategies ( Figure 2  Freezing of the pre -fused state In respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the antibody nirsevimab precisely engages specific antigenic sites (residues 62–69 and 196–209) of the fusion (F) glycoprotein, arresting its prefusion-to-postfusion transition [ 28 29  The “obstruction” formed by the fusion holes In Ebola virus, antibody ADI-15878 binds a densely packed hydrophobic pocket within the GP base (residues 40–150), disrupting hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions between GP1 and GP2 subunits [ 30 31 In summary, the steric blocking mechanism of VNAs is fundamentally driven by antigen–antibody interaction-induced conformational rearrangements of viral surface proteins [ 32 33 34 35 2.1.2. Lysis and Replication Inhibition of Viruses VNAs confer protection not only by blocking viral entry but also through direct virion disruption or replication inhibition—mechanisms particularly critical for non-enveloped viruses and select enveloped pathogens ( Figure 2 Induction of Viral Lysis Certain VNAs trigger conformational rearrangements or mechanical stress upon binding key epitopes on viral capsids/envelope proteins, ultimately inducing virion lysis [ 36 12 37 38 Inhibition of Viral Replication Other VNAs target non-structural viral proteins (e.g., polymerases or proteases) or indirectly impede replication by disrupting host–pathogen interplay [ 39 40 41 2.2. Indirect Effect Functions VNAs amplify antiviral immunity through indirect effector functions—mediated by Fc domain engagement with host immune components—which activate diverse clearance mechanisms to broaden immune coverage and enhance durability. This process is governed not only by antibody structural features (glycosylation profiles, subclass distributions, and valency states) but also by dynamic virus–host interplay [ 42 2.2.1. Fc-Mediated Immune Clearance The Fc segment of antibodies, upon binding to immune cell surface receptors (e.g., FcγR, FcαR) or complement components, can activate immune effector mechanisms such as ADCC, ADCP, and CDC ( Figure 3 Recent in vivo studies have further quantified the contribution of the Fc effector function in controlling viral infections. Existing evidence indicates that even if the Fab segment of the antibody completely loses its neutralizing activity and fails to block viral entry, the antibody can still effectively clear infected cells, reduce viral load, and modulate the inflammatory microenvironment through pathways such as ADCC and ADCP, provided its Fc segment exhibits high affinity for activating FcγR (particularly FcγRIIIa) [ 43 44 45 46 It is noteworthy that excessively strong Fc functionality or low antibody concentrations may trigger ADE, facilitating viral evasion [ 47 ADCC ADCC eliminates pathogens or infected cells through antibody-mediated cytotoxic immune responses. VNAs initially bind target-cell antigens via their Fab domains. Subsequent Fc engagement of Fcγ receptors (e.g., FcγRIIIa/CD16) on effector cells—notably natural killer (NK) cells—triggers cytotoxic granule release (perforin/granzymes), directly lysing bound targets [ 48  IgG Subclass Specificity IgG subtypes exhibit markedly distinct FcγRIIIa affinities, directly modulating ADCC efficiency. IgG1 demonstrates higher affinity (KD ≈ 100 nM) than IgG3 (KD ≈ 300 nM) due to CH2 domain conformational stability—a divergence rooted in amino acid composition and structural dynamics [ 49 50 51  Glycosylation modification Afucosylation substantially enhances FcγRIIIa binding and ADCC potency [ 52 53 54 ADCP ADCP represents a pivotal defense mechanism wherein FcγR-bearing immune cells phagocytose antibody-opsonized targets. VNAs bridge pathogens to phagocytes (e.g., macrophages) via FcγR interactions (FcγRIIa/RI/IIIa), inducing phagocytic activation. Immune cells internalize bound targets into phagosomes [ 55 In addition to enhancing ADCC efficiency as previously mentioned, engineered modifications to the Fc region can significantly augment ADCP [ 56 57 58 59 Furthermore, the pentameric structure of multimeric IgM plays a critical role in enhancing ADCP efficiency through synergistic mechanisms. This multivalent architecture enables IgM to bind multiple antigenic epitopes simultaneously via its Fab regions, promoting the formation of high-density immune complexes [ 60 61 62 63 CDC CDC eliminates target cells (e.g., cancer cells or pathogen-infected cells) through antibody-mediated activation of the classical complement pathway, culminating in membrane attack complex (MAC) formation. The complement system—comprising ≈30 soluble and membrane-bound proteins—constitutes a critical immune component that identifies and eliminates pathogens, apoptotic cells, and cellular debris [ 64 65 Notably, antibody subtypes exhibit marked efficiency differences: IgG3 demonstrates 5-fold greater CDC activity than IgG1 due to extended hinge regions exposing additional C1q-binding sites [ 66 66 67 Furthermore, inflammatory conditions augment CDC through host protease activity. Enzymes like MMP-9 cleave antibody hinge regions, unmasking cryptic C1q-binding sites and amplifying complement activation [ 68 69 70 2.2.2. The Central Role of Secretory Immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in Mucosal Immunity sIgA constitutes the principal effector molecule of mucosal immunity, playing indispensable roles in preventing viral invasion. As respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts represent primary viral entry portals, sIgA establishes the primary defensive barrier through coordinated mechanisms—including multivalent antigen binding and transcytosis. This dynamic immunological barrier operates across multiple dimensions to suppress viral transmission and infection, while synergizing with local immune cells to enhance protection. Structurally, sIgA comprises two IgA monomers covalently linked by a joining (J) chain and noncovalently associated with secretory component (SC) derived from epithelial cells [ 71 72 73 Figure 4 The Multi-Dimensional Antiviral Mechanisms of sIgA  Spatial blocking and mucus removal At mucosal surfaces, sIgA leverages its multivalent binding capability to tightly cross-link pathogens. This direct binding induces potent steric hindrance, effectively blocking the molecular recognition and interaction between pathogen surface ligands and host cell receptors [ 74 72  Transepithelial neutralization Following synthesis by plasma cells in the lamina propria, sIgA binds the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells. This binding initiates receptor-mediated endocytosis, facilitating transcytosis across the epithelial layer before apical secretion into mucosal surfaces [ 75 76 Beyond classical transcytosis-mediated neutralization, emerging evidence indicates sIgA can enter infected cells through alternative pathways to exert intracellular antiviral effects [ 77 78 79 Mucosal Immune Memory Works in Synergy with Cells The mucosal immune system can establish a complex and highly efficient defense network by generating sIgA and forming diverse immune cell populations. In this network, the formation of immune memory and the intercellular cooperation are crucial for maintaining the long-term immune homeostasis of the mucosa. The following will elaborate in detail on CD8 +  The synergistic effect of TRM and sIgA TRM cells, as a key component of mucosal immune memory, can remain in the tissue for a long time and quickly initiate the immune response upon encountering the pathogen again, providing immediate protection for the body. Recent studies have revealed that sIgA plays an indispensable indirect regulatory role in the differentiation of TRM cells [ 80 80 81 80 A large number of experimental studies have shown that oral administration of engineered anti-rotavirus sIgA can significantly enhance the immune protection ability of the intestinal mucosa [ 82 83 84 85 84  Epigenetic regulation of B cells maintains mucosal immune stability During the mucosal immune response, the prolonged survival time of sIgA + B cells in the mucosal area is crucial for maintaining long-term immune memory and immune protection. Multiple studies have shown that this prolonged survival time is associated with various regulatory mechanisms, among which epigenetic regulation plays a key role [ 86 87 For instance, the low DNA methylation status in the promoter region of specific genes may promote the expression of genes related to cell survival, thereby prolonging the survival time of sIgA + B cells in the mucosal area [ 88 89 89 90 3. The Mechanisms by Which Viruses Evade Neutralizing Antibodies After analyzing the mechanism of action of VNAs, we further focused on the complex strategies of virus escape and antibodies. Increasing studies have shown that these intricate escape pathways not only weaken the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies but also pose severe challenges to the development of vaccines and antibody therapies [ 91 92 Table 1 3.1. Antigen Variation 3.1.1. High-Frequency Point Mutations (Point Drift) Viruses exploit the low-fidelity replication of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) or reverse transcriptases to accumulate point mutations under host immune pressure. These alterations in critical neutralizing epitopes compromise the antibody-binding capacity. For instance, the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariant JN.1 harbors L455S and F456L mutations in its spike RBD, profoundly reducing neutralization titers against monoclonal antibodies S309 and REGN10987 [ 93 94 95 95 94 3.1.2. Antigenic Shift Beyond antigenic shifts mediated by point mutations in influenza A virus’s HA/NA genes [ 95 96 97 98 3.2. Glycosylation Shielding Glycosylation shielding enables viruses to exploit host glycosylation machinery, adding glycan chains to key epitopes that create steric hindrance or charge masking to block antibody access. The HIV-1 Env “glycan shield” exemplifies this strategy: dynamic modifications at V3 loop sites N332 and N301 occlude the CDR H3 binding interface of broad-neutralizing antibody 10E8 [ 18 99 100 101 Historically, DENV epitomized glycosylation-mediated evasion. Fakhriedzwan et al. demonstrated that glycans at site N67 facilitate DENV attachment to DCs via DC-SIGN, promoting viral aggregation and infection [ 102 103 3.3. Dynamic Configuration Certain viral surface proteins exploit conformational rearrangements or dynamic fluctuations to occlude neutralizing epitopes, exposing them only during specific infection stages—a phenomenon termed conformational masking. In RSV, antigenic site Ø (residues 62–69) of the F protein undergoes β-sheet restructuring during pre to postfusion transition, preventing stable binding by antibody nirsevimab [ 104 105 106 107 3.4. Physical Masking and Molecular Camouflage Beyond molecular-level adaptations, viruses employ physical masking or molecular camouflage strategies to occlude critical epitopes. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) utilizes host-derived apolipoprotein E to form complexes that sterically shield the E2 protein’s CD81-binding domain, impeding neutralization by antibodies like AR3A [ 108 109 110 111 112 3.5. ADE As mentioned previously, sub-neutralizing or non-neutralizing antibodies can paradoxically enhance viral internalization via FcγR-mediated mechanisms—a phenomenon termed ADE. In secondary DENV infections, antibodies at sub-neutralizing concentrations (e.g., 2D22) augment viral replication within monocytes through FcγRIIa-dependent endocytosis [ 47 113 114 115 115 3.6. Immunosuppression and Antibody Interference Viruses subvert antibody-mediated immunity through immune suppression and antibody interference mechanisms, often by hijacking host immunoregulatory pathways or secreting inhibitory proteins. Human cytomegalovirus encodes Fc receptors TRL11/TRL12 that sequester IgG Fc regions, both blocking FcγR engagement and promoting antibody degradation via endocytosis-mediated interference with FcγRn recycling [ 116 117 118 119 3.7. Escape Mutations Under Herd Immunity Pressure Under herd immune pressure such as vaccine or natural infection, some viruses can accumulate escape mutations through positive selection. Recent studies have shown that the HA receptor-binding mode of human H3N2 has evolved further [ 120 120 Interestingly, the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 once again validates the classic “mutation-escape” strategy. In the case of the JN.1 variant, the P681R substitution near the furin cleavage site not only improves the pre-activation efficiency of the spike protein, but also successfully elicits neutralizing antibodies targeting the original site [ 114 121 122 123 124 125 The synergistic upgrading of transmission and immune escape is also reflected in mutations such as N501Y, L452R, and T478K: N501Y enhances the binding of ACE2 and expands the cross-species infection spectrum [ 122 126 127 127 3.8. The Synergy of Escape Strategies Beyond individual escape mechanisms, viruses synergistically deploy combinatorial strategies to achieve high-efficiency immune evasion during evolution. SARS-CoV-2 variants exemplify this through concurrent mutations: F486P in the RBD enhances ACE2 affinity, Δ144–145 deletion in the NTD masks immunodominant epitopes, and D1139H in the S2 subunit retards fusion kinetics—collectively enabling escape from monoclonal antibody cocktails [ 128 129 130 130 Collectively, viruses evade VNAs through multifaceted and mechanistically complex strategies that amplify viral diversity while posing challenges to existing vaccines and antibody therapies. Future research must elucidate the molecular foundations of these escape pathways to develop pan-variant neutralizing antibodies and universal vaccines resilient to viral evolution. 4. Perspectives and Closing Remarks Current advances in VNAs development have ushered in an era of profound convergence among computational biology, immune engineering, and clinical medicine. This technological synergy not only accelerates the generation of high-potency antibodies but also extends the frontiers of precision medicine through multidisciplinary integration, providing transformative tools to counter viral evolution while addressing personalized therapeutic imperatives. 4.1. Rational Design of Antibodies Driven by Computational Biology AI-driven computational tools leveraging high-fidelity modeling are redefining antibody design paradigms. Deep generative models such as IgLM simulate the sequence landscape of natural antibody repertoires to predict CDR conformational diversity, enabling the successful engineering of broad-spectrum neutralizing antibodies including SA55—which targets SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants (e.g., XBB.1.5) through synergistic engagement of RBD and NTD epitopes on the spike protein, substantially curtailing viral escape [ 131 132 133 134 135 4.2. Immunoengineering Empowers the Innovation of Antibody Function and Delivery Breakthroughs in synthetic biology and protein engineering are expanding the functional boundaries of antibodies. Multi-specific antibody designs have significantly improved the antiviral spectrum. For example, the two-epitope antibody CoV-X2 targets a conserved region of the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and can neutralize a variety of variants, including JN.1 [ 136 137 138 In terms of delivery system, the combination of nanoparticles and mucosal delivery technology achieves local immune protection: liposomal nanoparticles loaded with sIgA can block the binding of the influenza virus HA protein to host receptors in the respiratory mucosa and activate memory T cell responses by nasal administration [ 139 140 141 4.3. Individualized Treatment Strategies in the Context of Precision Medicine Breakthroughs in single-cell sequencing and high-throughput screening technologies have propelled antibody development from population-level approaches to single-cell precision. Single-cell sequencing enables the simultaneous resolution of full-length antibody sequences from thousands of immune cells in a single experiment, directly capturing natively paired heavy- and light-chain genes. This advancement compresses the discovery timeline for candidate antibodies from months to weeks [ 142 143 144 + 145 146 147 Collectively, these cases delineate an end-to-end precision R&D pipeline spanning discovery, design, and production. Future antibody development may thus adopt a tripartite strategy: first, leveraging single-cell sequencing and high-throughput screening to identify optimal candidates; second, broadening immune coverage through multipathogen antigen combinations; and finally, utilizing synthetic biology tools like yeast glycoengineering for cost-effective manufacturing. This trajectory will usher neutralizing antibodies into a new era of individualized therapy driven by ‘single-monoclonal, single-cell, and single-genome’ paradigms. 4.4. Future Directions and R&D Challenges In summary, the field of VNAs is advancing rapidly toward achieving greater breadth, extended durability, and precision targeting. However, each technological innovation necessitates rigorous optimization and validation. Critical forward-looking questions remain unresolved: How can we shift from reactive antibody development to proactive design that anticipates viral evolutionary trajectories? For specific pathogens (e.g., HIV and influenza viruses), how do we strike an optimal balance between Fab-mediated neutralization potency and Fc-driven effector functions? Beyond efficacy, how can emerging production platforms (e.g., mRNA, yeast expression systems) overcome cost and manufacturing barriers to ensure global accessibility? Substantial challenges persist across three domains: (i) Biological challenges: Rapid viral mutations and antigenic diversity demand iterative antibody design. Before the arrival of new variant viruses, can we shift from reactive antibody design (responding to new variants) to proactive/predictive design anticipating viral evolution (AI-guided approaches)? With the crossdisciplinary integration and the development of AI technology, VNAs are gradually moving from “passively following virus evolution” to a new paradigm of “active prediction-active design”. Generative AI platforms (e.g., EVEscape, AlphaFold-Multimer, RFdiffusion) now enable proactive prediction of epitope evolution and antibody sequences months before new variants emerge, facilitating ‘zero-lag’ antibody library generation [ 148 149 (ii) Technological and translational challenges: The development of antibody drugs has long faced challenges such as large-scale production, long-term safety, and cost control [ 150 151 152 (iii) Logistical and regulatory challenges: Regulatory frameworks must evolve to address novel modalities. mRNA-encoded antibodies and highly engineered formats (e.g., multi-specifics, Fc-modified antibodies) pose unique evaluation complexities for agencies like the FDA and EMA. Overcoming these demands integrating computational biology, synthetic immunology, and clinical insights. The future of VNAs hinges on systemic integration. Synergizing AI-driven epitope prediction, programmable manufacturing, adaptive regulatory policies, and global health equity strategies will forge an efficient ‘design-produce-deliver-reimburse’ continuum. This promises to transform VNAs from bench innovations into accessible public health resources.

Weakening the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies increases the difficulty of developing vaccines and antibody therapies. Antigenic shift Viruses acquire completely new epitopes through genome recombination or genotype transformation, thereby evading existing antibody responses. It deactivates existing antibodies and increases the risk of transmission and infection. Glycosylation shielding Glycosylation Viruses add glycan chains around key epitopes to form steric or charge shielding that prevents antibody binding. Prevent antibody binding and enhance the ability of the virus to escape. Dynamic configuration Tablet hiding and dynamic exposure The viral surface protein hides neutralizing epitopes through conformational rearrangement or dynamic fluctuations and is only exposed at specific stages of infection. It is difficult to be continuously recognized by antibodies, increasing the chance of immune escape. Physical masking and molecular camouflage Physical shielding epitopes and the evasion of antibody recognition Viruses use external molecules to physically mask the epitopes, or they use molecular signals to deceive, thereby resisting antibody recognition. Block antibody recognition and reduce neutralization efficiency. ADE effect Antibody-dependent enhancement When inefficient antibodies are present, the virus particles can passively enter the cells through the FcγR pathway to enhance infection. Enhance the ability to infect and make antibody therapy ineffective. Immunosuppression and antibody interference Competition of immunoreactive agents or antibodies Viruses reduce antibody effectiveness by secreting immunosuppressants or inducing antibody competition. Interferes with immune response and weakens antibody efficacy. Escape mutations under herd immunity pressure Mutations under population immunization selection pressure Viruses produce adaptive mutations under the pressure of herd immunity to escape herd immunity response. Increases the risk of transmission and infection, challenging herd immunity strategies. ",
