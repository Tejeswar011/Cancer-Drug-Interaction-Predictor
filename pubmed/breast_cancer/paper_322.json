This systematic review examines how TAI and large language models (LLMs), including large language model meta ai (LLaMA), can be integrated into telehealth systems, their role in optimizing e‐consultation workflows, and their capacity to support personalized care through data collected by wearable biosensors and biological microelectromechanical systems (BioMEMS). These devices monitor physiological and behavioral data, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and emotional state. TAI enables effective diagnostics and targeted treatment by combining various information sources, including biosensor readings, patient history, and cognitive data. Firmware integrity plays a crucial role in ensuring security, reliability, and continuous data encryption. This review analyses 135 papers (October 2020‐March 2025) from databases like IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Scopus to demonstrate TAI's potential to enhance resource use and patient engagement. However, widespread adoption depends on overcoming technical challenges, improving firmware reliability, strengthening data security, and addressing ethical concerns. This review offers valuable guidance for engineers, system architects, and healthcare providers to create a sensitive and effective telehealth ecosystem. The graphical abstract illustrates how TAI telehealth systems integrate biosensors with knowledge‐based systems through LLMs and firmware. The diagram shows the continuous process starting with real‐time data collection and ending with secure, personalized healthcare delivery. The role of firmware is crucial in protecting data integrity and enhancing security measures, while remaining adaptable to changing telehealth needs.

The following section (Section 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 Method and Materials 2.1 Database Selection Rationale Our research objectives required a systematic review of articles between October 2020 and March 2025 from major databases that specialize in AI, telehealth, and healthcare fields. Our research utilized the databases IEEE Xplore and PubMed, together with Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. IEEE Xplore served as the top priority database because it contains a vast collection of peer‐reviewed articles and conference papers focused on AI and engineering applications in healthcare, which provide essential resources for telehealth technical advancement. The extensive biomedical content available through PubMed made it an ideal choice because it enabled researchers to access telehealth studies focusing on clinical practice and patient results. The research utilized Scopus and ScienceDirect because these databases offer multidisciplinary research access to high‐quality studies from engineering, computer science, and medical sciences fields. The research included Google Scholar because it allowed the retrieval of scholarly articles from diverse sources, which encompassed materials not typically found in conventional databases. The authors chose these databases due to their expertise in building a solid foundation for identifying high‐quality research on TAI and telehealth applications. The three databases provide comprehensive scholarly coverage of technical advancements, alongside clinical studies and multidisciplinary research, which fulfill the study requirements. 2.2 Literature Selection Rationale To include a broad range of relevant keywords, we used Boolean logic in crafting our search strategy, including: ‘Telemedicine’, ‘AI’, ‘Trustworthy’, ‘Telehealth’, ‘LMM’, ‘ChatGPT’, ‘Knowledge‐Based Systems’, ‘AI Telehealth Systems’, ‘Biosensors’, ‘BioMEMS’, ‘Wearable Telehealth Systems’, ‘Regulatory’, ‘Cybersecurity’, ‘Explainable AI’, ‘Ethical’, and ‘Telemonitoring’. These terms were combined with operators such as ‘AND’ and ‘OR’ to cover all literature relevant to AI applications in telemedicine and telehealth systems. Only articles that met strict criteria were included: articles that used AI models in telemedicine, telehealth, or recommendation systems for wearable health monitoring in original studies. Excluded were reviews, letters, conference papers, case reports, and studies not falling within the specified criterion. The final sample of 135 articles reflects a refined approach to this topic, shedding light on AI‐driven progress in telehealth. The PRISMA‐style flow diagram is presented in Figure 2 FIGURE 2 The PRISMA flow diagram of the literature search. 2.3 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The systematic review included strict selection standards, which enabled researchers to pick 135 methodologically sound articles from a large pool of studies. The study selection focused on original research articles published in English that examined TAI in telehealth across remote patient monitoring, clinical decision support, and patient engagement systems from October 2020 through March 2025. The review excluded non‐empirical research types, including reviews, letters, editorials, conference papers, and case reports, together with research on unrelated subjects or non‐English publications, to maintain focus on novel and empirical evidence within specified boundaries. 2.4 Data Extraction Paradigm In this phase, we describe the structured approach to extracting, evaluating, and synthesizing data from relevant studies, with a focus on AI applications in telehealth. 135 primary sources were reviewed thoroughly in Figure 2 Empirical evidence: To extract substantial evidence, four core components were reviewed. Datasets utilized: Most studies used public and proprietary datasets of biometric, behavioral, and health metrics (e.g., Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), PPG data). Features for analysis: The extracted features included HRV, oxygen saturation, cognitive load indicators, and emotional states, which are essential to assess patient health in real time. Models/methods applied: The methodologies were supervised and unsupervised learning, expert systems, and knowledge‐based AI for problem domains of early stress and fatigue detection, symptom prediction, and patient engagement. Evaluation metrics: Novelty, Accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and latency were standard metrics used to assess model performance, which reflect the system's reliability in real‐time, life‐critical applications. This systematic extraction and monitoring process offers a data‐driven path for designing telehealth systems to optimize patient outcomes and operational efficiency, and a foundation for addressing our research goals. Figure 3 FIGURE 3 A summary of the systematic review data includes essential features found in the included research studies. The visual depicts the frequencies of AI systems, including LLMs, DL, and knowledge‐based systems, as well as telehealth solutions, starting from remote monitoring, e‐consultations, and diagnostic imaging, with evaluation criteria such as accuracy, sensitivity, and latency. 3 Telehealth Paradigm in the Health Care System With the advent of hardware, firmware, smart wearable devices, and TAI‐based recommendation systems, telehealth has changed the patient monitoring and treatment modality. It has been integrated into the healthcare system [ 52 53 54 3.1 Smart Wearable Devices in Telehealth Systems Telehealth is built on smart wearable devices that continuously and non‐invasively monitor key physiological metrics [ 55 4 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 2 FIGURE 4 The various types of smart wearable devices for telehealth applications.

Sensor calibration and configuration, data encryption for privacy protection, cyber threat protection, performance tuning, and system updates are provided by key functions [ 51 85 86 3.4 Software in Telehealth Systems A telemedicine platform, patient management systems (PMS), data analytics, and user interface (UI) modules are the software layer of the system which are critical to the system's usability and effectiveness [ 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 3.5 Real‐Time Health Monitoring For telehealth, real‐time health monitoring is crucial to provide real‐time insights into patients’ health metrics [ 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 93 115 116 117 97 118 3.6 AI‐Based Recommendation System The intelligent core of telehealth is the TAI‐based recommendation system, which takes data and turns it into actionable insights. Multi‐source inputs, such as real‐time data from wearables, historical patient records, environmental factors, and biopatterns, are fed into advanced AI algorithms that recommend personalized healthcare [ 119 120 4 The Role of AI in Telehealth Its adoption into the field of telehealth has proven to be an integration of AI as a transformative agent that reshapes how healthcare services can be delivered remotely. There are many aspects of AI's role in telehealth, including diagnostic accuracy, personalizing treatment plans, resource allocation efficiency, and patient engagement. AI systems achieve improved telehealth efficiency through a combination analysis of various health data sources, which enables them to detect small medical patterns and forecast patient results as well as direct resources effectively. In this section, we will explain these aspects and how AI technologies will change the future of telehealth. 4.1 Deep Learning in Telehealth Telehealth allows diagnostic imaging research and predictive modeling as well as natural language processing (NLP) sessions to progress through DL algorithms that rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and attention‐based models. Research shows that CNNs deliver biomedical data analysis and pattern recognition results that equal or surpass human professional standards [ 34 121 122 123 124 125 126 4.2 Personalizing Treatment Plans Without AI, responsible for creating personalized treatment plans, telehealth services can't exist. AI algorithms can learn to recommend personalized therapy for several diseases using data from EHRs, wearables, and genetic information [ 127 128 129 130 131 132 127 129 130 133 4.3 Optimizing Resource Allocation Telehealth system resource allocation can be more efficiently done by AI, which can analyse data patterns. Through predictive analytics, you can identify patient populations at risk for certain conditions, and healthcare systems can then proactively allocate resources, not reactively [ 134 135 136 4.4 Methods to Improve Explainability in AI Decisions The implementation of TAI in healthcare requires explainability to provide transparency, which enables trust‐building between healthcare providers and patients. The AI model interpretability is enhanced through the methods SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model‐agnostic explanations (LIME) [ 137 138 139 140 4.5 Improving Patient Engagement in AI‐Driven Telehealth Systems Telehealth systems that use AI require patient engagement to achieve their success goals. The evaluation of patient satisfaction scores, along with adherence rates and system usage frequencies, together with patient‐reported outcomes (PROs), enables healthcare professionals to measure successfully interactive system performance and improved health results [ 141 142 143 136 144 145 5 Telehealth, LLMs, and Knowledge‐Based Systems Telehealth, LLMs, and knowledge‐based systems at the intersection are a game‐changing shift in how healthcare can be delivered and optimized remotely [ 146 147 148 149 150 14 151 152 153 5.1 The Role of LLMs in Telehealth The use of LLMs, including most recently LLaMA, has dramatically changed telehealth by empowering sophisticated language processing and natural conversation abilities [ 154 155 156 5.2 Knowledge‐Based Systems for Clinical Decision Support Knowledge‐based systems in telehealth are used as a repository of medical knowledge, decision protocols, and clinical guidelines. By integrating with LLMs, Knowledge‐Based Systems improve the reliability and accuracy of AI‐driven recommendations using verified medical data and contextual patient information [ 157 158 159 5.3 Practical Risks of LLMs in Telehealth The practical risks associated with LLMs in telehealth need careful management because they present substantial potential for telehealth improvement. The occurrence of ‘hallucinations’ stands as one of the significant risks because LLMs produce wrong and nonsensical information that misleads users. The combination of training data restrictions, ambiguous prompts, and probabilistic system operation leads to hallucinations. Healthcare facilities face the risk of inaccurate diagnoses, improper treatment decisions, and patient safety problems due to such system errors [ 160 161 162 163 164 3 TABLE 3 Taxonomy of LLM risks and mitigation strategies. Risk category Manifestations Mitigation strategies Validation methods Hallucinations  Factual inaccuracies Plausible but incorrect recommendations  Knowledge‐base grounding Human‐in‐the‐loop verification  Clinical trial testing Expert panel review Bias  Demographic disparities Unequal performance across populations  Fairness‐aware fine‐tuning Diverse training datasets  Subgroup analysis Equity audits Privacy  Data leakage risks Re‐identification potential  Differential privacy training Secure multi‐party computation  Penetration testing Compliance certification Interpretability  Black‐box decision making Unclear reasoning chains  XAI techniques (LIME/SHAP) Decision provenance tracking  Clinician usability studies Transparency scoring John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 5.4 Scenario‐Based Applications and Use of LLaMA in Telehealth Moreover, LLaMA's potential in advanced, scenario‐based applications of LLaMA in telehealth is to tailor healthcare interventions to specific clinical needs. By simulating diverse patient scenarios, LLaMA can provide support to healthcare providers in being proactive with, and more personalized, care [ 149 165 166 167 5 FIGURE 5 Illustrative applications of LLMs, such as LLaMA, in telehealth. The illustration shows three essential use cases where LLaMA combines chronic disease management, post‐operative care, and emergency response to boost healthcare decisions in regular and critical situations. 5.4.1 Chronic Disease Management LLMs can manage patient history, medication adherence, and real‐time biosensor data such as a wearable blood glucose or blood pressure device. This can then provide personalized advice, recommend lifestyle adjustments, and inform patients or caregivers of possible health risks [ 168 5.4.2 Post‐Operative Care LLMs can remind patients recovering from surgery about medication, assess their pain levels using conversation, and help patients take care of their wounds. The model reduces the likelihood of complications by proactively engaging the patient in adherence to post‐surgical protocols [ 169 5.4.3 Emergency Situations In cases such as suspected heart attacks, epileptic seizures, or stroke, LLMs can very quickly evaluate symptoms reported by patients, risk factors, and can give quick instructions in the meantime until emergency services come. In these cases, LLMs’ speed and accuracy in processing symptoms and suggesting first‐response actions can be lifesaving [ 170 171 169 164 4 TABLE 4 The comparison of different AI telehealth frameworks.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 6 BioMEMS in Telehealth BioMEMS are compact, integrated devices that combine biological elements with micro‐scale mechanical and electrical components, offering transformative potential in telehealth. Their small size enables minimally invasive monitoring, gathering continuous, high‐resolution data necessary for accurate health management in remote settings [ 172 173 174 175 6.1 Implantable Biosensors in Telehealth Embedded within the body, BioMEMS continuously monitors biometrics like blood glucose, respiratory rates, and other physiological parameters, offering real‐time data crucial for managing chronic conditions such as diabetes [ 176 177 178 179 180 6.2 Biosensor‐BioMEMS Integration in TAI Architectures Using biosensors and BioMEMS in TAI systems provides a solid structure for safe remote healthcare monitoring. At this stage, implantable BioMEMS devices can provide accurate measurements (SNR > 20 dB) that are not affected by motion, and their embedded firmware allows for real‐time validation of the data and secure sending [ 181 182 183 184 6.3 Wearable Health Monitors Wearable devices integrate BioMEMS for non‐invasive measurement of key health indicators, such as HRV, hydration status, body temperature, bladder pressure, and sometimes stress levels via skin conductance or ECG [ 185 186 187 6.4 LOC Diagnostics in Telehealth A specialized form of BioMEMS, LOC systems are miniaturized laboratories on a single chip capable of complex biochemical tests (e.g., blood or urine analysis) [ 188 189 6.5 Drug Delivery Systems in Telehealth Implantable drug delivery systems that indeed release specific doses of medication at pre‐determined times are also a form of BioMEMS technology [ 190 191 192 7 Technical Challenges and Risks in Telehealth In the context of telehealth, there are many technical challenges and risks related to firmware design and development, security, noise and interference management, intrusion prevention, and adaptability to extreme environmental conditions [ 193 7.1 The Critical Role of Firmware in Telehealth Firmware is the middleman between hardware and higher‐level applications that are used to control, manage, and support sensors and monitoring systems. Firmware design and development are of utmost importance in telehealth systems because they guarantee that data acquired from sensors is transmitted to the system without error and continuously [ 194 195 196 197 198 199 5 TABLE 5 The optimization strategies for firmware in AI‐driven health devices.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 7.2 Security Challenges in Telehealth Data security and patient privacy are among the most pressing concerns in telehealth systems. These systems, which transmit sensitive personal and health‐related information, require robust protection to guard against potential threats and unauthorized access [ 200 201 93 202 203 90 204 205 206 207 7.3 Noise and Interference Management Telehealth systems are frequently deployed in real‐world, noisy environments where various forms of interference can affect sensor data quality [ 208 209 210 7.4 Intrusion Detection and System Safety Another technical challenge is safeguarding systems against cyber intrusions and attacks. Telehealth systems often operate over public or private networks, making them susceptible to cybersecurity threats [ 211 194 200 7.5 Adaptability to Extreme Environmental Conditions The performance of telehealth systems in extreme conditions such as very high or low temperatures, high humidity, or unstable atmospheric conditions also poses a considerable challenge. Firmware and hardware in these systems must be designed to withstand such harsh environments to maintain their functionality and accuracy. Using resilient materials and weather‐resistant designs enhances the reliability of these systems in diverse environmental conditions [ 210 7.6 Cost Implications of AI‐Driven Telehealth Systems The implementation of AI technology within telehealth systems offers both financial benefits and implementation difficulties regarding cost. AI‐driven solutions lower long‐term healthcare expenses, but significant costs emerge from developing and obtaining data, along with training models during initial implementation. Existing infrastructure integration with AI technology requires substantial spending, since it includes both customization work and solving interoperability problems [ 212 213 214 215 7.7 Ethical Considerations Ethical considerations have always been critical to the design and deployment of firmware in telehealth [ 36 216 217 36 218 7.8 AI Bias and Fairness in Telehealth The implementation of AI in healthcare demands complete evaluations of bias and fairness to preserve equitable healthcare services [ 216 212 219 220 7.9 Regulatory Challenges in AI‐Driven Telehealth To successfully implement AI in telehealth, one must address the complicated set of regulations, including HIPAA in the U.S. and the GDPR in the European Union [ 221 222 223 224 7.10 Real‐World Case Studies of AI‐Related Data Breaches in Healthcare The essential requirement for AI‐driven telehealth systems to implement strong cybersecurity becomes apparent through current real‐life incidents [ 225 226 227 228 229 7.11 Mitigating Biases in AI‐Powered Healthcare The attainment of equal patient medical care depends on resolving bias problems in AI systems employed in healthcare. The implementation of AI systems requires structured datasets that represent various groups of patients to achieve accurate performance for all patient demographics. AI Fairness 360 from IBM and fairness metrics need to be used for regular auditing and bias detection operations [ 230 231 232 8 Discussion and Conclusion Integration of TAI and knowledge‐based systems into telehealth represents a transformative approach to modern healthcare, which enables continuous, real‐time monitoring and decision support, particularly in remote and underserved environments [ 233 234 114 235 6 FIGURE 6 The SWOT analysis in telehealth. Also, the implementation of TAI in telehealth produces various technical and ethical problems as well as regulatory and operational boundaries. The successful implementation of TAI telehealth depends on two things: optimizing the firmware to ensure reliable data integrity and system performance while establishing strong data protection measures, reducing noise levels, and promoting cross‐data source connectivity [ 236 118 237 238 239 240 241 8.1 Roadmap for Implementing TAI in Telehealth A systematic framework is required to integrate TAI into telehealth systems properly. Below is a seven‐step framework: Step 1. The setting of ethical regulations and regulatory frameworks must include standards for transparency, together with fairness and accountability measures that meet the requirements from HIPAA and GDPR. Step 2. Healthcare groups should build an extensive data governance framework that includes both quality, privacy, and security protocols for protected patient information. Step 3. XAI methods, including SHAP and LIME, should be integrated to enhance understanding of AI‐driven recommendations and establish trust in AI systems. Step 4. The system should maintain secure data processing by using a modular design and OTA updates in combination with energy‐efficient firmware. Step 5. AI systems need pilot tests that run performance evaluations to handle ethical problems and improve algorithms through feedback from the medical environment. Step 6. Healthcare providers and patients, together with policymakers, should collaborate to guarantee that AI systems fulfill clinical and ethical requirements. Step 7. The evaluation of AI systems concerning compliance issues, as well as performance standards and bias detection, needs to be performed continuously to maintain long‐term operational integrity and dependability. The roadmap creates an organized system for stakeholders to integrate TAI in telehealth to achieve secure and equitable medical care. 8.2 Future Directions The upcoming 5–10‐year period will introduce revolutionary transformations to AI‐based telehealth services that will change medical diagnostics, as well as individualized healthcare and tele‐monitoring systems, and regulatory authorities. Through AI, medical facilities will achieve real‐time, accurate image assessments, including X‐rays and magnetic resonance images (MRIs), matching the ability of specialist medical professionals, thus shortening diagnostic periods and enhancing therapeutic success. Alternative medicine will apply AI processing to genetics, together with environmental and lifestyle factors, to optimize treatment solutions for patients suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure. The future of wearable biosensors involves constant health metric assessment through containment methods, which AI technology will use to identify problems early and prevent them. The approval bodies will develop ethical rules that address the protection of personal data, while also covering biases and privacy standards for making AI systems transparent and unbiased. Standardized protocols such as FHIR and HL7 facilitate smooth data exchange, which lets the AI system receive entire patient records for precise predictions and scalability across nations. LLMs, along with generative AI systems, will establish essential roles in improving clinical support functions, medical report creation, and patient‐practitioner communication using natural language processing capabilities. AI‐powered telehealth services will create an environment that provides exact and personalized healthcare to patients. Finally, this research demonstrates the great promise of TAI‐driven telehealth systems to transform healthcare delivery by enabling precise, proactive care tailored to each patient. These systems can allow healthcare professionals to leverage timely, data‐driven insights to improve patient outcomes and build trust in AI‐powered healthcare solutions by optimizing firmware, developing robust security frameworks, and ensuring algorithm transparency. While we are moving toward broader adoption, it will be critical to have a balanced focus on performance, security, and ethical integrity to realize the transformative potential of TAI in healthcare fully. This systematic review identified several challenges and limitations that may affect the comprehensiveness and accuracy of literature evaluation. Despite double‐checking measures, relevant studies may have been missed through the use of keyword constraints or sorting criteria in major databases (e.g., IEEE Xplore, PubMed), and a range of search terms to enhance construct validity. Errors from the large workload in data extraction, comparison, and coding were mitigated with cross‐checking, but some misinterpretations may remain. In addition, our findings are limited in their external validity due to limitations in the generalizability of our results to other telehealth contexts and methods. Future systematic reviews of telehealth would achieve improved consistency, reproducibility, and applicability if they used standardized frameworks with broader study scopes. 8.3 Conclusion This review identified how TAI, together with LLMs, wearable biosensors, and knowledge‐based systems, affects telehealth platform implementation and ethics during operations. Research demonstrates that TAI enhances clinical decision support, patient interaction, and operational efficiency through LLaMA and ChatGPT, along with other LLMs, which boost symptom understanding and medical diagnosis. Biosensors attached to the body, together with BioMEMS, provide continuous patient monitoring to generate individual treatment recommendations. The system reliability depends on resolving three critical issues, including firmware optimization and data security, as well as noise management. The implementation of TAI creates ethical matters because it exposes patients to algorithmic biases and privacy risks, which need XAI systems and fair algorithms to combat these problems. TAI delivers better diagnostic results, patient outcomes, and resource efficiency than traditional telehealth, yet needs proper deployment to manage associated safety concerns. Local experts from both engineering fields, medical branches, and policy groups need to form teams to overcome TAI implementation challenges. Future research needs to validate TAI clinical outcomes over extended periods while creating standardized procedures for data protection and both technical and moral compliance. The resolution of these gaps will allow TAI to transform telehealth into an improved system that offers fair patient care and enhances operational efficiency. Telehealth receives a revolutionary healthcare upgrade through TAI and knowledge‐based systems that support real‐time patient checks, personalized medicine delivery, and clinical decision systems for areas that lack medical support. System architectures that combine LLMs and biosensor data enable healthcare providers to generate valuable discoveries that help manage chronic diseases and understand post‐operative recovery and emergencies. Their achievement depends on resolving multiple essential obstacles. The smooth functioning between hardware and software components relies on optimized firmware because it enables data consistency and system connection while delivering instant responses. The protection of sensitive patient information has become a primary priority, so healthcare providers require highly advanced encryption measures, as well as intrusion detection systems and full cybersecurity frameworks. Scalability and reliability face obstacles because of the need to deal with noise interference, harsh environmental conditions, and the high costs of AI implementation. Ethical considerations are equally vital. Satellite health services must ensure clear data practices, combined with patient‐consent protocols and easy‐to‐understand AI decision processes, for healthcare providers to trust the system. Equitable healthcare delivery depends on two critical measures: first, we need to fix algorithmic bias; second, we need to maintain fair treatment across different patient ethnic groups. AI development needs ethical guidelines that establish responsibility and comprehensive inclusion, especially in situations with high risk, such as emergency medical situations. The success of AI‐driven telehealth in the future requires the combined solutions of extensive testing, cross‐sector partnerships, and prolonged assessments of the system. TAI systems will provide precise, patient‐centered, proactive care when firmware optimization, security improvement, and algorithm transparency measures are implemented. The combination of LLMs with knowledge‐based systems will enhance both clinical decision quality and patient participation in healthcare services. The deployment of sustainable and fair telehealth solutions needs technical excellence to align with ethical standards that ensure patient well‐being through trust and safety protection for all users.
