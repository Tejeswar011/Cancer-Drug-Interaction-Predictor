Abstract Background Acupuncture therapy shows promise in managing aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia (AIA) among breast cancer patients. An umbrella review synthesizes findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRs/MAs) to assess its effectiveness. Summary This umbrella review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture therapy in treating AIA among breast cancer patients by analyzing existing evidence from SRs/MAs. Key Messages Six SRs/MAs were analyzed, revealing shortcomings in reporting quality, methodological quality, and evidence quality assessment. Comprehensive searches across eight electronic databases were conducted. PRISMA, AMSTAR 2, and GRADE were utilized to assess reporting, methodological quality, and evidence quality, respectively. Despite methodological shortcomings, a recent meta-subgroup analysis suggests the efficacy of acupuncture therapy for AIA patients, recommending a 10-session treatment course. Conclusion Acupuncture is identified as a secure and effective remedy for AIA sufferers, yet further high-quality research is needed to strengthen the evidence base and endorse acupuncture as a viable treatment option.
