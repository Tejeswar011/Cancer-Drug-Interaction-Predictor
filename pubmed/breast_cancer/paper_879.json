Thus, these populations are largely overlooked in health policy making. Persistent gender inequalities, socioeconomic divides, and racial-ethnic discrimination, particularly in low-resource communities, have exacerbated women’s health concerns, delaying advancements in care and accessibility. However, recent years have seen the emergence of tracking technologies and wearable devices that enable long-term biomonitoring of key health biomarkers which promise to facilitate early disease diagnosis for women from all walks of life. These innovations value education and accessibility, which can break down barriers to health care access and management that has affected generations of women around the world. This review discusses emerging biomonitoring technologies for diagnosing and managing critical women’s health conditions as defined by the World Health Organization, including breast and gynecological cancers, vaginal infections, fertility, pregnancy and post-menopausal osteoporosis. Additionally, we examine the current commercial landscape of women’s health technologies, highlighting barriers to adoption, such as medical insurance access and socioeconomic status, as well as discuss opportunities for future innovation. In global healthcare systems, sex and gender biases have led to a health gap that affects diverse populations of women. This review highlights emerging wearable, biomonitoring, and diagnostic technologies to address this health gap, examines the commercial landscape and barriers to adoption, and discusses opportunities for future innovation.

Osteoporosis is a musculoskeletal condition characterized by bone mineral density (BMD) loss due to heightened osteoclast activity 123 124 125 126 127 2e 125 Wearables measuring BMD provide a more direct strategy for monitoring osteoporosis compared to gait. For instance, emerging wearable armbands use ultrasonic transduction to measure BMD, detecting femoral ultrasonic velocity (3404.46 m s −1 128 129 131 Wireless wearable technologies for vaginal infection Vaginitis, or vaginal infection, one of the most common reasons women seek medical attention, impacts sexual and reproductive health 132 133 134 135 136 BV, the most frequent vaginal infection among reproductive-age women, is characterized by microbiome imbalances, particularly a loss of Lactobacilli Gardnerella Prevotella Mobiluncus 132 134 132 136 137 137 Research on wearable vaginal infection diagnostics remains limited, underscoring the need for further innovation. Several pH-based biosensors have been developed for BV and VVC detection. For example, intravaginal biosensing rings monitor pH levels continuously using a fluorescent polyelectrolyte-coated porous silica sensor on a PDMS ring 138 139 2f 140 These biosensors provide cost-effective, real-time data, but they also face design challenges related to comfort, durability, safety, and hygiene. Issues with adhesion, connectivity, and interference from biological fluids (e.g., menstrual blood) further complicate their adoption. Additionally, pH monitoring alone is insufficient for definitive diagnosis, as abnormal pH is common to both BV and trichomoniasis, necessitating supplementary diagnostic methods 141 Beyond pH sensing, innovative biosensors targeting specific vaginal pathogens could enhance diagnostic accuracy. For instance, a thiolated aptamer-based AuNP sensor detects glucans on Candida albicans 142 143 Despite advances in BV and VVC detection, wearable diagnostics for trichomoniasis remain unexplored. Expanding biosensor technologies to include pathogen-specific markers and multi-analyte detection could facilitate at-home vaginal health monitoring, offering more accurate, accessible, and user-friendly solutions. Portable diagnostics of women-prevalent conditions Portable diagnostic devices have notable advantages including POC, real-time results, and minimal infrastructure requirements, making them particularly beneficial for women’s health. However, research and development efforts have largely focused on vaginitis and cancer, leaving many other conditions unexplored. Expanding existing POC technology could substantially improve diagnostic accessibility and quality of life. WHO emphasizes that POC devices should align with ASSURED criteria—affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid, equipment-free, and deliverable 144 Point-of-care technologies for vaginal infection detection Timely and accurate detection of vaginitis is crucial, particularly in pregnancy, to prevent complications 145 Enzyme-activity-based technology for POC devices Bacterial enzymes such as vaginolysin (VLY) and sialidase (SLD) are key virulence factors in BV 146 3a 146 149 Fig. 3 Diagnostic devices for women-prevalent conditions. a b 158 c d https://BioRender.com/t20f565 SLD has been the target of numerous colorimetric and fluorescent biosensors. A reported colorimetric biosensor uses 20-(5-bromo-4-chloroindol-3-yl)-a-D-N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (BCIN), which changes color upon contact with vaginal fluid containing SLD 150 150 151 148 152 LAMP-based POC devices In the diagnosis of VVC, chlamydia trachomatis (CT), and neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), current gold standard tests include cell culture technology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), and PCR-based assays. Of these methods, PCR is the most clinically used as it has >90% sensitivity and specificity 153 154 More accessible POC-compatible alternatives to PCR are loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA). LAMP is a rapid, low-cost, and straightforward method for nucleic acid amplification, capable of amplifying the target gene within one hour under an isothermal cycle (50–60 °C) (Fig. 3b 153 153 155 156 While lateral flow assays (LFAs) are commonly used in BV POC biosensors, they lack the sensitivity and speed of NAATs 137 157 158 157 159 Bacteriophage-based biosensing technologies Bacteriophage (phage)-based biosensing is an emerging tool for the detection of bacterial pathogens in various settings 160 161 162 163 Diagnostic technologies for breast and gynecological cancers Early cancer detection significantly improves survival rates by enabling timely, less invasive treatment 164 165 166 164 2 Enrichment of early-stage women cancer biomarkers Serological biomarkers are commonly used in immunosensors, ELISAs, and PCR, with key breast and gynecological cancer biomarkers including breast cancer associated gene 1 and 2 (BRCA1 and BRCA2), cancer antigen-125 (CA-125), human epididymis protein 4 (HE-4), mesothelin alpha fetoprotein, osteopontin, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and human papillomavirus (HPV) virus. However, these markers may overlap with non-cancerous conditions, leading to false negatives 167 168 169 170 171 172 Alternative biomarkers for cancer detection focus on biomolecules secreted by breast and gynecological cancer cells into biological fluids, such as extracellular vehicles (EVs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), microRNA (miRNA), and cancer-derived lipids or proteins. For example, exosomes, ranging from 30 to 200 nm in size, can also be secreted by cancer cells into body fluids at different stages of cancer development depending on the cancer type 141 142 173 174 175 Despite their promise, CTC concentrations in biological fluids are extremely low (1–100 CTCs per million hemocytes), necessitating isolation and enrichment 174 176 175 177 178 Biochemical enrichment relies on biomarker interaction with biorecognition molecules. Magnetic beads (MBs) functionalized with cancer-specific probes enhance biomarker isolation in liquid biopsies. In addition, folate receptors, overexpressed in breast and ovarian cancers, are ideal MB targets for CTC capture (Fig. 3c 179 180 181 182 183 Biophysical separation, a label-free approach, overcomes biochemical limitations by utilizing filtration, inertial forces, ultrasound, or electrical fields 181 3d 184 185 181 186 156 157 Exosome isolation can also be achieved via surface charge manipulation. Chitosan-coated microfluidic channels, sensitive to pH changes, allow negatively charged exosomes to bind during sample flow. After capture and sample removal, pH modulation releases the exosomes, facilitating collection 186 181 POC technologies for breast and gynecological cancer Standard cancer diagnostics require trained personnel and hospital-based equipment, limiting accessibility, particularly for women with restricted healthcare access. At-home POC devices, such as LFAs, provide affordable, rapid screening that meets WHO’s ASSURED criteria 141 LFAs are paper-based POC devices composed of a sample pad that interacts with the sample fluid and transfers it to the conjugate pad for labeling. The labeled sample moves through the strip by capillary forces, towards the detection pad, modified with aptamers, antibodies and other biomolecules 187 188 However, conventional LFAs remain primarily qualitative or semi-quantitative, limiting their sensitivity compared to ELISA-based assays. To address sensitivity limitations, luminescent-based dual-mode LFAs incorporate fluorescent microspheres (FMs), QDs, and organic dyes, enabling both visual and quantitative detection 189 191 While LFAs effectively detect abundant cancer biomarkers (e.g., CA-125, HER2, HE-4), CTCs and exosomes, due to their low concentrations, require preconcentration before detection. Achieving simultaneous preconcentration, signal amplification, and detection of CTCs and exosomes in LFAs remains a challenge, though emerging strategies have been reported. Pen-based LFAs, using a catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) technique, are especially promising in their ease of use and all-in-one design 192 Multiplex detection for women-prevalent cancers Relying on a single biomarker for cancer detection can lead to high false-positive rates, as some biomarkers for women’s cancers are associated with other women’s conditions. For example, CA-125, a key ovarian cancer biomarker, is also elevated during endometriosis 193 195 196 197 Multiplex biosensors enhance diagnostic specificity by detecting multiple cancer biomarkers simultaneously. For instance, miRNA profiles (miR-21, miR-106a, miR-155) vary across breast cancer subtypes, necessitating multiplex detection strategies 198 199 200 201 Multiplex LFA-based POC devices are particularly relevant for ovarian cancer, one of the most difficult cancers to detect in its early stages. Since HE-4 levels in urine vary depending on hydration status and urine concentration, creatinine levels are used as a normalizer for urinary biomarkers 193 202 195 Despite advancements, few LFAs are available for detecting multiple protein biomarkers. LFAs sensitivity, in both singleplex and multiplex detection, is often limited by the hook effect that prevents the formation of the antibody-antigen complex 203 204 Commercialization, barriers to entry and future scopes Recent advancements in women’s health technologies–particularly in wearable biosensors and POC diagnostic devices–have accelerated the transition from conceptualization to clinical trials, driving increased stakeholder investment and introduction of these technologies into international markets (Supplementary Table 3 205 Barriers to entry of women’s wearable technologies A recent surge in technologies in the commercial space of women’s health have advanced significantly in the product pipeline for new product development (NPD) 205 206 210 211 212 213 220 221 222 221 222 223 Usability, adoption and compliance for diverse women Women’s health technologies in commercialized spaces are most successful when they are designed for diverse populations of cisgender women and transgender people from different socioeconomic and cultural communities 224 225 226 227 228 Furthermore, women from low socioeconomic status or enfranchised communities adopt biomonitoring technologies less than women of high socioeconomic status 229 62 62 230 231 232 234 Global policy making for women’s health technologies One challenge in the development of technologies is the lack of global policy making practices for women’s health. Within the past decade, a large positive shift towards the globalization of women’s health and sexual rights has taken place. On an international front, the United Nations (UN) and WHO acknowledged the lack of policy making and women’s sexual rights laws which has limited women’s access to healthcare and medical devices 235 236 237 241 242 243 Artificial intelligence in women’s health technologies From a clinical perspective, AI and ML can be leveraged to significantly improve predictive capabilities and offer dynamic pattern recognition to enhance early-onset diagnostics, automate data collection and streamline care 244 245 18 246 247 18 246 245 248 249 256 4 In diagnostics, new biomarker discovery using AI can introduce unique or more all-encompassing diagnostic strategies by providing more holistic understanding of disease mechanisms for conditions affecting women, thus bridging the knowledge gap 246 246 257 246 258 259 245 Some mHealth applications and wearable technologies that leverage AI and ML have already been commercialized for women’s health applications or are close to commercialization 260 261 248 249 256 262 In applying AI and ML for clinical practice, there is a dire need to understand the effects of generalized data and how we can shift away from it for reliable outputs 263 264 265 264 264 264 266 264 267 268 Outlook This review highlights key bioengineering advancements in women’s health diagnostics and biomonitoring. As more prototypes and in vivo studies emerge, the field is progressing toward commercialization, transforming economic, healthcare, and societal perceptions of women’s health monitoring and diagnostics. One outstanding challenge in these emerging technologies is the limited data from underrepresented populations to inform device design and user interface accessibility. To ensure equitable healthcare solutions, future biomedical devices must be inclusive, addressing the needs of cisgender women and transgender individuals across diverse backgrounds. As more wearable technologies and detection platforms for women’s health are created, integrating wearable technologies with ML and AI will not only enhance detection accuracy but also reduce user error in data interpretation. AI-driven systems can personalize diagnostics, ensuring precise monitoring of cancers, infections, and reproductive health conditions. AI algorithms can predict bacterial imbalances before a full-blown infection develops, allowing for earlier intervention 269 The future of women’s health technologies is shifting toward wireless, AI-integrated wearables that provide real-time predictive feedback, enhanced user interfaces, and seamless remote monitoring. These innovations will assist women by enabling personalized, proactive healthcare management. By bridging bioengineering, AI, and digital health, the next generation of wearable diagnostics will transform women’s health monitoring into a more accessible, data-driven, and patient-centered paradigm.
