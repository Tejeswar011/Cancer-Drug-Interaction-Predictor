Introduction Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women and remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Sarcopenia, a condition defined by progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and function due to aging or chronic disease, is increasingly recognized in patients with cancer [ 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 In oncological research, sarcopenia is most frequently assessed using imaging-based methods. Cross-sectional imaging at the L3 level provides a reproducible and well-validated approach to quantify SMI, and this radiological method has been widely adopted in cancer studies. Accordingly, radiologically defined sarcopenia, based on low SMI derived from imaging, offers a practical and objective measure that allows for consistent evaluation across studies and has become an established surrogate marker in oncological research [ 12 13 16 Because achieving pCR is a critical goal in HER2-positive and TNBC subtypes, identifying reliable predictors of treatment response is clinically valuable. Several factors—such as tumor grade, hormone receptor status, Ki-67 index, tumor size, choice of neoadjuvant regimen, and BRCA mutation status—have been associated with pCR rates [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 Given that achieving pCR in HER2-positive and TNBC patients is strongly associated with improved outcomes, clarifying the impact of low SMI on the treatment response in this context is critical. This study aimed to evaluate the association between radiologically defined sarcopenia, assessed as low SMI on PET-based imaging, and pCR in patients with HER2-positive and TNBC undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. We also sought to explore the potential of low SMI as a novel biomarker for predicting treatment response in these patient groups. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Patients and Data Collection This retrospective study included 85 patients diagnosed with HER2-positive or triple-negative breast cancer who received neoadjuvant therapy between January 2015 and October 2023. All participants had histopathologically confirmed breast cancer who also had radiologically verified early or locally advanced stage disease. Diagnosis was established through core needle biopsy or fine-needle aspiration, and all specimens were reviewed by an experienced breast pathologist at our center prior to the initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After completion of neoadjuvant therapy, all patients underwent surgical resection. Treatment planning was conducted by a multidisciplinary tumor board in accordance with national and international clinical guidelines, and the decision to administer neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including the selection of specific regimens, was based on each patient’s clinicopathological profile. Demographic, clinical, and histopathological data were retrospectively collected from the hospital records. The evaluated parameters included age, clinical stage at diagnosis, tumor grade, histological subtype, hormone receptor status (in HER2-positive patients), Ki-67 index, body mass index (BMI, weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters), pre-treatment skeletal muscle area (SMA), skeletal muscle index (SMI), baseline laboratory parameters (including neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and albumin), PET response, pathological complete response (pCR) status, and Miller-Payne grade. Pathological complete response was defined as the absence of invasive cancer in both the breast and axillary lymph nodes (ypT0/Tis, ypN0). Tumor response was evaluated using the Miller-Payne grading system [ 27 Patients without pre-treatment PET imaging, those who experienced disease progression during neoadjuvant therapy, those unable to undergo surgery, and those who did not complete their entire neoadjuvant systemic treatment at our institution were excluded, as the primary objective was to assess the relationship between low SMI and pCR. 2.2. Assessment of Body Composition and Definition of Low SMI SMI was assessed using PET-CT or PET-MRI images obtained prior to neoadjuvant therapy. It was calculated at the level of the third lumbar vertebra (L3) by dividing the total skeletal muscle area (cm 2 2 Figure 1 2 2 12 28 All SMI measurements were performed using PET-CT or PET-MRI images acquired with the same imaging device for all patients. Manual segmentation at the L3 level was independently conducted by two nuclear medicine specialists, both blinded to patient outcomes. All cases were subsequently reviewed together to reach consensus and minimize variability in segmentation. In the overall cohort, besides radiologically defined sarcopenia, the presence of sarcopenic obesity was also evaluated. Sarcopenic obesity was defined as the coexistence of radiologically defined sarcopenia (based on the SMI cut-off described above) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 29 2.3. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables were expressed as median (range) and compared using the Mann–Whitney U test or Student’s t In accordance with recommendations in the literature, variables with p 30 p 3. Results 3.1. Characteristics of Patients This study included 85 patients with breast cancer who received neoadjuvant treatment. The median age was 49 years (range: 24–77). Of the total cohort, 49 patients (56.6%) had HER2-positive disease, and 36 (42.4%) had triple-negative breast cancer. The vast majority (84.7%) had invasive ductal carcinoma. SMI was assessed using PET-CT in 44 (52%) patients and PET-MRI in 41 (48%) patients. Low SMI was identified in 35 patients (41.2%) before the initiation of neoadjuvant therapy. Among the baseline characteristics, BMI was the only variable that differed significantly between the groups. The low SMI group had a significantly lower median BMI compared to the normal SMI (25.8 vs. 29.5 kg/m 2 p No statistically significant differences were observed between low SMI and normal SMI patients in terms of menopausal status, histologic type, molecular subtype, tumor grade, Ki-67 index, clinical T and N stage, clinical TNM stage, or neoadjuvant treatment regimens (all p Table 1 3.2. Pathological Complete Response Outcomes pCR was achieved in 45 patients (52.9%) after neoadjuvant therapy. In the HER2-positive group, pCR was observed in 31 of 49 patients (63.3%) and in 14 of 36 patients in the TNBC group (38.9%). The difference between the two groups was statistically significant ( p p To evaluate the factors associated with achieving a pCR, both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. In the univariate analysis, several factors were found to be significantly associated with pCR. Patients with clinical T1–2 tumors had higher odds of achieving pCR compared to those with T3–4 tumors (odds ratio [OR] 2.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–7.01, p p p p p p p p In the multivariate analysis adjusting for potential confounding variables, radiologically defined sarcopenia (low SMI) remained the only independent predictor of pCR. Patients with normal SMI had a significantly increased likelihood of achieving pCR (OR 5.17, 95% CI 1.74–15.40, p Table 2 Sarcopenic obesity, defined as the coexistence of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 p 3.3. Treatment-Related Toxicity Outcomes The association between low SMI and treatment-related toxicity was also analyzed. Grade 2 or higher toxicity was observed in 15 of 35 patients with low SMI (42.9%) compared to 10 of 50 patients with normal SMI (20%) ( p Grade ≥ 2 non-hematologic adverse events occurred in 8 patients (32%), consisting of neuropathy (n = 4), fatigue (n = 3), and urinary tract infection (n = 1). Treatment delays due to toxicity were observed in 18 of 85 patients (21.2%) in the entire cohort. These occurred in 10 patients (28.6%) in the low SMI group and 8 patients (14.5%) in the normal SMI group, with no statistically significant difference between groups ( p 4. Discussion Radiologically defined sarcopenia is a common and clinically significant condition in cancer patients, resulting from multifactorial causes such as chronic inflammation, malnutrition, treatment-related toxicities, and decreased physical activity. It has been linked to adverse outcomes, including increased toxicity, reduced treatment efficacy, and inferior survival across various malignancies [ 12 31 32 The prevalence of radiologically defined sarcopenia in our cohort was 41.2%, which was slightly higher than that reported in previous breast cancer studies. A meta-analysis by Roberto et al. found radiologically defined sarcopenia in 33% of patients (n = 6130) and a separate analysis by Dai et al. reported a prevalence of 38% [ 33 34 35 36 In our study, BMI was significantly lower in patients with low SMI. This finding aligns with Caan et al., who reported lower BMI in radiologically defined sarcopenic patients (24.7 vs. 30.0 kg/m 2 23 36 26 33 37 Several studies have confirmed the negative impact of radiologically defined sarcopenia on survival outcomes in breast cancer [ 34 38 39 Contrary to our findings, in a retrospective study by Del Fabbro et al. [ 26 p p 36 40 41 These inconsistencies are likely due to differences in study design, sample size, patient subtypes, sarcopenia measurement techniques, and cut-off thresholds. Despite these limitations, our findings highlight the potential of radiologically defined sarcopenia as a clinically relevant predictor of pCR, especially in HER2-positive and TNBC subtypes, where achieving pCR has clear prognostic value. In our analysis of sarcopenic obesity, patients with this condition exhibited lower pCR rates compared to those without, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. This likely reflects the limited statistical power of this small subgroup. Few studies have directly evaluated the clinical implications of sarcopenic obesity in breast cancer and most available evidence comes from heterogeneous cancer populations. Meta-analyses and observational studies in these settings have reported associations between sarcopenic obesity and poorer overall, recurrence-free, and disease-free survival, as well as higher rates of postoperative complications, prolonged hospitalization, and reduced functional status [ 12 29 42 Similar to many other cancers, the association between radiologically defined sarcopenia and treatment-related toxicity in breast cancer has been demonstrated in numerous studies and meta-analyses [ 13 22 32 43 33 p 44 p 45 Although CT-based skeletal muscle measurement at the L3 level is widely accepted for radiologically defined sarcopenia diagnosis [ 12 32 43 44 13 14 15 23 14 This study has several limitations. First, the retrospective design and relatively small sample size may introduce selection bias, limit the generalizability of the findings, and constrain the statistical power of subgroup analyses. Second, our study was based solely on imaging-derived SMI measurements. Although radiologically defined sarcopenia is commonly applied in oncological research, this approach does not capture functional parameters such as muscle strength or physical performance, which are essential to the clinical definition of sarcopenia. In addition, the use of PET-based SMI measurements, while promising, has not yet been standardized or validated for radiologically defined sarcopenia diagnosis in breast cancer populations. Third, we did not assess changes in radiologically defined sarcopenia status over the course of treatment, as post-treatment PET imaging was not routinely performed for all patients in our center, which precluded the evaluation of longitudinal changes in SMI and their potential impact on treatment efficacy. Finally, other potentially relevant factors influencing SMI, such as nutritional status and physical activity levels, could not be evaluated due to a lack of available data. Prospective validation of the prognostic role of radiologically defined sarcopenia in larger, multicenter cohorts is needed, as current evidence is limited by heterogeneous measurement methods and varying cut-off values across studies. In addition, interventional approaches to prevent or reverse low SMI warrant further investigation. Structured resistance and aerobic exercise programs, combined with targeted nutritional strategies such as individualized dietary counseling and supplementation, have demonstrated potential benefits in maintaining or restoring muscle mass, improving treatment tolerance, and enhancing oncologic outcomes [ 33 46 5. Conclusions In conclusion, our study demonstrates that low SMI is an independent negative predictor of pathological complete response in patients with HER2-positive and TNBC receiving neoadjuvant therapy. These findings highlight the importance of early identification and management of radiologically defined sarcopenia in this population. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate these results and explore targeted interventions that may enhance treatment outcomes in patients with low SMI.
