Introduction A type I transmembrane glycoprotein, CD44, was initially characterized in the 1980s as a lymphocyte homing receptor [ 1 2 3 4 5 Both CD44s and CD44v (pan-CD44) bind to hyaluronic acid (HA) through the conserved extracellular domain, which plays critical roles in cellular homing, migration, adhesion, and proliferation [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 CD44 is also recognized as a cell surface marker of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) in various carcinomas [ 5 5 5 Multiple isoforms of CD44 have been implicated in malignant progression across diverse tumor types [ 7 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 10 11 We previously generated highly sensitive and specific mAbs targeting CD44 by immunizing mice with stably CD44v3–10-overexpressed Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO/CD44v3–10). The critical epitopes recognized by these mAbs were identified through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, followed by functional characterization in flow cytometry, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Among the established clones, C 44 1 44 44 22 44 In this study, we converted C 44 2a 44 2a 2. Results 2.1.

Discussion Given the critical role of CD44 in cancer metastasis and therapeutic resistance, several strategies targeting CD44 have been developed for the treatment of diverse malignancies, including head and neck, breast, gynecological, and ovarian cancers [ 25 26 27 28 2a 44 2a, Figure 1 44 2a Figure 3 Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 5 Figure 6 In a gastric cancer cell line, the predominant CD44v transcripts—CD44v3, 8–10, CD44v6–10, CD44v8–10, and CD44v3, 8—were identified [ 29 44 2a 12 30 12 44 2a Figure 4 31 32 44 2a 44 2a Figure 4 33 10 44 2a CD44 is reported to be a target gene of Wnt/β-catenin in a mouse intestinal tumor model [ 34 35 22 36 37 38 Since bivatuzumab–mertansine showed toxicity to normal skin epithelium [ 27 28 39 40 44 22 44 To reduce the reactivity and toxicities in normal tissues, cancer-specific mAbs (CasMabs) for various antigens have been developed. More than three hundred anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) mAb clones have been established by immunization of mice with cancer cell-expressed HER2. Among them, H 2 2 2 41 2 NCT06241456 42 44 2a 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Lines CHO-K1 and COLO205 (colorectal cancer) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). MKN45 and NUGC-4 (human gastric cancer) cell lines were obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources (Osaka, Japan). KatoIII (human gastric cancer) was obtained from the Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research Institute of Development, Aging, and Cancer at Tohoku University (Miyagi, Japan). CHO/CD44v3–10 was established previously [ 43 MKN45 and NUGC-4 were maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan). CHO/CD44v3–10, CHO-K1, KatoIII, and COLO205 were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.). All culture media were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/mL amphotericin B (Nacalai Tesque, Inc.). Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO 2 4.2. Recombinant mAb Production A control mIgG 2a 2a 23 44 1 22 2a 44 2a H 44 H 2a L 44 L 44 2a 4.3. Flow Cytometry Cells were detached by brief incubation with a solution containing 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; Nacalai Tesque, Inc.) and 0.25% trypsin. Following centrifugation and washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a blocking buffer, the cells were incubated with primary mAbs for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were treated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Danvers, MA, USA). Fluorescence signals were acquired using an SA3800 Cell Analyzer (Sony Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The dissociation constant (K D 22 4.4. Immunohistochemical Analysis Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue arrays of gastric cancer (BS01011b) were purchased from US Biomax Inc. (Rockville, MD, USA). The tissue arrays were autoclaved in citrate buffer (pH 6.0; Nichirei Biosciences, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) for 20 min. The blocking was performed using SuperBlock T20 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). The sections were incubated with 5 μg/mL of C 44 2a 44 2a 44 4.5. ADCC by C 44 2a The animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the institutional regulations and ethical guidelines to minimize pain and distress, and were approved by the Institutional Committee for Animal Experiments of the Institute of Microbial Chemistry (Numazu, Japan; approval number: 2025-029). Five-week-old female BALB/c nude mice were purchased from Japan SLC Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). The splenocytes (designated as effector cells) were prepared as described previously [ 45 44 2a 44 2a n 2a n Cytotoxicity was calculated as a percentage of lysis using the following formula: % lysis = (E − S)/(M − S) × 100, where E represents the fluorescence intensity from co-cultures of effector and target cells, S denotes the spontaneous fluorescence from target cells alone, and M corresponds to the maximum fluorescence obtained after complete lysis using a buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mM EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100. Data are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance was evaluated using a two-tailed unpaired t 4.6. CDC by C 44 2a The Calcein AM-labeled target cells (CHO/CD44v3–10, MKN45, and COLO205) were plated and mixed with rabbit complement (final dilution 10%, Low-Tox-M Rabbit Complement; Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, ON, Canada) and 100 μg/mL of C 44 2a n 2a n 4.7. Antitumor Activity of C 44 2a The Institutional Committee approved the animal experiment for Animal Experiments of the Institute of Microbial Chemistry (approval number: 2025-011). Throughout the study, mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions with an 11 h light/13-h dark cycle and provided with food and water ad libitum. Body weight was measured twice weekly, and general health status was assessed three times per week. Humane endpoints were predefined as a body weight loss exceeding 25% of the initial weight and/or a tumor volume exceeding 3000 mm 3 Female BALB/c nude mice (4 weeks old) were obtained from Japan SLC, Inc. Tumor cells (0.3 mL of a 1.33 × 10 8 6 44 2a 44 2a n 2a n 44 2a 44 2a n 2a n Tumor size was measured, and volume was calculated using the formula: volume = W 2 p Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Supplementary Materials The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms26189170/s1 Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.K.K. and Y.K.; methodology, M.K.K. and T.O.; validation, H.S. and Y.K.; investigation, M.T., T.O., and H.S.; data curation, M.T. and H.S.; writing—original draft preparation, M.T. and H.S.; writing—review and editing, Y.K.; project administration, Y.K.; funding acquisition, Y.K.
