We investigated the characteristics of fibrinolysis—an essential process that balances blood clot breakdown—and found that they divide HCC into biological subtypes with different tumor microenvironments and outcomes. Among these genes, hemopexin ( HPX HPX HPX HPX Abstract Fibrinolysis plays a crucial role in maintaining coagulation homeostasis, but its functions in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain poorly understood.

Introduction Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, with an estimated 20 million new cases and 9.7 million deaths in 2022 [ 1 2 3 4 Fibrinolysis, the process of fibrin clot degradation mediated by the plasminogen–plasmin system, plays crucial roles in both physiological and pathological processes. Basically, fibrinogen is cleaved by thrombin to release fibrinopeptides A and B (FpA/FpB), exposing polymerization sites that drive fibrin assembly, and then factor XIIIa cross-links fibrin and stabilizes the clot. Fibrinolysis counterbalances this process: tissue-type or urokinase-type plasminogen activator converts plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades cross-linked fibrin into D-dimer and related fragments [ 5 6 In gastric cancer (GC), key fibrinolytic and coagulation-related proteins, such as tissue factor (TF), thrombin, fibrinogen (FBG), FpA, and D-dimer (DD), are abnormally expressed and serve as biomarkers for disease progression and prognosis [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 On this basis, this study aims to investigate the role of fibrinolysis in HCC. We then develop and validate a prognostic signature derived from fibrinolysis-related characteristics and examine its clinical relevance and prognostic value. Finally, we nominate a priority candidate gene for functional evaluation and explore pathways that may underlie its effects. 2. Methods 2.1. Data Acquisition and Processing TCGA pan-cancer gene expression data, copy number variation (CNV) data, and clinical information were obtained from UCSC Xena ( https://xenabrowser.net/ https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-LIHC https://dcc.icgc.org/releases GSE54236 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds 22 23 24 25 2.2. Gene Set Function Enrichment Analysis and Tumor Microenvironment Analysis The fibrinolysis gene set was obtained from the Gene Ontology (GO) database ( www.geneontology.org 26 27 28 https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb 27 29 30 31 32 2.3. Molecular Subtyping of Fibrinolysis in HCC and Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis Molecular typing of HCC samples was performed using the fibrinolysis gene set by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) (v0.26). The optimal number of subtypes of fibrinolysis-related molecular subtypes in HCC was determined based on the cophenetic correlation. We included the fibrinolysis molecular subtypes of HCC in the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) (v1.72-1) [ 33 2.4. Construction of the Risk Signature Univariate Cox analysis was performed on the genes related to the fibrinolysis-related molecular subtypes in HCC. Genes with p (1) R i s k S c o r e  =  h 0 t exp ∑ j = 1 n C o e f j × X j The predictive performance of the risk signature was quantified through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). 2.5. Animals and Xenograft Tumor Model Male BALB/c nude mice (4–6 weeks old) were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd (Beijing, China). Mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions in groups of 5 per cage. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking University People’s Hospital (approval number 2020PHE057) and conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines. For tumor implantation, 5 × 10 6 n V L S 2 2.6. Cell Lines and Cell Culture The human cell lines Bel-7402, SK-Hep-1, Hep3B, PLC/PRF/5, and HEK-293T were acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). MHCC-97L, MHCC-97H, and HCC-LM3 were acquired from the Cell Resource Center, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, CAMS/PUMC (Beijing, China). Cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or Minimum Essential Medium (MEM) medium (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO 2 2.7. Lentivirus Packaging Procedure and Infection The plvx-HPX overexpression vector was obtained from Shanghai Generay Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Lentivirus was produced in 293T cells using the pSPAX2/pVSV-G packaging system. Briefly, 293T cells were seeded in 10 cm dishes and transfected at 70–80% confluence with a plasmid mixture containing the transfer vector (plvx-HPX), pSPAX2, and pVSV-G (Addgene, Watertown, MA, USA) at a ratio of 4:3:1 using polyethylenimine (PEI) (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) in Opti-MEM (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The medium was replaced with fresh complete DMEM 6–8 h post-transfection. Viral supernatants were harvested at 48 h post-transfection, centrifuged (3000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), filtered through 0.45 μm membranes, and stored at −80 °C. Target cells were infected at 30–50% confluence with viral supernatant containing 8 μg/mL Polybrene. After 12–16 h, the medium was replaced with fresh complete medium. Puromycin selection (1–2 μg/mL) was initiated 48 h post-infection and maintained for 3–7 days until complete death of control cells. Stable cell lines were validated by qPCR and/or Western blot analysis. 2.8. RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, #15596026CN, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration and purity were determined by NanoDrop spectrophotometry (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). First-strand cDNA was synthesized from total RNA using Hifair ® ® ® −ΔΔCt HPX HPX ACTB ACTB 2.9. Western Blotting Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) containing protease inhibitor cocktail on ice. Protein concentrations were quantified using the BCA assay (LABLEAD, Beijing, China). Equal amounts of protein (10–20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE (ACE Biotechnology, Changzhou, China) (140 V, 40 min) and transferred to 0.45 μm PVDF membranes (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) using a wet transfer system (400 mA, 40–60 min). Membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat milk (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: Caspase-3 (Rabbit monoclonal, 1:1000, ABclonal, #A19654, Wuhan, China), Bax (Rabbit monoclonal, 1:1000, ABclonal, #A19684), TNF-α (Rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000, ABclonal, #A11534, Wuhan, China), Hemopexin (HPX) (Rabbit monoclonal, 1:1000, ABclonal, #A9133, Wuhan, China), and Caspase-9 (Rabbit antibody, 1:1000, Abmart, # T55049 2.10. CCK-8 Assay Cell proliferation was assessed using the CCK-8 assay (LABLEAD, #CK001, Beijing, China). Cells were digested, counted, and resuspended at a density of 5–8 × 10 4 2.11. Clone Formation Assay Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 500–1000 cells per well and cultured for 10–14 days to allow colony formation. Each experimental group included three replicate wells. After incubation, cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Solarbio, Beijing, China) for 15 min, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min at room temperature. Colonies containing > 50 cells were counted manually under a microscope. 2.12. EdU Cell Proliferation Assay Cell proliferation was evaluated using the BeyoClick™ EdU-594 Kit (Beyotime, #C0078S, Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells seeded in 24-well plates were incubated with 10 μM EdU for 2 h at 37 °C, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. The Click reaction was performed using the fluorescent azide conjugate (594 nm excitation/615 nm emission) to label proliferating cells. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst (346 nm excitation/460 nm emission). Images were acquired using a fluorescence microscope (THUNDER Imaging Systems, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), and EdU-positive cells were quantified using ImageJ software (v1.54g). 2.13. Wound Healing Assay Cells were seeded in 6-well plates and cultured until reaching 90–100% confluence. A sterile 200 μL pipette tip was used to create a straight scratch wound in the monolayer. Detached cells were removed by washing with PBS, and fresh serum-free medium was added to minimize proliferation effects. The wounded area was photographed at 0 h and 24 h or 36 h under an inverted microscope. 2.14. Flow Cytometry Apoptosis Assay Cell apoptosis was evaluated using the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Pharmingen™, #556547, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were harvested, washed twice with cold PBS, and resuspended in 1×Annexin V binding buffer at a density of 1 × 10 6 2.15. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Assay Kit with JC-1 Analysis Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using the JC-1 assay kit (Beyotime, #C2006, Shanghai, China) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates and cultured under experimental conditions. After treatment, cells were incubated with JC-1 staining solution (2 μM) at 37 °C for 30 min in the dark. Following two washes with assay buffer, fluorescence was visualized using a THUNDER Imaging System (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). 2.16. TUNEL Apoptosis Assay The TUNEL assay was performed to detect apoptotic cells in paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Briefly, tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated. After antigen retrieval in citrate buffer, sections were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. The TUNEL reaction mixture was applied and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Fluorescence microscopy was performed with the following settings: TUNEL-positive cells (green): at 488/530 nm (excitation/emission), and DAPI (blue): at 358/461 nm (excitation/emission). Apoptotic cells were quantified by counting TUNEL-positive cells in at least 5 random fields per section and expressed as a percentage of total DAPI-stained nuclei. 2.17. H&E Staining and Immunohistochemistry Analysis For histopathological evaluation, xenograft tumor tissue sections (4–5 μm) were stained with hematoxylin (Boster, Wuhan, China) and eosin (H&E) (Boster, Wuhan, China) following standard protocols as in a previous study [ 34 2.18. RNA-seq Analysis RNA sequencing was performed by Tsingke (Beijing, China) using the Illumina NovaSeq X Plus Sequencing Systems. The raw sequencing data were aligned to the human reference genome GRCh38.112 using HISAT2 (v2.2.1), and gene expression levels were quantified as fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM). Functional enrichment analyses were conducted for GO terms; Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The top significantly enriched terms/pathways ( p 2.19. Statistical Analysis Statistical processing was performed using R v4.3.1 or GraphPad Prism v8.0.2. Continuous data from two groups were compared using unpaired two-tailed t p 3. Results 3.1. Analysis of the Biological Role of Fibrinolysis in Pan-Cancer The fibrinolysis gene set was obtained from the GO database, with a total of 27 genes. This study first analyzed the correlations of these 27 genes at the transcriptome level in pan-cancer ( Figure 1 USF1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 3.2. Construction and Clinical Analysis of Fibrinolysis Molecular Subtypes in HCC Through the analysis of fibrinolysis at the pan-cancer level, the fibrinolysis score in HCC was relatively high and was also a protective factor for the prognosis of HCC. For this reason, our subsequent research focused on HCC. Based on the 27 fibrinolysis genes and with a phenotypic correlation of 3, we classified the HCC samples into three subtypes ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 3.3. A Risk Signature Was Constructed Based on the Fibrinolysis Molecular Subtype of HCC Based on the significant characteristics of the fibrinolysis molecular subtypes, we further constructed a prognostic signature. Firstly, we analyzed the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between HCC and normal liver tissues in TCGA-LIHC. Based on the thresholds of adjusted p 2 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 We randomly split the TCGA-LIHC cohort (follow-up > 0) into training and internal test sets (5:5). Fibrinolysis-related signatures were first screened by univariable Cox analysis, and then LASSO-Cox was performed in the training set ( Figure 3 ACAT1 GRHPR HPX PCK2 IYD PON1 (2) R i s k S c o r e = h 0 ( t ) e x p ( − 0.3320497 × A C A T 1 − 0.5356651 × G R H P R − 0.2373711 × H P X + 0.5909421 × P C K 2 − 0.2974011 × I Y D − 0.1330290 × P O N 1 ) . Grouping was based on the median RiskScore of each dataset. This study verified the risk signature in the training set and the entire set. In the training set, survival analysis indicated that the survival outcome in low-risk group patients was significantly better ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 GSE54236 Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 p 3.4. The Key Gene HPX in HCC Was Identified Through the Risk Signature Through the risk signature, we obtained six genes related to fibrinolysis molecular typing.

Discussion This study systematically investigated the role of fibrinolysis in pan-cancer; we successfully identified the fibrinolysis-related gene HPX HPX HPX HPX The bioinformatics methods employed in this study, including differential expression analysis, molecular subtyping, and the risk signature construction, proved effective in uncovering the clinical relevance of fibrinolysis in HCC. Biologically, fibrinolysis can modulate tumor progression through extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis, and metastatic dynamics; clinical practice also underscores this axis, as low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is widely used for cancer-associated thrombosis and may influence the coagulation–fibrinolysis balance [ 35 36 HPX HPX 37 38 39 HPX Published research has revealed that HPX HPX HPX 40 41 42 HPX HPX 43 HPX HPX The relationship between fibrinolysis and cell death, particularly apoptosis, remains an underexplored area in cancer biology. Our study provides compelling evidence that fibrinolysis-related genes, especially HPX HPX HPX HPX 43 HPX HPX Many Asian patients with HCC have underlying chronic hepatitis B or C infection and cirrhosis and experience ‘rebalanced’ hemostasis due to impaired hepatic synthesis, portal hypertension–related thrombocytopenia, and inflammation. These changes can shift coagulation–fibrinolysis dynamics and confound circulating markers, including HPX. Accordingly, clinical translation of HPX and fibrinolysis-based signatures should account for liver function, etiology (HBV/HCV, alcohol-related, NASH), and anticoagulant exposure. Future validation will stratify analyses by these factors and employ standardized preanalytical handling to ensure interpretability across diverse patient populations. To strengthen clinical applicability, multi-center validation with prespecified endpoints in larger and etiologically diverse cohorts is needed. Despite these significant findings, our study has several limitations. First, while we identified HPX 5. Conclusions In summary, our study provides a comprehensive analysis of fibrinolysis in pan-cancer and establishes its critical role in HCC progression. We identified three novel molecular subtypes of HCC based on fibrinolysis and developed a prognostic risk signature with potential clinical utility.
