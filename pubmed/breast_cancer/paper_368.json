The bulk degradation of cytosolic material through autophagy provides the necessary nutrients that cells utilize under starvation. Autophagy can play a mixed role in both the growth and survival of cancer cells. As a damaged cellular content-clearing mechanism, autophagy is involved in the early stage of tumor regression. Subsequently, in a mature tumor cell microenvironment, autophagy protects tumor cells from cellular stress, immune evasion, and therapeutic resistance. Therapeutic resistance mediated by autophagic regulators can make anticancer therapy less effective. This review discusses the molecular mechanism of mammalian autophagy, evaluates the dynamic role of autophagy in cancer, highlights autophagy-mediated therapeutic resistance, and suggests the use of biomarkers. In cancer therapy, the addition of biomarkers can provide specific identification, and the conjugation of biomarkers with chemo-drugs can reduce the side effects and ensure normal cell integrity. Plain Language Summary Plain Language Summary: This review explores the complex role of autophagy (a natural cellular recycling process) in cancer development and treatment resistance. While autophagy can suppress tumors in early stages by removing damaged components, it can also help mature tumors survive stress and evade therapy. The study details the molecular pathways of autophagy, highlights how it contributes to drug resistance, and proposes biomarker-based solutions to improve treatment precision. It underscores the need for new therapeutic strategies that target autophagy without harming normal cells, offering hope for more effective and less toxic cancer therapies. mammalian autophagy ATGs therapeutics resistance dichotomous role autophagic biomarkers pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes typesetter ts10 cover-date January-December 2025 Introduction Cancer is a complex disease that has the second-highest global prevalence.  1  2  3  2 4 5  4  6 Christian de Duve (a biochemist) marked the starting point of autophagy research through the discovery of lysosomes.  6  7  8  6  9 10 12 Autophagy encompasses three main types (macro, micro, and chaperone-mediated autophagy); distinguished by the process of delivering cargo to the lysosome.  13  14  8  15  9 16 17 9 18 9 17  19  20  21 The dichotomous role of autophagy is crucial in cancer development. The critical link between impaired autophagy and cancer development was first established nearly 3 decades ago. Notably, in 1999, Levine’s group first correlated autophagy to cancer through identifying Beclin1 as a tumor suppressor.  22  23  24  19 Methodology This review synthesizes existing literature concerning the role of autophagy in cancer progression. The literature search encompassed articles published in English over the past 25 years, utilizing the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct databases. For selection, specific search terms and phrases were employed, including “autophagy dual role in cancer,” “autophagy in drug resistance,” “mammalian autophagy,” and “overview of autophagy.” The primary inclusion criteria prioritized systematic reviews, clinical trials, and other literature reviews that offered significant insights into the molecular mechanisms of autophagy in the context of cancer development ( Figure 1 Figure 1. Data Screening Illustration General Aspects of Mammalian Autophagic Molecular Mechanisms The discovery of ATG proteins marked a significant turning point in autophagy research.

Apoptosis is a caspase-dependent, energy-requiring program characterized by outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, cytochrome-c release, and executioner caspase activation, which culminates in immunologically quiet cell clearance.  74  75  76 Mechanistically, apoptosis–autophagy crosstalk is bidirectional. Anti-apoptotic BCL-2/BCL-xL binds Beclin-1, inhibiting PI3KC3 complex formation and dampening autophagic flux; conversely, stress-activated caspases cleave Beclin-1, generating fragments that amplify mitochondrial apoptosis, converting a survival process into death signaling.  77  78 Autophagy in Cancer: A Dichotomous Phenomenon Autophagy is an important part of the quality control system and is implicated in cellular defense. It can also be described as a stress management system; whenever cells face particular stress or stimuli, they immediately upregulate autophagy to protect cells from deleterious effects.  79 80 82  83 Autophagy Functions as a Tumor Suppressor Autophagic Key Regulator Beclin-1 is the first identified haploinsufficient tumor suppressor, monoallelically lost in several cancer cell lines. 82 84  85  86  87  88 89 90 PTEN is another tumor suppressor gene that acts as an inhibitor of PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway through inducing autophagy. 91 92  93 Figure 3  91  94  95 53 53  91 Figure 3.

To survive and fulfill these high metabolic and energy demands, autophagy is activated. This protective form of autophagy (pAg) will provide an alternative avenue for tumor survival. Here, we will describe some important regulatory factors that contribute to this pAg mechanism, including BNIP3, HMGB1, p 62 Figure 4  129  130  131  20 Figure 4.

Compared to those with low autophagic flux, high levels of autophagic flux in some models favor dormancy-inducing the survival of the disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in a quiescent state before they reactivate in new conditions.  155  156 As shown in Figure 5 Figure 5.

However, over 90% of cancer patients’ mortality is connected to drug resistance.  174  175  176  177 Table 2 177 194  195 196 197  198 199 201 Table 2.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and Ras-mutant cancers are highly dependent on high basal autophagic flux and theoretically the most suitable to be targeted by autophagy inhibitors.  204  205  206 Tumor Heterogeneity – Implications for Sampling and Monitoring Heterogeneity of tumors is a patient and cancer type-specific challenge to utilization of autophagy biomarkers in cancer. Autophagy appears to be spatially heterogeneous in tumors, both activity and levels of activity can vastly differ in the hypoxic center, nutrient-deprived niches, and proliferative edges. In pancreatic cancer, hypoxic areas have an increased mitophagy, mediated through BNIP3, with a lower flux at the peripheral zones.  140  76  155 The single-cell sequencing also underlines intra-tumoral heterogeneity such that, even in the same tumor, distinct autophagy signatures are observed across clonal populations.  207  208 Future Direction The profound understanding of autophagic regulation, paradoxical activity, and resistance against chemotherapy opens a new question about the possible future strategies to overcome autophagically induced negative effects. As mentioned earlier, combination therapy has been experimented with in some clinical trials. The cytotoxic effects are one of the main concerns in combination therapies. We suggest the use of biomarkers not only in diagnosis but also as drug conjugates to ensure selective delivery to specific tumor cells, thereby increasing the drug efficacy  209 Figure 7 Figure 7. Possible Strategy Through an Autophagy-specific Biomarker to Reduce Resistance and Ensure Normal Cell Survival in a Therapeutic Environment. Under Therapeutic Stress, Autophagy-specific Proteins’ Abnormal Upregulation can be Detected by Biomarkers. Autophagy Inhibitor Tagged With a Biomarker to Ensure Targeted Cell Identification, Clearance, and Safety of Normal Cells Cancer therapy has been developed significantly after the discovery of tumor biomarkers. The main purpose of using biomarkers is to provide a sensitive, specific, reliable, cost-effective, reproducible, and powerful detection against cancerous cells.  210 Table 3 Figure 7  217 Table 3. Overview of Autophagy-specific Biomarkers in Different Cancer Cells Autophagy-specific biomarkers Characteristics of biomarkers in cancer cells Types of cancer Reference Beclin-1 Expression reduced Brain tumors, cervical cell carcinomas, sporadic breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer.  211 212 LC3-II Overexpressed Hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, colorectal cancer, and triple-negative breast cancer.   213 ULK1 Overexpressed Colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma  213 214 P 62 Upregulated Breast cancer, epithelial ovarian cancer, and lung adenocarcinomas  214 215 PTEN Downregulated Prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, skin cancer, brain cancer, and breast cancer.  213 216 Therefore, overexpression of LC3-II indicates a higher level of autophagy activation to protect tumor cells from stress. Increased levels of LC3-II in patients provide a piece of valuable information to design a specific therapeutic approach for better clinical outcomes. In addition, LC3-II or p 62 Clinical Implementation of Autophagy Biomarkers Although the finding of biomarkers specific to autophagy (Beclin-1, LC3-II, ULK1, p62, and PTEN) suggests potential avenues in terms of early diagnosis and pharmaceutical intervention, the conversion of the given knowledge to clinical practice also requires tight validation and standardization. The development of a biomarker with clinical actionability requires strong analytical validity, clinical validity and clinical utility. There are now numerous autophagy biomarkers in preclinical or early-phase clinical development, but most have not been tested in large multi-center studies where they may demonstrate the consistency and accuracy of diagnosis. As an example, it has been found that LC3-II overexpression has great prognostic importance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hepatocellular carcinoma, where they are associated with negative patient outcome and with autophagic flux.  218  219 Likewise, Beclin-1 was found to be involved in tumor suppressor biomarker status in breast, prostate and ovarian cancer cases where its lower expression was associated with higher stages of the disease and decreased survival rates.  81 The validation also depends on a biomarker and the type of cancer. As an example, the use of p62/SQSTM1 as an autophagy inhibitor is justified by the experimental evidence, and few clinical studies have been performed, which limit the utility in practice as there are no standardized thresholds and prospective clinical trials that show predictive performance.  220 Regarding implementation, diagnostic laboratories should favor low cost of implementation, ease of integration, and challenges of reimbursement. To use biomarkers as a guide to therapeutic interventions, biomarkers need to be backed by companion diagnostics or FDA-approved assays as needed. The practice is especially applicable to new tactics that may pair biomarkers with drugs conjugates or targeting agents to increase tumor specificity and avoid the undesired byproducts of off-target interactions. Clinical Integration Into Practice – Decision-Making Algorithm The lack of an actionable framework for the manner in which oncologists can integrate autophagy-related biomarkers into their daily clinical practice has been identified as one of the factors inhibiting the clinical translation of these markers.  221 Biomarker testing using IHC to assess LC3, Beclin-1 as well as p62 is recommended and can be supplemented with liquid biopsy in cases when this is possible.  222  223 Figure 8 Figure 8. Evaluation of Autophagic Status in Therapeutic Decisions. A Clinical Decision-Making Algorithm Outlining when and How Autophagic Biomarkers (LC3, Beclin-1, p62) Should be Assessed in Oncology Pharmacoeconomic Considerations The translation of autophagy biomarkers into clinical oncology can no longer be justified as a matter of biological plausibility or theoretical clinical potential but must consider economic tractability. The health systems, especially those with low- and middle-income countries consider in their applications of new diagnostics and have to do a strident investigation of the cost-benefit ratio. The recent evidence in oncology reveals biomarker-driven selection of treatment paths is often cost effective in the long-term, such as use of HER2 testing in breast cancer and EGFR/ALK testing in lung cancer, both of which reduced inappropriate exposure to expensive drugs with superior outcomes.  224 Economic modeling further indicates that even a small survival enhancement of 3 to 6 months as a result of optimizing the choice of therapies using biomarkers would make such tests cost effective in terms of saving expensive hospitalizations, administering fewer adverse events, and avoiding futile use of therapies with tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of price tags per treatment cycle.  225  226 Regulatory Landscape for Autophagy Biomarkers Regulatory approvals are essential to the translation of autophagy biomarkers to bedside, with the majority of such biomarkers most appropriately considered as companion diagnostics (CDx).  227 In the United States, the FDA determines that CDx must be approved along with their corresponding therapeutic, usually through the Center of Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH). EGFR mutation testing, as an example, was simultaneously approved together with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Considering applications to autophagy, such biomarker assays would probably require validation in phase III trials of autophagy-inhibiting agents (eg, using HCQ combinations).  228  229 Notwithstanding this framework, autophagy biomarkers have unique issues. Contrary to the single-gene mutations, autophagic flux is a fluctuating, situation-specific process, which makes it more complicated to develop minimized cut-off points to use in the clinical practice. There will be adaptive strategies of validation such as multicenter trials, assay standardization and correlation of biomarker levels with therapeutic outcomes required by the regulators. Participation in expedited regulatory initiatives (eg, the FDA Breakthrough Devices Program or EMA PRIME scheme) have the potential to expedite regulatory pathways to develop autophagy biomarkers in parallel to new therapeutics.  230 Table 4 Table 4.

Priority Research Directions In order to bring the potential discoveries regarding autophagy to the benefits of actual clinical applications, it is clear that research priorities need to be suddenly put in place. First, validations studies must be prospective with large multi-center studies on candidate biomarkers including LC3-II, Beclin-1, and p62. These examinations ought to employ standard immunostaining and identify a replicable cut-off point to relate to the accuracy in diagnosis and forecast across various groupings of patients. Second, longitudinal studies that evaluate the dynamic changes of disease patients in autophagic markers with regard to the response and building treatment resistance are needed. Examples of such studies might be liquid biopsy analysis of circulating tumor DNA, exosomes of autophagy proteins, or autophagy transcripts so that tumor behavior can be monitored non-invasively in real-time. Moreover, integrating the mechanistic in-vivo studies and the functional genomics screens to characterize the tumor- and context-specific dependency on autophagy is required to fix the discrepancies observed across clinical use of autophagy-targeting drugs. Patient-derived xenograft models or organoid systems allow a more realistic representation of the tumor microenvironment and the discovery of the intersection between the control of autophagy and immune cell activity and metabolic reprogramming. In addition, the combination of autophagy inhibitors with other treatment options, including immune checkpoint blockade or metabolic inhibitors should be the priority of interest to be tested in phase I/II. Such trials should include strong biomarker endpoints in order to find responders and modify treatment strategy in response. Lastly, the field would progress satisfactorily with development of clinically accepted imaging or tracer that would detect and measure autophagic flux non-invasively in human cancer. New positron progression tomography (PET) indicators or autophagy indicators might empower clinicians to understand the efficacy of a drug in real time, which would allow them to create more customized treatment regimens. Clinical Translation: Implications for Treatment Selection and Combinatorial Approaches The linkage between mechanisms and practice in the field of cancer needs oncologists and researchers to convert the autophagy status into decisions concerning effective treatments. For example, tumors with high basal autophagic flux—such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and certain Ras-mutant cancers—may be more likely to benefit from combination regimens that include an autophagy inhibitor (eg, hydroxychloroquine) alongside chemotherapy or targeted therapy.  231  204  232 Practically, the combination therapy must be logically made to capitalize on the autophagy crosstalk with other pathways. As an example, the combination of autophagy inhibitors and the immune checkpoint inhibitors would promote antitumor immunity by blocking autophagic killing of cytotoxic granules and MHC-I, thereby creating successful immune surveillance. On the same note, metabolic regulation such that the metabolic blockade of glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation used against tumor cells, in combination with autophagy blockade, could take advantage of the metabolic rigidity of the tumor during stress. In the design of clinical trials, the use of dynamic biomarker monitoring is vital to change dosing and prevent toxicity when it is not required. The response can also be assessed by real-time visualization of autophagic flux with PET radiotracers, or serial liquid biopsies, to monitor markers of exosomal autophagy. The combination strategies will become safer and more effective with clear algorithms concerning escalation, switching, and termination of therapy on the basis of these measures. Integration with Personalized Medicine: A Multi-Omic Approach Autophagy biomarker integration into personalized medicine roadmaps demands integrating them into multi-omic strategies that will fully characterize tumors. Precision oncology is becoming an increasingly important intersection of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and immunoprofiling to develop comprehensive therapeutic approaches.  233  234  235 This has been possible through next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies that are ever more capable of multiplex biomarker panels that involve protein-based, RNA-based, and DNA-based characteristics.  236  237 Conclusion The study of autophagy in cancer biology demonstrates its dual character towards being a tumor suppressor protein in initial stages of cancer development and a survival adaptation that drives cancer progression, metastasizing, and development of therapeutic resistance in advanced cancers. Although remarkable progress has been achieved towards unraveling the molecular regulators of autophagy and how it needs to talk to the tumor microenvironment, there is still a large number of gaps, especially in terms of making this knowledge clinically applicable. A potentially fruitful direction is the incorporation of the autophagy-specific biomarkers into the early detection, prognostic assessment, and stratification of treatment. These biomarkers have therapeutic value as correct identification of impaired autophagic processes may guide the process of choosing personalized therapies. Moreover, the conjugation of the biomarkers with the anticancer drugs may allow the highly specific delivery of the drug, potentially improving the efficiency of the treatment, whereas causing as little destruction to the healthy tissue as possible. Such a strategy could transcend the autophagic-dependent therapeutic resistance and preserve tissue integrity of normal tissues which is one of the most serious problems in contemporary oncology. Future biomarker-driven studies Precision oncology (also known as precision medicine) involves the ability to personalize approaches to cancer by considering risks and predicting outcomes.
