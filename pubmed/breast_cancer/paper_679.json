Background The incidence of insulin resistance (IR) among cancer survivors is significantly higher than that in the general population. Current diagnostic methods for IR are complex, often requiring fasting blood samples, specialized laboratory tests, and sometimes invasive procedures, which limit their routine clinical application. This study investigated the association between platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), a readily available marker from routine blood tests, and IR in cancer survivors, aiming to find a more straightforward predictor of IR that could potentially simplify screening and monitoring processes in this high-risk population. Methods This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 1,418 cancer survivors from the NHANES 2005-2018 database. IR was assessed by three indicators: homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), and the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the relationship between PLR quartiles and IR, with restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses to evaluate non-linear relationships. Covariates included demographic (age, gender, race/ethnicity), socioeconomic (marital status, education, family poverty income ratio), lifestyle (smoking status, alcohol consumption, sleep duration, physical activity) and health status variables (body mass index (BMI), history of cardiovascular disease, hypertension status). Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify sensitive populations. Results The 1,418 cancer survivors (weighted population: 20,233,847; median age 69.0 years; 58.4% female) with low HOMA-IR (< 2.5), high QUICKI (≥ 0.33) and low TyG index (< 4.68) demonstrated more favorable metabolic profiles, including lower PLR values, better socioeconomic status, better lifestyle, and lower chronic disease burden. Compared to the lowest PLR quartile (Q1), individuals in the highest quartile (Q4) showed significantly increased IR risk when assessed by QUICKI (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.61, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02 - 2.53, P = 0.040) and the TyG index (HR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.02 - 2.45, P = 0.035). Each increment in PLR quartile was associated with a 19% (QUICKI) and 15% (TyG) increased risk of IR. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis results indicated that PLR cutoff values in the range of 124 - 137 can serve as screening thresholds for IR in cancer survivors. In the subgroup analysis, the PLR and IR showed no significant interaction across all examined subgroup characteristics in both the HOMA-IR and QUICKI models (P > 0.05). However, in the TyG index model, individuals in the Q4 compared to the Q1 demonstrated greater susceptibility to IR in those with physical activity < 600 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-mins/week (odds ratio (OR) = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.12 - 4.61); and those with a history of hypertension (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.05 - 3.63), with P values for interaction of 0.007 and 0.036, respectively. Conclusions Higher PLR levels indicated a significantly increased risk of IR in cancer survivors, especially when assessed by QUICKI and the TyG index. This relationship showed no significant interaction between subgroups in the HOMA-IR and QUICKI models, but in the TyG index model, and the association was more pronounced among individuals with low physical activity and those with a history of hypertension. As a simple, cost-effective biomarker derived from routine blood tests, PLR offers potential clinical value for the assessment of IR risk in cancer survivors, especially in high-risk subgroups.

In 2022, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reported nearly 20 million new cancer cases globally [ 1 2 3 4 The platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is an inflammation-based hematologic marker calculated as the ratio of platelet count to lymphocyte count in routine blood tests. PLR reflects both systemic inflammation and immunological suppression [ 5 6 The association between the PLR and IR remains inconclusive and somewhat controversial. According to some research, increased PLR levels might considerably raise the risk of IR via inflammation-related pathways [ 7 8 9 This study is based on cross-sectional data from cancer survivors in the NHANES database between 2005 and 2018, with the objective of analyzing the relationship between the PLR and IR indicators (including homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), and the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index). Cancer survivors represent a population at high risk of metabolic dysfunction, and exploring the correlation between specific metabolic biomarkers in this group is crucial for comprehending the underlying mechanisms and optimizing management strategies. The findings of this study not only enhance the clinical utility of PLR in cancer survivors but also provide new perspectives for the diagnosis and treatment strategies of IR. Materials and Methods Study population This cross-sectional study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative surveillance program that employs a complex multistage probability sampling design to track population health in the United States. NHANES systematically combines standardized interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory diagnostics to collect comprehensive health data across diverse demographic groups. Data from seven consecutive survey cycles spanning from 2005 to 2018 were used in our analysis. This study included participants from NHANES who were identified as cancer survivors. Cancer survivor status was operationalized through affirmative responses to the medical history questionnaire item: “Has a doctor or other health professional ever told you that you had cancer or a malignancy of any kind?” (Variable MCQ220 in NHANES documentation). We excluded participants with: 1) missing exposure data (platelet or lymphocyte counts); 2) missing outcome measures (fasting glucose, insulin, or triglyceride data); 3) incomplete covariate information (including race/ethnicity, marital status, alcohol and tobacco use, and history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or hypertension); 4) records with implausible values or duplications. All data were collected following standardized NHANES protocols, with trained personnel conducting laboratory assessments and administering questionnaires to maintain data integrity and representativeness. A total of 1,418 participants were included in the final sample. Figure 1 Figure 1 Flowchart of the systematic selection process. Variables Exposure variables In this study design, the exposure variable was the PLR, calculated as: PLR = platelet count (10 9 9 Outcome variables The outcome variables in this study were three commonly used metabolic indicators of IR: HOMA-IR, QUICKI and the TyG index. Biological samples for analysis were processed following standardized protocols from the NHANES, adhering to international laboratory standards. Fasting blood samples were routinely obtained for the measurement of plasma glucose and serum insulin concentrations, with all biochemical analyses done under strict quality control procedures: 1) HOMA-IR = fasting glucose (mmol/L) × fasting insulin (µU/mL)/22.5. HOMA-IR is a widely recognized method for IR measurement. A cutoff value of 2.5 was established, values exceeding this threshold are indicative of the presence of IR. 2) QUICKI = 1/(log (fasting insulin (µU/mL)) + log (fasting glucose (mmol/L))). QUICKI is used for quantitative assessment of insulin sensitivity, serves as a complementary method to HOMA-IR for evaluating IR. Higher QUICKI values indicate better insulin sensitivity. Based on the clinical guidelines of the Endocrine Society, a cutoff value of 0.33 was established, with values below this threshold indicating the presence of IR. 3) TyG Index = ln (fasting triglycerides (mg/dL) × fasting glucose (mg/dL))/2. This index estimates IR based on fasting triglycerides and fasting blood glucose (FBG). The TyG Index serves as a surrogate marker for IR based on glucose and lipid metabolism and is particularly suitable for assessing IR in metabolic syndrome research. A cutoff value of 4.68 was established, with values above this threshold indicating the presence of IR. Covariates The selection of covariates was founded on theoretical rationale, literature support, statistical validity, and the specific context of the study. To ensure model stability, we first analyzed potential multicollinearity among covariates using variance inflation factor (VIF), excluding variables with VIF > 10. Although diabetes was initially considered as a potential covariate in preliminary analysis due to its VIF < 10, we ultimately excluded it from our final models. This decision was based on the mechanistic relationship between IR and diabetes, where type 2 diabetes is generally understood to be a clinical manifestation or outcome of progressive IR rather than an independent confounding factor [ 10 11 2 Statistical analysis All continuous variables were found to be non-normally distributed and therefore presented as median with interquartile range (Q1, Q3). Categorical variables were expressed as frequencies with weighted percentages. For between-group comparisons, the Chi-square test was used for categorical variables, while the Mann-Whitney U test was applied for non-normally distributed continuous variables. To examine the association between PLR and IR indicators (HOMA-IR, QUICKI, and the TyG index), we conducted a stepwise analytical approach. First, we employed univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to examine the relationship between PLR quartiles and IR indicators. Three models were constructed with different levels of adjustment: Model 1 included no covariates; Model 2 adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics only; and Model 3 further adjusted for relevant covariates presented in Table 1 Table 1 Characteristics of Study Participants Stratified by Insulin Resistance Indicators Characteristics Total (n = 1,418) HOMA-IR QUICKI TyG index < 2.5 (n = 762) ≥ 2.5 (n = 626) P value ≥ 0.33 (n = 710) < 0.33 (n = 708) P value < 4.68 (n = 718) ≥ 4.68 (n = 700) P value PLR, median (Q1, Q3) 130.5 (101.3, 168.1) 125.28 (96.93, 162.97) 137.14 (107.03, 173.33) < 0.001 123.51 (96.22, 161.42) 137.74 (108.22, 174.30) < 0.001 126.00 (96.32, 163.28) 135.13 (106.39, 172.36) 0.002 Age, years, median (Q1, Q3) 69.0 (58.0, 78.0) 69.00 (57.00, 79.00) 68.00 (58.00, 76.00) 0.891 70.00 (57.75, 79.00) 68.00 (58.00, 76.00) 0.849 68.00 (56.75, 78.00) 69.00 (59.25, 78.00) 0.004 Gender, n (%) 0.046 0.064 0.222 Male 654 (41.6) 296 (39.1) 358 (44.3) 322 (39.4) 332 (44.3) 328 (40.1) 326 (43.3) Female 764 (58.4) 360 (61.0) 404 (55.7) 386 (60.6) 378 (55.8) 372 (59.9) 392 (56.7) Race/ethnicity, n (%) 0.002 0.003 0.253 Mexican American 106 (2.8) 32 (1.6) 74 (4.1) 34 (1.7) 72 (4.21) 40 (2.3) 66 (3.4) Other Hispanic 98 (2.8) 35 (2.6) 54 (3.0) 35 (2.4) 54 (3.2) 44 (3.1) 45 (2.4) Non-Hispanic White 964 (85.2) 489 (88.8) 475 (81.6) 533 (88.5) 44 (81.4) 459 (84.2) 505 (86.3) Non-Hispanic Black 181 (5.3) 65 (3.9) 116 (6.6) 77 (4.2) 104 (6.5) 119 (6.3) 64 (4.1) Other race 78 (3.9) 35 (3.1) 43 (4.7) 39 (3.2) 39 (4.8) 40 (4.0) 38 (3.8) Marital status, n (%) 0.656 0.307 0.091 Never married 81 (4.9) 37 (5.4) 44 (4.4) 43 (5.7) 38 (4.0) 47 (5.4) 34 (4.4) Married/living with partner 892 (68.3) 408 (67.5) 484 (69.1) 441 (67.6) 451 (69.1) 441 (70.2) 451 (66.3) Widowed/divorced/separated 445 (26.8) 211 (27.1) 234 (26.5) 224 (26.7) 221 (27.0) 212 (24.4) 233 (29.4) Education, n (%) 0.033 0.029 0.005 Less than high school 301 (12.9) 124 (11.0) 177 (14.8) 133 (11.1) 168 (15.0) 125 (10.5) 176 (15.4) Above high school 1,117 (87.1) 532 (89.0) 585 (85.2) 575 (88.9) 542 (85.0) 575 (89.5) 542 (84.6) Family PIR, n (%) < 0.001 < 0.001 < 0.001 < 1.3 331 (14.7) 127 (11.4) 204 (18.0) 137 (11.6) 194 (18.2) 143 (12.6) 188 (17.0) 1.3 - 3.5 572 (36.1) 261 (33.6) 311 (38.7) 289 (34.6) 283 (37.8) 276 (31.3) 305 (41.2) ≥ 3.5 515 (49.2) 268 (55.1) 247 (43.3) 282 (53.8) 233 (44.0) 290 (56.1) 225 (41.9) Smoking status, n (%) 0.697 0.956 0.025 No 663 (48.7) 314 (49.3) 349 (48.2) 334 (48.8) 329 (48.7) 344 (51.6) 319 (45.7) Yes 755 (51.3) 342 (50.8) 413 (51.8) 374 (51.2) 381 (51.3) 356 (48.4) 399 (54.4) Alcohol use, n (%) 0.001 < 0.001 0.204 No 354 (20.4) 141 (16.9) 232 (24.0) 150 (16.8) 204 (24.6) 161 (19.1) 193 (21.8) Yes 1,064 (79.6) 515 (83.1) 549 (76.0) 558 (83.2) 506 (75.4) 539 (80.9) 525 (78.2) Sleep duration, h/night, n (%) 0.017 0.006 0.042 < 7 428 (27.3) 182 (24.6) 246 (30.1) 194 (24.1) 234 (31.1) 193 (24.5) 235 (30.3) 7.0 - 9.0 793 (60.8) 388 (64.4) 405 (57.1) 418 (64.4) 375 (56.5) 408 (63.6) 385 (57.8) ≥ 9 197 (11.9) 86 (11.0) 111 (12.8) 96 (11.5) 101 (12.4) 99 (11.9) 98 (11.9) PA, MET-min/week, n (%) < 0.001 < 0.001 < 0.001 < 600 698 (43.7) 296 (38.5) 402 (49.0) 319 (38.4) 379 (49.9) 318 (37.8) 380 (50.0) ≥ 600 720 (56.3) 360 (61.5) 360 (51.0) 389 (61.6) 331 (50.1) 382 (62.2) 338 (50.0) BMI, kg/m 2 < 0.001 < 0.001 < 0.001 < 18.5 20 (1.8) 18 (3.2) 2 (0.3) 19 (3.2) 1 (0.1) 17 (3.1) 3 (0.4) 18.5 < 25 377 (28.3) 292 (45.0) 85 (11.1) 303 (43.8) 74 (10.1) 261 (38.6) 116 (17.1) 25 < 30 486 (34.1) 243 (37.6) 243 (30.6) 270 (37.9) 216 (29.7) 231 (33.3) 255 (35.0) ≥ 30 535 (35.8) 103 (14.2) 432 (58.0) 116 (15.2) 419 (60.1) 191 (25.0) 344 (47.5) Diabetes mellitus, n (%) < 0.001 < 0.001 < 0.001 No 979 (76.4) 559 (90.8) 420 (61.6) 599 (90.3) 380 (60.1) 589 (88.3) 390 (63.6) Yes 439 (23.6) 97 (9.2) 342 (38.4) 109 (9.7) 330 (39.9) 111 (11.7) 328 (36.4) CVD, n (%) < 0.001 < 0.001 0.002 No 1,066 (80.0) 516 (83.8) 550 (76.2) 559 (83.9) 507 (75.5) 553 (83.2) 513 (76.7) Yes 352 (20.0) 140 (16.2) 212 (23.8) 149 (16.1) 203 (24.5) 147 (16.8) 205 (23.4) Hypertension, n (%) < 0.001 < 0.001 < 0.001 No 596 (48.2) 339 (58.4) 257 (37.7) 363 (58.2) 233 (36.4) 340 (56.2) 256 (39.6) Yes 822 (51.8) 317 (41.6) 257 (62.3) 345 (41.8) 477 (63.6) 360 (43.8) 462 (60.4) Non-normally distributed continuous variables are presented as median (Q1, Q3), and categorical variables are reported as n (weighted %).

PLR: platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio; HOMA-IR: homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance; QUICKI: quantitative insulin sensitivity check index; TyG: triglyceride-glucose; PIR: poverty income ratio; PA: physical activity; BMI: body mass index; CVD: cardiovascular disease; ANOVA: analysis of variance. To explore potential effect modification by key clinical characteristics on the association between PLR and IR indicators, we conducted prespecified stratified analyses. Within each subgroup, we employed multivariable logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals for the association between PLR and IR indicators, with adjustment for potential confounders according to Model 3. We visualized the effect estimates, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values for the association between PLR and each IR indicator across different subgroups using forest plots, allowing for assessment of the statistical significance of between-subgroup differences. Finally, to evaluate the discriminative ability of PLR for IR, we plotted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for each IR assessment method (HOMA-IR, QUICKI, and the TyG index) and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals. The optimal PLR cutoff value for each indicator was determined by maximizing the Youden index (sensitivity + specificity - 1), and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity at the cutoff points were reported. All statistical analyses were performed using R statistical software, and a two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Ethic statement This study was conducted using publicly available data from the NHANES database and did not involve any additional interventions or direct contact with participants. Data collection and usage were approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). All research data were anonymized, and individuals in the database survey had already signed informed consent forms at the time of recruitment. This study fully adhered to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and complied with the regulatory requirements of the US government’s health research policies. Therefore, no additional ethical review or informed consent was required. Results Baseline characteristics This study enrolled 1,418 participants, representing a weighted population of 20,233,847 US adults. The median age of the study population was 69.0 years (interquartile range: 58.0 - 78.0), with females comprising 58.4% of participants. Non-Hispanic Whites represented the predominant racial/ethnic group (85.2%). Among the study population, 35.8% were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 Comparison of population characteristics across IR categories revealed that participants with high HOMA-IR (≥ 2.5) exhibited significantly higher PLR values compared to those with low HOMA-IR (< 2.5) (137.14 vs. 125.28, P < 0.001). Regarding sociodemographic characteristics, the low HOMA-IR group had a higher proportion of females (61.0% vs. 55.7%, P = 0.046) and non-Hispanic Whites (88.8% vs. 81.6%), while Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Blacks were more prevalent in the low HOMA-IR group (P = 0.002). Individuals with lower HOMA-IR were more likely to have higher educational attainment (89.0% vs. 85.2%, P = 0.033) and higher income levels (family poverty income ratio (PIR) ≥ 3.5: 55.1% vs. 43.3%, P < 0.001). With respect to lifestyle factors, alcohol consumption was more prevalent in the low HOMA-IR group (83.1% vs. 76.0%, P = 0.001). Optimal sleep duration (7 - 9 h per night) was more common among individuals with low HOMA-IR (64.4% vs. 57.1%, P = 0.017), as was high physical activity level (≥ 600 MET-min/week) (61.5% vs. 51.0%, P < 0.001). The proportion of normal weight individuals (18.5 ≤ BMI < 25 kg/m 2 2 Similar trends were observed when comparing groups by QUICKI and TyG Index. Participants with high QUICKI (≥ 0.33) and low TyG (< 4.68) demonstrated more favorable metabolic profiles, including lower PLR values, better socioeconomic status, better lifestyle, and lower chronic disease burden. Overall, these findings demonstrate significant associations between IR and PLR levels, socioeconomic status, lifestyle choices, and chronic disease burden in this nationally representative sample.

Assessed by HOMA-IR When using HOMA-IR as the assessment tool, participants in the highest PLR quartile (Q4, ≥ 168.18) demonstrated a 64% higher risk of IR compared to those in the lowest quartile (Q1, < 101.33) in the unadjusted model (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.11 - 2.13, P = 0.013). This association was attenuated and no longer statistically significant in Model 2 and Model 3 (Model 2: HR = 1.58, 95% CI: 1.07 - 2.35, P = 0.223; Model 3: HR = 1.40, 95% CI: 0.90 - 2.14, P = 0.140). Trend analysis revealed that each increment in PLR quartile was associated with an 18% increase in IR risk in the unadjusted model (HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04 - 1.34, P = 0.008); however, this trend was weakened after full adjustment (HR = 1.13, 95% CI: 0.98 - 1.30, P = 0.091). Assessed by QUICKI The QUICKI assessment demonstrated more robust associations across all adjustment models. Compared to the reference group, all higher PLR quartiles showed significantly increased IR risk. The association was strongest for the highest PLR quartile (Q4), with an 80% increased risk in the unadjusted model (HR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.21 - 2.68, P = 0.003), which remained significant even after full adjustment (Model 3: HR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.02 - 2.53, P = 0.040). Similarly, participants in the third PLR quartile (Q3) exhibited a 60% higher risk in the fully adjusted model (HR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.05 - 2.51, P = 0.030). The dose-response relationship was confirmed by the significant trend test across all models, with each increment in PLR quartile associated with a 19% increase in IR risk in the fully adjusted model (HR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.03 - 1.38, P = 0.021). Assessed by the TyG index The TyG index yielded consistent results, with all higher PLR quartiles showing significantly increased IR risk. The third PLR quartile (Q3) demonstrated the strongest association, with a 69% higher risk after full adjustment (Model 3: HR = 1.69, 95% CI: 1.09 - 2.62, P = 0.017). Participants in the second quartile (Q2) and highest quartile (Q4) also showed significantly elevated risks in the fully adjusted model, with HRs of 1.61 (95% CI: 1.02 - 2.46, P = 0.027) and 1.56 (95% CI: 1.02 - 2.45, P = 0.035), respectively. The trend analysis further supported the dose-dependent nature of this relationship, with each increment in PLR quartile associated with a 15% increase in IR risk after full adjustment (HR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.01 - 1.31, P = 0.039). Collectively, these results demonstrate a consistent positive association between elevated PLR levels and increased IR risk. This association was most robust when assessed using the QUICKI and the TyG index, where the associations remained statistically significant even after comprehensive adjustment for demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, and relevant comorbidities. The magnitude of risk increase ranged from approximately 56% to 61% for individuals in the higher PLR quartiles compared to those in the lowest quartile. The significant trend analyses further support a dose-response association between PLR and IR risk, suggesting that PLR may serve as a potentially useful clinical indicator for IR prediction.

The reference point was set at a PLR value of 130.53 across all analyses. All models were adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, family PIR, smoking status, alcohol consumption, sleep duration, physical activity, BMI, history of diabetes status, CVD and hypertension. PLR: platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio; IR: insulin resistance; HOMA-IR: homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance; QUICKI: quantitative insulin sensitivity check index; TyG: triglyceride-glucose; PIR: poverty income ratio; BMI: body mass index; CVD: cardiovascular disease; OR: odds ratio; CI: confidence interval. Subgroup analysis of PLR and IR in cancer survivors To further explore the population heterogeneity in the association between PLR and IR, we conducted extensive subgroup analyses to identify specific sensitive populations, including age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, education level, family PIR, smoking status, alcohol consumption, sleep duration, physical activity, BMI, and history of CVD and hypertension. Figure 3 Figure 3 Subgroup analysis of the association between PLR and IR assessed by HOMA-IR (a), QUICKI (b), and the TyG index (c). For quartile analysis, odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) represent the comparison of the highest quartile (Q4) versus the lowest quartile (Q1). All OR and interaction measures were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, education level, family PIR, smoking status, alcohol use, sleep duration, physical activity, BMI, and comorbidities (CVD and hypertension), with the stratification component in question being excluded. PLR: platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio; IR: insulin resistance; HOMA-IR: homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance; QUICKI: quantitative insulin sensitivity check index; TyG: triglyceride-glucose; PIR: poverty income ratio; BMI: body mass index; CVD: cardiovascular disease. Interaction effect analysis revealed no significant interactions between PLR and IR across the examined subgroup characteristics in both HOMA-IR and QUICKI models (P > 0.05). However, in the TyG index model, significant interactions were observed. Specifically, individuals in the highest PLR quartile (Q4) compared to the lowest quartile (Q1) demonstrated higher susceptibility to IR among those with physical activity < 600 MET-min/week (OR = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.12, 4.61) and those with a history of hypertension (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.05, 3.63), with P for interaction values of 0.007 and 0.036, respectively. ROC curve analysis To determine the optimal cutoff values of PLR for clinically detecting IR in cancer survivors, ROC curve analyses were performed for three IR indicators ( Fig. 4 Table 3 Figure 4 ROC curve analysis of PLR for predicting IR assessed by HOMA-IR (a), QUICKI (b), and the TyG index (c). PLR: platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio; IR: insulin resistance; HOMA-IR: homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance; QUICKI: quantitative insulin sensitivity check index; TyG: triglyceride-glucose; ROC: receiver operating characteristic; AUC: area under the curve. Table 3 ROC Curve Analysis of PLR for Predicting Insulin Resistance Assessed by HOMA-IR, QUICKI, and the TyG Index IR indicator Variable Cutoff value Sensitivity Specificity AUC (95% CI) HOMA-IR PLR 124 0.525 0.588 0.561 (0.531, 0.591) QUICKI PLR 132 0.617 0.562 0.616 (0.587, 0.645) TyG index PLR 137 0.606 0.587 0.622 (0.593, 0.651) IR and other composite inflammatory indicators based on complete blood count To thoroughly evaluate the utility of complete blood count-derived inflammatory markers in predicting IR among cancer survivors, we analyzed several composite inflammatory indicators calculated from routine blood tests, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR, NLR= neutrophil count/lymphocyte count), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR, LMR = lymphocyte count/monocyte count), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII, SII = platelet count × neutrophil count/lymphocyte count), and systemic inflammation response index (SIRI, SIRI = neutrophil count × monocyte count/lymphocyte count). Results indicated that although these indicators showed varying degrees of correlation with IR measures in univariate analyses, most of them demonstrated limited predictive value after adjusting for potential confounding factors in our fully adjusted models. When using HOMA-IR as the IR measurement index, only SII showed a statistically significant association (P = 0.016) in the fully adjusted model. Similarly, when using the TyG as the IR index, only LMR demonstrated significant correlation (P = 0.002). All other inflammatory indicators failed to show significant associations with IR (all P > 0.05). The complete results of these analyses are presented in the accompanying file ( Supplementary Material 1 wjon.elmerpub.com Discussion In this study, we assessed IR using three different indicators: HOMA-IR, QUICKI, and the TyG index. Our findings revealed that higher PLR levels were significantly associated with increased risk of IR in cancer survivors, particularly when assessed using QUICKI and the TyG index. Compared to the lowest PLR quartile (Q1), individuals in the highest quartile (Q4) showed significantly increased IR risk when assessed by QUICKI (HR = 1.61, 95% CI: 1.02 - 2.53, P = 0.040) and TyG index (HR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.02 - 2.45, P = 0.035). Each increment in PLR quartile was associated with a 19% (QUICKI) and 15% (TyG) increased risk of IR. The ROC analysis results indicated that PLR cutoff values in the range of 124 - 137 can serve as screening thresholds for IR in cancer survivors. In the subgroup analysis, the PLR and IR showed no significant interaction across all examined subgroup characteristics in both the HOMA-IR and QUICKI models (P > 0.05). However, in the TyG index model, individuals in the Q4 compared to the Q1 demonstrated greater susceptibility to IR in those with physical activity < 600 MET-min/week (OR = 2.28, 95% CI: 1.12 - 4.61); and those with a history of hypertension (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.05 - 3.63), with P values for interaction of 0.007 and 0.036, respectively. Recent studies revealed that different cancer types showed varied degrees of association with IR, with pancreatic and hepatic carcinomas showing the most pronounced correlation [ 4 12 13 13 4 12 14 4 15 16 18 4 14 19 20 Current methods for assessing IR primarily include: 1) The Glucose Clamp technique, which involves continuous intravenous insulin infusion while adjusting glucose infusion rates to maintain stable blood glucose levels, measuring insulin sensitivity. This is recognized as the gold standard for measuring insulin sensitivity, directly assessing insulin action with high reliability. However, this test is time-consuming, technically complex, costly, and unsuitable for routine clinical use or large-scale epidemiological studies. 2) Clinical surrogate indicators such as HOMA-IR, fasting insulin measurement, HOMA-β (pancreatic β-cell function index), QUICKI, Matsuda index, and the TyG index, reduce the assessment costs and simplify the testing procedures, and enhance practicality and accessibility. However, the accuracy of most indicators relies on strict fasting conditions [ 21 23 24 25 23 26 27 23 27 The PLR reflects the dual changes of increased platelets and decreased lymphocytes. During acute inflammation and prothrombotic conditions, proinflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10) stimulate megakaryocyte proliferation, leading to elevated platelet counts [ 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 38 39 40 Our findings align with several studies investigating the relationship between PLR and IR. In a study of 405 patients with type 2 diabetes, Zhang et al found that PLR level was independently and positively correlated with IR risk (OR: 1.011, 95% CI: 1.002 - 1.019, P = 0.014). Higher PLR levels were significantly associated with IR, and the higher the PLR value, the more severe the degree of IR, which suggested that PLR can be used as an effective marker to evaluate IR risk [ 41 42 43 44 The mechanistic connection between PLR-indicated systemic inflammation and IR involves multiple interconnected pathways. Elevated PLR reflects a state of chronic inflammation characterized by enhanced platelet activation and relative lymphopenia. This inflammatory milieu creates a complex network of molecular interactions that directly impairs insulin signaling efficiency. First, proinflammatory cytokines (such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) promote serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRSs), particularly IRS-1, activate signaling pathways including JNK, ERK, and p38, interfere with insulin signal transduction, downregulate GLUT4 transporter expression, reduce glucose uptake, and directly inhibit effective insulin signaling, thereby decreasing insulin sensitivity [ 45 48 49 50 50 30 51 52 53 54 3 13 To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale, nationally representative study to specifically investigate the association between PLR and IR in cancer survivors, addressing a critical gap in the existing literature. Unlike previous studies that focused on general populations or specific disease groups, our research recognizes cancer survivors as a unique population with distinct metabolic vulnerabilities due to their treatment history and underlying inflammatory burden. This study reveals the significant clinical value of the association between PLR and IR in cancer survivors. First, PLR, as a readily available indicator from routine blood tests, offers a simple, cost-effective, and noninvasive tool for assessing IR risk and screening for metabolic complications in cancer survivors. Second, our research is the first to confirm the association between PLR and various IR indicators in a nationally representative sample, identifying physical activity, and hypertension as important effect modifiers. This provides a basis for developing individualized monitoring strategies for cancer survivors. Finally, we established clinically applicable PLR cutoff values (124 - 137) that can be immediately implemented in routine clinical practice for IR screening. This study has several advantages that ensure the reliability and broad applicability of our findings. First, we utilized the NHANES 2005-2018 database, a large representative sample that enhances the external validity and statistical robustness of our results. Second, we employed a multidimensional assessment strategy, comprehensively evaluating the association between PLR and IR through three different IR indicators (HOMA-IR, QUICKI, and the TyG index), overcoming the limitations that might exist with a single indicator. Third, in our analytical approach, we constructed three-level stepwise adjustment models from simple to complex, systematically controlling for potential confounding factors, and revealed the non-linear relationship between PLR and IR through RCS regression analysis. Fourth, this study conducted detailed subgroup analyses, providing a theoretical foundation for clinical precision risk assessment. Fifth, we strictly adhered to NHANES standardized sample collection and laboratory testing procedures, ensuring data quality. Finally, this study is the first to focus on cancer survivors as a special high-risk population, filling a gap in existing literature in this field and providing new perspectives for understanding the potential mechanisms of metabolic complications in cancer survivors. This study has several limitations. First, as a cross-sectional study, we can only establish the association between PLR and IR, not a causal relationship. Second, our research is based on the US population, and caution should be exercised when generalizing these findings to other racial or regional populations. Third, despite adjusting for multiple known confounding factors, unmeasured confounders may still exist, such as specific cancer types, treatment regimens (chemotherapy, radiotherapy), and disease staging, which could influence the relationship between PLR and IR. Fourth, although HOMA-IR, QUICKI, and the TyG index are effective surrogate markers for assessing IR, they may have certain limitations compared to the glucose clamp technique (the gold standard). Fifth, our study sample included a high proportion of elderly participants (median age 69 years), which may limit the applicability of the results to younger cancer survivors. Finally, in the present study dataset, participants with extreme PLR values (such as > 400) were very few (only nine cases), making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about the diagnostic performance in this extreme range. Based on the results of this study, we only recommend the use of PLR for IR screening within the routine range (50 - 300). In the future, we can pursue the following research directions. First, comparative studies between cancer survivors and non-cancer populations are needed to distinguish between general risk factors for IR and cancer-specific inflammatory pathways that may exacerbate metabolic dysregulation. Such comparisons would help determine whether the observed associations between PLR and IR are unique to the post-cancer state or reflect general inflammatory mechanisms. Second, longitudinal studies tracking PLR and IR markers from pre-diagnosis through cancer treatment and into survivorship would provide valuable insights into the temporal relationship between inflammation and metabolic changes. This could help establish whether elevated PLR is a cause or consequence of IR in this population and identify optimal intervention windows. Third, mechanistic studies investigating the biological pathways connecting platelet activation, lymphocyte dynamics, and insulin signaling in cancer survivors are warranted. Such research could reveal novel therapeutic targets for preventing or managing IR in this growing population. Fourth, intervention studies targeting inflammatory pathways in high-risk subgroups identified in our analysis (particularly physically inactive individuals and those with hypertension) would help determine whether reducing inflammation could improve insulin sensitivity in cancer survivors. Special attention should be paid to interventions appropriate for these sensitive populations. Finally, studies examining how cancer type, stage, status, treatment modalities, and time since diagnosis modify the PLR-IR relationship would help refine risk assessment and personalize monitoring and intervention strategies. This is particularly important given the heterogeneity of cancer survivorship experiences and the varying metabolic effects of different cancer treatments. These future research directions could significantly advance our understanding of inflammation-related metabolic dysfunction in cancer survivors and ultimately lead to improved clinical guidance for this growing population with unique health needs. Conclusions Higher PLR levels significantly increase the risk of IR in cancer survivors, particularly when assessed through QUICKI and the TyG index. In the TyG index model, this association was more pronounced in individuals with lower physical activity and a history of hypertension. PLR, as an easily accessible biomarker, provides potential clinical value for assessing IR risk in cancer survivors, offering a scientific foundation for developing individualized monitoring and intervention strategies.
