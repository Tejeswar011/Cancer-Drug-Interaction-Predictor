Background The efficacy of PD-1 inhibitors in the induction therapy of locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LA-NPC) remains unclear. The aim of this study was to retrospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitor combined with induction chemotherapy in patients with LA-NPC. Patients and methods A retrospective study was conducted on 158 LA-NPC patients, 80 patients received TPF (nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin and 5-fuorouracil) induction chemotherapy, and 78 patients received TPF-ICB (TPF plus PD-1 inhibitor) chemoimmunotherapy. Treatment response was evaluated immediately following completion of induction therapy using RECIST v1.1 criteria, including cervical lymph nodes and primary nasopharynx lesions. Responses were categorized as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), or progressive disease (PD), with objective response rate (ORR) calculated as the combined CR+PR rate. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity assessment. Acute treatment-related toxicities during induction therapy were graded according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria and compared between treatment groups. Results After induction therapy, the ORR in the TPF group was significantly lower than that in the TPF-ICB group (71.2% vs. 88.5%, p p p p p p Conclusions The induction therapy of PD-1 inhibitor combined with TPF showed high CR and ORR rates in LA-NPC, and the safety was acceptable. locally advanced stage nasopharyngeal TPF PD-1 inhibitor concurrent chemoradiotherapy efficacy and safety The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

The effectiveness and safety of many PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have been demonstrated in patients with recurrent or metastatic NPC (R/M-NPC) ( 20 21 20 22 25 NCT03121716 NCT03581786 20 23 26 Clinical evidence from immune checkpoint inhibitors in recurrent/metastatic NPC (R/M-NPC) suggests that IC combined with immunotherapy may be a promising treatment option for LA-NPC ( 20 22 23 p 27 Despite the biological rationale, clinical data on combining IC with PD-1 inhibitors in LA-NPC remain limited. Preliminary evidence from the phase II CAPTAIN study demonstrated that camrelizumab monotherapy achieved a 28.2% objective response rate (ORR) in heavily pretreated recurrent/metastatic NPC, with biomarker analysis suggesting MHC cell density and PD-L1 expression may predict response ( 23 26 Methods Ethics consideration The retrospective study was approved by the ethics Committee of Chengdu Fifth People’s Hospital/The Second Clinical Medical College, Affiliated Fifth People’s Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Committee. All participants were asked to sign an informed consent form. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations and adhered to the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee as well as with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration (along with its later amendments or similar ethical standards). Patient selection This study aims to retrospectively investigate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 inhibitors combined with TPF induction chemotherapy in LA-NPC patients. Patients were enrolled if they met these criteria: with untreated locally advanced III-IVA stage NPC based on the 8th AJCC classification; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 – 1; and adequate marrow and organ function. The main exclusion criteria included the combination of a second malignancy; a previous or ongoing active autoimmune disease; acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS); active hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and active tuberculosis; and incomplete follow-up data. Induction chemotherapy and immunotherapy Between January 2018 and December 2023, 158 patients with untreated III-IVA stage LA-NPC (cT1-2 N2-3 or cT3-4 N0-3 based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCCC) 8<sup>th</sup> edition) met the inclusion and exclusion criteria of this study. All patients received induction TPF chemotherapy every 3 weeks for three cycles: nab-paclitaxel (Shiyao Group Ouyi, Shijiazhuang, China) 260 mg/m 2 2 2 16 28 29 Concurrent chemoradiotherapy All patients received 3 cycles of IC followed by CCRT, with radiotherapy administered using intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) techniques according to NPC treatment guidelines ( 16 30 3 31 The IMRT target volumes included the primary gross tumor volume (GTVp, 70.95 Gy/33 fractions), metastatic lymph nodes (GTVn, 66 Gy/33 fractions), high-risk clinical target volume (CTV1, 60 Gy/30 fractions), and low-risk clinical target volume (CTV2, 54 Gy/30 fractions), with treatments delivered five times weekly, consistent with established protocols ( 28 32 33 Study endpoints The main endpoint of this study is the clinical ORR after 3 cycles of induction therapy, and it is required to be done 1 week before the start of radiotherapy. Tumor response assessment was performed 1 week following induction therapy completion through: (1) systematic nasopharyngoscopic evaluation and (2) contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the nasopharynx and neck (or computed tomography (CT) for patients with MRI contraindications). Secondary endpoints included PFS, overall survival (OS), and toxicity assessment. According to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1.0) ( 34 35 Survival and prognostic factors PFS was defined as the time from the start of the patient’s induction chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy to PD or death from any cause. OS was calculated from the time of initial diagnosis to the time of death from any cause. Kaplan Meier survival curve plot describes the PFS and OS of patients. Cox univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine prognostic indicators for PFS and OS in patients with NPC. Follow-up Follow-up procedures were systematically conducted at 3-month intervals in years 0 – 3, at 6-month intervals in years 3 – 5, and annually thereafter (until death). The comprehensive evaluations comprising: (1) physical examinations with nasopharyngeal endoscopy; (2) head and neck MRI/CT; (3) serum tumor marker assessment; (4) quantitative Epstein-Barr virus DNA monitoring. The final follow-up data were updated on June 1, 2024. For survival analysis, all time-to-event outcomes were calculated from the initial diagnosis date until either the occurrence of the defined event or the final follow-up contact. Statistical analysis Continuous variables were analyzed using Student’s T-tests; categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. The chi-square test was used to compare clinical pathologic variables, therapeutic efficacy, ORR, and toxicity between the two groups. The cutoff values of age and the Ki67 index were calculated using ROC curves. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to compare the PFS and OS between the two groups. A Cox model was subsequently used to assess the independence of immunotherapy in affecting the PFS and OS. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0. The differences of p Results Patient characteristics This study included 158 LA-NPC patients meeting the inclusion criteria, comprising 80 patients receiving TPF chemotherapy alone and 78 receiving PD-1 inhibitors plus TPF. The immunotherapy subgroup (n=80) included sintilimab (33 patients), tislelizumab (27), and toripalimab (20). The cohort consisted of 108 males (68.4%) and 50 females (31.6%), with a mean age of 55.4 years. Tumor staging distribution was: T1 (5.1%), T2 (38.0%), T3 (37.3%), and T4 (19.6%); nodal staging was N0 (2.5%), N1 (14.6%), N2 (60.8%), and N3 (22.2%). Disease stages were III (58.2%) and IV (41.8%). Demographics showed 24.7% patients <50 years and 75.3% ≥50 years, with 63.3% non-smokers and 83.3% non-drinkers. ECOG performance status was 0 (42.4%) or 1 (57.6%). Based on Ki67 proliferation index (low: <10%; moderate: 10-30%; high: ≥30%), patients were stratified into high-proliferation (Ki67≥30%) and intermediate/low-proliferation (Ki67<30%) groups. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/height² (m²). The groups showed comparable distributions, with no significant differences found in baseline characteristics, including age, gender, ECOG status, disease stage, Ki67, BMI, smoking, and drinking status (  Table 1 p Table 1 Baseline clinical characteristics of patients with LA-NPC in different treatment groups.

Discussion This retrospective study major explored the safety and efficacy of TPF induced chemotherapy combined with PD-1 inhibitor in LA-NPC patients. The most important finding in current research is that the addition of PD-1 inhibitors to LA-NPC induced chemotherapy does not significantly increase the risk of adverse events in patients. On the contrary, it is more beneficial for tumor remission during induction therapy. Induction chemotherapy based on gemcitabine + cisplatin (GP) or docetaxel+ cisplatin + fluorouracil combined with CCRT is one of the standard treatment methods for LA-NPC ( 17 29 36 37 16 17 38 20 23 26 The PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway is an important pathway in the mechanism of tumor escape ( 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 Currently, PD-1 inhibitor combined chemotherapy has been approved as the first-line standard treatment for R/M-NPC. Similar to classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma, NPC features a unique lymphocyte infiltration environment, making it more susceptible to the benefits of PD-1 inhibitors ( 46 48 22 p 23 p 21 20 Based on preclinical evidence and promising results of PD-1 inhibitors in RM-NPC, adding immunotherapy to induction therapy for LA-NPC patients is a popular clinical research topic. Research has shown that after induction chemotherapy, the bone marrow-derived suppressor cells, regulatory T cells, and B cells in the peripheral blood of NPC patients are significantly reduced, while CD3 T cells, central memory T cells, and pro-inflammatory cytokines are significantly increased. This provides a solid foundation for exploring the combination of immunotherapy and induction chemotherapy for NPC ( 49 A retrospective study included 57 LA-NPC patients who received induction chemotherapy combined with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, which significantly increased the ORR rate of primary nasopharynx from 68.60% in the induction chemotherapy group (121 patients) alone to 94.7% ( 50 51 52 53 53 A randomized controlled phase 3 clinical study on the combination of GP induced chemotherapy and CCRT therapy with sintilimab for the treatment of 210 LA-NPC also showed that adding PD-1 inhibitors to standard treatment increased the 3-year event-free survival rate from 76% to 86% (median follow-up was 41·9 months) ( 27 27 NCT04453826 NCT04557020 54 27 50 51 53 To our knowledge, this is the first real-world study evaluating TPF induction chemotherapy combined with PD-1 inhibitors for LA-NPC. Our study provides robust evidence supporting the incorporation of PD-1 inhibitors into TPF induction chemotherapy for LA-NPC, with a median follow-up of 65 months—one of the longest reported in this setting. Unlike previous studies ( 27 49 51 53 55 NCT03707509 23 NCT03581786 21 3 The superior ORR and survival in our TPF-ICB group may also reflect synergistic effects between chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Preclinical evidence suggests that chemotherapy enhances antigen presentation and T-cell activation, potentially augmenting PD-1 inhibitor efficacy ( 56 57 59 60 62 63 65 NCT04398056 66 On the other hand, we analyzed the safety of PD-1 inhibitor combined with chemotherapy in the induction therapy of LA-NPC. In our real-world study, the most common adverse events in patients during immunotherapy combined with TPF-induced chemotherapy included hair loss (100%), peripheral nerve numbness (23.8%), vomiting (17.4%) and decreased appetite (16.2%). In addition, the incidence of adverse events in PD-1 inhibitor combined with TPF group was not significantly higher than that in TPF chemotherapy group alone. Overall, the incidence of adverse events, with the exception of hair loss, was lower than in previous studies ( 67 67 However, the discussion on the optimal induction therapy for LA-NPC is still ongoing, and the optimal sequence of PD-1 inhibitors (induction and maintenance) and long-term outcomes (over 5 years) are still unclear. In any case, we have seen a glimmer of hope in PD-1 monoclonal immunotherapy in LA-NPC patients, and hope to be confirmed by more study results and longer follow-up. Although the heterogeneity of this study is relatively high, considering that we are attempting to explore the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and their impact on NPC from a holistic perspective, this is acceptable. On the one hand, compared with standard treatment, the combination chemotherapy of sintilimab, tislelizumab, and toripalimab has shown encouraging therapeutic effects and good tolerability in NPC patients. On the other hand, there were no statistically significant differences in PFS and OS among patients in different immunotherapy regimens. Moving forward, we highlight three critical research directions: biomarker discovery to identify optimal candidates, optimization of treatment sequencing to maximize synergy while minimizing toxicity, and comprehensive tumor microenvironment characterization using single-cell technologies to elucidate the dynamic immune changes induced by this combination therapy ( 54 65 68 69 Despite these promising results, our study has limitations. Firstly, its retrospective design may introduce selection bias, though baseline characteristics were balanced ( p 70 71 75 Conclusion This study demonstrates that PD-1 inhibitors combined with TPF induction chemotherapy yield exceptional short-term efficacy and manageable toxicity in LA-NPC, expanding upon prior GP-based immunotherapy trials. The regimen’s innovation lies in its synergy potential and applicability to high-risk subgroups (T4/N3). Larger randomized studies with extended follow-up are warranted to validate these findings and refine patient selection criteria.
