Basigin (BSG) is a transmembrane protein with multifunctional roles in the breast tumor microenvironment. Using the hallmarks of cancer, we explore the pleiotropic roles of BSG in breast cancer. Further, we examine the cellular interactants of BSG and the molecular regulators of BSG. BSG has the potential to play a prognostic role and is a candidate target for new therapeutic interventions.

The prospective implications of targeting BSG, associated molecular interactants, and miRNAs for therapeutic and prognostic purposes in BC is also explored. Cellular and molecular marker profiles of BC subtypes BC can be classified in a number of different ways: location (ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)/lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) and stages), immunohistochemical (IHC) markers, and recently with molecular markers that include miRNAs and mutations of key oncogenic genes (BC antigen gene 1 and 2, BRCA1, BRCA2 TP53 48 48 49 49 50 1 Table 1 Classifications of BC Subtypes Title Subtypes Markers Tests References Classical Histopathology (3 subtypes) DCIS, IBC, LCIS Hormone receptor proteins IHC 260 Intrinsic Subtypes (4 subtypes) Normal-like, Basal-like, ERBB2 + , ER + /Luminal-like Estrogen receptor, Basal Keratins, ERBB2 mRNA 49 Intrinsic Subtypes [PAM50] (5 subtypes) Normal-like, Basal-like, ERBB2 + , Lum A, Lum B, Lum C ER, Keratins, Laminin, ERBB2, Adipose markers mRNA 245 PAM50/ Topological data analysis (TDA) (7 subtypes) Normal, ERBB2+ Normal/HER2+ Basal-like, Lum A, Lum B, Lum B/HER2+ Myoepithelial Genes Mathematical models/ mRNA 53 PAM50-ROR (prognostic prediction) Normal, Basal ERBB2 + , Lum A, Lum B HR, HER2, Clinical Data mRNA 54 Intrinsic Subtypes + Claudin Low (6 subtypes) Normal-like, Basal-like, ERBB2+ Lum A, Lum B, Claudin-low HER2 + ; Luminal Genes; Cell-Cell Adhesion Proteins; Immune System Response, Proliferation, Mesenchymal/ECM Genes; Claudins mRNA 55 261 miRNA-based intrinsic subtypes (10 subtypes) ERBB2 + , Lum A, Basal, Lum B, Basal/ERBB2 + , Basal/Lum B, Basal/Lum A, ERBB2 + /Lum B, ERBB2 + /Lum A, Lum A/ Lum B, HER2, HRs, Ki67, CAIX, Cytokeratins, microRNAs Small RNA sequencing 37 60 ECM miRNA HER2 Lum DCIS IBC LCIS IHC mRNA TDA HR CAIX Studies have shown that the presence of multiple cell types in normal mammary epithelia that acquire distinct features when transitioning to a disease state can become markers of disease and are key in identifying and delivering targeted therapy to the malignant cells 44 51 52 53 57 58 59 60 60 61 34 37 62 2 Table 2 Commercial tests for clinical analysis of breast cancer Test Analytes Detection Method Use References PAM50 gene panel 50 gene panel Microarray, qRT-PCR BC Prognosis 4 subtypes classification 54 245 Prosigna PAM50 panel Nanostring Array Risk of Recurrence 262 Blueprint 80 gene panel Microarray Selecting chemotherapy or endocrine therapy 263 Oncotype DX 16 prognostic +5 reference genes qRT-PCR Risk of Recurrence 264 MammaPrint 70 genes Microarray Administration of chemotherapy 265 266 qRT-PCR BC With advanced technologies providing us with a better understanding of the numerous diseases affecting individuals, we have also come to understand the great inter-individual variability that stems from environmental, physiological, molecular, and socioeconomic factors unique to each person 63 64 65 66 TP53), GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MAP3K1), BRCA1 67 68 69 70 71 72 Expression significance of BSG in BC While the methods of BC classification are diverse and evolving with our understanding of the neoplasm, surface markers will remain key players in early detection and treatment of this malignancy. Most patients still receive treatment plans revolving around the classical disease markers (IHC and pathological classification), leading to under or over-treatment of the disease 73 74 73 75 76 77 78 As a surface marker that has been implicated in tumor-initiating breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs), the transmembrane glycoprotein BSG has the potential to play a role in the next generation of cancer biomarkers 79 80 22 24 81 23 82 83 84 85 86 87 89 90 91 92 1 93 95 Fig. 1 Role of BSG in surpassing the hallmarks of cancer. The Hallmarks of cancer, first introduced by Hanahan and Weinberg in 2000 95 94 93 https://BioRender.com/8ttjnxe Role of BSG in nonmutational epigenetic programming Epigenetic modifications—including DNA methylation, histone modification, noncoding RNA (ncRNA) modulation of gene expression, and epi-transcriptomic regulation of RNAs to modulate gene expression have been identified as key drivers of cancer development and progression 96 97 98 96 99 BSG is able to induce the synthesis of hyaluronan, the primary ligand for cell surface receptor CD44, which has been previously implicated in BC stem cells 85 85 100 101 102 104 105 BSG-mediated activation of invasion and progression to metastasis Hyaluronan is ubiquitous throughout the extracellular matrix and a key element of the TME that influences tumor growth and disease progression 106 100 107 108 113 85 104 109 114 115 21 85 111 While the precise roles of MMPs in cancer metastasis are debated due to their involvement in numerous contradictory pathways, the interactions between BSG and MMPs are worth examining. BSG has been observed to mediate the activity and expression of MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-14, and MT2-MMP 116 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 BSG-regulated cell proliferation and inflammation It is interesting to note that when released from the cell membrane, soluble BSG inhibits migration of BC cells, but promotes cellular proliferation 125 126 127 128 129 130 127 MCT-4 overexpression has been observed in the metastatic BC cell line MDA-MB-231 131 132 133 132 134 BSG-mediated inducing or accessing of vasculature Vasculature within the TME is essential for the survival and metastasis of cancer, enabling the delivery of nutrients to cancer cells and metastasis from the primary site throughout the body. Experimentally, BSG has been proven to promote angiogenesis via inducing the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in both MMP-dependent and independent manner 135 136 137 139 140 136 BSG in the deregulation of cellular energetics BSG has been shown to play a role in glycolysis in numerous cancers 141 89 111 142 111 143 31 111 144 145 144 144 146 148 At the leading edge of a tumor, lactate efflux acidifies the TME, which in turn enhances invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance 111 149 Xenopus 150 151 152 2 Fig. 2 Pleiotropic role of BSG in Stages of Breast Cancer Progression. The multifunctional roles of BSG in the TME enable tumor growth and progression to distant metastases by (i) enabling lactate efflux to promote an acidic environment that inhibits the growth of normal cells and promotes tumor expansion, (ii) by stimulating VEGF production BSG promotes the delivery of nutrients to the TME and the development of vasculature through which CSCs can metastasize, and (iii) by disrupting tumor ECM through CD44/MMP production, BSG promotes anchorage-independent growth and EMT transformation. BSG enriched cells form a population of CSCs, which intravasate blood vessels, circulate, and extravasate to a distance site. Created in BioRender. Richard, V. (2025) https://BioRender.com/5gpaf4 BSG unlocks the stemness and phenotypic plasticity of cancer cells CSCs are a small subpopulation of tumor cells with the ability to proliferate extensively and establish malignant lesions 153 154 154 155 156 92 157 In BC, CD44+ expression is consistently cited as a marker of BCSCs, with some authors going so far as to suggest that it alone is sufficient for classification of BCSCs 158 153 159 90 38 130 38 160 MicroRNAs as molecular interactants of BSG First discovered in C. elegans 161 162 163 lin-4 let-7) 161 164 165 166 167 168 MicroRNA let-7b has been identified as a prognostic marker in ovarian 169 170 170 171 172 46 47 47 46 46 3 46 47 46 173 174 3 Fig. 3 microRNAs Inhibit BSG-mediated Breast Cancer Metastasis.

These “magic bullets” as some have described them are guided to target sites by tumor-specific antigens 201 207 201 201 207 208 207 209 207 209 207 210 In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)—where the majority of translational research on the protein to date has occurred—BSG has proven a valuable target for therapeutic applications 211 212 213 214 215 216 204 216 217 218 219 220 The future of BSG in personalized cancer research Leveraging the interplay between BSG and hyaluronan-promoting therapy resistance 111 221 104 104 110 109 154 222 223 224 121 187 225 The case of targeting BSG-mediated interactions As previously reported, BSG/MCT complexes can be found in breast cancer, specifically in tumor cells in distinct patters compared to normal cells 150 152 226 227 147 145 228 229 230 231 232 233 137 Barriers to BSG-mediated therapies While ADCs improve on the tumor targeting potentials of earlier therapeutics, off-site effects still occur and necessitate monitoring for severe adverse events. In the case of HER2-targeted therapies for breast cancer, interstitial lung disease (ILD, pneumonitis) has been reported in some patients 234 235 234 Though ADCs show great promise, the administration routes are hampered because they rely on surface antigens for endocytosis and payload delivery. To be effective, ADCs must circulate from the site of their injection (usually intravenous) to the tumor vasculature, permeate through the vesicular membrane, and bind with the surface antigen target 236 237 238 239 240 241 207 242 243 Concluding remarks Initial categorization of breast cancer relied on clinical-pathological data 244 49 245 246 BSG, as a transmembrane protein, has the potential to play a role in the next generation of breast cancer markers. BSG has been shown to have prognostic implications 32 141 182 247 248 61 130 153 155 158 177 206 222 249 84 86 129 189 212 214 218 250 113 MicroRNAs have seen increasing interest as potential vectors for therapeutic application.
