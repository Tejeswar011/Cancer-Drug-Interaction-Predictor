Introduction Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) presents significant clinical and molecular heterogeneity, which makes prognosis and treatments very complicated. Despite advances in surgical and systemic therapies, a substantial number of RCC patients progress to advanced stages, highlighting the need for novel stratification approaches that account for the tumor’s biological complexity. Methods An integrative multi-omic analysis, combining transcriptomic and clinical data, was performed to identify the metabolic subtypes of RCC. Unsupervised clustering was used to stratify patients based on their metabolic profiles, and subtype-specific molecular signatures were examined through differential expression and pathway enrichment analyses. Prognostic outcomes, immune features, and drug sensitivities were then analyzed. The value of the classification was validated by the biological experiments. Results Three distinct metabolic subtypes (C1, C2, and C3) were identified, each associated with distinct survival outcomes. The C1 subtype, marked by enhanced oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism, correlated with improved survival. The C2 subtype, characterized by prostaglandin biosynthesis, was linked to poor prognosis and immune evasion. The C3 subtype was similar to C2 but was characterized by extensive prostanoid biosynthesis, indicating a moderate prognosis in the three subtypes. Immunotherapy and targeted drug sensitivity analyses revealed subtype-specific vulnerabilities, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies tailored to each metabolic profile. Subsequent in vitro Conclusions Metabolic subtyping through multi-omics integration offers a clinically relevant framework for RCC prognosis and personalized treatment. This approach highlights the role of metabolic reprogramming in tumor immunity and therapeutic response, providing a foundation for future clinical applications in precision oncology. renal cell carcinoma metabolic subtyping prostaglandin biosynthesis immuneexhaustion tumor prognosis The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

Data from GLOBOCAN 2020 indicate that men are twice as likely as women to develop and die from RCC ( 5 6 7 8 9 The substantial heterogeneity of RCC encompasses diverse genetic, epigenetic, and metabolic alterations across histological subtypes. Recently, various kinds of sequencing methods have markedly advanced, and many novel techniques not only broaden the range of the internal pathways but also ensure that the potential mechanisms are closer to the actual conditions of RCC ( 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 20 As a classical and powerful theory, the Warburg effect provides a more comprehensive perspective for cancer research, and aberrant cancer metabolism is regarded as the hallmark ( 21 22 23 in vivo 24 de novo 25 26 In this study, we comprehensively explored the global metabolic patterns of RCC through multiple clustering and enrichment analyses. We attempted to demonstrate the relationship between clinical characteristics and metabolism and find the key pathways driving RCC progression. We validated metabolic patterns via relevant experiments. This new metabolism-associated classification may provide a new insight into the mechanisms and underlying therapies of RCC. Methods Data acquisition and processing Transcriptomic and clinical data were integrated from three independent cohorts of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC): TCGA-KIRC, EMTAB3267, and GSE22541 All datasets were filtered to include only primary tumor samples with complete survival data, tumor grades, and TNM staging. Raw data of RNA-seq were converted to transcripts per million (TPM) and transformed to log2(TPM+1). Microarray data were normalized using quantile normalization, and batch effects were removed using ComBat (  Supplementary Figure S1A Unsupervised clustering of metabolic subtypes To identify distinct metabolic subtypes, unsupervised consensus clustering was performed on the TCGA-KIRC cohort using the ConsensusClusterPlus package (R v4.2.3) ( 27 Template-based molecular subtyping using nearest template prediction To better stratify patients into biologically and clinically relevant subtypes, the nearest template prediction (NTP) approach in the “MOVICS” package was implemented ( 28 Gene set enrichment analysis for GO and KEGG pathways Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were conducted using the clusterProfiler R package (version 4.6.2). Enrichment analysis was applied separately for biological processes (BPs), cellular components (CCs), and molecular functions (MFs) in GO terms and for metabolic and signaling pathways in KEGG. Pathways with an adjusted p Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter To estimate the absolute abundance of distinct stromal and immune cell populations from bulk transcriptomic profiles, we employed Microenvironment Cell Populations-counter (MCP-counter) by the “MCPcounter” R package (version 1.2.0, Bioconductor version 3.20) ( 29 30 Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis To further delineate heterogeneity in immune infiltration between samples, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was performed using the “GSVA” R package (Bioconductor version 3.20) ( 31 GSVA-based characterization of immune cell and functional pathway activities Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was applied to RNA-seq expression profiles to estimate pathway activities and immune cell infiltration in an unsupervised, non-parametric manner. GSVA and enrichment scores were performed using the “GSVA” R package. Hierarchical clustering of GSVA scores enabled the visualization and identification of subtype-specific patterns in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), which are displayed graphically in the heatmaps. To evaluate the features of Tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS), Germinal centers B cell (GC B), Follicular helper T cell (Tfh), Follicular dendritic cells (FDC), Plasma, and B cells, GSVA was performed based on related gene sets, which were obtained from a previous study ( 32 Assessment of immunotherapy response in the CheckMate immunotherapy cohort mRCC patients from the CheckMate immunotherapy cohort ( 16 Drug sensitivity profiling of RCC To investigate the differential drug sensitivity of RCC, the OncoPredict algorithms implemented in MOVICS were utilized alongside drug response data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) database (Release 8.5, October 2023). The sensitivity of a range of therapeutic drugs was analyzed, and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 Immunohistochemistry Paraffin-embedded RCC tissues were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated through graded ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling the sections in Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 9.0) for 15 minutes in an electric cooker, and then the sections were naturally cooled. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched using 3% hydrogen peroxide for 10 minutes at room temperature. Next, tissue sections were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 minutes and then incubated with primary antibodies (anti-PTGES2; dilution 1:200, Proteintech, Wuhan, Hubei, P.R.C, Cat No. 10881-1-AP) overnight at 4°C. The next day, sections were washed three times and incubated with Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Absin Bioscience, China, No. abs996, general concentration) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Detection was performed using Diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate, and counterstaining was performed using hematoxylin. Images were acquired using a Leica microscope and imaging system. Cell culture Human RCC cell lines 786-O and 769-P were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Mansas, Virginia, USA). To confirm the identity of the cell lines, short tandem repeat (STR) analysis was used to identify the two cell lines. STR testing was conducted by Shanghai Zhong Qiao Xin Zhou Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (  Supplementary Materials 2  3 2 Construction of stable cell lines of PTGES2 knockdown and overexpression To generate stable knockdown RCC cell lines, two short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences targeting human PTGES2 were designed, and the sequences were as follows: shPTGES2-1: 5′-GAAGCCGAATCTCGCTGATTT-3′, shPTGES2-2: 5′-CGGCAATAAGTACTGGCTCAT-3′. A scrambled non-targeting RNA (5′-CAACAAGATGAAGAGCACCAA-3′) was used as a negative control (shCtrl). All oligonucleotides were cloned into the pLKO.1-puro vector to generate two knockdown plasmids, and PTGES2 [Coding sequence (CDS) region was obtained from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NM_025072.7 33 Lentiviral particles were produced by co-transfecting HEK293T cells with the plasmids and packaging plasmids (psPAX2 and pMD2.G) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Viral supernatants were collected at 48 and 72 hours post-transfection. For transduction, cells were seeded in six-well plates (2 × 10 5 Quantitative polymerase chain reaction Total mRNA of cells was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Shanghai, China), and then mRNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using PrimeScript RT Master Mix (Takara Bio, Beijing, China) and quantified by qRT-PCR on a QuantStudio 7 Flex System. The following primers were used: PTGES2: Forward: 5′-GTGACCGAGTTCGGCAATAAG-3′, PTGES2: Reverse: 5′-CGGACAATGTAGTCAAAGGACG-3′, GAPDH: Forward: 5′-GGAGCGAGATCCCTCCAAAAT-3′, GAPDH: Reverse: 5′-GGCTGTTGTCATACTTCTCATGG-3′. The run method is shown below: Hold stage: 50°C for 2min, 95°C for 10 min. PCR stage: 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 1min and 40 cycles. Melt curve stage: 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 1min, 95°C for 15 s. The relative mRNA expression is calculated using the following method: ΔCt = Ct (PTGES2) − Ct (GAPDH), ΔΔCt = ΔCt (Sample) − ΔCt (Control), Fold gene expression = 2^−(ΔΔCt). Western blotting Cells were lysed in Radio Immunoprecipitation Assay Lysis buffer (RIPA) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) on ice for 30 minutes. Lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000 g The next day, membranes were washed three times and then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (HRP-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG(H+L), dilution 1:5000, Proteintech, Cat No. SA00001-2) for 1 hour at room temperature. Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents and visualized using an imaging system (Tanon chemiluminescence image analysis system). Cell proliferation assay Cell viability was assessed using the Cell Counting Kit-8 reagent (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. 786-O and 769-P cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 3 × 10 3 Transwell assay The Transwell assay was used to test the cell migration capabilities; 2 × 10 4 Colony formation assay To assess cell proliferative capacity, 786-O and 769-P cells were seeded into six-well plates at a low density of 1,000 cells/well. After culturing for 10–14 days, colonies were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 minutes. Visible colonies were counted. Statistical analysis The Kaplan–Meier survival curves of defined metabolic subtypes were generated using the survival and survminer R packages. Differences in overall survival (OS) among subtypes were evaluated using the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for age, gender, grade, TNM stage, and metastasis. The HRs and 95% CIs were calculated, and the proportional hazards assumption was strictly tested using Schoenfeld residuals. Correlations between clinical and molecular features were tested using χ 2 The R software (v4.2.3) and GraphPad Prism (v9.0) were used for all statistical analyses. p Results Three distinct global metabolic patterns presented different clinical features in ccRCC By integrating intersecting metadata of RCC samples from TCGA-KIRC, EMTAB3267, and GSE22541  Supplementary Figure S1B  Figure 1A Figure 1 Three distinct global metabolic patterns presented different clinical features in ccRCC.

Bar plot (C) displays various clinical and demographic factors such as subtype, stage, and survival time across the metaclusters. The Kaplan–Meier analysis showed marked survival differences among the three subtypes. Generally, cluster C1 had the better survival probability, C3 was in the middle, and C2 presented the worst prognosis (overall p p p p  Figure 1B  Figure 1C Validation of independent datasets revealed diverse outcomes of RCC patients For the external datasets, NTPs were carried out to validate the classification approach and the value of prognosis. Regarding EMTAB3267, NTP analysis confirmed the reliability of metabolism C1 to C3 clusters. Overall, subtypes had high prediction confidence (  Figure 2A  Figure 2B GSE22541  Figures 2C, D Figure 2 Validation of independent datasets revealed diverse outcomes of RCC patients.

G: Box plots compare enrichment scores across various entities like “Cell Cycle” and “Angiogenesis” for categories c1, c2, c3, with significance noted by asterisks. Additionally, the evaluation of some classical signaling pathways suggested that cluster C2 represented a distinct difference compared to the other two subtypes. In particular, HIPPO, NRF2, PI3K, TGF-β, and RTK RAS were the typical pathways (  Figure 3G Clusters C2 and C3 involved an enabled immune microenvironment and implicated immunotherapy response All three clusters indicated the outcomes of corresponding patients, and prostaglandin biosynthesis of cluster C2 and prostanoid biosynthesis of cluster C3 were of particular attention. The prostanoids are several lipid metabolites generated from 20-carbon fatty acids, and they play a key role in the inflammatory response in vivo 34 35 GSVA delineated clear immunophenotypic segregation among the three defined subtypes. Notably, C2 was characterized by a marked enrichment of immunosuppressive cellular populations, including interleukins, cytokines, B-cell functions, T-cell functions, NK cell functions, antigen processing, and macrophage functions; C3 displayed a relatively balanced TIME (  Figure 4A  Figure 4A  Figure 4A  Figure 4B Figure 4 Clusters C2 and C3 involved an enabled immune microenvironment and implicated immunotherapy response.

Panel D contains survival probability plots with time on the x-axis. Panel E displays grouped bar charts illustrating the distribution of clinical benefits and overall response rates. Color codes represent different clusters, and significance is indicated by asterisks. Immune checkpoints are tightly linked to the clinical efficacy of RCC patients, and RCC is regarded as a kind of “hot” immunological tumor, so we explored the association between three subtypes and the expression of eight immune checkpoints. The results showed that cluster C2 exhibited a higher expression of CD274 than clusters C1 and C3; however, PDCD1LG2, TNFRSF9, and TNFRSF4 were at extremely low levels compared to the others (  Figure 4C We also retrospectively reviewed all patients’ outcomes after accepting immunotherapy in the CheckMate immunotherapy cohort. RCC patients in cluster C1 achieved significantly prolonged survival compared to patients in C2 and C3 ( p  Figure 4D  Figure 4E To strengthen the relation between subtypes and TLS, we calculated and explored TLS score, GC B, Tfh, FDC, Plasma, and B cell_score features among RCC patients, and the results showed that C3 presented higher expression of these TLS-related features, including CR2, FCER2, PAX5, CD19, MZB1, JCHAIN, DERL3, CCL19, CCL21, CXCL13, and BLC6. Furthermore, the C3 cluster also presented high enrichment scores of TLS score, GC B, Tfh, FDC, Plasma, and B cell_score features, indicating a high TLS formation tendency (  Supplementary Figure S2 Drug sensitivity exhibited significant heterogeneity across three subtypes Dozens of IC 50 50 Many kinds of drugs showed antitumor properties; herein, certain representative drugs were chosen. For the most frequently targeted medicine, TKI was observed to have a significant sensitivity gradient among the three subtypes. For the receptor TKI sunitinib, cluster C2 exhibited the highest estimated IC 50 p  Figure 5A 50 p p  Figures 5B, C Figure 5 Drug sensitivity exhibited significant heterogeneity across three subtypes.

ANOVA p-values indicate statistical significance for differences among groups. Each panel features red, gray, and green plots corresponding to groups C1, C2, and C3. Other kinds of kinase inhibitors were committed to lethal effects on cancer cells. For the serine/threonine kinase inhibitors, such as VX-680, which were a part of evolutionary conserved families (Aurora-A, Aurora-B, and Aurora-C), controlling events of cell cycles, cluster C2 possessed a higher IC 50 p  Figure 5D p p  Figures 5E, F Except for kinase targets, inhibitors specific to diverse pathways were considered beneficial in the extinction of cancer cells. Therefore, some drugs were estimated in three subtypes. Rapamycin and phenformin blocked the mTOR signaling pathway, inducing cancer cell autophagy and apoptosis, respectively. In cluster C2, both showed high IC 50 p p  Figures 5G, H p  Figure 5I p  Figure 5J Otherwise, chemotherapeutics for cancers that target DNA replication are always available. Etoposide and doxorubicin were the common interventions inhibiting topoisomerase-II, thereby terminating DNA replication in cancer cells. As expected, drug resistance was the same in all the above drugs (etoposide p p  Figures 5K, L The overall drug response patterns corroborate our hypothesis that the molecular and phenotypic profiles of C1, C2, and C3 contribute to distinct therapeutic vulnerabilities. In particular, the cluster C2 phenotype appeared to be associated with enhanced drug resistance, which was in line with the poor prognosis of cluster C2 as mentioned before. Prostaglandin expression defines distinct prognostic and immunotherapy responses For further validation of cohorts, patients were stratified into high and low prostanoid/prostaglandin expression groups based on the median expression of the metabolism gene signature (PGE2). In the TCGA-KIRC cohort, patients with high prostanoid/prostaglandin expression exhibited significantly worse survival (prostanoid p p p p  Figures 6A–D Figure 6 Prostaglandin expression defines distinct prognostic and immunotherapy responses.

Hazard ratios, confidence intervals, and p-values are displayed. Bar graphs (E-F) show benefit and progression percentages, with colors indicating different outcomes. Bars are labeled with percentages and sample sizes. Patients in the high prostanoid group with PD were more than those in the low prostanoid group (26% vs. 23%), the same as in the high/low prostaglandin group (28% vs. 21%). In terms of progression, the high prostanoid and low prostanoid groups showed no difference (87% vs. 87%), but patients in the high prostaglandin group were more likely to progress than others (91% vs. 83%) (  Figures 6E, F Prostaglandin biosynthesis pathway regulates RCC progression and prognosis To evaluate the clinical relevance of prostaglandin biosynthesis in the context of therapeutic response, immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis was performed on RCC tissue microarrays (TMAs) obtained from patients with differential responses to targeted therapy. A total of 12 tumor specimens were analyzed and stratified into four groups according to clinical response criteria: CR (n = 3), PR (n = 3), SD (n = 3), and PD (n = 3). For analytical purposes, CR and PR were classified as the non-progressive disease (non-PD) group, while SD and PD were considered PD based on radiological and clinical progression metrics. Here, we found prostaglandin E synthase 2 (PTGES2), one key enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of prostaglandin E2, which was associated with the progression of some tumors, such as colorectal cancer (CRC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and RCC ( 36 38  Figure 7A r p r p r p r p r p  Supplementary Figure S3A p p p  Supplementary Figure S3B  Supplementary Figure S4A  Supplementary Figure S4B  Supplementary Figures S4C, D Figure 7 Prostaglandin biosynthesis pathway regulates RCC progression and prognosis.

Panel G shows bar graphs with quantified colony numbers. Panel H provides images of cell migration assays. Panel I includes bar graphs quantifying cell migration results, highlighting significant differences. To further investigate the role of PTGES2 in RCC cell proliferation and metastasis, we performed a series of in vitro  Figures 7B–D The CCK-8 assay was used to explore cell proliferation. Knockdown of PTGES2 resulted in a significant reduction in cell reproductive capacity in both 786-O and 769-P cell lines; in contrast, PTGES2 overexpression contributed to the obvious proliferation of RCC cells, and all differences were statistically significant ( p  Figure 7E  Figure 7F p  Figures 7F, G To evaluate the metastasis of PTGES2 in RCC cells, a Transwell assay was conducted to determine the cell migration ability. The results suggested that shPTGES2 cells exhibited significantly reduced migration compared to the control cells (  Figure 7H p  Figure 7I p  Figures 7H, I In general, these in vitro Discussion There has been sufficient evidence to prove that RCC is a highly heterogeneous and metabolic disease, and the Warburg effect produces abundant energy to support the metabolism and unlimited growth of cancer cells ( 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 GSE22541 47 Cluster C1 was primarily involved in fatty acid degradation and various amino acid metabolism, and patients had a better prognosis than those in C2 and C3. Actually, the metabolic abnormal pattern exhibited by cluster C1 has been observed in the analysis of various cancer types, suggesting that it may be a relatively common phenomenon in the process of tumor metabolic reprogramming ( 48 49 de novo 50 50 53 54 55 56 57 58 60 61 For clusters C2 and C3, prostaglandin (PG) biosynthesis and prostanoid biosynthesis were enriched, respectively, and a worse prognosis than that in C1 occurred. PGs are nearly the same as prostanoids in nature. PGs have emerged as critical regulators in inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and tumors ( 62 64 65 Previous studies have shown that prostanoid biosynthesis emerges as a cascade, massive proinflammatory cytokines were exploited, and they initiated downstream interferon, interleukin, lymphokine, chemokine, and tumor necrosis factor; sometimes, inflammation and immune response were overactivated, producing prostanoid-angiogenic response ( 66 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 76 77 Moreover, prostanoid biosynthesis is tightly related to the immune microenvironment. Ahmadi et al. came up with a novel perspective on tumor immunology. They found that PGE2 prevented the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), and the activation of naive CD8+ T cells was terminated; meanwhile, the CD8+ CD28− T cells were induced, and tumor cells could not be killed. The overexpression of COX-2 had a similar effect on DCs and prompted tumor cells to generate lymphatic metastasis ( 78 In vivo 79 80 81 82 83 84 To validate the precision of our model, a few RCC tissues were screened, which were from RCC patients treated with immunotherapies in the FUSCC cohort, and follow-up datasets were complete. Tumors in the “PD” group showed higher expression of PTGES2 than in the “non-PD” group. The synthesis of PGE2 was an extremely complicated process; one targeted metabolite profiling uncovered that PTGES2 was the key enzyme ( 85 36 37 86 in vitro In summary, this original classification based on tumor metabolism provided new insights into RCC; all three clusters covered the majority of metabolic features of the tumor microenvironment. It was worth noting that cluster C1 represented more about the early stage of RCC, in which FA metabolism and amino acid metabolism were active, and the prognosis was better. Clusters C2 and C3 pointed to prostanoid biosynthesis, which was associated with immune exhaustion and indicated a poor prognosis. We integrated the public databases and our cohort, not only elucidating the clinical significance of three clusters but also emphasizing the importance of metabolism-related therapies in advanced RCC patients. However, we also recognize that there are still some potential or unknown confounding factors that have not been adequately controlled in this study, which may affect the interpretation of some of the research results. In particular, variables such as patient age, gender, underlying disease status, lifestyle, and treatments could all potentially act as confounding factors in the relationship between the exposure factors and outcomes in this study. Furthermore, there may be selection bias in the sample selection process of this study. For example, the included cases were mainly from public databases or specific centers. For the analysis of certain specific subgroups, the sample size was further reduced, which may have exacerbated the impact of this bias. At the same time, the total sample size of this study was relatively limited, resulting in insufficient overall statistical power, especially in the subgroup analysis or multivariate analysis. Therefore, we suggest that future studies with a larger sample size should be conducted in multiple centers and with higher-quality data to further confirm the findings of this study. Conclusion In conclusion, this study classified RCC from the metabolic perspective and proposed three subtypes with different kinds of metabolism. Every cluster exhibited a specific metabolic status and appeared to have highly predictive value. Meanwhile, our classification may offer insights for improving the effects of immunotherapies in advanced RCC patients.
