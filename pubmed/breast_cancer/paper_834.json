While, the function of miR-451a in liver cancer still indistinct. AIM To study the effect of miR-451a in liver cancer development. METHODS GeneChip microarray analysis performed to detect miR-451a expression in liver cancer tissues and normal liver tissues. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to validate the expression of miR-451a in liver cancer cell and other tumor cell lines. Construction of liver cancer cell lines that stably overexpressed miR-451a by transfecting Lentivirus produced by Genechem company. Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium (MTT) bromide assay and colony formation assay to determine the effect of miR-451a in liver cancer cell proliferation. Flow cytometry used to investigate whether miR-451a involved in liver cancer cell apoptosis. Cell migration ability was measured via RESULTS MiR-451a expression significantly downregulation in liver cancer tissues compared with that in normal liver tissue. MiR-451a also obviously low-expressed in liver cancer cell, colorectal carcinoma cell and esophageal carcinoma cell lines. Human hepatoblastoma G2 (HepG2) and BEL-7404 cell lines that stably overexpressed miR-451a by transfecting lentivirus constructed successfully. MTT bromide assay and colony formation assay showed that the overexpressed miR-451a inhibit HepG2 cell proliferation viability, but not BEL-7404 cell. Flow cytometry determined that miR-451a regulating proliferation not through inducing apoptosis. Wound scratch assay revealed that miR-451a overexpression suppressed HepG2 cell migration. Furthermore, mex-3 RNA binding family member C was predicted as the target gene by bioinformatic analysis, and rescue experiments confirmed the hypothesis. CONCLUSION Therefore, miR-451a may be candidate miRNA for understanding molecular mechanisms of liver cancer development and novel target in liver cancer cell.

The expression of miR-451a obviously decreased in liver cancer tissues, which indicated that miR-451a may play crucial role in liver cancer progression. The aim of our study was to further determine the effect of miR-451a in hepatocarcinogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients’ samples A total of 100 Liver cancer samples and corresponding normal liver tissues collect from patients with liver cancer. The patients were pathological diagnosed clearly, having no preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, who underwent complete surgical resection at The Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical University. Informed consent was provided by all patients, and the experiment approved by our Ethics Committee of The Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical University. Cell cultures and stable cell line construction Human liver cancer cell lines [including SMMC-7721, Huh7, human hepatoblastoma G2 (HepG2), Hep3B, BEL-7402, BEL-7404], human colorectal carcinoma cell lines (HCT-116, RKO) and human esophageal carcinoma cell lines (ECA109, TE-1) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. All the cell lines were cultured in Dulbeccos’ Modified Eagle’s Medium (Hyclone, NJ, United States) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL of penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. For transfection, lentivirus system for miR-451a stable overexpression and pcDNA-mex-3 RNA binding family member C (MEX3C) plasmid overexpressing MEX3C were created by the Genechem Company (Shanghai, China). All the cell lines in this study authenticated by STR profiling. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis Total RNA was purified from tissue and cell lines using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, United States). The cDNA was synthesized with promega M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase kit. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed using qPCR SYBR Green master mix (Takara, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China) on a Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). MiR-451a expression was normalized to U6 mRNA level, and gene expression levels normalized to GAPDH. Each reaction was performed in duplicate. MiRNA-specific primers designed by RiboBio (Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China). Primers used for amplification were as follows: (1) GAPDH: Forward primer: 5’-TG ACTTCAACAGCGACACCCA-3’, reverse primer: 5’-CACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAA-3’; and (2) MEX3C: Forward primer: 5’-ATGAGGTTATTGCTGCCCTAG-3’, reverse primer: 5’-GTGAATTTGGATTGCCTGAGTA-3’.

The medium changed every 3 days and colonies were fixed in methanol and stained with crystal violet solution (Beyotime) 10 days later and quantified. The experiment was repeated three times. Apoptosis assay After 72 hours, LV-NC or LV-miR-451a transfection, HepG2 or BEL-7404 cells were harvested, washed and resuspended in the binding buffer. The apoptosis assay kit (eBioscience, Inc.) was used to examine the cells according to the instruction, and stained cells detected by flow cytometry (FACS Guava easyCyte HT, Millipore, MA, United States). Each experiment was performed three times. Wound scratch assay HepG2 and BEL-7404 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and transfected with LV-NC or LV-miR-451a for 24 hours. A sterile pipette tip used to make the wounds in the cell monolayer as beginning gap length at 0 hour, while the residual gap length at 48 hours were detected using the Image Analysis and Detection System (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). The experiments repeated at least three times. Western blot analysis Transfected HepG2 or BEL-7404 cells were ground and lysed in RIPA buffer on ice and then subjected to Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of proteins were loaded onto sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, and the resulting bands were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, MA, United States). The membrane was blocked and then incubated with primary antibodies of MEX3C and β-actin overnight. Next day, the membranes were washed and incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies. Signals were detected on X-ray film using an electrochemiluminescence detection system (Pierce, Rockford, IL, United States). Statistics analysis Data are presented as mean ± SD.

It was found that miR-451a down-regulated more than 12-fold compared with that in normal liver tissues (Figure 1A 2 3 Figure 1  MiR-451a expression in liver cancer tissues and construction of miR-451a stable up-expression cell lines. a P Table 2 Expression of miR-451a in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines  Cell type  U6  hsa-miR-451a, Ct value  ∆Ct Human hepatoblastoma G2 10.84 35 24.16 10.72 35 24.28 10.77 35 24.23 BEL-7402 13.19 35 21.81 13.09 35 21.91 13.2 35 21.8 BEL-7404 11.67 35 23.33 11.61 35 23.39 11.53 35 23.47 Huh-7 10.82 35 24.18 10.84 35 24.16 10.74 35 24.26 SMMC-7721 12.56 35 22.44 12.58 35 22.42 12.66 35 22.34 Hep3B 13.55 35 21.45 13.53 35 21.47 13.51 35 21.49 Table 3 Expression of miR-451a in colorectal cancer cell and esophageal squamous cancer cell  Cell type  U6  hsa-miR-451a, Ct value  ∆Ct HCT116 11.74 35 23.26 11.56 35 23.44 11.68 35 23.32 RKO 11.77 35 23.23 11.7 35 23.3 11.79 35 23.21 ECA109 11.04 35 23.96 11.07 35 23.93 11.06 35 23.94 TE-1 11.79 35 23.21 11.81 35 23.19 11.79 35 23.21 Construction of miR-451a stable up-expression cell lines To determine potential function of miR-451a, lentivirus system (LV-NC or LV-miR-451a) produced by Genechem Company transfecting HepG2 and BEL-7404 cell line (Figure 1B C 1D Overexpression of miR-451a decreased HepG2 cell growth Having found decreased expression of miR-451a in liver cancer, we then explored whether miR-451a functions as a tumor suppressor. The effect of miR-451a on liver cancer cell growth was observed. The absorptivity of liver cancer cells was determined by MTT bromide assay, after transfection for 0 day, 1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 4 days and 5 days. The absorptivity of the HepG2 cell decreased at the 490 nm from 48 hours. It was indicated that the growth of HepG2 cell transfected with LV-miR-451a significantly decreased as compared with that of LV-NC group ( P 2A 2B 2C 2D 2E Figure 2  Effects of MiR-451a overexpression on human hepatoblastoma G2 cells and BEL-7404 cells. a P MiR-451a have no effect on liver cancer cells apoptosis Because overexpression of miR-451a can prohibit HepG2 cell proliferation, it was then investigated whether the role of miR-451a is related to the cell apoptosis by flow cytometry. However, for both HepG2 cell and BEL-7404 cell line, up-regulation of miR-451a had no influence on liver cancer cell apoptosis (Figure 3 via Figure 3  Effects of miR-451a overexpression on apoptosis. Up-regulation of miR-451a inhibited HepG2 cell metastasis Wound scratch assay was used to evaluate migration ability of HepG2 and BEL-7404 cell lines transfected with LV-miR-451a or LV-NC virus. The distance of cell migration in HepG2 cells transfected with LV-miR-451a was obviously shorter compared with cells treated with LV-NC virus ( P 4A 4B Figure 4  Effect of miR-451a overexpression on cell migration. a P MiR-451a inhibited proliferation and metastasis of HepG2 cell by targeting MEX3C To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of miR-451a in proliferation and migration, potential target genes for miR-451a explored using the Targetscan, microRNA. ORG and miRDB database. As a result, MEX3C was predicted as potential target for miR-451a. Subsequently, RT-PCR and western blotting performed to confirm MEX3C expression level (Figure 5A B via P 5C P 5D via Figure 5  Mex-3 RNA binding family member C overexpression rescued the effects of miR-451a in human hepatoblastoma G2 cell. ( a P DISCUSSION Our present study mainly to determine the miR-451a expression in liver cancer cell lines, by contrast, miR-451a expression in colorectal cancer cell and esophageal squamous cancer cell were also detected. In order to investigate the function of miR-451a, HepG2 and BEL-7404 cell transfected with LV-miR-451a to construct stably overexpressed miR-451a liver cancer cell line. MTT bromide assay, colony formation assay and wound scratch assay showed that miR-451a overexpression can inhibit HepG2 cell proliferation and migration, but not for BEL-7404 cell line. This discrepancy is likely attributable to inherent differences between the two cell types in their molecular profiling, target gene expression, and compensatory capacity within signaling networks. Resolving this issue necessitates further elucidation of the specific signal-dependent mechanisms unique to BEL-7404 cells. Concurrently, our findings demonstrate that miR-451a does not influence apoptosis in this system. This is likely because, in HepG2 cells, miR-451a suppresses proliferation by inhibiting its target(s), thereby downregulating associated signaling pathways and ultimately inducing cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. In contrast, in BEL-7404 cells, this G1 arrest mechanism cannot be effectively activated, potentially due to the absence of key target pathways, p53 mutation, and/or the presence of compensatory signaling pathways. Elucidating the precise growth inhibitory mechanisms involved will also constitute one of the key foci of our future investigations. Meanwhile, 9 target gene for miR-451a explored by bioinformatics analysis and validated through RT-PCR and western blotting. Our preliminary literature review identified MEX3C as a frequently dysregulated target gene across multiple cancer types. Critically, its direct regulatory role in cell cycle control exhibits high mechanistic plausibility and logical coherence with the miR-451a-induced proliferation suppression phenotype. Hence, MEX3C was prioritized as a candidate target for further investigation. Moreover, rescue experiments were designed to confirm the predicted target gene MEX3C. Therefore, the results of our study suggested the importance of miR-451a in HepG2 cells by prohibiting cell proliferation and migration. It has been reported that miR-451a act as various aspect role in several kinds of cancers. For example, it is proved that miR-451a upregulated in whole blood samples collected from luminal A breast cancer patients. While, up-regulation of miR-451a can suppress the resistance to tamoxifen through regulating autophagy, 14-3-3ζ expression and Erα[ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 via 17 18 via 19 20 21 However, this study has several limitations. These include the lack of patient demographic characteristics, clinical staging, treatment modalities, and prognostic outcome details for the source specimens. Additionally, the downstream pathways through which MEX3C influences proliferation and migration remain unexplored. Consequently, conducting further follow-up studies and delineating the downstream pathways involved will constitute the primary focus of our subsequent work. We plan to perform a comprehensive analysis and mechanistic dissection of these aspects in future investigations. CONCLUSION In summary, this study found that miR-451a obviously down-regulated in liver cancer tissues and tumor cell lines. Overexpression of miR-451a significantly inhibit HepG2 cell proliferation, colony formation and migration. However, miR-451a were not participated in liver cancer cell apoptosis. Moreover, bioinformatic analysis showed that MEX3C was target gene of miR-451a, which validated by RT-PCR and western blotting. Furthermore, rescue experiments confirmed that overexpression of MEX3C can inhibit the effect of miR-451a in HepG2 cell. Therefore, our research provides new insight for understanding molecular mechanisms of liver cancer development and progression to support diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
