Introduction The genus Echinops Asteraceae 1 The presence of uniflowered capitula aggregated into second-order spherical or oval heads identifies the genus Echinops Cardueae 2 3 Echinops Echinops Echinops 4 Botanical Identity, Taxonomy, and Cultivation Based on the geographic distribution of taxa, a variety of Echinops Figure 1 Likely originating from steppe regions of Southeast Europe and West Asia, E. sphaerocephalus 6 Echinops exaltatus Echinops banaticus Echinops ritro There are eight taxa known to exist in Italy. Currently, 12 taxa are known to exist in Greece, while nine are present in Albania [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 The perennial plant has straight, thorny wooden stems and grows to a height of 30 to 100 cm. The inflorescences are tubular flowers that lead to thorns and are blue and white–silver in color. The leaves are long and have serrated edges without petioles [ 13 14 15 More than 120 species of this genus can be found worldwide, particularly in Central Asia, the Mediterranean Basin, and tropical Africa [ 16 Echinops 17 The perennial accessions of Echinops sphaerocephalus E. exaltatus E. banaticus 2 E. sphaerocephalus Asteraceae It can reach a height of 1.5 m and favors calcareous soils. The plant gets its name from the blue or white blossoms that form spherical racemes (3 to 8 cm in diameter) during the July to August blooming season (lat. Echinops 18 E sphaerocephalus 19 For optimal development, it requires alkaline, well-drained soils. The majority of Echinops The objective of this systematic review is to comprehensively evaluate the phytochemical constituents and pharmacological activities of Echinops Echinops Echinops 2. Materials and Methods This review aimed to critically evaluate available research on the genus Echinops Echinops Echinops To conduct this literature search, various databases were utilized, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Springer Nature, Scopus, Medline, ScienceDirect, and Elsevier. The search employed keywords such as anti-Alzheimer, antidiabetic, anti-malarial, antimicrobial, cytotoxicity, Echinops Figure 2 Echinops sphaerocephalus Echinops Echinops sphaerocephalus This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. 3. Results and Discussion The chemical content of Echinops Echinops 20 20 3.1. Thiophenes The primary bioactive components of the genus Echinops 21 Table 1 The majority of thiophenes have two thiophene rings in their structures, and the majority of thiophenic compounds have an acetylenic functional group. The two most prevalent thiophenes identified from nine species were α-terthiophene and 5-(but-3-en-1-ynyl)-2,2′-bithiophene. Essential oils extracted from the many plants in this genus were shown to contain thiophenes. Thiophenes have been shown to have insecticidal, anti-proliferative, and anti-fungal properties. Most of the biological activities of Echinops Lam et al. used GC-MS to analyze the thiophene content in diethyl ether extracts from roots, leaves, and stems of 16 Echinops E. bannaticus E. ritro 34 Liu et al. isolated and structurally elucidated 12 thiophenes from ether and n-butanol extracts of E. grijisii 35 The hexane fraction from the roots of Echinops ellenbeckii 33 Later, Wand et al. isolated and structurally elucidated four thiophenes from a 95% ethanol extract of E. latifolius 42 Zhang et al. found eight thiophenes, including one new one, echinothiophenegenol, in a 95% ethanol extract of roots of Echinops grijisii Table 1 30 Nakano et al. isolated two polyacetylene thiophenes, echinopsacetylenes A and B, from the roots of Echinops transiliensis Table 1 40 Wu et al. isolated a new thiophene, 2,2-Dimethyl-4-[5-(prop-1-ynyl)-2,2-bithiophen-5-yl]-1,3-dioxolane, from ethanol extracts of Echinops spinosissimus spinosus 50 Li et al. found three new substituted bithiophenes (5′-(3,4-Dihydroxybut-1-yn-1-yl)-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5-carbaldehyde, 4-Hydroxy-1-(5′-methyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)butan-1-one, and 5′-(3,4-Dihydroxybut-1-yn-1-yl)-[2,2′-bithiophene]-5-carboxylic acid, Table 1 Echinops ritro 37 3.2.

Flavonoids Flavonoids are low molecular weight, bioactive polyphenols that play a vital role in photosynthesis. Flavonoids are secondary metabolites and, as a class of natural compounds, have attracted attention due to their diverse pharmacological activities, particularly their antioxidant properties. Strong antioxidants, such as flavonoids, can shield the body from harmful free radicals. They accomplish this by scavenging free radicals, which is made possible by their capacity to donate hydrogen ions. Flavonoids also possess antifungal, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties; additionally, they can protect the gastrointestinal mucosa from harm caused by necrotic agents and different ulcer models. Furthermore, flavonoids possess anti-carcinogenic properties because they can prevent cancer from developing and spreading by influencing angiogenesis, apoptosis, cellular differentiation, proliferation, and metastasis. To the best of our knowledge, there is comparatively little research on the flavonol and flavone contents of Echinops species [ 73 74 75 The majority of flavonoids in the genus Echinops E. niveus 64 E. echinatus 76 E. integrifolius 66 E. spinosus 77 E. albicaulis 47 Table 3 Echinops niveus 64 Echinops echinatus 84 Echinops giganteus 65 Table 3 Echinops giganteus 65 Echinops ritro 53 Echinops transiliensis 41 A new isoflavone glycoside, echinoside, along with 7-hydroxyisoflavone, kaempferol-4′-methylether, kaempferol-7-methylether, myrecetin-3-O-a-L-rhamnoside, kaempferol, and kaempferol-3-O-a-L-rhamnoside ( Table 3 Echinops echinatus 74 Senejoux et al. reported, for the first time, 6-methoxyflavones in Echinops integrifolius 66 Trihydroxy methoxy flavone, kaempferol-3- O Echinops taeckholmiana 61 3.4.

Therapeutic Potential of the Genus Echinops The chemical components and extracts isolated from the many species in this genus have a broad range of biological effects, as summarized in Figure 4 The Echinops Echinops 4 Based on its chemical composition, Echinops 20 Echinops grijisii 30 In vitro screening and analysis of the phytochemical properties of Echinops 4 Antifungal, antibacterial, cytotoxic, antimalarial, and insecticidal pharmacological activities are defined by the presence of thiophenes, while anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and hepato-protective properties are attributed to terpenes, flavonoids, and other phenolic substances [ 20 57 3.5.1. Antioxidant Activity One of the main pathophysiological mechanisms of many liver illnesses is oxidative stress. Antioxidants from different natural sources have offered clinical promise in the treatment of liver diseases. Oxidative stress can result from liver injury as well as be the cause of hepatocyte damage, malfunction, and cell death. This dichotomy necessitates elucidating the causal relationship through experimental investigations of the hepatotoxic mechanisms of pro-oxidants, such as medications, and particular preventative and therapeutic strategies involving the administration of antioxidants derived from plants. Both the potential hepatoprotective ability of plant extracts in humans and the potential mechanisms of injury should be assessed in experimental models that use several biomarkers to evaluate hepatotoxicity. This strategy improves the likelihood that liver protection seen in animal and cell culture models may be effectively extended to human pathophysiology and treatment. It has been suggested that the generation of ROS is a precursor to drug-induced hepatotoxicity and a sign of a drug’s potential for hepatotoxicity [ 85 37 In addition to liver disease, oxidative stress is a key pathophysiological process in many other chronic diseases that are relevant to society. In experimental pharmacology, a variety of physiologically active chemicals and secondary metabolites derived from plants, primarily phenolic compounds, are being studied as sources of antioxidants that are essential for preventing disorders linked to oxidative stress. By giving lipids or lipid peroxyl radicals hydrogen atoms, flavonoids have been shown to have the ability to break free radical chains in lipids [ 95 The antioxidant activity assessments of Echinops Kiyekbayeva et al. evaluated the antioxidant activity of the aqueous methanolic extract of E. albicaulis 47 2 2 E. albicaulis 96 p 2 2 2 2 2 2 Erenler et al. investigated the antioxidant potential of chemical compounds isolated from Echinops orientalis Trauv.

Antidiabetic Properties Numerous variables contribute to type 2 diabetes, a complex metabolic disease. The World Health Organization estimates that this illness affects over 422 million people and results in over 1.6 million fatalities per year. Eight out of every 1000 people are thought to have type 2 diabetes, and as people age, their risk of the disease rises. The number of children and adolescents receiving a diagnosis of this illness has increased in recent years [ 100 Figure 5 101 102 E. echinatus 88 The 70% hydro-alcoholic root extract of E. echinatus 103 104 Aqueous methanolic extract of Echinops echinatus 105 Total E. spinosus 101 K.

Alzheimer’s Disease Prevention Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most prevalent forms of age-related neurodegenerative dementia affecting elderly individuals worldwide. It is estimated that 13% of individuals over 65 and 45% of those over 85 suffer from Alzheimer’s syndrome [ 90 91 Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition is one of the mechanisms through which anti-Alzheimer’s medications work.

Food Supplement The market must constantly expand and adapt to accommodate new food product sources and make the best use of existing resources due to the rising demand for food. Echinops sphaerocephalus E. sphaerocephalus 19 94 The term “mannas” refers to the sweet and sticky secretions that certain plants produce as a result of insect feeding, plant reactions to mechanical stimuli, or changes in the temperature outside of the plant tissues. The distribution of host and breeding insects, the period of production, and the manner of exploitation are some of the elements that contribute to the production of manna, even though the precise methods and conditions are still unknown. Several ecological and biological elements also contribute to the development and reproduction of manna-producing insects [ 13 129 130 131 132 133 134 Echinops sphaerocephalus 4. Conclusions The genus Echinops While preclinical studies support the use of Echinops species, further toxicological evaluations and clinical trials are essential to confirm efficacy and ensure the safe therapeutic applications of these species in modern medicine.
