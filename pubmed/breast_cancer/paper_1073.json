Introduction Intensive Care Units (ICUs) are specialized units where advanced life-support systems are utilized to monitor and treat patients with critical health conditions [ 1 2 3 4 5 Septic shock and cardiogenic shock have been reported as leading causes of mortality in surgical ICU patients. Scoring systems such as APACHE, SAPS, and SOFA have been developed to predict mortality. Despite certain limitations, these scoring systems are widely used in clinical practice. Beyond scoring systems, factors such as a low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (<9), prolonged mechanical ventilation, inotropic support, lactic acidosis, massive transfusion, the presence of comorbidities, hypoalbuminemia, emergency surgical interventions, and advanced age have been reported to be associated with mortality in surgical ICUs [ 6 7 However, much of the current literature focuses on cardiovascular and neurosurgical ICU populations, while evidence addressing predictors of mortality in general surgery patients requiring tertiary ICU care remains limited. This gap is particularly important, as these patients frequently present with complex abdominal pathologies, higher comorbidity burdens, and significant postoperative complications. The present study aims to address this gap by identifying clinical and biochemical predictors of mortality specific to general surgery patients in a tertiary ICU setting, thereby providing data that may guide risk stratification and optimize patient management. 2. Methods 2.1. Study Design and Ethical Approval This retrospective case-control study was approved by the Ege University Medical Research Ethics Committee on 23 May 2024 (Approval No: 24-5.1T/25). This retrospective study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Due to the retrospective nature of the study and the critical condition of many patients (including those who were intubated), the need to obtain informed consent was waived by the ethics committee. 2.2. Study Population and Inclusion Criteria Patients aged 18 years and older with a history of general surgery-related pathology who were transferred from the General Surgery Clinic to the tertiary Anesthesia Intensive Care Unit between January 2018 and December 2023 were included. Patients who had undergone solid organ transplantation (liver or kidney) or were under 18 years old were excluded due to differing clinical courses and prognostic outcomes. Additional exclusion criteria included incomplete medical records and admission to the ICU from non-surgical clinics. At ICU admission, the type of respiratory support was documented for all patients, including spontaneous breathing, oxygen mask, orotracheal intubation, or tracheostomy. Mechanical ventilation and duration of intubation were also recorded, as these parameters were later analyzed in relation to mortality. 3. Data Collection This was a retrospective study, and all eligible patients admitted consecutively to the ICU during the study period were included. Data were obtained from electronic hospital information systems and supplemented by physical patient files when necessary. Demographic data, clinical parameters, laboratory values, and severity scores (SOFA, APACHE II, GCS) were extracted using a standardized case form and transferred into an electronic spreadsheet for analysis. Patients were divided into two groups based on mortality during ICU stay: the mortality group and the non-mortality group (discharged patients). Clinical, laboratory, and scoring parameters were compared between these groups. Demographic and descriptive parameters including age, sex, body mass index (BMI; weight in kg/height in m 2 2 2 4. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using version 29.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics were presented as numbers ( n p t p 5. Results Between January 2018 and December 2023, 259 patients transferred from the General Surgery Clinic to the Anesthesia Intensive Care Unit were screened. Sixteen patients with liver transplants, two with kidney transplants, and ten patients with missing data were excluded. A total of 231 patients were included, of whom 90 (39%) were female and 141 (61%) were male. The mean age was 59.49 ± 18.43 years, and the mean BMI was 28.85 ± 6.04. At ICU admission, 74.02% of patients had at least one comorbidity. The primary diagnoses included gastrointestinal perforation in 57 patients (24.7%), mesenteric vascular disease in 19 (8.2%), mechanical bowel obstruction in 35 (15.2%), acute biliopancreatic infections (pancreatitis, cholecystitis, and cholangitis) in 18 (7.8%), trauma in 44 (19%), necrotizing fasciitis in 5 (2.2%), gastrointestinal bleeding in 11 (4.8%), and elective cancer surgery requiring postoperative ICU care in 42 (18.2%). Among these patients, 150 (64.9%) died during their ICU stay, while 81 (35.1%) were discharged alive. The ICU mortality rate for general surgery patients was 64.9%. The mean length of ICU stay was 11.38 ± 16.59 days. No significant differences were found between mortality and non-mortality groups in inflammatory indices, including the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, platelet/lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil/platelet ratio, and HALP score ( p p p p p p Table 1 5.1. Malignancy Group Among 231 patients, 44 had a diagnosis of malignancy. Of these, 30 (68.18%) died, and 14 (31.81%) were discharged alive.

Discussion This retrospective study evaluated surgical ICU patients over a five-year period, focusing on mortality rates and associated risk factors. Our findings revealed a high ICU mortality rate of 64.9%, which is influenced by the exclusive inclusion of general surgery patients with complex clinical profiles. Key factors such as advanced age, obesity, inflammatory markers, including NLR and TLR in malignancy patients, and APACHE II and SOFA scores were significantly associated with mortality. Additionally, the CRP/albumin ratio demonstrated prognostic value in predicting outcomes, especially among patients with malignancies. These results emphasize the multifactorial nature of mortality risk in surgical ICU patients and highlight important predictive parameters that can guide clinical management. Advanced age, comorbidities, and disease severity represent independent risk factors for both short- and long-term mortality. Mortality rates increase significantly with age, especially in patients over 80 years old [ 8 9 10 11 12 p The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been utilized since the early 2000s as a parameter in endotoxemia, SIRS, and sepsis [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 Across the entire cohort, these parameters did not exhibit statistically significant differences. Due to the heterogeneous patient population, subgroup analyses were conducted. In the malignancy subgroup, NLR and PLR demonstrated significance. A systematic meta-analysis indicates these ratios can predict outcomes in solid tumors and correlate with poor survival [ 19 20 The HALP score is an immunonutritional parameter developed for predicting survival, disease-free survival, and mortality risk in malignancy patients [ 21 22 23 The CRP-to-albumin ratio combines nutritional and inflammatory status and has been extensively examined as an independent prognostic marker in sepsis, infections, malignancies, and other diseases. However, few studies have specifically evaluated its prognostic value in critically ill surgical ICU patients [ 24 25 26 27 This study has several limitations. First, it was conducted in a single tertiary center with a retrospective design, which restricts the generalizability of the findings. Second, although the overall sample size was moderate, subgroup analyses were limited by smaller numbers, which may have reduced statistical power. Third, certain potential confounders, such as detailed nutritional status, perioperative care variations, and socioeconomic factors, could not be evaluated due to incomplete data in retrospective records. Fourth, the cut-off values identified for the CRP/albumin ratio, APACHE II, and SOFA scores were derived from our own cohort and require external validation before clinical implementation. Finally, owing to the observational design, our study can only identify associations and does not allow causal relationships to be established. Despite these limitations, the study provides valuable insights into predictors of mortality in surgical ICU patients and highlights directions for future multicenter prospective research. 7. Conclusions The parameters examined in this study demonstrate significant predictive value in determining mortality rates among surgical intensive care patients and optimizing ICU resource utilization. Our findings highlight the complexity and high risk of mortality and morbidity in general surgical ICU patients, emphasizing the need for meticulous care. Age, obesity, comorbidities, hemodynamic status, and renal parameters all significantly impact mortality outcomes. Additionally, established scoring systems such as APACHE II and SOFA remain effective tools for mortality prediction. Furthermore, the CRP/albumin ratio, reflecting both inflammatory response and nutritional status, showed significant prognostic importance, particularly within the malignancy subgroup. Elevated CRP/albumin values correlated with higher mortality, suggesting its potential as an independent predictor and a useful parameter for risk stratification in critically ill surgical patients.
