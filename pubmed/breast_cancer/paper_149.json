Methods TNBC transcriptomic datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were analyzed to identify FGF4-associated pathways using differential gene expression analysis, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), and immune infiltration profiling via Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT). Functional annotations (GO/KEGG) highlighted IL6/STAT3 as a key pathway. In vitro models with FGF4-overexpressing or knockdown TNBC cells were co-cultured with macrophages to assess IL6/STAT3 activation, M2 polarization markers (CD206, Arg1), and cytokine secretion (ELISA). Tumor cell behaviors (proliferation, migration, invasion) were quantified. In vivo orthotopic TNBC models in mice evaluated FGF4’s impact on tumor growth, immune cell infiltration (flow cytometry), and STAT3 activity (Western blot). Results FGF4 was upregulated in TNBC and strongly correlated with M2 macrophage infiltration. In vitro, FGF4 activated IL6/STAT3 signaling, inducing macrophage polarization to an M2 phenotype with elevated IL-10/TGF-βsecretion and suppression of T cell proliferation. Conditioned media from M2 macrophages enhanced TNBC cell aggressiveness. In vivo, FGF4-overexpressing tumors showed higher weight and increased M2 markers, whereas FGF4 knockdown reduced tumor volume and enhanced CD8 + Conclusion FGF4 promotes TNBC progression by activating IL6/STAT3 to reprogram macrophages into immune-suppressive M2 effectors, fostering a tumor-permissive microenvironment. Targeting FGF4 may disrupt this crosstalk, offering a novel immunotherapeutic strategy for TNBC.

Highlights  This study reports for the first time that FGF4 mediates macrophage polarization and influences immune suppression in breast cancer through the IL6/STAT3 signaling axis. It is found that the high expression of FGF4 promotes the polarization of macrophages toward the M2 phenotype, thereby enhancing the tumor immune-suppressive microenvironment. It is confirmed that knocking down FGF4 or inhibiting the IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway suppresses M2 polarization and enhances immune killing. It is demonstrated that IL6 or STAT3 activators can reverse the inhibitory effects of FGF4 knockdown. This study provides new targeted intervention strategies and molecular insights for immune therapy in TNBC.

Through bioinformatics analysis and both in vitro and in vivo experiments, we systematically investigate how FGF4 activates the IL6/STAT3 signaling axis to promote M2 macrophage polarization, thereby driving tumor progression and immune evasion. The findings provide a theoretical basis for targeting FGF4 and offer new insights into immunotherapy strategies for TNBC. As an immune modulator, FGF4 may serve as a critical target for overcoming current immunotherapy limitations, and regulating its interaction with the IL6/STAT3 axis holds promise for improving the efficacy of TNBC immunotherapy. Thus, this study holds significant value for basic research and clinical applications, particularly in developing immunotherapeutic agents and enhancing patient outcomes. Results Differential gene expression and WGCNA reveals 107 candidate genes related to key MP-RGs in TNBC To identify DEGs between TNBC samples and normal samples, we first performed differential expression analysis using the TCGA-TNBC dataset. The analysis was conducted with the “DESeq2” package in R, comparing the Tumor and Normal groups. Genes were filtered based on the |log 2 p S1 S1 To explore the co-expression patterns of MP-RG-related genes, we performed WGCNA on TNBC samples from the GSE25066 1 1 1 1 p To assess the enrichment of MP-RGs in the TNBC training samples, we calculated MP-RG scores using the ssGSEA algorithm from the “GSVA” package in R. The significance between the TNBC disease and control groups was evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, with a threshold set at p 1 To identify DEGs related to MP-RGs in TNBC, we intersected the 680 DEGs with the 2438 key genes identified from the co-expression network, yielding 107 candidate genes, constituting 3.6% of the total genes (Fig. 1 F). These candidate genes may play critical roles in the initiation and progression of TNBC, warranting further investigation. Enrichment analysis and PPI network construction reveal the potential regulatory role of candidate genes in macrophage polarization in TNBC To annotate the functions of the 107 candidate genes, we performed GO and KEGG enrichment analyses using the R packages “clusterProfiler” and “GOplot.” The selection criteria for GO analysis were set at p 2 p 2 To explore the candidate genes’ PPI, we uploaded the genes to the STRING database ( http://www.string-db.org/ http://www.cytoscape.org/ 2 To identify key genes among the candidates, we evaluated the importance of each gene using five algorithms from the CytoHubba plugin: MCC, EPC, Degree, EcCentricity, and Closeness. The top 10 genes from each algorithm were selected for visualization (Fig. 2 S2 2 CIBERSORT analysis reveals that FGF4 May regulate M2 macrophage polarization in TNBC through the IL6/STAT3 axis To further explore the relationship between the four core genes and macrophage infiltration in TNBC, we used the CIBERSORT algorithm to analyze the infiltration levels of 22 immune cell types in TNBC samples. The results revealed a significant increase in M2 macrophage infiltration and a marked decrease in M1 macrophage infiltration in TNBC samples compared to normal samples (Fig. 3A). Additionally, we observed significant differences in the infiltration levels of 11 immune cell types, including B cells, macrophages, monocytes, and T cells, between TNBC and normal samples. Further analysis of the correlation between the four core genes and immune cell infiltration (Fig. 3 3 FGF4 regulates the IL6/STAT3 axis to promote M2 macrophage polarization We first established FGF4 overexpressing and knockdown TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549) and performed a macrophage co-culture experiment to evaluate the impact of FGF4 on the IL6/STAT3 axis. Figure 4 4 S2 To further investigate the effect of FGF4 on macrophage polarization, we examined polarization markers in the co-cultured macrophages. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that in the FGF4 overexpression group, the expression of M2 markers (Arg1 and CD206) was significantly increased, while M1 markers (iNOS and CD86) were markedly reduced. In contrast, in the FGF4 knockdown group, M1 markers were upregulated, and M2 markers were downregulated (Fig. 4 To confirm the role of the IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway in FGF4-mediated macrophage polarization, we activated the IL6/STAT3 axis in the co-culture system by adding an IL6 neutralizing antibody and a STAT3 activator (Colivelin). Compared to the sh-FGF4 group, both the sh-FGF4 + rIL6 and sh-FGF4 + Colivelin groups showed increased expression of M2 polarization markers (Arg1 and CD206) and decreased expression of M1 polarization markers (iNOS and CD86) in macrophages (Fig. 5 FGF4 regulates M2 macrophage polarization via the IL6/STAT3 axis to enhance immunosuppressive function and promote breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion To further assess the immunoregulatory function of macrophages under FGF4 regulation, we measured the levels of immunosuppressive cytokines secreted by macrophages (Fig. 6 6 6 S3 Additionally, we evaluated the impact of M2 macrophage-derived secretions on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells (Fig. 6 S3 6 S3 6 S3 These data indicate that FGF4 drives M2 macrophage polarization through the IL6/STAT3 axis, promoting tumor cell proliferation and invasion in the breast cancer microenvironment. FGF4 regulates macrophage polarization via the IL6/STAT3 axis to enhance the immunosuppressive microenvironment and promote TNBC growth In in vivo experiments, we first implanted FGF4-overexpressing, knockdown, and control breast cancer cells into the mammary fat pads of immunocompetent mice to establish an orthotopic tumor model (Fig. 7 A). After 28 days, tumor tissues were harvested and weighed to assess the effect of FGF4 on tumor growth. The results showed that tumors in the FGF4 overexpression group were significantly heavier than those in the control group, while tumors in the FGF4 knockdown group were markedly lighter (Fig. 7 Subsequently, to evaluate the impact of FGF4 on the tumor immune microenvironment, we performed immune cell infiltration analysis on the tumor tissues. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that in the FGF4 overexpression group, M2 macrophage markers (Arg1, CD206) were significantly increased, while M1 markers (iNOS, CD86) were reduced. In contrast, in the FGF4 knockdown group, M2 markers were downregulated, and M1 markers were significantly upregulated (Fig. 7 7 To further confirm the functional status of T cells, we assessed the expression levels of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and GzmB in tumor-infiltrating T cells. Flow cytometry results showed that in the FGF4 overexpression group, the proportions of T cells positive for IFN-γ, TNF-α, and GzmB were significantly reduced, while in the FGF4 knockdown group, the expression levels of these functional markers were significantly higher (Fig. 7 These results further confirm that FGF4, by regulating the IL6/STAT3 axis, enhances the immunosuppressive function of macrophages and suppresses T cell anti-tumor activity. Discussion This study found that FGF4 is significantly upregulated in TNBC and is positively correlated with the infiltration of M2 macrophages. As an important cytokine, FGF4 is known to play a role in the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of various tumors [ 25 26 27 28 This study also reveals the mechanism by which FGF4 promotes M2 macrophage polarization through the IL6/STAT3 signaling axis, a finding consistent with previous reports. IL-6, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, has been extensively studied for its role in modulating immune cell function [ 29 30 The role of the IL6/STAT3 signaling axis in the immune microenvironment of TNBC has been widely studied [ 31 32 33 34 This study demonstrates that FGF4 promotes M2 macrophage polarization through the IL6/STAT3 signaling axis, further enhancing the immunosuppressive microenvironment and thereby driving tumor growth and metastasis. Consistent with existing research on the role of M2 macrophages in the TNBC immune microenvironment, we observed a significant increase in M2 macrophages in the presence of elevated FGF4 expression. This mechanism supports the concept of FGF4 as a key regulator of the immune microenvironment. Unlike other studies focused on immune microenvironment regulation, our work highlights the unique role of FGF4 in modulating M2 macrophages, particularly through the activation of the IL6/STAT3 axis. This activation promotes macrophage polarization and enhances their immunosuppressive functions, facilitating immune escape by tumor cells. Our findings further elucidate how FGF4 contributes to immune escape and tumor progression in TNBC by strengthening the immunosuppressive microenvironment and promoting M2 macrophage accumulation. In agreement with previous studies, M2 macrophages secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines that promote tumor growth, metastasis, and immune evasion and reduce drug efficacy [ 35 36 37 38 This study reveals the critical role of FGF4 in regulating the immune microenvironment in TNBC, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for immune-based treatments. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors have succeeded significantly in some cancers, TNBC often develops resistance to immunotherapy due to its highly immunosuppressive microenvironment. Our findings provide new insights into how targeting FGF4 to modulate the tumor immune microenvironment could help overcome current immunotherapy limitations. Unlike traditional immunotherapy approaches, strategies targeting FGF4 may enhance treatment efficacy by regulating immune cell polarization and promoting immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. Future clinical trials will be crucial in validating the effectiveness of this therapeutic strategy. Although this study systematically reveals the role of FGF4 in TNBC, there are still certain limitations. First, the use of independent shRNAs targeting different regions would be a valuable strategy to further confirm the specificity of knockdown effects by minimizing sequence-independent artifacts and off-target effects [ 39 Conclusion This study systematically elucidates how FGF4 regulates macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype in TNBC through the IL6/STAT3 signaling axis, integrating multi-omics analyses, in vitro co-culture experiments, and in vivo tumor models. The findings reveal that FGF4 upregulates the IL6/STAT3 axis, enhancing the immunosuppressive function of M2 macrophages, which secrete IL-10 and TGF-β to suppress T cell anti-tumor activity. Additionally, FGF4-induced M2 macrophages significantly promote TNBC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In vivo studies further validate FGF4’s role in regulating the immune suppressive microenvironment, providing new molecular insights into the initiation and progression of TNBC (Graphic abstract). This study is the first to identify the critical role of FGF4 in mediating macrophage polarization through the IL6/STAT3 axis. It unveils a novel mechanism of immune escape in TNBC and offers new directions for targeted regulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. FGF4 emerges as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target, providing a theoretical foundation for developing precision immunotherapy strategies for TNBC. Moreover, modulation of the IL6/STAT3 signaling axis could represent a promising intervention pathway to improve TNBC prognosis and therapeutic outcomes. Materials and methods Ethical statement All animal experiments in this study were conducted in accordance with ethical guidelines for animal research. The experimental protocol was approved by our institution’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (Ethical Approval Number: 2024102801), and all procedures followed the Guidelines for the Welfare and Ethical Review of Experimental Animals. During the experiment, animal welfare was ensured, and efforts were made to minimize pain and stress in the mice. After the study, the mice were euthanized humanely. Public data acquisition Gene expression and clinical data for TNBC patients were obtained from the TCGA database ( https://gdc.cancer.gov/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ GPL96 https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis DEGs of gene expression data from the Tumor and Normal groups were performed using the DESeq2 package. The threshold was set at |log 2 p Functional enrichment analysis Functional enrichment analysis was performed to explore the significance of DEGs in biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions. DEGs associated with macrophage polarization were subjected to functional enrichment analysis using the ClusterProfiler package for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. The significance threshold was set at p Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) WGCNA was used to construct gene co-expression networks and identify gene modules associated with specific phenotypes. First, the gene expression matrix was loaded using the WGCNA package. Data preprocessing included sample clustering, outlier detection, and data normalization. An appropriate soft-thresholding power was selected to ensure the network adhered to scale-free topology. A weighted gene co-expression network was constructed, and gene similarity was calculated, transforming it into an adjacency matrix, which was further converted into a topological overlap matrix. Gene modules were identified using dynamic tree cutting, and a heatmap of module-sample correlations was generated. Key modules significantly associated with KGN treatment were identified, and their biological functions were explored. Genes from the key modules were extracted for further analysis. Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analysis PPI network analysis was performed to uncover PPI and identify key regulatory factors. Interaction data for proteins encoded by the key module genes were obtained from the STRING database. A gene list from the key modules was input, with Homo sapiens as the species, and an interaction confidence threshold of 0.4 was applied. The resulting PPI network was visualized and analyzed using Cytoscape software. Key network nodes (hub genes) were identified using five methods from the CytoHubba plugin. Immune infiltration analysis The immune cell infiltration abundance of 22 immune cell types was calculated using the CIBERSORT algorithm based on the training set to investigate differences in immune cell infiltration levels between disease and normal samples. The relative distribution of immune cells in each sample was obtained, and immune cell infiltration was visualized using stacked bar plots generated with the ggplot2 package in R. To compare further the differences in immune cell infiltration between TNBC and Normal samples, immune cells that scored 0 in more than half of the training set samples were excluded. The remaining 12 immune cell types were analyzed for group differences using the Wilcoxon test, and boxplots were created with ggplot2. Additionally, Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed in the GSE83453 p Cell transfection and grouping The TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 (ATCC, USA, HTB-26MET™), BT-549 (ATCC, USA, HTB-122) was cultured in a medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA, F0193) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Pen-Strep, Thermo Fisher, USA, 15140148) in a 37 °C, 5% CO 2 RT-qPCR experiment Total RNA was extracted from the transfected cells using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher, USA, 15596026). RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara, Japan, RR037A). SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher, USA, 4309155) was used for RT-qPCR on an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA, 7500). The cycling conditions were set for 40 cycles, and relative expression levels of FGF4 were calculated using the 2 -ΔΔCT S1 Western blot analysis Total protein was extracted from cells using RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, China), and protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay. The protein samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, USA). Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C, including FGF4 (1:1000, Abcam, UK, ab106355), STAT3 (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, USA, 9139), IL6 (1:1000, Proteintech, China, 21865-1-AP), and p-STAT3 (1:1000, Abcam, UK, ab267373), along with the internal control β-Actin antibody (1:5000, Cell Signaling Technology, USA, 4967). The secondary antibody was an HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit/mouse antibody (1:5000, Thermo Fisher, USA, 31460), incubated for 1 h. Protein signals were detected using an ECL chemiluminescent reagent (Beyotime, China) and analyzed by ImageJ software for densitometric analysis. Co-culture experiment and grouping FGF4 overexpression, knockdown, and control group cells of the MDA-MB-231, BT-549 breast cancer cell line were co-cultured with THP-1 macrophage cells (ATCC, USA). The THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages by treatment with 100 ng/mL PMA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA, P8139) for 48 h. After differentiation, the MDA-MB-231, BT-549 cells and THP-1 macrophages were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and cultured in Transwell chambers (Corning, USA) to assess the impact of FGF4 on macrophage polarization. Immunofluorescence staining To assess the expression levels of iNOS, CD86, Arg1, and CD206 in macrophages, macrophages from the co-culture system were first isolated and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min and washed thrice with PBS. To block non-specific binding, the cells were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. The following primary antibodies were used to detect target markers: CD68 (ab201973, 1:200, Abcam, UK), iNOS (ab178945, 1:200, Abcam, UK), CD86 (ab239075, 1:100, Abcam, UK), Arg1 (ab313496, 1:200, Abcam, UK), and CD206 (ab64693, 1:100, Abcam, UK). Cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 1% bovine serum albumin PBS. After primary antibody incubation, cells were labeled with secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor ® ® Flow cytometry After co-culture, macrophages were collected and stained to detect M1 markers (iNOS, CD86) and M2 markers (Arg1, CD206). The primary antibodies used were iNOS (Abcam, UK, ab239990), CD86 (Abcam, UK, ab239075), Arg1 (Abcam, UK, ab212522), CD206 (BD Biosciences, USA, 550889), and CD68 (BD Biosciences, USA, 565595). Following staining, the expression of cell surface markers was analyzed using a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA). For tumor tissue, samples were mechanically homogenized and digested with collagenase I (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to generate a single-cell suspension. After centrifugation, the suspension was stained to detect T-cell functional markers. CD8 (BioLegend, USA, clone: 53 − 6.7), IFN-γ (BioLegend, USA, clone: AN-18), TNF-α (BioLegend, USA, clone: 6B8), and GzmB (BioLegend, USA, clone: GB11) antibodies were added to identify positive cells. The expression of these markers was assessed using a BD FACSCanto II flow cytometer, and T-cell functional status was analyzed using FlowJo software. IL6/STAT3 pathway intervention To further investigate the role of the IL6/STAT3 signaling pathway in FGF4-mediated macrophage polarization, the IL6-neutralizing antibody (1 µg/mL, AF-206-NA, R&D Systems, USA) or the STAT3 activator Colivelin (10 µM, 3945, Tocris Bioscience, UK) was added to the co-culture system. IL6 and Colivelin were introduced separately in the FGF4 knockdown group, and flow cytometry was used to examine changes in the expression of M1 and M2 polarization markers in macrophages. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) The supernatant from the co-culture system was collected to measure the levels of immune-suppressive cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β secreted by macrophages under FGF4 regulation. ELISA kits (IL-10: R&D Systems, USA, M1000B; TGF-β: BioLegend, USA, 594509) were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Standards and samples in a 96-well plate were incubated and washed, and then enzyme conjugate and substrate were added for color development. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a BioTek microplate reader (USA), and cytokine concentrations were calculated. T cell proliferation assay To assess the inhibitory effect of FGF4-regulated macrophages on T cell proliferation, T cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dye (65-0850-84, Thermo Fisher, USA). After labeling, the T cells were added to the co-culture system and incubated with macrophages. After 48 h of co-culture, T cells were collected, and CFSE-labeled T cell proliferation was analyzed by flow cytometry. Data were analyzed using FlowJo software to calculate the T cell proliferation inhibition rate. Cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay To evaluate the effect of M2-polarized macrophage supernatants on breast cancer cell proliferation, supernatants were added to MDA-MB-231, BT-549 cells. After 24 h of incubation, 10 µL of CCK-8 reagent (CK04, Dojindo, Japan) was added, and the cells were incubated for another 2 h. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (MB-530, HEALCES, China), and the cell proliferation rate was calculated. Transwell migration and invasion assays To evaluate the effect of M2 macrophage-derived secretions on breast cancer cell migration, MDA-MB-231, BT-549 cells were suspended in a serum-free medium and placed in the upper chamber of a Transwell system (8 μm pore size, Corning, USA). A culture medium containing M2 macrophage supernatant was added to the lower chamber. After 24 h of incubation, cells that had migrated through the membrane were fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. The number of migrated cells was counted under a microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany). To assess the effect of M2 macrophage supernatants on breast cancer cell invasion, the upper chamber was pre-coated with Matrigel (Corning, USA). MDA-MB-231, BT-549 cells were added to the upper chamber, and M2 macrophage supernatant was added to the lower chamber. After 48 h of incubation, invading cells that had passed through the Matrigel were fixed and stained. The number of invasive cells was then counted under a microscope. Establishment of an orthotopic breast cancer model To establish an orthotopic breast cancer model, FGF4-overexpressing, knockdown, and control groups of TNBC cells (4T1 cells, Pricella, China, CL-0007) were injected into the mammary fat pads of immunocompetent BALB/c mice (purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd., BALB/cAnNCrl, 211). Each group contained 10 mice, and all procedures adhered to ethical guidelines for animal experiments. Mice were sacrificed 28 days post-injection, and tumor tissues were excised and weighed to assess tumor growth [ 40 Immunohistochemistry staining Tumor tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and subjected to dehydration, embedding, and sectioning (4 μm thickness). Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer (pH 6.0), followed by 10-minute incubation with 0.3% H 2 2 Statistical analysis Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 9.0 software (GraphPad Software, USA); for comparisons between two groups, an independent t-test was used. For comparisons among multiple groups, one-way analysis of variance was performed, followed by post-hoc least significant difference or Tukey’s multiple comparison tests.
