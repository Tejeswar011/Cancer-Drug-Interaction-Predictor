Introduction With the rapid advancement of extremely high-capacity sequencing technologies, researchers can now readily examine vast numbers of SNP markers—often reaching into the hundreds of thousands—within datasets containing thousands of participants [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 5 6 9 10 11 12 13 14 Nevertheless, the etiological interpretation of complex traits necessitates an explicit consideration of non-additive, genome-wide epistatic interactions. Epistasis-defined as the context-dependent effect of one locus contingent upon the allelic state of another [ 15 16 17 18 19 20 Over the past decade, a diverse portfolio of computational strategies has been introduced to systematically uncover epistatic interactions [ 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 21 To mitigate this scalability bottleneck, DECMDR [ 22 24 Multi-objective optimisation paradigms have also gained prominence. MACOED [ 25 28 26 29 30 Despite these algorithmic advances, prevailing approaches exhibit several persistent limitations. Most methods mandate an a priori specification of interaction order, struggle to maintain an optimal balance between stochastic exploration and population diversity, and lack unified, high-resolution evaluation criteria capable of rigorously quantifying the biological significance of detected epistatic effects. Herein, we present GPBSO—Gene Pool-Based Brain Storm Optimization—a new swarm-intelligence algorithm devised for the systematic discovery of epistatic interactions. Distinct from prevailing approaches, GPBSO integrates automatic estimation of the maximum interaction order, the exploratory power of a dynamically maintained gene pool, and the balance between global and local search achieved by the Brain Storm Optimization framework. In addition, GPBSO combines Bayesian network scoring with statistical validation to ensure robust detection of epistatic interactions across multiple orders. These innovations collectively make GPBSO a scalable and reliable tool for dissecting the polygenic architecture of complex traits. To thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of GPBSO, we employed both synthetic and real-world GWAS datasets. The synthetic datasets were generated using EpiGEN [ 31 22 24 26 29 30 Subsequently, GPBSO was deployed on the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) GWAS dataset [ 32 TSBP1 TSBP1-AS1 DAB1 OMA1 STK32A-AS1 LRIG1 LOC105376945 BTNL2 SPATA5 LOC105370777 33 2. Materials and Methods When faced with a difficult problem that no single individual can solve, bringing together a group of people—especially those with diverse backgrounds—for brainstorming often leads to a high probability of finding a solution. Human interaction and collaboration can generate remarkable and unexpected intelligence. One effective way to facilitate such interaction and cooperation for generating innovative ideas is to organize a brainstorming session. This concept led to the invention of Brain Storm Optimization (BSO) [ 34 The Gene Pool-based Brain Storm Optimization (GPBSO) algorithm is an improved method based on BSO, designed to detect complex epistatic interactions in Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) data. GPBSO enhances the search process by emulating the collaborative and ideation dynamics characteristic of human brainstorming, while simultaneously employing a dynamic gene pool management strategy. Initially, the gene pool is defined as the complete set of SNPs not yet incorporated into the existing population. As the algorithm progresses, this pool is adaptively modified: when a newly generated individual is admitted into the population, its constituent SNPs are excluded from the gene pool; conversely, when an individual is eliminated due to suboptimal fitness, its SNPs are returned to the pool. This continuous update mechanism ensures that the gene pool remains representative of the SNPs available for future selection, thereby sustaining population diversity and maintaining an effective balance between exploration and exploitation. The structural overview and procedural workflow of GPBSO are illustrated in Figure 1 2.1. Load the Gwas Data into Memory To enhance computational efficiency and minimize memory overhead, the algorithm utilizes a binary-based data storage and processing strategy, analogous to the method implemented in BOOST. Given a dataset comprising N genetic loci, along with C0 control samples and C1 case samples, the genotype information is organized into two distinct data structures: healthy_data and disease_data, corresponding to the control and case groups, respectively. The healthy_data structure is defined as an array of length N, where each entry healthy_data[loc] (with loc in the range [0, N)) is a vector consisting of three components representing the encoded genotype counts or distributions for the respective locus. Each component is a binary array of length C0, representing the genotype distribution of the loc-th gene locus in the healthy group. Specifically, healthy_data[loc][type][sample] (sample ∈ [0, C0)) takes a value of 1 or 0, indicating whether the genotype of the sample-th healthy sample at the loc-th locus matches the type-th possible genotype. The disease_data array follows the same structure as healthy_data. By using only 3 bits per gene locus and sample to store genotype information, the algorithm significantly reduces memory usage. For example, if each gene locus has two possible genotypes (0 or 1) and the dataset contains 8 disease samples and 8 healthy samples, a statistical table for gene locus combinations is constructed through binary operations, which is then used to calculate relevant statistical metrics. The binary operations on genotype data significantly reduce computational complexity, with a time complexity of O(S × L × 3 L 29 30 35 2.2. Determine the Maximum Order (mo) Based on the Samples GPBSO does not require a preset interaction order. Instead, it determines the maximum order (mo) based on the GWAS sample size. The maximum interaction order mo is estimated based on the smaller of the case or control sample sizes. This estimation involves computing the natural logarithm of the smaller sample size, subtracting 0.5, and then rounding the result down to the nearest integer. While a larger mo enables the algorithm to investigate more complex epistatic interactions, setting mo too high may result in excessively sparse contingency tables, thereby compromising the reliability of the k2 statistic. To ensure analytical stability, the algorithm is designed such that each cell in the contingency table contains approximately three samples, with the final mo value adjusted accordingly through rounding. 2.3. Initialize Discussion Groups and Gene Pool The initialization of discussion groups and the gene pool constitutes a critical component of the GPBSO algorithm, directly influencing its operational efficiency and optimization capability. At the initial stage, the algorithm employs the k-means++ clustering method to partition the population into multiple discussion groups. Each group represents a localized region within the solution space and comprises individuals with similar genetic characteristics. This grouping mechanism emulates the collaborative nature of brainstorming sessions, fostering inter-group diversity and intra-group cohesion. Such a structure not only facilitates organized generation of new individuals in subsequent phases but also reinforces the algorithm’s capacity to navigate and exploit the solution space effectively. Simultaneously, the gene pool module is systematically constructed to complement this framework. It is initialized as the set of all candidate SNPs that are not currently present in any individual within the population. Thus, the gene pool serves as a dynamic repository of unused genetic elements, ensuring access to a wide range of variation during the search process. As the algorithm progresses, the gene pool is continuously updated in real time. When a newly generated individual is successfully incorporated into the population, its constituent SNPs are removed from the gene pool to prevent repeated usage of the same genetic components, thereby enhancing population diversity and encouraging exploration of unexplored regions in the search space. Conversely, if an individual is removed due to inferior fitness, its SNPs are restored to the gene pool, ensuring that potentially useful genetic material remains accessible. The coordinated implementation of discussion group formation and dynamic gene pool management enables GPBSO to maintain a robust balance between exploration and exploitation. This balance is essential for mitigating the risk of premature convergence and promoting an efficient, non-redundant search process. Collectively, the design and integration of these two modules represent key innovations in the algorithm, substantially contributing to its overall performance and effectiveness in identifying epistatic interactions. The operational structure of the gene pool module is depicted in Figure 2 2.4. Generate Individual X Through Discussion Group Dynamics The individual generation algorithm in the GPBSO algorithm embodies the core principles of the framework, which dynamically balances the exploitation of promising ideas and the exploration of new ones by simulating brainstorming sessions. Utilizing three distinct methods, the algorithm mimics the collaborative and innovative nature of brainstorming, leveraging the collective intelligence of “discussion groups” and the untapped potential within the gene pool. In the Idea Fusion Method, a top-performing discussion group is selected to refine existing ideas. Two high-ranking individuals (ideas) from this group are chosen, and their genetic material is combined—taking the first half of the SNPs from one and the second half from the other. This reflects the brainstorming process where participants merge the best aspects of existing ideas to create a stronger, more refined solution. This strategy enables the algorithm to intensify its search within promising regions of the solution space, leveraging the advantages of previously validated solutions. Within the Inspiration Sparking Method, the process of partially reimagining an idea based on external stimuli is emulated. Specifically, a high-fitness individual selected from a designated discussion group undergoes targeted modification, wherein the second half of its SNP sequence is substituted with novel SNPs sampled from the gene pool. This mechanism introduces controlled variability while preserving the core attributes of the original solution, thereby achieving a balance between exploiting established knowledge and exploring new combinatorial possibilities. The Free Association Method reflects the brainstorming principle of unconstrained ideation by generating entirely novel individuals. In this approach, a new candidate is constructed solely from the gene pool by randomly selecting a fixed number of SNPs. This encourages the incorporation of original and independent genetic combinations into the population, thereby enhancing solution diversity and reducing the risk of premature convergence to local optima. Collectively, these three generation strategies embody the fundamental tenets of brainstorming—structured synthesis, adaptive transformation, and radical innovation. The Idea Fusion Method facilitates refinement through recombination of existing individuals, the Inspiration Sparking Method promotes guided creativity via selective alteration, and the Free Association Method ensures exploratory breadth through the introduction of wholly new genetic material. The interplay of these mechanisms enables the algorithm to thoroughly and adaptively traverse the search space, enhancing its ability to identify intricate patterns of SNP epistasis. The coordinated function of discussion groups and the dynamically managed gene pool further contributes to the algorithm’s capacity to balance intensification and diversification during the search process. 2.5. Identifying Epistasis Within SNP Combinations Through the k2 Metric The k2 score, which is commonly used in Bayesian network modeling, serves as a quantitative indicator for detecting epistatic associations. Its formal definition is shown in Equation (1). (1) k 2 ( Y , S ) = ∏ c ∈ C m c , 0 ! × m c , 1 ! ( m c , * + 1 ) ! In Equation (2), the k2 statistic quantifies the degree of association between phenotype traits and a group of SNP interactions.

Evaluating the Significance of Interaction Effects with the G-Test Within the GPBSO framework, epistatic relationships are evaluated and categorized as either statistically relevant or not. As illustrated in Algorithm 1 the algorithm can uncover a large number of such interactions. This section outlines how GPBSO determines statistical significance, using the G-test as its core evaluation method. The G-test [ 36 p 30 In Equation (2), the statistical significance of the relationship between a given phenotype and a specific set of SNPs is measured using the G-test. This evaluation is carried out under the likelihood-ratio framework, and its test statistic approximately follows a chi-squared distribution. All possible genotype configurations for the chosen SNP set are considered. For example, if the set contains l SNPs, there will be 3 l (2) g ( Y ; S ) = pvalue _ of ( 2 ∑ c ∈ C m c , 0 × m c , 0 × m m c , * × m * , 0 + m c , 1 × m c , 1 × m m c , * × m * , 1 ) Here, m c C m c ,0 m c ,1 m c ,* *,0 *,1 g Y E p S 2.7. Parameter Settings and Practical Guidance The performance of GPBSO depends on three key parameters: the population size (PopSize), the maximum number of generations (maxGen), and the maximum interaction order (mo). In all experiments, mo was estimated automatically from the sample size as described in Section 2 6 7 7 For practical applications, we recommend setting PopSize = 50–200. Smaller datasets (<500 SNPs) can be analyzed with PopSize = 50–100 and a modest maxGen (often around 10 6 7 7 Supplementary Table S2 3. Results 3.1. Performance Assessment Using Simulated Genotype Data There are a number of challenges related to generating simulated epistasis datasets. From a biological perspective, in real genetic environments, alleles tend to only partially conform to Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium, which is influenced by the Minor Allele Frequency (MAF), and are locally constrained by linkage disequilibrium structures. Ultimately, any interaction that contributes to the causation of a phenotype may explain only part of the trait’s heritability, leaving a substantial portion unaccounted for. Additional practical challenges involve runtime, computational efficiency, and scalability. To systematically evaluate the performance of GPBSO and competing algorithms on these simulated datasets, we employed two commonly used metrics: F-measure, defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and Power, defined as the probability of correctly identifying true epistatic interactions. To address these complexities, we employed EpiGEN to generate simulation datasets that reflect realistic genetic properties. EpiGEN was used to generate a corpus of synthetic genetic data based on 2000 samples modeled on Chromosome 22. Several models were constructed based on potential epistatic interactions described by Evans et al. [ 37 Table 1 Supplementary Table S1 We constructed three types of simulation scenarios: (1) second-order interactions among 100 SNPs, (2) second-order interactions among 1000 SNPs, and (3) third-order interactions among 100 SNPs. In the third-order interaction scenario, the 100 loci included 3 interacting loci and 97 noise loci. For each scenario, ten independent datasets were generated for each of the five epistatic interaction models, resulting in a total of 150 simulated datasets. Using these datasets, we systematically evaluated the performance of GPBSO and benchmarked it against five existing methods [ 22 24 26 29 30 Supplementary Table S2 To visually illustrate the detection performance of each method, Figure 3 Supplementary Tables S3–S5 3.2. Computational Cost Analysis To further evaluate the efficiency of GPBSO, we compared its computational cost with that of competing algorithms under the same experimental environment. Table 2 3.3. Validation on Authentic GWAS Datasets Real-data validation used the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) resource: 14,000 patients across seven complex diseases and 3000 shared controls. The disorders are bipolar disorder, coronary artery disease, Crohn’s disease, hypertension, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and type 2 diabetes, each represented by about 2000 cases. All samples were genotyped for approximately 500,000 SNPs. Following WTCCC quality-control guidelines, we removed low-quality SNPs and samples and excluded monomorphic loci, yielding seven independent case–control GWAS datasets; details are in Supplementary Table S6 Building on the favorable outcomes observed in the simulation phase, we extended GPBSO to the seven WTCCC GWAS datasets. Runs were configured with automatic order inference (o = −1), a generation cap of 8 × 10 7 Table 3 Supplementary Table S7 Leveraging annotations from the NCBI database of genetic variation (dbSNP) [ 38 Table 4 Table 5 DAB1 BTNL2 LRIG1 To visualize the resulting interaction landscapes, Cytoscape v3.6.0, an open-source platform for biological network visualization [ 39 Figure 4 Figure 5 Supplementary Figures S1–S12 4. Discussion This study evaluated GPBSO for detecting epistatic interactions in GWAS data using both simulated and real datasets. In real GWAS analyses of seven complex diseases, GPBSO identified numerous significant SNP–SNP and gene–gene interactions, many consistent with known biology, supporting the method’s practical utility. Although GPBSO’s computational cost is higher than purely filtering-based methods, its superior performance in detecting higher-order interactions compensates for this limitation. Functional validation remains necessary to confirm the causal roles of detected interactions. In addition to rediscovering known disease-associated loci, GPBSO also revealed several novel candidate genes, including LRIG1 OMA1 SPATA5 LRIG1 40 41 OMA1 42 43 SPATA5 Although GPBSO involves several tunable parameters, the provided guidelines can assist researchers in selecting appropriate values according to dataset size and available computational resources, thereby improving reproducibility and usability for other researchers. Future work will focus on developing adaptive strategies for automatic parameter tuning, further optimizing computational efficiency, and integrating biological prior knowledge to enhance interpretability and scalability. Compared with existing approaches, GPBSO demonstrates several distinctive advantages. First, it eliminates the need for manual specification of interaction order by automatically estimating the maximum order (mo) from the dataset, thereby supporting a comprehensive and scalable search. Second, the Brain Storm Optimization framework enables a robust balance between exploration and exploitation, which helps maintain population diversity and reduces the risk of premature convergence. Third, the incorporation of a dynamically replenished gene pool broadens the search space, enhances heterogeneity, and reduces selection bias in SNP sampling. Finally, the integration of the Bayesian K2 score with the G-test ensures statistically rigorous evaluation of candidate interactions across all orders. Together, these features distinguish GPBSO from other epistasis detection algorithms and account for its superior performance on both simulated and real GWAS datasets. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, our extensive experiments demonstrate that GPBSO is a powerful and practical algorithm for detecting epistatic interactions in GWAS data, with particular strength in uncovering higher-order interactions. Applied to seven real GWAS datasets of complex diseases, GPBSO successfully identified numerous biologically meaningful SNP–SNP and gene–gene interactions, and constructed interaction networks that highlight potential candidate genes for further study. These results not only validate the effectiveness of GPBSO but also provide valuable insights into the genetic architecture of complex diseases. Future work will focus on further improving computational efficiency and integrating functional validation to enhance biological interpretability. 6.
