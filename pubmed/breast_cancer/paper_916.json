Introduction The global burden of viral infectious diseases and the increase in the mortality rate of cancers pose a substantial threat to social stability and economic development. Vaccination remains the most effective tool for preventing and controlling infectious diseases and cancers, underscoring the critical need for safe and efficacious vaccines to safeguard global health and drive economic growth [ 1 2 3 4 5 Compared with conventional vaccines, nanotechnology-based vaccines (nanovaccines) offer distinct advantages, including improved antigen stability, enhanced delivery efficiency, and modulation of immune responses [ 6 5 7 8 Additionally, traditional vaccines face challenges related to stability and precise targeting. Being predominantly composed of biological macromolecules such as proteins or polysaccharides, they are susceptible to denaturation or degradation under suboptimal storage and transport conditions, compromising vaccine efficacy [ 9 Nanovaccines employ nanotechnology to encapsulate or conjugate antigens for targeted delivery to the immune cells. This facilitates more controlled, precise, and effective activation of host immune responses. Nanocarriers can present antigens on their surfaces to enhance uptake by antigen-presenting cells or encapsulate antigens within their structures to shield them from enzymatic degradation, prolong stability, and enable sustained antigen release, ultimately improving immunogenicity and protective outcomes. The advent of nanovaccine technology offers promising avenues for overcoming the drawbacks of traditional vaccines. Notably, cancer immunotherapy utilizing nanovaccines exemplifies the cutting edge of precision medicine [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 4 16 17 18 Despite their considerable advantages and encouraging preclinical outcomes, nanovaccines remain largely confined to the early stages of research, with significant hurdles yet to be addressed in the transition from animal studies to human clinical trials. This review aims to systematically examine the design strategies and core technologies underpinning nanovaccines, while elucidating their applications in cancer therapy, infectious disease prevention, and beyond. Furthermore, we critically analyze the prevailing technical challenges impeding clinical translation, with the goal of providing comprehensive insights to inform future research and development in this rapidly evolving field. 2. Strategies for the Design of Nanovaccines 2.1. Selection and Optimization of Primary Carrier Materials In the development of nanovaccines, the choice and optimization of carrier materials are of paramount importance, as different materials exhibit distinct physicochemical properties and functional advantages ( Figure 1 19 20 21 22 23 2.1.1. Inorganic Nanoparticles Inorganic nanoparticles—including gold nanoparticles, iron oxide nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes—have emerged as promising carriers in nanovaccine design due to their structural stability and favorable biocompatibility [ 24 25 26 Beyond their role as carriers, certain inorganic nanomaterials possess intrinsic immunostimulatory properties, contributing to the activation and enhancement of host immune responses [ 27 28 25 Therefore, the design and development of biodegradable inorganic nanomaterials are imperative to mitigate long-term safety concerns and to enable their broader application in biomedical and vaccine delivery contexts. 2.1.2. Polymeric Nanoparticles Polymeric nanoparticles represent a versatile vaccine delivery platform in which antigens and adjuvants are encapsulated within a biocompatible and biodegradable polymer matrix. Compared with traditional vaccine delivery systems, polymeric nanoparticles offer several advantages, including enhanced antigen stability, protection against enzymatic degradation, controlled release kinetics, and the ability to target specific cells or tissues [ 29 It has been demonstrated that the chemical structure and physicochemical properties of polymeric nanomaterials can be finely tuned by modifying synthesis conditions and formulation parameters. This allows precise control over particle size, morphology, and surface characteristics, thereby improving both the stability and the targeting efficiency of nanovaccines. Common polymeric materials employed for nanovaccine fabrication include poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), chitosan, polylactic acid (PLA), and polyethylene glycol (PEG), all of which exhibit excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and modifiable surface properties, making them highly attractive carriers for vaccine delivery [ 30 31 32 Among these, PLGA is the most extensively studied polymer for biomedical applications. As a biodegradable copolymer, PLGA undergoes hydrolysis of its ester bonds, leading to safe metabolic by-products, and has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for human clinical use [ 33 34 This sustained-release capability maintains an effective antigen concentration over extended periods, continuously stimulating the immune system and thereby enhancing immunogenicity. In addition to their favorable release profiles, PLGA nanoparticles are highly biocompatible and do not induce long-term toxicity or adverse reactions. Furthermore, the synthesis process and formulation parameters allow precise modulation of their particle size and surface properties, facilitating optimized biodistribution and immune activation [ 35 2.1.3. Lipid Nanoparticles Lipid nanoparticles have attracted considerable attention as vaccine delivery systems owing to their excellent biocompatibility, low intrinsic toxicity, and controlled release properties. They are capable of encapsulating antigens and adjuvants, protecting them from enzymatic degradation, and facilitating targeted delivery to specific cells or tissues. Among the various nanocarriers, lipid nanoparticles offer notable advantages in terms of encapsulation efficiency and scalability of manufacturing, making them particularly suitable for large-scale vaccine production [ 36 Common lipid-based nanocarriers include liposomes, nanoemulsions (such as nanostructured lipid carriers, NLCs), and solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). These systems can encapsulate both hydrophilic and hydrophobic antigens, improving the solubility of poorly water-soluble molecules and enabling delivery through fusion with target cell membranes. Liposomes, for instance, are spherical vesicles composed of a phospholipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core, which protects encapsulated antigens from gastrointestinal degradation and supports sustained release [ 37 38 2.1.4. Biomimetic Nanoparticles Biomimetic nanoparticles, designed to emulate the structure and functions of natural cells, have emerged as promising platforms to enhance vaccine biocompatibility and elicit cell-like interactions [ 39 40 3 Among these, OMVs—nanoscale vesicles naturally secreted by Gram-negative bacteria—have gained traction in personalized cancer vaccine strategies. OMVs are primarily composed of outer membrane proteins and lipopolysaccharides, which inherently display pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These features enable OMVs to activate various immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, by triggering innate immune pathways and initiating robust adaptive responses. Because of their intrinsic immunostimulatory properties, OMVs can act as natural adjuvants to enhance antigen-specific immunity [ 41 Neisseria meningitidis 42 As a frontier in nanomedicine, biomimetic nanotechnology has also been widely explored for cancer therapy to improve efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity. The tunable size, morphology, and surface characteristics of biomimetic nanomaterials facilitate the encapsulation of hydrophobic drugs, controlled release, improved pharmacokinetics, and efficient tissue penetration. These nanoparticles can traverse narrow capillaries, enabling passive targeting through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects, or active targeting via ligand-mediated interactions with specific cellular receptors. Similar to lipid nanomaterials, biomimetic systems can be surface-functionalized to specifically target cancer cells or the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby enhancing delivery precision and therapeutic outcomes [ 43 Nonetheless, the design and fabrication of biomimetic nanomaterials are often complex, involving multi-step processes and sophisticated technologies that necessitate specialized equipment. This results in high production costs and poses significant challenges to scalability. Currently, these materials are primarily confined to laboratory research, with large-scale, reproducible manufacturing remaining difficult to achieve [ 44 2.2. Functionalization to Enhance Targeting Functionalization strategies have opened new avenues to improve the targeting capabilities of nanovaccines. Active targeting is primarily achieved by modifying the surfaces of nanovaccines with antibodies, peptides, or other ligands that can specifically bind to receptors on target cells or tissues [ 45 46 47 By decorating the surfaces of nanovaccines with specific ligands, it is possible to achieve active targeting of dendritic cells (DCs) and other key immune cells. For instance, the modification of nanocarriers with polyethylene glycol (PEG) not only reduces nonspecific protein adsorption but also improves the overall targeting efficiency of the nanovaccines [ 48 49 50 51 52 53 For cancer nanovaccines, functionalization can also leverage physiological cues—such as local pH or enzymatic activity—to trigger controlled drug release, protecting antigens and adjuvants from premature degradation and improving both stability and therapeutic efficacy [ 15 54 This pH-responsive fusion design enables nanovaccines to achieve active targeting of cancer cells, overcoming the limitations of traditional nanocarriers that depend solely on passive targeting mechanisms like enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effects. Direct intracellular release of antigens within cancer cells further augments cellular immune responses, particularly the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), thereby strengthening antitumor effects. In preclinical models, nanoparticles functionalized with VSVG and loaded with cancer antigens have demonstrated enhanced antigen presentation, robust anticancer immune responses, and significant tumor growth inhibition [ 55 2.3. Synergistic Delivery of Immune Adjuvants Nanoparticles themselves can function as adjuvants in cancer nanovaccines, amplifying immune responses and enhancing therapeutic efficacy. Self-adjuvanted nanovaccines represent an innovative approach that integrates antigen delivery with intrinsic immune-stimulating properties, simplifying vaccine composition while potentiating immunogenicity. However, despite their promising potential in cancer therapy and the prevention of immune-mediated diseases, these systems face notable challenges. The interactions between nanoparticles and immune cells involve multiple signaling pathways and diverse cell types, making the underlying mechanisms of action complex and not yet fully elucidated [ 56 57 For complex diseases like cancer and emerging infectious diseases—where the immune system often exhibits dysfunction or evasion mechanisms—co-delivery of multiple adjuvants can synergistically activate complementary immune pathways. Combining STING agonists with TLR ligands, for instance, has been shown to robustly amplify immune responses by engaging distinct immunological signaling axes [ 58 59 60 In models of melanoma, colorectal cancer, and HPV-associated cancers, nanovaccines incorporating STING agonists have effectively inhibited tumor growth, offering a promising, safe, and potent strategy for cancer immunotherapy [ 61 62 63 Nevertheless, certain STING agonists, such as cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), face limitations due to rapid diffusion from injection sites, reducing local bioactivity and provoking systemic inflammation. Encapsulation within nanoparticles mitigates these issues by facilitating targeted delivery to DCs in draining lymph nodes while limiting systemic exposure. This co-delivery approach enhances immune cell activation while reducing the risk of systemic inflammation, thereby improving both the efficacy and safety profile of the vaccine [ 64 2.4. Self-Assembled Nano-Delivery Systems Nanoparticle-based vaccines with an ideal size ranging from 20 to 100 nm, which mimic the size and structural presentation of natural viruses, enhance the recognition and uptake by immune cells (such as dendritic cells), providing an effective platform for triggering a strong immune response against infectious diseases [ 65 66 67 Virus-like particles (VLPs), composed of one or more self-assembling molecules that mimic the morphology and size of viruses but lack genetic material, represent a prime example. VLPs are highly immunogenic, engaging immune pathways distinct from those triggered by conventional inactivated virus vaccines, and can simultaneously activate humoral and cellular immune responses [ 68 69 70 71 Beyond virus-derived assemblies, various self-assembling proteins such as ferritin, mi3, E2 protein, and encapsulin proteins have been widely used in nanovaccine development [ 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 Additionally, self-assembling peptides that organize into nanofibers, nanotubes, nanoribbons, or hydrogels present significant potential for vaccine applications. These structures can promote cell adhesion, provide epitope recognition sites, and facilitate antigen presentation and release [ 79 80 81 Overall, nanovaccines encompass a diverse array of delivery vectors, each offering unique advantages and facing distinct limitations ( Table 1 3 10 3. Breakthroughs in the Field of Application 3.1. Cancer Immunotherapy Vaccination plays an indispensable role in the prevention and treatment of diseases, and cancer nanovaccines have recently garnered considerable attention due to their capacity to elicit robust anti-tumor immune responses. Cancer vaccines, critical tools within immunotherapy, can be broadly categorized into prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. Prophylactic vaccines, such as those targeting human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), reduce the incidence of virus-associated malignancies by priming the immune system [ 82 83 25 Recent advances in nanomaterials and cancer immunotherapy have facilitated the development of cancer nanovaccines, which have demonstrated promising potential in the management of melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and triple-negative breast cancer [ 84 85 86 87 88 Successful induction of adaptive anti-tumor immunity relies on three key elements: antigen, adjuvant, and an immune-supportive tumor microenvironment (TME) [ 89 90 91 Moreover, combining nanovaccines with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies has demonstrated synergistic benefits. While nanovaccines increase the pool of tumor-specific T cells, ICIs block inhibitory pathways, enabling these T cells to function effectively within the TME [ 92 3.2. Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the transformative potential of nanotechnology in vaccine development. Nanovaccines have overcome many of the inherent limitations of traditional vaccines by facilitating targeted antigen delivery, enhancing antigen presentation, and enabling controlled release, thereby improving immunogenicity and vaccine stability [ 93 94 Among the most notable achievements is the development of mRNA vaccines, which leverage lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to deliver genetic instructions encoding viral antigens. These vaccines have demonstrated remarkable efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants [ 95 96 97 Beyond COVID-19, nanovaccines are advancing the development of vaccines against other formidable infectious diseases. In HIV vaccine research, nanoparticle platforms capable of multivalent antigen display mimic viral structures and enhance B cell activation, broadening and intensifying immune responses. For example, presenting stabilized HIV Env gp140 trimers on nanoparticles can induce broadly neutralizing antibodies, a key milestone in HIV vaccine efforts [ 98 99 100 Nanotechnology also holds promise in veterinary vaccines, which are critical for controlling zoonotic diseases and improving livestock productivity [ 2 101 102 1 3.3. Autoimmune Diseases and Allergies Nanocarriers also offer innovative strategies for managing autoimmune diseases and allergic disorders by delivering immunomodulatory agents or inducing antigen-specific tolerance [ 103 104 For example, Wang and Li’s group at the University of Science and Technology of China developed low-immunogenic LNPs optimized for delivering PD-L1 mRNA to antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [ 105 106 107 108 Thus, by enabling precise delivery and minimizing systemic side effects, nanovaccine platforms and nanocarriers offer powerful new modalities for the treatment of autoimmune and allergic diseases. On the whole, nanovaccines have been useful in breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy, prevention and control of infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases. With targeted delivery, efficient immune activation, and customizability, they have demonstrated broad clinical prospects, and numerous formulations have progressed to clinical trials ( Table 2 Table 2 4. Key Challenges in the Clinical Translation Despite remarkable preclinical advances, the clinical translation of nanovaccines remains fraught with significant challenges and unresolved questions ( Figure 2 4.1. Safety Issues The expanding biomedical application of nanomaterials necessitates rigorous assessment of their potential biological toxicity, with particular concern regarding the long-term metabolic fate of inorganic nanoparticles. 4.1.1. Potential Toxicity Upon systemic administration, nanoparticles may be perceived as foreign by the immune system, triggering activation of immune cells and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Sustained inflammatory responses may inflict chronic tissue damage, impairing organ function [ 110 111 112 113 4.1.2. Long-Term Metabolic Risks Nanoparticles possess unique physicochemical properties distinct from endogenous biomolecules, complicating their metabolic processing and excretion. Many nanoparticles resist enzymatic degradation and evade clearance via conventional renal or biliary routes, resulting in prolonged in vivo persistence and cumulative toxicity [ 114 115 4.2. Large-Scale Production and Stability Successful therapeutic efficacy in animal models does not guarantee clinical translatability. Scaling up production of nanovaccines with consistent quality and stability remains a formidable hurdle. High labor and material costs, coupled with complex multi-step manufacturing protocols, impede reproducibility. Transitioning formulations from preclinical models to humans often necessitates optimization or redesign of manufacturing processes, which demands significant investment and innovation, frequently stalling promising candidates [ 116 117 Specific challenges arise in the production of biologically derived components such as bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) and virus-like particles (VLPs). OMV yield and composition are influenced by variable bacterial culture conditions (media, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen) and genetic stability, contributing to batch-to-batch heterogeneity that complicates purification and quality control. The high cost of specialized equipment, reagents, and labor further constrains large-scale OMV production [ 118 119 VLP manufacturing depends critically on consistent expression and quality of viral structural proteins. Variability in gene expression, cell metabolism, and culture conditions can alter protein yield and conformation, affecting VLP self-assembly efficiency and product quality [ 120 4.3. Balancing Immunogenicity and Targeting Efficiency A pivotal challenge in nanovaccine development is achieving an optimal balance between potent immunogenicity and targeted delivery while avoiding adverse immune overactivation. Targeted delivery is one of the core objectives of nanovaccines. It not only relies on the inherent uptake of nanoparticles by myeloid cells, but also aims to accurately target functional myeloid cells (such as dendritic cells) through strategies such as ligand modification to improve the specificity and efficiency of immune responses. A cytokine storm—an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response characterized by excessive release of cytokines like TNF-α and IL-6—poses a severe risk, potentially causing multi-organ damage and mortality. Nanomaterial physicochemical properties (size, shape, surface charge, composition) affect their interaction with the immune system. The large surface area often leads to protein corona formation, which can modify nanovaccine immunogenicity and elevate inflammation risk [ 121 Optimizing delivery platforms, formulations, dosage forms, and administration routes is critical to enhancing efficacy, safety, stability, and patient compliance, while facilitating large-scale immunization logistics [ 122 5. Perspectives Looking forward, nanovaccine technology is poised to evolve along multiple dimensions—intelligent design, interdisciplinary integration, novel delivery methods, and universal protection—poised to revolutionize vaccine science. 5.1. Intelligent Design Upgrades Next-generation “smart” nanovaccines will feature stimulus-responsive release mechanisms tuned to the tumor microenvironment’s pH gradients, aberrant protease activity, and oxidative stress. For instance, multi-stage nanosystems can sequentially release antigens in acidic tumor tissues, followed by adjuvant activation via cancer-specific enzymes, amplifying immune responses in a spatiotemporal manner. 5.2. Multidisciplinary Integration and Innovation Continued refinement of mRNA vaccine platforms and nanocarrier materials science will yield safer, more effective delivery systems. Artificial intelligence-driven machine learning models will accelerate in silico screening and optimization of mRNA sequences and carrier formulations. Additionally, integration with emerging gene-editing technologies promises expanded therapeutic capabilities in disease prevention and treatment. 5.3. Needle-Free Delivery and Mucosal Immunity Expansion Needle-free administration, such as intranasal spray nanovaccines, will gain prominence, emphasizing enhanced mucosal adhesion, permeability, and immune activation to broaden protective coverage. Exploration of oral and rectal nanovaccine formulations will offer convenient, non-invasive options for infectious disease control and therapeutic interventions. 5.4. Breakthroughs in Universal Vaccines Bioinformatics and structural biology will deepen identification of conserved epitopes across cancers and pathogens, facilitating universal vaccine development. Cancer vaccines targeting pan-cancer antigenic signatures and broad-spectrum infectious disease vaccines capable of covering multiple variants will mitigate immune escape and improve preparedness for global health crises. 6. Conclusions Nanovaccines, at the intersection of materials science and immunology, have achieved significant milestones in both fundamental research and clinical translation. Technologies such as nanocarriers and functional surface modifications have surmounted traditional vaccine limitations, as exemplified by the global deployment of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines and emerging personalized cancer nanovaccines. As a next-generation vaccine platform, nanovaccines hold transformative potential for infectious disease prevention, cancer therapy, and immunomodulatory interventions. Nonetheless, challenges including nanotoxicity, manufacturing scalability, and immune response calibration must be addressed. Advancing interdisciplinary collaboration, process optimization, and regulatory frameworks will be pivotal to realizing the clinical promise of nanovaccines, ultimately enhancing global public health and personalized medicine.
