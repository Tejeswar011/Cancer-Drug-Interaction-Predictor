Introduction The growing demand for sustainable and functional materials has catalyzed extensive research into carbohydrate-based biopolymers, particularly polysaccharides such as chitosan, alginate, pectin, and cellulose. These polysaccharides exhibit unique structural and functional properties that enable their interaction with metallic nanoparticles, leading to enhanced antimicrobial performance. These biopolymers, defined as polymeric materials based on polysaccharides such as alginate, chitosan, pectin, cellulose, starch, and lignin, exhibit favorable properties such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, low immunogenicity, and non-toxicity. 1–5 e.g. Laminaria Fucus e.g. e.g. Aspergillus niger e.g. et al. 6 7–9 Among biopolymers, chitosan and alginate hold prominent positions due to their unique properties and diverse applications. Chitosan, a derivative of chitin obtained through deacetylation, is abundant in the exoskeletons of crustaceans and the cell walls of fungi. Its structure, featuring primary amine and hydroxyl groups, allows for chemical modification without altering its degree of polymerization. Chitosan has demonstrated excellent antimicrobial properties against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, which depend primarily on its molecular weight and degree of deacetylation (DD) ( Table 1 10 11 12–15 Table 1 Sources, extraction methods, physicochemical properties and characterization of chitosan obtained on current research Sources Species Extraction methods Molecular weight (kDa) Deacetylation degree (%) Key characteristics Ref.

Nanoparticles exhibit an exceptionally high surface area-to-volume ratio, meaning that a substantial proportion of their atoms or molecules are located at the surface, where they can participate in chemical, physical, or biological interactions. This property is critical for enhancing reactivity, catalytic efficiency, and interfacial bonding when incorporated into polymeric matrices. 34,35 via in situ 36 37 Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus 38,39 25 37,40 41 This review provides a comprehensive analysis of recent advancements in biopolymer–nanoparticle composites, with a focus on their synthesis, characterization, and diverse applications as antimicrobial materials.

Chitosan Chitosan (CS) is a cationic polysaccharide derived from the deacetylation of chitin, which is the second most abundant biopolymer in nature. 28 d d 18 23,42–44 17,21,32,45 2 46 47 Table 1 20,48 3.1.1. Chitosan extraction methods The extraction of CS from natural resources begins with a demineralization process aimed at removing inorganic salts, such as calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 19 2 4 3 49 2 2 3 3 50,51 3 52 Fig. 2a 16 24,53 Fig. 2 (a) General chitosan extraction process from crustacean exoskeleton ( Parastacus pugnax 23 16 3 28 The biological extraction of CS represents a sustainable alternative to traditional chemical methods, which typically involve extreme temperature conditions and aggressive chemical agents such as HCl and NaOH. 24 25 27 The application of ultrasound and microwave technology in the CS extraction has emerged as an eco-friendly alternative to traditional methods that produce hazardous waste, limiting the sustainability of the process. 54 29 In recent years, various strategies have been developed to optimize the extraction of CS, since the traditional extraction method presents drawbacks due to prolonged reaction times, high energy consumption, and the use of hazardous chemical reagents. 55 56 57 et al. 30 3.1.2.

Generally, a high M/G ratio (>1) is associated with the formation of soft and elastic gels, while a low M/G ratio (<1) and a higher content of G blocks favor the formation of strong and rigid gels. 63 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 64  Fig. 3c 59,65 7 3.2.1.

Emerging alginate extraction methods The increasing demand for more sustainable processes has driven the development of environmentally friendly extraction technologies ( Fig. 4b 59,63 Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) is an emerging technique that utilizes ultrasonic waves to facilitate alginate release from cell walls, significantly reducing extraction time while preserving the structure of functional groups. This method yields alginates with higher molecular weight and viscosity, suitable for biomedical and cosmetic applications. Similarly, high-pressure processing (HPP) employs extreme pressure conditions to break algae cells and release alginate, enhancing process efficiency and producing alginates with high purity and molecular weight, ideal for industrial applications requiring improved rheological properties. 68 Finally, enzymatic extraction of alginate is an efficient and sustainable alternative to conventional methods, as it enables the selective degradation of the macroalgal cell wall using specific enzymes, minimizing phenolic compounds and preserving the biopolymer's structure. Recent studies have optimized this process through technologies such as ultrasound and acid pretreatment, increasing yield and reducing extraction time. 62 et al. 60 3.2.3.

Pectin Pectin is a polysaccharide-based carbohydrate polymer found in the primary cell walls and middle lamella of plants, primarily composed of galacturonic acid (Gal-A) in three structural forms: rhamnogalacturonan I, rhamnogalacturonan II, and homogalacturonan. Depending on the degree of esterification (DE), pectin is classified as low methoxyl pectin (DE < 50%) and high methoxyl pectin (DE > 50%), as illustrated in Fig. 5a 2+ 70 71 72 Fig. 5 (a) A comparative diagram of extraction of pectin from agro-industrial biomass using conventional heating reflux extraction (HRE) and microwave assisted extraction (MAE) techniques, optimization procedure and characterization, reproduced from ref. 70 73 1 8 74 3.3.1.

Cellulose Cellulose is a polysaccharide-based carbohydrate polymer and the most abundant biopolymer in nature. It consists of linear chains of repeating β- d 1 Acetobacter xylinum 81 Given its carbohydrate polymer nature, cellulose has unique physicochemical characteristics that make it essential in diverse industrial applications. Its high crystallinity, biodegradability, and chemical reactivity enables its use in food packaging, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and biomaterials. 82 83 3.4.1. Methods of cellulose extraction The extraction and synthesis methods directly influence the final structure and functionality of cellulose, affecting its degree of polymerization, crystallinity, and molecular weight. The recovery of high-purity cellulose requires the efficient removal of hemicellulose, lignin, and other non-cellulosic materials, with each method presenting specific advantages and limitations ( Fig. 6a Fig. 6 (a) Different cellulose extraction methods reproduced from ref. 84 85 (AHP) 86 3.4.2. Conventional extraction methods for cellulose Some conventional extraction methods such as acid hydrolysis achieve high crystallinity but may lead to cellulose degradation. Acid hydrolysis facilitates the decomposition of hemicellulose and cellulose in the presence of acidic catalysts such as HCl, HNO 3 2 4 87 88 2 89 90 As an alternative, solid acids have been proposed to reduce corrosivity and operational risks. 89 91 92 2 2 2 93 84 3.4.3. Eco-friendly and advanced extraction methods Meanwhile, solvent-based extraction is emerging as a promising alternative for obtaining high-purity cellulose with reduced environmental impact. The use of solvents facilitates the efficient hydrolysis of hemicellulose and lignin, yielding cellulose with high purity and recovery rates. Combinations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with salts and aqueous HCl have been shown to be effective, achieving cellulose recovery rates between 48.9% and 55.5%, with minimal hemicellulose (1.2–3.2%) and lignin (0.97–3.47%) content. 94 95 84 Innovative methods for cellulose extraction emerged due to the limitations of conventional cellulose extraction techniques. These alternative approaches are designed to enhance efficiency and sustainability while minimizing equipment degradation and purification costs (see Fig. 6a 96 88 97 Another promising technique is organosolv fractionation, which efficiently separates cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin using organic solvents such as 1,4-dioxane, methanol, ethanol, and acetone. 87 98 84 The chemical structure of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin is illustrated in Fig. 6b Table 4 1 81 Table 4 Characteristics of cellulose based on precursor and extraction method Biopolymer Sources Extraction methods Yield (%) Functional groups Key characteristic Ref.

Morinda citrifolia Escherichia coli Salmonella typhimurium Staphylococcus aureus Listeria monocytogenes 124 One of the main challenges in incorporating plant-derived extracts into polymeric matrices such as pectin is their limited solubility in aqueous environments, which often compromises dispersion uniformity and bioactive efficacy. 125 126 et al.

Another potential use is demonstrated by Ahmad, R., and Ansari, K. in the synthesis of a bio-nanocomposite (Alg@AgNPs) for use as an adsorbent. Their approach considers biocompatibility and green chemistry during the AgNP synthesis process, utilizing alginate as a reducing and stabilizing agent ( Fig. 12a–c Fig. 12d 161 Fig. 12 SEM images of (a) before adsorption and (b) after adsorption of crystal violet (CV) dye, (c) TEM of Alg@AgNPs and (d) regeneration cycles for CV dye on Alg@AgNPs, reproduced from ref. 161 With these advancements, green methodologies not only involve the use of non-toxic compounds or solvents but also promote the utilization of several types of waste, such as agricultural, industrial, or technological residues, as raw materials or as reducing and stabilizing agents in the synthesis of nanomaterials, including metallic nanoparticles. For instance, Mondal et al.

Preliminary studies suggest that combining CS and nanoparticles yields more effective bactericidal and antimicrobial agents, targeting pathogens such as Escherichia coli Acinetobacter baumannii Staphylococcus aureus Candida Pseudomonas Aspergillus niger Penicillium Enterococcus faecalis Pseudomonas aeruginosa Streptococcus pneumonia 35,159,161,168,169 In conclusion, biopolymer–nanoparticle composites represent a powerful platform for antimicrobial materials, but their design must consider multiple physicochemical and biological factors to optimize efficacy across a broad spectrum of pathogens. The incorporation of green synthesis techniques, controlled nanoparticle distribution, and functional synergistic agents ( e.g. 6. Application of interest of biopolymer–nanoparticle composites Preliminary studies on the synthesis of nanoparticle-enhanced biopolymers have generated increasing interest across different industrial sectors, mainly due to their biocompatibility and broad multifunctional properties. In this context, Fernandes et al. in situ 183 184–187 One example of this approach was reported by Che et al. in situ S. aureus E. coli 188 Another common strategy involves depositing thin polymer/nanoparticle films onto cotton, polyester, or cotton–polyester blends. Polymeric matrices such as poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), or CS are combined with AgNPs or ZnNPs to form composite coatings. These systems enhance color, improve UV shielding, provide antimicrobial activity against E. coli S. aureus C. albicans 189 Gao et al. E. coli S. aureus −1 184–186,190 −1 190,191 The food industry has consistently focused on improving food safety by extending product shelf life, ensuring quality, and minimizing waste. In this pursuit, natural biopolymers, particularly CS, have shown significant potential. Derived from chitin, CS exhibits antimicrobial, antioxidant, and bioactive properties, making it a promising candidate for food preservation and packaging applications. Its effectiveness has been widely documented, especially in meat and fresh products, where it helps extend shelf life. For example, Tuesta et al. 192 2 193 194 2 In the biomedical field, particularly in the treatment and prevention of various diseases, systems based on biopolymers combined with nanoparticles have shown promising potential. A representative example is the study by Boca et al. 195 Alternatively, several studies have focused on the development of hydrogels composed of metallic nanoparticles (Ag or Au) and biopolymers such as chitosan, poly(vinyl alcohol), carboxymethylcellulose, poly(lactic- co e.g. 196–198 199 While conventional chemical synthesis methods remain widely used, green synthesis routes have also been proposed. Metallic nanoparticles have been synthesized using plant extracts such as Camellia sinensis Moringa oleifera S 200 201 7. Challenges in the large-scale production, of biopolymer–nanoparticle composites, toxicity, and regulatory approvals To address the issue of large-scale production, we have incorporated insights from Muñoz-Bonilla et al. 202 Concerning nanoparticle toxicity, we acknowledge that our earlier emphasis on biocompatibility might have lacked sufficient nuance. As highlighted by Altaf et al. 203 Regarding regulatory approvals, Ruan et al. 202 Overall, the synergy between biopolymers and metallic nanoparticles represents a promising frontier for the development of next-generation multifunctional materials. However, to fully harness their potential, future research must address critical challenges related to large-scale production, long-term biocompatibility, and regulatory approval frameworks. Special attention should be given to developing standardized protocols for green synthesis and toxicity assessment, which are essential for the safe translation of these materials into clinical and food-related environments. Moreover, the design of smart biopolymer–nanoparticle systems with stimuli-responsive behaviors and tunable degradation profiles could unlock new applications in targeted drug delivery, active packaging, and environmental remediation. Interdisciplinary collaboration among material scientists, toxicologists, and regulatory bodies will be vital to accelerate the adoption of these technologies and ensure their sustainable and responsible integration into real-world applications. 8. Environmental implications of biopolymer–nanoparticle composites: sustainability and biodegradability considerations The integration of nanoparticles into biopolymer matrices has garnered significant attention for enhancing material performance, particularly in sectors such as packaging, 204,205 204,206 207,208 Fig. 15 Fig. 15 Flowchart illustrating the integration of nanoparticles into biopolymer matrices, summarizing the key application sectors, potential performance benefits ( e.g. e.g. Biopolymers are often viewed as sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based plastics due to their renewable origins and potential for biodegradability. Nevertheless, the incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles into these matrices can alter their environmental footprint in multifaceted ways. 209,210 210,211 LCA studies have demonstrated that even small mass fractions of nanoparticles (based on carbon, for example carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon black) can significantly increase the non-renewable energy use and greenhouse gas emissions of biopolymer–nanoparticle composites. 210,212 et al. 213 210 214 Methods like flame spray pyrolysis further exacerbate these effects due to high electricity consumption and low yields. 214 210 et al. 211 2 215 Biopolymer matrices typically biodegrade under controlled composting or anaerobic digestion, releasing carbon dioxide or methane in a theoretically net-neutral carbon cycle. 216,217 218 e.g. 219,220 Although biopolymers are often biodegradable, recycling remains a desirable pathway to reduce environmental impact. Some nanocomposite systems, such as those incorporating clay or metallic fillers, demonstrate good recyclability and reuse potential. 221 2 2 2 λ 2 S. aureus E. coli S. aureus E. coli The use of green, and available materials, easy synthetic processes, simple extraction method, eco-friendly protocols, high removal efficiency, and noticeable antibacterial properties are advantageous to work. 3 211 9. Conclusions Polysaccharide-based biopolymer–nanoparticle composites hold significant promise as multifunctional materials for antimicrobial applications. However, despite their inherent biocompatibility and biodegradability, emerging evidence indicates that their toxicity profiles can vary widely depending on synthesis parameters and environmental context. This underscores the necessity of conducting case-specific safety evaluations. Moreover, regulatory hurdles remain a major barrier to clinical and commercial deployment, primarily due to the absence of standardized evaluation protocols and long-term performance data. To fully realize the potential of these materials, future research should prioritize the development of green synthesis routes, robust toxicity assessment frameworks, and stimuli-responsive systems with tunable degradation. Interdisciplinary efforts among researchers, toxicologists, and regulators will be essential to bridge existing gaps and facilitate the safe, scalable, and responsible integration of these composites into biomedical, food, and environmental applications. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in optimizing large-scale production, ensuring consistent nanoparticle dispersion within biopolymer matrices, and assessing long-term biocompatibility. Additionally, addressing concerns regarding nanoparticle toxicity and achieving regulatory approvals are critical steps before their widespread application in medical and food-related fields. Future research should focus on developing scalable and cost-effective green synthesis strategies while ensuring the safety and stability of biopolymer–nanoparticle composites. Advances in nanotechnology, such as the design of hybrid nanostructures with controlled release mechanisms, could further enhance the functionality of these materials. Moreover, exploring new bio-based reducing agents and crosslinking techniques may lead to improved mechanical and barrier properties. Overall, the synergy between biopolymers and nanoparticles presents promising opportunities for next-generation materials with enhanced performance in diverse applications. Sustained interdisciplinary collaboration among materials scientists, chemists, biotechnologists, and regulatory experts will be essential in unlocking the full potential of these innovative composites.
