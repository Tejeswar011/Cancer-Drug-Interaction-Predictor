Even with recent decades of research progress in AML, the exact etiology of this deadly disease is still not fully understood, with recent advancements in sequencing technologies highlighting the role of a growing number of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are intimately associated with AML leukemogenesis. These ncRNAs have been found to have a significant role in leukemia-related cellular processes such as cell division, proliferation, and death. A few of these non-coding RNAs exhibit potential as prognostic biomarkers. The three main groups of ncRNAs that contribute unique activities, especially in cancer, are microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs). Their existence or altered expression levels frequently offer vital information on the diagnosis, course of treatment, and follow-up of cancer patients. The identification of ncRNAs has opened up new avenues for the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of acute myeloid leukemia. In order to provide a clear understanding of the significant influence that lncRNAs have on prognostic predictions and diagnostic accuracy in AML, this review aims to provide a comprehensive and insightful understanding of how these molecules actively participate in the complex landscape of the disease. non-coding RNA (ncRNAs) long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) circular (circ) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) Intramural Research Grant from SGPGIMS A-13-PGI/IMP/88/2023 The authors declare that financial support was received for the research of this article.

Introduction AML has undergone significant changes over time. Previously considered to be a single type of acute leukemia, AML has transformed into a diverse group of subtypes, each with unique molecular and pathophysiologic characteristics [ 1 Figure 1 1 2 3 There are just a few AML cases where specific factors, including prior chemotherapy treatments or chemical exposure, have been identified. However, genetic abnormalities, such as single gene mutations or chromosomal abnormalities, are thought to be the cause of most AML cases. There is no apparent connection between the origins of these genetic changes and any extrinsic causal factors, which frequently serve as the leading causes of AML development [ 4 Table 1 2. Current Methods for Identification of ncRNAs Numerous ncRNAs are produced and released by malignant cells and are found in biological fluids like urine or blood. Their existence or changed expression levels frequently offer vital information on the diagnosis, course of treatment, and follow-up of cancer patients [ 5 Currently, RNA sequencing, microarrays, and qRT-PCR are the primary techniques used to identify and measure ncRNA biomarkers in biopsies. However, until these methods can be easily incorporated into clinical practice, they frequently need to undergo significant optimization. Therefore, the development of a quick, standardized, and clinically useful technique is urgently needed in order to help move ncRNA profiling from bench-top research to real-world bedside applications. Bloomfield et al. developed a probe assay based on the nCounter platform ( nSolver Analysis Software, version 4.0 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 8 3. Role of lncRNAs and Cancer 3.1. Overview of lncRNAs and Their Classification Only three percent of the human genome ultimately produces mRNAs, which code for proteins. It is well established that merely 2% of the human genome is responsible for encoding proteins. In contrast, approximately 70–90% undergo transcription, producing an enormous number of transcripts that belong to the non-coding part of the genome [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 19 23 3.2. Molecular Function of lncRNAs Uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid progenitors is a common phenomenon in acute myeloid leukemia that creates a block in the differentiation stages. The hallmark of AML disease is the differentiation block, leading to the accumulation of immature myeloblasts [ 19 24 25 25 Additionally, the nuclear localization of LONA exhibits an inverse correlation with NPM1 protein localization [ 25 26 27 LncRNA also plays a role in developing drug resistance; for example, the lncRNA DANCER has been recognized to confer resistance to the conventional drug regimen cytarabine (Ara-C) in AML cell lines [ 28 29 The lncRNA XIST, previously identified as an initial long non-coding RNA, demonstrated as a miR-29a sponge and thus modulated the suppression of the oncogene MYC [ 30 31 32 33 32 On the other hand, ncRNAs that exhibit tumor-suppressive characteristics serve as protectors of genomic stability by impeding excessive cell division and facilitating the restoration of DNA damage [ 33 LncRNA NR-104098 is downregulated in AML cells following ATRA-induced differentiation [ 34 35 36 37 37 Increased expression of lncRNA has been associated with an adverse prognosis in AML. PANDAR exhibits increased expression levels in AML patients compared to healthy controls. ROC analysis demonstrated that the PANDAR expression level could serve as a diagnostic biomarker, which can distinguish AML patients from healthy controls [ 38 39 40 Apart from this, researchers also methodically found lncRNAs in specific leukemia variations, including childhood MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and demonstrated their association with many target protein-coding genes [ 41 42 43 42 LncRNAs are essential for controlling multiple aspects of AML cell activity, such as proliferation regulation, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis initiation. One such instance is the lncRNA PVT1 [ 44 45 46 47 HOTAIRM1, a myeloid-specific lncRNA located between HOXA1 and HOXA2, regulates myeloid maturation by modulating integrin genes such as CD49d and CD11c. Its downregulation impairs ATRA-induced granulocyte differentiation [ 48 49 Nevertheless, additional research is required to completely clarify the degree of HOTAIRM1′s regulatory impact on nearby genes. The complex role that HOTAIRM1 plays in myeloid differentiation pathways underscores its potential importance as a molecular regulator of AML. Table 2 Figure 2 4. Role of circRNAs in AML A class of ncRNAs known as circRNAs is distinguished by its circular structure. The circRNAs create closed circular RNA molecules because they lack separate 3′ and 5′ ends, in contrast to linear RNAs. circRNA and lncRNA, having common properties such as being non-coding and highly conserved and having a long life span, also share common functions like serving as a sponge for miRNA [ 97 98 98 Since it was initially noticed in viroids, this unusual circular arrangement is a characteristic shared by all eukaryotic cells. It is becoming increasingly evident that circRNAs regulate gene expression and impact many facets of leukemogenesis, including adhesion, proliferation, cell cycle changes, and apoptosis [ 99 100 101 102 103 103 In a recent study, the bone marrow of AML patients compared to the bone marrow of healthy controls demonstrated an increase in circ-vim expression using RT-qPCR. The authors of this study suggested the critical role of Circ-Vim as a tumor promoter based on their findings [ 104 Foxo3 105 106 107 108 In one study, has_circ_0012152 was observed with an increased expression level in AML patients compared with ALL patients [ 109 110 110 111 111 112 113 114 115 115 116 Additionally, circ_0000370 expression was shown to be higher among AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutations than in FLT3 wild-type (WT) patients, and this elevated expression was linked to a worse prognosis. The study additionally demonstrated a positive association between circ_0000370 expression and FLT3-ITD expression. Furthermore, the downregulation of circ_0000370 expression was seen following the injection of quizartinib, an inhibitor of FLT3 [ 116 116 Table 3 5. Role of miRNAs in AML Extensive profiling and functional studies have shed light on the sensitive regulatory role performed by miRNAs in hematopoiesis. In the past decade, the role of miRNAs in AML has been studied very exhaustively. However, there is less literature available on the other two ncRNAs (lncRNA and circRNA). That is why the primary focus of this review is to investigate lncRNA and circRNA. At the same time, we would like to discuss the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of AML. miRNAs play a critical regulatory role through various means, including epigenetic alterations, copy number alterations, aberrant targeting of the promoter region, and alterations in the vicinity of oncogenic genomic regions due to chromosomal rearrangements. It has been recently observed that lncRNAs and circRNAs in AML can modulate the function of specific miRNAs and promote the initiation, maintenance, and progression of leukemogenesis [ 120 121 122 123 120 124 A prevalent issue in AML known as chemoresistance has been connected to miRNAs. These miRNAs influence apoptosis, the cell cycle, and the function of specific proteins, such as ATP-binding cassette transporters, that aid cells in discharging chemotherapy medicines, among other mechanisms that contribute to resistance. Li and colleagues found that, in comparison to normal leukemia cells (K562 cells), miR-181a was less active in a subset of leukemia cells (K562/A02 cells) that were resistant to doxorubicin [ 125 126 AML is diagnosed chiefly using the widely accepted molecular and cytogenetic criteria published by the WHO in 2016. Notably, the complex association these criteria uncover between AML subtypes and unique miRNA signatures correlated with each further emphasizes the importance of these criteria. There is intrinsic variation in AML when it comes to miRNA expression profiles. Among various AML subtypes, miRNAs frequently have distinct signatures that differentiate them from one another [ 120 Table 4 6. Interplay and Crosstalk Among ncRNA Classes in AML Pathogenesis The complex pathogenesis of AML is increasingly recognized to involve intricate regulatory networks governed by diverse classes of ncRNAs, including lncRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs. Rather than acting in isolation, these ncRNAs frequently engage in dynamic crosstalk, forming competing ceRNA networks that modulate gene expression and cellular behaviors relevant to leukemogenesis [ 144 120 6.1. lncRNA-miRNA Interaction Recent research has shown that the aberrant expression of circular and lncRNAs in AML may alter the roles of certain miRNAs, aiding in the start, upkeep, and progression and development of leukemogenesis. Several lncRNAs function like molecular sponges for miRNAs, sequestering them away from their target mRNAs [ 97 145 30 146 6.2. CircRNA-miRNa-mRNA Axis Emerging evidence suggests that lncRNAs and circRNAs can regulate each other’s expression or stability through shared miRNA response elements (MREs) [ 147 148 120 64 118 119 149 7. LncRNAs: Emerging Clinical Utility lncRNAs are gaining attention for their important ability to regulate gene expression via several means, like chromatin remodeling, ceRNA activity, and scaffold functions [ 150 151 49 29 91 92 93 152 153 The role of miRNAs has been extensively investigated in AML for their role in leukemogenesis, prognosis, and therapy resistance [ 154 155 124 156 157 158 159 160 124 161 162 8. Conclusions and Future Directions ncRNAs play an important role in development, progression, and drug resistance in hematological malignancies. However, due to the limited number of studies relating to all three ncRNA networks, their application in clinical practice is still at its preliminary stages. The crosstalk between different ncRNA classes—especially lncRNAs, miRNAs, and circRNAs—plays an important role in orchestrating the gene expression pattern underlying AML. These interactions among different class of ncRNAs showed an additional and very important layer of post-transcriptional regulation that contributes to leukemic progression and therapy response. Future research is required that will systematically delineate these interactions diligently and explore them for potential therapeutic targeting in AML. While miRNAs remain the most clinically studied class of ncRNAs in AML, lncRNAs are rapidly gaining traction, especially in terms of prognostic potential and therapy resistance mechanisms. circRNAs also offer exciting possibilities due to their stability and specificity, but functional validation is still at the early stage. Future studies that will integrate multi-omics, single-cell sequencing, and ncRNA-targeted therapeutics are essential to explore the full therapeutic potential of these RNA species in AML. With miRNAs, this approach is the most sophisticated and may be applied in two different ways [ 163 164 165 166 131 Additionally, medication resistance has been linked to miR-181b downregulation in AML patients [ 167 168 169 170 In conclusion, ncRNAs regulate complex regulatory networks that play a key regulatory role in the pathophysiology of acute myeloid leukemia. Several ncRNA expressions have been reported with diagnostic and prognostic potential, supporting clinicians in subtype categorization, prognosis evaluation, and drug therapy response prediction. Despite a lot of research, the mechanisms behind the regulatory role of miRNAs in AML pathogenesis are still intricate and multi-dimensional due to the wide spectrum of gene expression patterns. LncRNAs and cirRNAs have gained more attention in past years. Targeting ncRNAs for therapeutic targets in AML appears increasingly intriguing as our current understanding of these multi-dynamic interactions grows, opening the door to more efficient and focused treatment approaches down the road. Recent research has made it clear that the abnormal expression of circular and lncRNAs in AML may alter the roles of particular miRNAs, aiding in the start, upkeep, and progression of leukemogenesis. The competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) hypothesis was put forth by Salmena et al. in 2011, indicating that lncRNAs bind to endogenous miRNAs in AML in a competitive manner [ 120 120 64 118 119 9. Concluding Remarks ncRNAs play a critical role in development, progression, and drug resistance in hematological malignancies. However, due to the limited number of studies relating to all three ncRNA networks, their application in clinical practice is still at its early stages. Future developments for ncRNAs in AML therapy are promising, with a focus on modulating their expression as specific targets for therapeutic interventions. Novel therapeutic approaches involving the direct manipulation of ncRNAs are expected to emerge as our comprehension of the roles of ncRNAs in leukemia deepens, opening up new possibilities for the development of efficient and tailored AML therapeutics.

The spongy tissue found inside bones is called bone marrow, and it is here that blood cells are produced. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are found in the red marrow, where they undergo distinct progenitor stages before differentiating into red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. AML begins when a single, immature white blood cell known as a “blast” has several alterations that enable unchecked cell division. Figure 2 LncRNA-mediated diverse regulatory function in AML. This schematic diagram illustrates the diverse functioning of lncRNAs and their influence on regulation. The dysregulation of these ncRNAs can affect oncogene or tumor suppressor gene expression, ultimately contributing to leukemogenesis and cancer progression (lncRNAs mentioned here discussed in the main text). ncrna-11-00070-t001_Table 1 Table 1 WHO classification of acute myeloid leukemia. Group Number AML Type Major Clinical Characteristics Commonly Implicated Genes 1 AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities Distinct genetic alterations. FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, RUNX1, etc. Specific implications for treatment. Varied prognosis. 2 AML with myelodysplasia-related changes Overlapping features with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). TP53, ASXL1, EZH2, etc. Impacts on therapy choices. 3 Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms Arises as a result of prior cancer treatments. MLL rearrangements, TP53, etc. Special considerations in diagnosis and therapy. 4 AML not otherwise specified Broad category encompassing AML cases without specific features. Various gene mutations Diagnosis and treatment are more generalized. Variable clinical presentations. 5 Myeloid sarcoma Manifests as extramedullary tumors in various body tissues. No single common gene implicated Diverse symptoms depending on the location of the tumors. Clinical complexity due to tumor heterogeneity. 6 Myeloid proliferations related to Down Associated with individuals with Down syndrome. GATA1 mutations Diagnosis and treatment tailored to this patient group. ncrna-11-00070-t002_Table 2 Table 2 List of lncRNAs identified in acute myeloid leukemia.
