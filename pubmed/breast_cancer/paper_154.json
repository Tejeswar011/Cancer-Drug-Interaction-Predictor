To date, no cure is available for the treatment of infertility in Turner syndrome patients with 45,XO. Results Here, we report an organoid approach for generating human germline stem cells and their somatic niche cells in the Turner syndrome. The niche provides an appropriate microenvironment for germline fate in the organoids. Single-cell transcriptomics reveals the dynamics of germline development from iPSCs to germline stem cells, together with their somatic niche. The germline stem cells follow a successive trajectory of four developmental states with featured molecular events, which determine the developmental fate of the germline stem cells. Notably, we have identified the key factor E2F1 from the germline trajectory to regulate the germline stemness fate. E2F1 knockout impairs the specification of the germline stem cells in 45,XO organoids. Remarkably, E2F1 acts as a key fate regulator by activating the transcription of germline factor TFAP2C through binding to and activating its promoter. Importantly, transcriptional regulation of E2F1 creates a positive-feedback loop of E2F1-TFAP2C-SOX17, which contributes to the fate of the germline stem cells, hPGCLCs. Conclusion This study revealed a successive development trajectory of germline stem cells and identified E2F1 and related positive-feedback loop of E2F1-TFAP2C-SOX17 to control the fate of germline stem cells, hPGCLCs, offering a foundation for understanding and reconstituting germline fate in vitro in Turner syndrome patients with 45,XO.

As the first pluripotent germline stem cells to emerge during early embryonic development, human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) carry all the genetic information about both health and disease and transmit it to subsequent generations [ 13 14 15 16 By in vitro induction, hPGC-like cells (hPGCLCs) were generated from embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) under defined conditions [ 17 19 20 18 19 17 14 20 21 23 Recent studies have revealed epigenetic and signaling mechanisms in regulating human germline fate. For example, m⁶A modifications were found to restrict hPGCLC induction through an m 6 24 25 26 Here, we set out to explore technology and underlying mechanisms for inducing iPSCs derived from patients with Turner syndrome of 45,XO into hPGCLCs under defined conditions via an organoid culture. By single-cell transcriptomics of induced 45,XO organoids, we revealed four developmental states of hPGCLCs and trajectories underlying germline fate. Somatic niche cell types were also identified in the organoids, which provided an appropriate niche for hPGCLC development. We further identified the transcription factor E2F1 as the key regulator of hPGC fate by activating TFAP2C transcription. Notably, we found a previously unrecognized positive feedback loop of E2F1-TFAP2C-SOX17 through transcriptionally controlled expression of these regulators respectively, which contributes to the specification of hPGCLCs. These findings provide a foundation for understanding and reconstituting germline development in vitro in patients with 45,XO Turner syndrome.

Plasmid constructs For construction of E2F1 knockout XO hiPSCs, gRNAs targeting the E2F1 http://www.genome-engineering.org/crispr/ TFAP2C E2F1 E2F1 SOX17 TFAP2C SOX17 Organoid generation and hPGCLC induction Induction was performed as previously described, with modifications [ 17 18 5 ™ l 4 Cell karyotype analysis First, 45,XO-hiPSCs were treated with 10 μg/mL Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) for 24 h. After 0.1 μg/mL colchicine was added, the cells were cultured for 2 h. Then, the cells were dissociated with TrypLE ™ Immunofluorescence analysis Organoids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. After washing and permeabilization for 30 min with PBST (1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% BSA in PBS) at room temperature, the samples were blocked in 5% BSA in PBS at 4 °C overnight and then incubated with primary antibodies in 5% BSA in PBS at 4 °C overnight. The samples were washed three times with 0.1% BSA in PBS and incubated with the corresponding secondary antibodies and DAPI at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. After washing three times, images were captured with a confocal microscope (Leica, SP8) and processed with Leica software. The primary and secondary antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Cell culture, transfection and dual-luciferase reporter assays 45,XO hiPSCs (derived from amniocytes at 20 weeks) were provided by Professor Duanqing Pei [ 27 ™ 28 Western blot analysis Total protein was extracted from the cells by lysis buffer, separated via 12% SDS‒PAGE and subsequently transferred to PVDF membranes. After that, the PVDF membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk for at least 30 min and incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution in 5% BSA) at 4 °C overnight. After washing three times, the cells were incubated with an HRP-labeled secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution in 5% nonfat milk) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the signals were detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit. Construction of a single-cell cDNA library Chromium single-cell 3′ reagent kits V3 (10X Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) were used for scRNA-seq library preparation according to the manufacturer’s protocols. A single-cell suspension of organoids was loaded into a Chromium Controller (10X Genomics) to form single-cell GEMs (Gel Bead-in-Emulsion), which were generated by the addition of a bead with a cell barcode and a cell in every droplet. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT‒PCR) was performed on the individual GEMs, and synthetic cDNAs with a specific cell barcode were mixed for amplification. The cDNA library was subsequently prepared based on the manufacturer’s instructions (10X Genomics). Sequencing was performed on a BGISEQ-500 (BGI, Shenzhen, China). Single-cell transcriptomics First, the raw data were demultiplexed, aligned, and counted. After quality control and filtering of the raw data, Seurat (Seurat 3.0.2) and Doublet detection (Doublet detection 3.0) were used to calculate subsets of the dataset that showed high intercell differences. In this experiment, the 2000 genes with the highest degree of variation were selected for downstream analysis. Single-cell FASTQ sequencing reads for each sample were processed using the Cell Ranger Single-cell Software Suite (v3.1.0) available on the 10X Genomics website and converted into a digital gene expression matrix by mapping the data onto the human genome [ 29 30 31 RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‒qPCR) FastPure Cell/Tissue Total RNA Isolation Kits (Vazyme, Nanjing, China) were used to perform RNA extraction according to the manufacturer’s protocols. In brief, organoids were lysed with Buffer RL1 containing β-mercaptoethanol, after which the lysates were transferred to gDNA-filter columns and spun to remove DNA. The filtered liquor was subsequently transferred to RNAPure filter columns and spun to collect RNA. After that, cDNAs were obtained by MMLV reverse transcription. For RT‒qPCR, 2X Taq Pro Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix was used to perform RT‒qPCR on a QTRAP mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, AB3200). GAPDH was used as an internal control. The results are expressed as the means ± SDs from three independent experiments. The primers used are shown in Supplementary Table S2. Construction of E2F1 knockout 45,XO hiPSCs A total of 20 μg of the E2F1 sgRNA-pX330 vector was electroporated into 45,XO hiPSCs by a BEX electroporator (CUY21 EDIT II). The parameters were PpV:200 V, Pp on: 5 ms, Pp off: 50 ms; Pd V: 25 V, Pd on: 50 ms, Pd off: 50 ms, cycle: 5, Capacitance (μF): 940. Then, the cells were seeded into Matrigel-coated 6-well plates, passaged, and induced after 3 or 4 days. Genomic DNA was extracted from the cells, and PCR amplification and sequencing of sgRNA-targeted sites were subsequently performed to identify the gene editing types. Cell cytometry Organoids containing hPGCLCs were washed in PBS and dissociated with 0.1% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C. The dissociated cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-INTEGRINα6 and Alexa Fluor 700-conjugated-conjugated anti-EpCAM (1:40 in 0.1% BSA in PBS) at 4 °C in the dark for 30 min. Finally, the cell suspension was analyzed via a CytoFLEX (Life Sciences, Beckman Coulter). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP assays) Organoids containing hPGCLCs were washed in PBS and dissociated with 0.1% trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C. The dissociated cells were cross-linked for 15 min at room temperature with 1% formaldehyde and then released with 0.125 M glycine. After the cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES–KOH pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate) for 10 min at 4 °C. Then, the genomic DNA was sonicated into 100 bp-500 bp fragments. After that, 20 μg of DNA was incubated with beads conjugated with an anti-E2F1 antibody or IgG at 4 °C overnight. After washing, genomic DNA was extracted with elution buffer (0.1 M NaHCO 3 TFAP2C E2F1 Statistical analysis All the data are presented as the means ± standard errors of the means from three independent experiments. Statistical comparisons were made using Student’s t P Results Organoids of 45,XO reveal hPGCLCs and their somatic niche To obtain the organoids, 45,XO hiPSCs were first induced into incipient mesoderm-like cells (iMeLCs), which were further induced with defined factors by 3D culture at high density in U-bottom low-cell binding 96-well plates (Fig. 1 18 1 1 1 Fig. 1 Characterization of 45,XO organoids. a b c d e f g-h g h To identify the cell types of the organoids, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on day 8 organoids using 10 × Genomics and benchmarked the transcriptomes against the reference human genome hg19. After filtering, we obtained more than 52,600 reads for each cell, 4977 median detected genes per cell, and 19,925 median unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) (Supplementary Table S3 and S4). After discarding poor-quality cells, more than 12,500 cells remained for clustering and typing. To identify cell types, we employed Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and identified 10 major cell clusters based on known marker genes, namely, hPGCLCs, late hPGCLCs, pre-Sertoli cells, pre-Lydig cells, pregranulosa cells, stroma cells, endothelial cells, and epithelial cells (Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Identification of cell clusters in 45,XO organoids at single-cell resolution. a b c d UMAP mapping of hPGCLC marker expression showed that the representative markers SOX17, BLIMP1, TFAP2C, and CD38 were expressed in cluster 4, indicating that the cluster was composed of hPGCLCs (Fig. 2 2 Considering the important roles of the somatic niche in germline cell development [ 14 3 3 32 33 + 3 + + + Fig. 3 Identification of supporting cell types in 45,XO organoids at single-cell resolution. a b c d e Four developmental states and lineages of hPGCLCs To identify the developmental states and trajectories of the hPGCLCs, we performed reclustering analysis on the hPGCLC cluster. Three distinct subpopulations were observed, which represented three developmental states: state 0, state 1, and state 2 (Fig. 4 4 4 4 4 Fig. 4 Subpopulations and developmental trajectory of hPGCLCs. a b c d f Considering the relationship of cluster 9 (late hPGCLCs) with cluster 4 (hPGCLCs), we next sought to reconstruct their developmental trajectory together. Pseudotime analysis confirmed that the state of cluster 9 was downstream of the trajectory (Fig. 5 5 5 5 Fig. 5 Identification of late hPGCLCs. a b c P d E2F1 is the key regulator of hPGCLC specification As a characteristic marker of state 2 in hPGCLCs, the transcription factor E2F1 is supposed to be important for hPGCLC development.

To establish a base for overcoming this obstacle, in the present study, we generated hPGCLCs and their niche cells by modeling the organoids derived from 45,XO hiPSCs. Somatic niche development in the organoids provided a guide and support for hPGCLC specification. Single-cell transcriptomics of 45,XO organoids revealed the developmental trajectories underlying germline fate. We identified 4 developmental states—state 0, state 1, state 2, and the late state—of hPGCLCs, each of which has characteristic molecular activities. Notably, we found a key marker, E2F1, which is involved in the cell cycle and DNA replication, in state 2. E2F1 knockout impaired the specification of hPGCLCs in 45,XO organoids. Remarkably, the transcription factor E2F1 acted as the key regulator of hPGCLC fate by activating the transcription of TFAP2C, a core regulator of the hPGCs. In addition, we found the E2F1-TFAP2C-SOX17 positive feedback loop of transcriptional regulation in the specification of hPGCLCs. Together, these findings provide a foundation for understanding and reconstituting germline development in vitro in patients with the 45,XO Turner syndrome. The specification mechanisms of hPGCs in vivo have not been elucidated well. A critical point is that hPGCs develop beginning at embryonic day 12 in vivo [ 34 17 19 17 18 34 35 36 As a kind of germline stem cells, hPGC specification proceeds toward germline fate, in addition to the maintenance of stemness. However, cascade regulation mechanism underlying germline fate remains elusive. In this study, we have demonstrated a previously unrecognized positive feedback loop among E2F1, TFAP2C, and SOX17, which enhanced their regulatory activity to promote the development of germline stem cells and suppress the differentiation of somatic cells. In the loop, E2F1 is a key factor to engage the signal amplification through activation of TFAP2C 37 38 39 40 41 42 E2F1 Induction of hPGCLC by the organoids from 45,XO iPSCs and an understanding of relevant germline development are the first steps in the treatment of infertility in females with Turner syndrome. Immediately following hPGCLC induction from somatic cells via iPSCs, we are faced with the challenge of in vitro gametogenesis from hPGCLCs, although prospermatogonia or oogonia have been induced by hPGCLC co-culture with mouse somatic cells from fetal gonads [ 21 23 Conclusions This study revealed a successive development trajectory of the germline stem cells, hPGCLCs, found that transcription factor E2F1 regulates germline-stem cell fate by activating the mesoderm regulator TFAP2C, and demonstrated that the positive-feedback loop of E2F1-TFAP2C-SOX17 is important in control of the specification of hPGCLCs in human Turner syndrome. These findings provide a foundation for understanding and reconstituting germline fate in vitro in Turner syndrome patients with 45,XO. Supplementary Information  Additional file 1.
