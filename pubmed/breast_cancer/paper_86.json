Autophagy, a lysosome-dependent degradation process, is typically regarded as a survival mechanism. However, excessive degradation of ferritin may indirectly lead to Fe²⁺ accumulation, thereby facilitating ferroptosis. In this study, we reveal for the first time the existence of a TRIM39-RNF168 ubiquitination axis in the TNBC model that targets autophagy-dependent ferroptosis in TNBC cells. The high expression of TRIM39 in TNBC cells confers resistance to ferroptosis and enhances cell survival. Regulation of the TRIM39-RNF168 axis, achieved by knocking down TRIM39 or RNF168, can activate autophagy-coupled ferroptosis in TNBC cells. The activated autophagy-ferroptosis pathway effectively suppresses TNBC progression in vivo, presenting a promising potential therapeutic approach.

Its significant heterogeneity and limited therapeutic targets have hindered the development of effective targeted therapies, leaving TNBC behind other breast cancer subtypes in therapeutic advancements. Current treatment options are mainly restricted to surgery, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, which often yield suboptimal outcomes. As a result, TNBC has the highest cancer-related mortality rate, particularly among Asian women 1 2 3 4 TRIM39, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) family, comprises a RING finger domain, one B-box type 1, one B-box type 2, and a coiled-coil region 5 6 7 8 9 5 10 9 6 RNF168, another RING finger protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, plays a pivotal role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair through its unique ability to form atypical K63-linked polyubiquitin chains 11 12 13 14 15 This study elucidates that TRIM39, highly expressed in various TNBC model cells, exerts positive regulation on RNF168 through deubiquitination, thereby enhancing the resistance of tumor cells to Regulated Cell Death (RCD). Inhibition of the TRIM39-RNF168 axis in vitro effectively activates autophagy and ferroptosis events in TNBC cells, significantly suppressing the proliferation and migration capabilities of tumor cells. There exists a mutual activation relationship between autophagy and ferroptosis dependent on the deficiency of the TRIM39-RNF168 axis. TRIM39-RNF168 deficiency-dependent activation of autophagy-ferroptosis in vivo effectively inhibits tumor growth, highlighting its potential as a novel therapeutic strategy for TNBC. Results TRIM39 and RNF168 are positively correlated with TNBC progression Analysis of clinical TNBC samples revealed a significant difference in the expression levels of RNF168 between tumor and adjacent normal tissues (Fig. 1A 1B 1C Fig. 1 TRIM39 and RNF168 are positively correlated at the protein level and may have a potential association with TNBC progression. A B C D E F G GSE45827 H GSE45827 I J P Based on this hypothesis, we screened proteins related to RNF168 (Fig. 1D 9 16 17 1E 1F GSE45827 1G 1H Immunohistochemical staining of both tumor and adjacent normal tissues provided a visual representation of the enrichment of RNF168 and TRIM39 in tumor cells (Fig. 1I 1J TRIM39 positively regulates RNF168 levels through deubiquitination To further investigate the mechanism linking TRIM39 and RNF168, we selected various breast cancer cell lines for in vitro experimentation. We analyzed TRIM39 and RNF168 expression levels in both normal control cells (MCF-10A) and breast cancer model cells. Consistent with our prior bioinformatic analyses, TRIM39 and RNF168 exhibited high heterogeneity in TNBC cells. Expression levels in BT549 were nearly identical to those in normal controls, while HCC1937, MDA-MB-157, and MDA-MB-231 cells showed a progressive increase. Additionally, a positive correlation between TRIM39 and RNF168 was observed, as the ranking of TRIM39 expression from low to high corresponded with RNF168 expression levels (Fig. 2A Fig. 2 TRIM39 deubiquitinates RNF168, protecting it from proteasomal degradation. A B C D n E F G n H I J K n L n M P We performed knockdown experiments in MDA-MB-157 and MDA-MB-231 cells, which had the highest TRIM39 expression. Two shRNAs, shTRIM39-1 and shTRIM39-2, were designed to maximize knockdown efficiency. WB analysis revealed that shTRIM39-2 was more effective at reducing TRIM39 expression (Fig. 2B 2C 2D To determine whether TRIM39 regulates RNF168 directly or indirectly, we conducted reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments. RNF168 was detected in the eluate of TRIM39 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2E 2F 2G TRIM39 is an intriguing protein, as most of its homologs are E3 ubiquitin ligases; however, several studies have shown that TRIM39 functions as a deubiquitinase. Based on this, we treated cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 after TRIM39 knockdown. WB analysis indicated that MG132 treatment partially restored RNF168 levels, suggesting that TRIM39 knockdown-induced RNF168 reduction is linked to the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway (Fig. 2H 2I 2J To investigate the relationship between RNF168 deubiquitination and TRIM39 activity, we introduced a catalytically inactive Flag-tagged TRIM39-C44A mutant. Co-IP experiments revealed that the C44A mutant was unable to deubiquitinate Myc-tagged RNF168 (Fig. 2K 2L Finally, we expressed wild-type ubiquitin and Lys48-resistant ubiquitin (Lys48R) in TRIM39 knockdown and control HEK293T cells. WB analysis revealed that RNF168 was degraded in the presence of wild-type ubiquitin when TRIM39’s deubiquitination activity was absent. However, Lys48R ubiquitin prevented RNF168 from undergoing proteasome-mediated degradation, regardless of TRIM39 knockdown (Fig. 2M TRIM39 modulates ferroptosis resistance and cell viability in TNBC cells Bioinformatic analysis suggests a potential correlation between RNF168 and ferroptosis, and our previous experiments demonstrate that TRIM39 positively regulates RNF168 via deubiquitination. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer an indirect link between TRIM39 and ferroptosis. To explore this possibility, we conducted WB analysis of ferroptosis-related proteins. Knockdown of TRIM39 led to increased activity of long-chain fatty acid-CoA ligase 4 (ACSL4), which promotes lipid peroxidation during ferroptosis, and a decrease in ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), indicating a shift in iron homeostasis toward free Fe²⁺. In addition, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) levels were reduced, suggesting diminished cellular antioxidant capacity (Fig. 3A Fig. 3 Knockdown of TRIM39 activates ferroptosis in tumor cells. A B C D E F n P P P Next, we measured several biochemical markers associated with ferroptosis, including glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), and Fe²⁺ levels. TRIM39 knockdown resulted in a decrease in GSH, indicative of reduced antioxidant potential, while MDA levels increased, reflecting enhanced lipid peroxidation. Fe²⁺ levels were elevated, suggesting an increase in free iron, which could facilitate Fenton reactions and trigger ferroptosis (Fig. 3B To assess lipid peroxidation levels, we stained cells with the C11 probe, which emits red fluorescence in its reduced state and green fluorescence upon oxidation by ROS. TRIM39 knockdown in MDA-MB-157 and MDA-MB-231 cells resulted in significantly higher ROS levels compared to controls (Fig. 3C Upon treatment with varying concentrations of the ferroptosis activator erastin, TRIM39 knockdown cells exhibited lower survival rates compared to control cells (Fig. 3D Since ferroptosis is often accompanied by mitochondrial damage, we utilized the MitoTracker probe to assess mitochondrial activity in TRIM39 knockdown cells. A reduction in mitochondrial red fluorescence was observed in both MDA-MB-157 and MDA-MB-231 cells following TRIM39 knockdown, indicating mitochondrial loss and suggesting energy deficiency in surviving cells (Fig. 3E 18 S1A S1B The CFDA probe needs to be hydrolyzed within live cells to emit fluorescence. Although CFDA staining is typically employed to assess cell proliferation, in the absence of sufficient time for cell division, the positive rate of CFDA staining effectively reflects cell viability. In our study, after washing away excess dye, fluorescence was observed immediately. The results demonstrated that TRIM39 knockdown significantly reduced the viability of MDA-MB-157 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3F S1C S1D In BT549 and HCC1937 cell lines with inherently low TRIM39 levels, overexpression of TRIM39 (Fig. S1E S1F S1G S1H S1I S2F S2A S2B S2C S2D S2E TRIM39 regulates autophagy in tumor cells Recent studies have increasingly highlighted the link between autophagy and ferroptosis 19 22 Under neutral conditions, LC3 tagged with mRFP-GFP emits both red (mRFP) and green (GFP) fluorescence. However, when autophagosomes fuse with acidic lysosomes to form autolysosomes, GFP fluorescence is quenched in the acidic environment, while mRFP remains stable. Thus, green puncta represent autophagosomes, and red puncta represent both autophagosomes and autolysosomes. Quantitative analysis revealed that TRIM39 knockdown increased the total number of LC3-positive puncta. However, the ratio of mRFP + − + + 4A Fig. 4 TRIM39 negatively regulates autophagy in tumor cells. A B C D E P P P Electron microscopy confirmed these findings, showing a substantial increase in autophagosomes and a significant reduction in autolysosomes in TRIM39 knockdown MDA-MB-157 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4B WB analysis of key autophagy-related proteins contradicted this hypothesis. TRIM39 knockdown led to an increase in ATG7, a protein essential for autophagosome formation, while levels of the autophagy-inhibitory protein p62 were reduced, indicating enhanced autophagic flux (Fig. 4C Additionally, in TRIM39-overexpressing BT549 and HCC1937 cell lines, we observed a reduction in LC3-positive cells, along with a significant increase in the ratio of autolysosomes to autophagosomes (Fig. 4D 4E Conversely, opposing autophagy-related changes were observed in TRIM39 knockdown and TRIM39 overexpression cell lines, indicating that TRIM39 exerts a clear negative regulatory effect on autophagy in TNBC cells. TRIM39-mediated ferroptosis and autophagy exhibit mutual promotion We have established that TRIM39 independently negatively regulates both ferroptosis and autophagy. Therefore, we hypothesized that ferroptosis and autophagy, activated by TRIM39 knockdown, may be interconnected. In BT549 and HCC1937 cell lines overexpressing TRIM39, we introduced the ferroptosis inducer Erastin. WB analysis revealed an increase in the autophagy marker LC3 and a decrease in the negative marker p62 following Erastin treatment (Fig. 5A 5B 5C Fig. 5 Knockdown of TRIM39 activates the mutual promotion between ferroptosis and autophagy. A n B n C D n E n F n G n H n I n P P P Comparing vector control and Erastin-treated groups in BT549 and MDA-MB-231 cells, we observed that Erastin-induced ferroptosis promotes autophagy, and this ferroptosis-dependent autophagy can be suppressed by TRIM39 overexpression. A plausible explanation is that ferroptosis damages organelles, such as mitochondria, triggering autophagy as a feedback mechanism to remove damaged components. TRIM39 overexpression reduces ferroptosis, thereby diminishing the demand for autophagy and leading to reduced autophagic activity through downstream signaling cascades. We further investigated TRIM39’s negative regulation of autophagy by treating MDA-MB-231 cells with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ), where autophagy had been enhanced by TRIM39 knockdown. WB analysis showed a significant increase in p62 levels upon CQ treatment, indicating autophagy inhibition. LC3 expression varied significantly depending on TRIM39 knockdown status (Fig. 5D 5E 5F In addition to pharmacological approaches, we inhibited autophagy by knocking down ATG5, a protein essential for autophagosome formation and LC3 lipidation. ATG5 knockdown reduced LC3 levels and, without simultaneous TRIM39 knockdown, significantly increased p62 levels, indicating reduced autophagic flux (Fig. 5G 5H 5I 5H 5I 5E In summary, TRIM39 knockdown independently activates both ferroptosis and autophagy. Moreover, the ferroptosis and autophagy triggered by TRIM39 knockdown can mutually promote each other, without unilateral dependency. RNF168 knockdown suppresses the proliferative phenotype induced by TRIM39 overexpression in tumor cells TRIM39 is known to positively regulate RNF168 through deubiquitination, while also negatively regulating TNBC tumor cell survival via ferroptosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that RNF168, as a downstream target of TRIM39, may also play a role in regulating ferroptosis in tumor cells, thereby influencing tumor phenotypes. We overexpressed RNF168 in MDA-MB-157 and MDA-MB-231 cells and observed a reduction in the expression of the autophagy-related protein p62, which is negatively associated with autophagy (Fig. S3A S3B 23 24 S3C S3D, E S3F–H To further explore the relationship between TRIM39 and RNF168, we knocked down RNF168 in the TRIM39-overexpressing cells (Fig. 6A 6B, C Fig. 6 Knockdown of TRIM39 synergizes with erastin treatment to promote ferroptosis. A B C D E F G n H I J P P P In ferroptosis-related assays, RNF168 knockdown resulted in a significant increase in ACSL4 expression, while FTH1 and GPX4 levels significantly decreased (Fig. 6D, E 6F To further validate these findings in vivo, we transplanted the treated cells subcutaneously into mice to establish a tumor growth model (Fig. 6G 6H 6I 6J TRIM39 promotes tumorigenesis by enhancing ferroptosis resistance in TNBC cells Previous experiments demonstrated that TRIM39 knockdown induces ferroptosis, reducing tumor cell viability, while TRIM39 overexpression promotes tumor cell proliferation and invasion. Based on these findings, we conducted an in vivo reverse validation to test whether TRIM39 overexpression could maintain its oncogenic effects under ferroptotic stress. This was done by inducing tumorigenic phenotypes through TRIM39 overexpression, followed by ferroptosis induction, to assess whether TRIM39 could still promote tumor growth under ferroptotic pressure (Fig. 7A Fig. 7 Overexpression of TRIM39 renders tumor cells insensitive to ferroptosis. A B C D E F G n H I J P P P Colony formation assays showed that Erastin treatment significantly inhibited the proliferative effects of TRIM39 overexpression (comparison b vs. c, Fig. 7B 7C Similar trends were observed in ferroptosis-related protein levels (Fig. 7D, E 7F The in vivo model confirmed these findings. Mice injected with tumor cells and treated with intraperitoneal injections of Erastin showed significant tumor growth suppression. However, TRIM39 overexpression partially counteracted Erastin’s inhibitory effects, resulting in tumor growth curves similar to those of the control group (Fig. 7G–I Histopathological analysis further supported these observations. The control group displayed sparse cavitation in tumor tissue, while tumors overexpressing TRIM39 were dense and devoid of cavitation. Both groups treated with Erastin showed pronounced cavitation, though the degree of cavitation was slightly reduced in the TRIM39-overexpressing group (Fig. 7J These findings confirm that enhancing TNBC tumor cell resistance to ferroptosis is a key mechanism through which TRIM39 exerts its oncogenic effects (Fig. 8 Fig. 8 Schematic of the TRIM39-RNF168 ubiquitination axis in the TNBC model that targets autophagy-dependent ferroptosis. TRIM39 functions as a deubiquitinase, specifically exhibiting deubiquitinating activity through its interaction with RNF168. Regulation of the TRIM39-RNF168 axis, achieved by knocking down TRIM39 or RNF168, can activate autophagy-coupled ferroptosis in TNBC cells. Discussion Cell death can generally be categorized into accidental cell death (ACD) and programmed cell death (PCD) 25 26 27 28 29 31 Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradation process crucial for determining cell fate under various stress conditions 32 34 35 37 38 40 22 4 In the context of ferroptosis and autophagy, ferroptosis is observed to inhibit cancer cell proliferation and invasion by damaging mitochondria 41 42 43 44 Consequently, the anti-cancer effects associated with TRIM39-RNF168 inhibition are primarily mediated by ferroptosis. However, autophagy plays an essential auxiliary role in the ferroptotic process, as inhibiting autophagy significantly reduces the efficacy of ferroptosis as an anti-cancer mechanism. Thus, in the TRIM39-RNF168-mediated anti-TNBC effect, autophagy and ferroptosis act synergistically, where the combined effect exceeds the sum of their individual contributions (1 + 1 > 2). Our results support the notion that TRIM39 functions as a deubiquitinase, specifically exhibiting deubiquitinating activity through its interaction with RNF168. As a downstream effector of TRIM39, RNF168 is known to promote DNA repair. However, our study reveals its novel role in inhibiting both autophagy and ferroptosis. DNA integrity is closely monitored by various mechanisms, and when irreversible DNA damage occurs, autophagy and ferroptosis are activated. Cancer provides a prominent example where DNA errors persist, yet cells fail to undergo programmed cell death. Our study shows that in TNBC, high TRIM39 expression stabilizes RNF168, creating a false sense of genomic control that allows tumor cells to evade the genetic surveillance self-destruct mechanisms. In conclusion, the TRIM39-RNF168 axis-mediated autophagy-ferroptosis interaction plays a crucial role in regulating TNBC proliferation and migration. Inhibiting TRIM39 or RNF168 could suppress tumor growth by activating both autophagy and ferroptosis, while sensitizing TNBC cells to chemotherapeutic treatments. The regulatory effect on RNF168 is more significant, while the high expression of TRIM39 in TNBC cells shows notable specificity compared to normal cells. Therefore, TRIM39 is suitable as a diagnostic and prognostic marker, whereas RNF168 is more appropriate as a therapeutic target. Targeting the TRIM39-RNF168 axis, in combination with ferroptosis-related chemotherapy, offers the potential to reduce toxicity and enhance therapeutic efficacy. Methods Cell lines and culture HEK293T cells, normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A), and TNBC cell lines (BT549, MDA-MB-157, MDA-MB-231, and HCC1937) were obtained from the Cell Bank/Stem Cell Bank (Shanghai, China). HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). MCF-10A cells were maintained in MEGM Mammary Epithelial Cell Growth Medium (CC-3150, Lonza) supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies). The breast cancer cells were maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium containing 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies) and 10% FBS. All cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO₂. Plasmid construction, transfection, and lentiviral infection The Flag-TRIM39, Flag-TRIM39 (C44A), and Myc-RNF168 plasmids were constructed by inserting the corresponding full-length cDNA sequences of TRIM39 ( NM_172016 NM_152617 For plasmid transfection, cells were seeded in six-well plates and incubated for 24 h. When cells reached 70–80% confluence, transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 3000 (L3000150, Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were cultured in puromycin-containing medium (2 μg/mL) for 3 days to select transfectants, which were then collected for further experiments. Lentiviral packaging was performed by co-transfecting HEK293T cells with psPAX2 and pMD2.G plasmids, along with shTRIM39-pLKO.1-puro or TRIM39-pCDH-puro plasmids. Viral particles were used to infect TNBC cells in the presence of 10 μg/mL Polybrene. Forty-eight hours post-infection, cells were cultured in puromycin-containing medium (2 μg/mL) for 7 days to select for stable transfectants. The surviving cells were collected after selection and used in xenograft tumor experiments following qPCR verification of knockdown/overexpression efficiency. Immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays Cells subjected to different treatments were lysed in NETN buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, pH 8.0) containing Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (78430, Thermo Fisher). Lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz) and specific primary antibodies. After washing three times with NETN buffer, protein complexes bound to A/G agarose beads (20421, Thermo Fisher) were eluted, boiled, and analyzed by immunoblotting. For mass spectrometry, beads were rinsed twice with 150 µl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Subsequently, immunocomplexes were eluted using 2 µl of 1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). Before MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, 1 µl of the eluted solution was combined with 1 µl of matrix solution (0.7 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) in 40% (v/v) acetonitrile/0.1% (v/v) TFA). A 1 µl portion of this mixture was then applied to an AnchorChip target for proteomic analysis by MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics). For ubiquitination assays, cells were co-transfected with Flag-TRIM39, Flag-TRIM39 (C44A), Myc-RNF168, and either HA-Ub-WT, HA-Ub-Lys48-only, or HA-Ub-Lys63-only, and incubated or treated with MG132 for 24 h. Cells were lysed in NETN buffer containing protease inhibitor, and lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-RNF168 or anti-Myc antibodies. Endogenous RNF168 or HA-ubiquitinated Myc-RNF168 was immunoprecipitated, and ubiquitination levels were determined by Western blot. Western blot analysis and antibodies Protein samples were boiled and normalized to equal concentrations in sample loading buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl, 0.4 M DTT, 277 mM 8.0% (w/v) SDS, 6 mM bromophenol blue, and 4.3 M glycerol), separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes using transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, pH 8.3, with 20% methanol (v/v)). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBST at 4 °C overnight, and then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), and band intensities were analyzed with ImageJ software (NIH). Antibodies used for immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were primarily obtained from Proteintech (WuHan, China), including TRIM39 (12757-1-AP), RNF168 (21393-1-AP), GAPDH (60004-1-Ig), ubiquitin (10201-2-AP), Myc-Tag (10828-1-AP), Flag-Tag (20543-1-AP), HA (60004-1-Ig), ACSL4 (81196-1-RR), FTH1 (11682-1-AP), GPX4 (67763-1-Ig), ATG5 (66744-1-Ig), p62 (66184-1-Ig), LC3 (14600-1-AP), and Beclin-1 (10355-1-AP). The LC3B antibody (ab51520) was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), and the Beclin-1 antibody (3738S) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Massachusetts, USA). Clinical samples Clinical specimens were collected from Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, between 2022 and 2024, with informed consent obtained from all patients. The storage, analysis, and disposal of samples were conducted under the guidance of the Ethics Committee of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University Ethics Committee (Y2024-877), as well as have been performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Colony formation assay Treated cells were seeded at a density of 500 cells per well in six-well plates and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS for 2 weeks. Colonies were fixed with methanol for 30 min and stained with 2 mL of 0.1% crystal violet (1 mg/mL), diluted with water, for 3 min. The excess crystal violet was washed off, and images were captured using a digital camera mounted on a stand. Colony count was performed using ImageJ software to quantify the number of colonies in each well. Colonies were confirmed under a microscope at 200× magnification (BDS400, VitalVision), with the requirement that each colony contained more than 50 cells. Transwell migration assay Cells (2 × 10⁴) were seeded into the upper chamber of Transwell inserts (CLS3422, Corning) in serum-free medium, with the lower chamber filled with DMEM containing 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. After 24 h of incubation, adherent cells in the lower chamber were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and stained with 0.1% crystal violet, diluted with water. Migrated cells were visualized under a light microscope at 200× magnification (BDS400, VitalVision), with images captured from three random fields per well. Cell counts were analyzed using ImageJ, and the average across the three fields was calculated to quantify migration. Measurement of iron content, glutathione, and lipid peroxidation levels Relative iron concentration was measured in cell lysates using a commercial Iron Assay Kit (ab83366, Abcam) following the manufacturer’s instructions, and absorbance at 593 nm was recorded immediately using a colorimetric microplate reader (DNM-9606, Drawell). Glutathione (GSH) levels were quantified using a GSH Assay Kit (CS0260, Sigma), with the yellow product (5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid) measured spectrophotometrically at 412 nm. Lipid peroxidation was evaluated by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) levels with a Lipid Peroxidation Assay Kit (ab118970, Abcam), and the absorbance of the MDA-TBA adduct was measured at 532 nm. Molecular probe for imaging CFDA The commercial CFDA fluorescent dye kit (HY-D0938, MCE) was used. After removing the culture medium from the treated TNBC cells, live cell staining with CFDA was performed by incubating the cells with pre-warmed (37 °C) PBS containing 5 μM CFDA at 37 °C for 15 min. Post-incubation, the cells were refreshed with pre-warmed medium, and within 30 min, fluorescence was measured using a fluorescence microscope at 200× magnification (FV3000, Olympus) with excitation at 488 nm. Cells presenting bright green fluorescence were identified as living cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) The intracellular ROS levels were measured using the commercial lipid peroxidation detection probe BODIPY 581/591 C11 (S0043S, Beyotime). Red fluorescence, indicative of the reduced form, was detected with excitation at 581 nm, while the oxidized form was detected via green fluorescence with excitation at 500 nm at 200× magnification (FV3000, Olympus). Xenograft tumor models For subcutaneous xenograft models, treated MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells (2 × 10⁷) were injected into female BALB/c nude mice (6–8 weeks old, 18–20 g, Shanghai Model Organisms Center). Tumor diameters were measured with calipers every 7 days. After 35 days, mice were euthanized under anesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (100 mg/kg), and tumor weights were recorded. All animals received humane care during the study protocol and during euthanasia. Sections were prepared from paraffin-embedded tumor tissues. Erastin treatment commenced 1 week post-cell injection, with daily intraperitoneal injections of 5 mg/kg, while the control group received vehicle (DMSO). Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhongshan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University (2024-135).
