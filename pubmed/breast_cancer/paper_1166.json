Introduction Hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer syndrome has traditionally been the primary criterion for genetic counseling, followed by germline BRCA1/2 (BRCA) 1 BRCA 2 3 4 BRCA 5 6 7 Copy number variations (CNVs), also referred to as large genomic rearrangements (LGRs), such as deletions or duplications larger than 1000 base pairs, have been identified in BRCA 8 BRCA BRCA 6 Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is now a well-established method for comprehensive BRCA indels 9 10 11 10 11 Among various NGS protocols, hybrid capture-based approaches have demonstrated greater reliability for CNV detection compared to amplicon-based PCR protocols. Nonetheless, several BRCA 12 The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of different NGS bioinformatics pipelines to accurately identify and call BRCA Diatech Myriapod ® Finally, a strategy was proposed to improve the interpretation of NGS data for reliable identification of CNVs in FFPE samples in a clinical setting. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design This study was conducted at the Genomics Core Facility, G-STeP, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS. A total of 40 FFPE tumor samples from patients with advanced or relapsed platinum-sensitive OC were selected. All samples were previously screened for BRCA TruSight Oncology 500 High Throughput 13 SOPHiA DDM™ Homologous Recombination Solution Table 1 BRCA To evaluate the performance of BRCA Diatech Myriapod ® 2.2. DNA Extraction For DNA extraction, FFPE tissue samples containing >20% tumor cells and <10% necrosis, as determined by the local pathologist, were selected. DNA was extracted using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA/RNA FFPE Kit on the EZ2 Connect workstation (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA quantity and quality were assessed using the Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). 2.3. NGS Methods Used for CNV Calling The TSO500HT indels 13 CNV calling for the TSO500HT BRCA SOPHiA DDM™ HRD indels BRCA SOPHiA DDM™ BRCA 2.4. BRCA Testing with Myriapod ® The Myriapod ® indels BRCA CNV analysis was performed using the Myriapod NGS With the aim of evaluating the performance of the CNV detection algorithm of the Myriapod ® BRCA BRCA BRCA BRCA 2.5. Re-Evaluation of CNV Calling Using Diatech Software by Simulating a Diagnostic Setting To further evaluate the CNV calling performance of the Myriapod ® Myriapod ® 2.6. Read Coverage and Comparative Analyses Sequencing performance was evaluated across the 4 NGS runs, with the aim of optimizing CNV calling. Key quality metrics assessed included mean coverage, percentage of uniformity, and on-target reads. Results were analyzed separately for each sequencing run and summarized as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) and confidence intervals, across all samples within each run. In parallel with the assessment of sequencing quality, statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate CNV calling performance using the Myriapod ® Myriapod ® Myriapod ® TSO500HT SOPHiA DDM™ HRD Solution 2.7. Data Analysis Sequencing data were processed and interpreted using the Myriapod ® indels 3.

Myriapod ® 3.1.1. BRCA CNV-Negative Samples Based on the graphical visualization and interpretation of CNV status, out of the 23 CNV-negative samples, 16 could be considered negative for both genes. Four samples were CNV-negative for BRCA2 BRCA1 BRCA1 BRCA2 BRCA2 BRCA1 BRCA1 BRCA2 According to the CNV calling performed by the Myriapod ® CNV Not Positive CNV Not Positive BRCA2 Potential CNV BRCA1 Potential CNV Potential CNV BRCA2 CNV Not Positive BRCA1 The final interpretation and reporting of CNV status, based on both graphical visualization and software-based CNV calling, led to the classification of 18 samples as negative BRCA Potential CNV BRCA1 Inconclusive BRCA2 BRCA2 Table 2 Considering the final interpretation and reporting of CNV results, out of the 23 negative samples, 18 would be considered completely negative, and 5 would be referred for confirmatory testing. 3.1.2. BRCA CNV-Positive Samples Based on graphical visualization and interpretation of CNV status, among the 17 CNV-positive samples, 10 were confirmed as Positive BRCA2 Potential CNV BRCA1 BRCA1 Inconclusive BRCA2 BRCA1 Inconclusive BRCA2 BRCA1 BRCA2 failed In nine samples, the expected CNV was correctly identified. Of these, five also showed a Potential CNV Potential CNV The final interpretation and reporting of CNV status, integrating graphical visualization with software-based calling, resulted in 13 samples being classified as definitively CNV-positive. Two samples were negative for the expected CNV but showed inconclusive findings in other gene. One sample was interpreted as Inconclusive failed Table 2 Considering the final interpretation and reporting of CNV results, out of the 17 positive samples, 13 would be considered Positive Negative Inconclusive. Overall, under these analytical conditions, the Myriapod ® Table 3 3.2.

BRCA CNV-Positive Samples Based on the graphical visualization and interpretation of CNV status, among the 17 CNV-positive samples, 14 were confirmed as Positive. confirmed CNV BRCA1 Inconclusive BRCA2 BRCA1 Inconclusive BRCA2 Table 4 According to the CNV calling performed by the Diatech software, one sample was classified as failed Potential CNV BRCA1 BRCA2 ( Table 4 ) The final interpretation and reporting of CNV status, integrating graphical visualization with software-based calling, resulted in 15 samples being classified as definitively CNV-positive. One sample was interpreted as Negative BRCA1 Inconclusive BRCA2 Table 4 Overall, under these analytical conditions, the Diatech pipeline showed a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of about 95% when compared to the reference assays ( Table 3 3.3. Sequencing Metrics and Performance The distribution of sequencing quality metrics across individual samples in different runs is shown in Figure 1 The percentage of on-target reads showed minimal variation between samples, demonstrating the high specificity and robustness of the protocol, and confirming that the vast majority of reads were aligned to the intended targets, resulting in reliable and uniform coverage. Among the three metrics reported in the table, the mean coverage, coverage uniformity, and on-target read percentage, coverage uniformity is the one that most strongly impacts the accuracy and reliability of CNV detection across different samples and sequencing runs. Mean coverage was maintained at elevated levels across all four runs, with a total average of 6680 ± 1346×. The mean uniformity across all samples was 94.9% ± 0.88, indicating efficient and balanced coverage of the targeted regions. The percentage of on-target reads was remarkably high across all runs, with minimal variability, with a total mean of 99.8% ± 0.05. Taken together, these results demonstrate a high level of technical reliability across runs, with all quality metrics falling within expected and acceptable thresholds. Although this analysis was performed on a relatively small sample set, the data reflect the robustness and high quality of the sequencing process. Collectively, these metrics demonstrate a strong technical reliability across runs, with all quality parameters well within expected and acceptable thresholds. 4. Discussion This study evaluated the analytical performance of different NGS strategies for the detection of BRCA Diatech Myriapod ® 14 indels 15 12 An interesting aspect was the strategy used to evaluate the Diatech Myriapod ® BRCA Table 4 16 Table 4 Table 1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/ https://databases.lovd.nl/shared/genes From a diagnostic perspective, our findings suggest that graphical visualization and software-based interpretation should be considered complementary tools. Therefore, a multi-step approach combining algorithmic CNV calling, graphical visualization, and expert review is confirmed as the most reliable strategy, particularly for CNV detection in amplicon-based protocols using FFPE samples ( Figure 2 The reliability of CNV detection is also intrinsically linked to the quality of sequencing data. Accurate variant calling requires that key quality metrics, such as the mean coverage, coverage uniformity, and on-target read percentage, meet established thresholds. When these metrics fall below recommended levels, the risk of inconclusive or incorrect calls increases, primarily due to insufficient read depth or uneven read distribution. In our study, sequencing metrics remained consistently high across runs, with mean coverage exceeding 6600× and on-target rates approaching 100%, supporting the technical robustness of the workflow and likely contributing to successful CNV detection. Among the strengths of this study are the use of real-world clinical FFPE samples, comparison across different NGS platforms, and simulation of practical diagnostic scenarios. However, certain limitations must be acknowledged. First, the sample size was relatively small and may not fully capture the heterogeneity of BRCA Looking ahead, integrating automated quality control checkpoints and confidence scoring for CNV calls could reduce the burden of manual review while enhancing overall reliability. Furthermore, continued development and validation of dedicated CNV detection algorithms specifically optimized for amplicon-based sequencing will be essential for broader clinical implementation. 5. Conclusions Our study highlights the importance of having validated NGS workflows and bioinformatics pipelines for the accurate detection of BRCA Myriapod ® Myriapod ® These elements are essential for the reliable molecular identification of BRCA For these reasons, it is possible to hypothesize a decision-making workflow, as described in Figure 2 BRCA Limitations This study has some limitations. Despite the significant number of BRCA BRCA An additional limitation is the lack of detailed information on the CNV calling algorithms used by each platform. As stated in the manuscript, each bioinformatics pipeline is proprietary, which limits transparency regarding the specific parameters or thresholds applied during CNV detection.
