Recognizing that AML arises from complex genetic and epigenetic alterations, a deeper understanding of its pathogenesis has paved the way for precision medicine. The article reviews key targeted therapies, including IDH inhibitors (e.g., ivosidenib, enasidenib) for IDH mutations, FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., midostaurin, gilteritinib) for FLT3 alterations, BCL2 inhibitors (e.g., venetoclax) impacting apoptosis, and emerging Menin inhibitors for specific subtypes like KMT2A-rearranged or NPM1-mutant AML. It also discusses epigenetic therapies that target reversible changes, such as DNMT inhibitors (e.g., azacitidine, decitabine) for DNA methylation and HDAC inhibitors for histone modifications, along with other promising agents under development targeting epigenetic regulators. Furthermore, the article explores gene therapy as a significant future direction, detailing advancements in gene editing (CRISPR/Cas9) and strategies designed to shield healthy hematopoietic cells from targeted toxicity (e.g., CD33, CD123 editing) or to enhance the anti-leukemic function of immune cells (e.g., CAR-T, TCR therapy). The future perspective emphasizes the importance of developing synergistic combination therapies and leveraging molecular insights for truly personalized treatment approaches to overcome therapeutic challenges and improve long-term outcomes for AML patients.

Common symptoms include hemorrhage, ecchymosis, ostealgia, fatigue, fever, and cachexia; blood tests and a bone marrow biopsy can help diagnose the disease [ 1 2 3 4 The primary treatment for AML is chemotherapy, which contains both induction and consolidation stages. While consolidation removes undetectable remaining disease to reach remission, induction lowers the number of leukemic cells. Another strategy is stem cell transplantation, which uses graft cells to elicit an immune response against leukemic cells [ 5 6 Normal bone marrow cells can develop leukemic due to changes in their DNA, disrupting the usual regulation of cell growth and cell death. Thus, unregulated bone marrow cell division results in immature cells that evolve into leukemic white blood cells, known as myeloblasts. These cells may damage healthy cells and cause them not to function correctly [ 7 8 Numerous genetic alterations are involved in the pathogenesis of AML, several of which represent potential novel therapeutic targets [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Gene therapy is a promising approach in the treatment of AML, especially for relapsed or refractory cases. While gene-based strategies—such as lentiviral transfer of T cells expressing leukemia-specific T-cell receptors (e.g., HA-1 via StrepTamer technology)—are under investigation following allogeneic stem cell transplantation, current clinical efforts are largely focused on exploiting targeted and epigenetic therapies [ 17 13 14 18 19 20 21 This article explores targeted and epigenetic therapies for AML. It reviews how the understanding of AML pathogenesis, driven by genetic and epigenetic alterations, has led to precision medicine strategies. The article discusses specific targeted agents like IDH, FLT3, BCL2, and Menin inhibitors that address molecular abnormalities in AML. It also covers epigenetic therapies targeting reversible modifications such as DNA methylation and histone changes, including DNMT inhibitors, HDAC inhibitors, and others. Finally, gene therapy is presented as a promising approach, highlighting advancements in gene editing and targeted strategies, and future directions like combination and personalized therapies. Targeted therapy in AML Cancer has become a crucial public health challenge, with over 52,900 individuals diagnosed and more than 27,000 people losing their lives to the disease daily [ 22 23 24 24 25 Targeted therapy, which focuses on specific molecules, is essential for improving outcomes against cancer cell survival [ 26 27 28 29 IDH inhibitors Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2, occur in approximately 15–20% of AML patients and result in the neomorphic production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which impairs cellular differentiation through epigenetic dysregulation [ 30 31 32 1 The development of IDH inhibitors, such as ivosidenib (IDH1 inhibitor) and enasidenib (IDH2 inhibitor), represents a major advancement in targeted therapy for AML. These agents work by inhibiting mutant IDH enzymes, reducing 2-HG levels, and restoring normal differentiation of leukemic cells [ 13 14 33 34 Clinical trials have demonstrated that IDH inhibitors, particularly in patients with relapsed or refractory AML harboring IDH mutations, lead to durable remissions with a favorable safety profile [ 35  Fig. 1 In their wild-type forms, IDH1 and IDH2 enzymes catalyze the transformation of citrate into 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG). Once inside the nucleus, 2-OG plays a physiological role by activating dioxygenase enzymes, which are essential for DNA and histone demethylation processes. Abbreviations: IDH1 – isocitrate dehydrogenase 1; IDH2 – isocitrate dehydrogenase 2; 2-OG – 2-oxoglutarate; NADPH – nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; TCA – tricarboxylic acid cycle; CoA – coenzyme A; TET1/TET2 – ten-eleven translocation proteins 1 and 2; JmjC – Jumonji-C domain-containing family; KDMs – histone lysine demethylases; DNA – deoxyribonucleic acid FLT3 inhibitors FLT3 inhibitors are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that can be classified into first- and second-generation inhibitors based on their ability to inhibit FLT3 and associated downstream signaling pathways [ 36 37 38 39 18 Despite these advances, the emergence of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, often due to secondary TKD mutations or activation of alternative signaling pathways, has prompted investigations into sequential or dual inhibition strategies. These innovations are redefining the current standard of care and expanding the treatment options for patients with FLT3-mutated AML [ 40 41 42 43 44 2  Fig. 2 mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, encompassing secondary mutations within FLT3 itself, mutations affecting parallel or downstream signaling cascades, and external factors such as altered drug metabolism and changes within the bone marrow microenvironment BCL2 inhibitors BCL2 inhibitors, a type of BH3 mimetic, target anti-apoptotic BCL2 family proteins to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. These inhibitors promote cell death by binding to anti-apoptotic proteins like BCL2, freeing pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAK and BAX1. Venetoclax (ABT-199) is a selective BCL2 inhibitor that was the first FDA-approved drug in this class [ 45 3 46 Venetoclax has demonstrated potent antitumor activity, particularly in hematological malignancies like chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and AML. It is incorporated into treatment regimens for these diseases [ 47 48 It has also been studied in combination with intensive chemotherapy like FLAG-IDA in newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory AML. Combinations of venetoclax with obinutuzumab are used for previously untreated CLL. Venetoclax has also shown promise in combination therapies for multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma [ 47 Despite its success, resistance to venetoclax can occur. Combination strategies are being explored to overcome resistance and enhance efficacy. In AML, combinations of venetoclax with FLT3 inhibitors like midostaurin or gilteritinib have shown synergistic effects, particularly in FLT3-mutated subtypes. Additionally, concurrent targeting of other anti-apoptotic proteins like MCL-1 or BCL-XL, often alongside venetoclax, is being investigated in preclinical models and clinical trials to overcome resistance mechanisms [ 47 49 48  Fig. 3 Molecular mechanisms underlying venetoclax-induced tumor suppression Menin inhibitors Menin inhibitors represent a targeted therapeutic approach in AML, particularly for subtypes driven by KMT2A rearrangements (KMT2Ar) or NPM1 mutations (NPM1mt) [ 50 51 52 53 54 55 Menin inhibitors are small molecules designed to block the interaction between menin and KMT2A fusion proteins by binding to the KMT2A binding pocket on menin. This disruption prevents the activation of the aberrant transcriptional program responsible for leukemia cell proliferation and survival [ 56 Preclinical studies in cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of both KMT2Ar and NPM1mt AML have demonstrated that menin inhibition leads to differentiation and reduced viability of leukemia cells [ 57 50 57 58 59 Strategies combining menin inhibitors with other agents, including BCL2 inhibitors (like venetoclax), are being explored in preclinical studies and clinical trials to overcome resistance and enhance efficacy [ 60 61 Epigenetics in AML Epigenetics primarily refers to alterations in chromatin structure, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and changes in higher-order chromatin structures that ultimately influence gene expression [ 62 63 64 65 66 19 67 68 In AML, specific mutations impacting epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone modification (e.g., Enhancer of Zeste Homologue 2 - EZH2, and ASXL1), DNA methylation regulation (e.g., DNMT3A, TET2), and enzymes catalyzing metabolism (e.g., IDH1/2), have emerged as crucial contributors to disease pathogenesis, with prognostic implications [ 19 67 63 69 70 71 In addition to DNA methylation, the dynamic process of histone acetylation, regulated by histone lysine acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs), significantly affects gene transcription by modifying chromatin accessibility [ 72 73 74 In addition to DNA methylation and histone modifications, RNA modifications have recently emerged as an additional layer of epigenetic regulation involved in the pathogenesis of AML [ 75 76 78 79 81 79 80 Epigenetic therapies for AML treatment Epigenetic therapy in AML targets reversible epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation and histone changes. DNMT inhibitors like 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) and decitabine have been used for over a decade to treat AML patients who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy, as well as those with MDS [ 82 83 84 HDAC and BET inhibitors are currently in trials, showing promise for targeting AML-specific epigenetic alterations. Recent studies have also explored combining DNMT and HDAC inhibitors, demonstrating potential synergistic effects [ 74 85 86 LSD1 inhibitors, such as tranylcypromine and ORY-1001, inhibit the demethylation of histone H3K4 and H3K9, promoting myeloid differentiation and apoptosis, particularly in AML with MLL rearrangements. Clinical trials have shown promising results, with phase 1 studies reporting a 36% response rate in MLL-translocated AML when combined with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), though challenges like toxicity and limited single-agent efficacy persist [ 87 IDH inhibitors, such as ivosidenib and enasidenib, target mutant IDH1 or IDH2 enzymes, reducing oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate levels to restore normal DNA demethylation. These agents are approved for IDH-mutant AML, achieving approximately 30% response rates in relapsed/refractory cases, and are under investigation for MDS, with ongoing trials exploring combinations to enhance efficacy [ 14 DOT1L inhibitors, like pinometostat, target H3K79 methylation to disrupt transcription elongation in MLL-rearranged AML, a subtype with poor prognosis. Preclinical studies demonstrate robust anti-leukemic effects, but phase 1 trials indicate limited single-agent activity, prompting research into combinations with HMAs or chemotherapy to overcome resistance [ 88 1  Table 1 Epigenetic therapies for AML treatment Drug Mechanism of Action Indication Notes 5-Azacytidine (5-AZA) DNMT (DNA Methyltransferase) inhibitor AML and MDS Used in patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy Decitabine DNMT inhibitor AML and MDS Similar to 5-AZA, used for patients with high-risk AML or MDS HDAC Inhibitors Histone deacetylase inhibitor AML (under clinical trials) Enhances histone acetylation, promoting gene expression BET Inhibitors Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal Motif inhibitor AML (under clinical trials) Targets epigenetic alterations specific to AML LSD1 Inhibitors (e.g., Tranylcypromine, ORY-1001) Lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor AML, MDS (under clinical trials) Promising in MLL-rearranged AML; phase 1 trials show safety and responses in R/R AML and MDS (e.g., 36% response rate in MLL-translocated AML). Combination with ATRA enhances differentiation. IDH Inhibitors (e.g., Ivosidenib, Enasidenib) Isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitor AML with IDH1/2 mutations (approved), MDS (under investigation) Approved for IDH-mutant AML; induces differentiation and clinical responses in ~ 30% of R/R AML patients. Trials ongoing for MDS with IDH mutations. DOT1L Inhibitors (e.g., Pinometostat) Disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like inhibitor AML with MLL rearrangements (under clinical trials) Preclinical studies show anti-leukemic effects in MLL-rearranged AML; phase 1 trials indicate tolerable safety but limited single-agent efficacy, prompting combination studies. Overview of AML treatments The bone marrow microenvironment emerges as a crucial player in AML pathogenesis and progression. Studies show that the interactions between AML cells and surrounding stromal cells, extracellular matrix, and immune cells contribute to the survival and drug resistance of AML cells. As a result, strategies aimed at disrupting these interactions may offer a viable approach to enhance the effectiveness of AML therapies [ 89 Historically, the lack of suitable preclinical models has impeded the development of new drugs for AML precisely due to the challenge of replicating the disease’s complexity and heterogeneity. However, recent advances in PDX models, 3D organoid cultures, and genome editing technologies have mostly overcome these limitations. These evolving models offer a more physiologically relevant platform for drug discovery and development, potentially leading to more effective and targeted therapies for AML patients [ 90 In recent years, advances in understanding the genomic and molecular aspects of AML have significantly broadened treatment options [ 91 92 93 94 Agents targeting oncogenic mutations—such as FLT3 and IDH inhibitors—are among the AML-targeted therapies. FLT3 is a cytokine receptor primarily expressed in hematopoietic tissues, while IDH catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-ketoglutarate [ 95 96 In combination with chemotherapy, Midostaurin has improved survival rates in FLT3-mutated patients, while enasidenib has shown efficacy in patients with IDH2 mutations, promoting differentiation of leukemic blasts and increasing remission rates [ 95 Small molecular inhibitors, enasidenib and ivosidenib, show potential effects in treating AML patients, harboring IDH2 and IDH1 mutations, respectively, which are present in about 20% of AML cases. Clinical trials indicate that both inhibitors can induce complete remission and enhance overall survival in AML patients with IDH2 and IDH1 mutations [ 14 97 18 98 99 The FDA approved Midostaurin, for AML patients harbouring FLT3 mutations, as the first approval of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for AML and the inaugural drug for a mutation-specific non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) subtype [ 38 14 97 Advancements in understanding FLT3 gene mutations have caused the development of TKI agents targeting various points within the ATP binding site of the FLT3 RTK. Sunitinib, Lestaurtinib, Midostaurin, Crenolanib, and Gilteritinib are type 1 inhibitors [ 100 101 Ivosidenib, an IDH1 inhibitor, has received FDA approval for safety and efficacy in patients with IDH1-mutated R/R AML [ 14 97 33 In AML gene therapy, a compelling opportunity lies in overcoming drug resistance and enhancing long-term patient outcomes [ 102 103 104 The complexity of AML presents challenges in identifying patients who will respond to treatment. However, advancements in genomic sequencing and gene expression analysis have helped classify AML into distinct genetic and molecular subtypes, paving the way for more precise and personalized gene therapies [ 67 105 106 The foundational concept of gene therapy with hematopoietic stem cells lies in transferring functional genes to the patient’s stem cells to correct genetic defects or enhance immune function [ 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 Gene therapy for AML Recent advancements in gene therapy for AML involve several strategies, often leveraging gene editing technologies and exploring new targets or delivery methods [ 114 115 116 This strategy allows for the administration of targeted therapies post-transplant at optimal doses without causing severe toxicity to the newly engrafted hematopoietic system, thereby potentially increasing the therapeutic index. A prime example of this is the development of tremtelectogene empogeditemcel (trem-cel), formerly known as VOR33. Trem-cel is an allogeneic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell transplant product generated from healthy donor hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) where the myeloid protein CD33 has been genetically ablated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology [ 117 CD33 is a frequently targeted antigen in AML, expressed on over 80% of AML blasts, and existing therapies like GO target it. However, GO’s use is limited by on-target, off-tumor hematopoietic toxicity [ 118 NCT04849910 117 118 Another antigen targeted in AML is CD123, which is overexpressed on AML blasts and leukemic stem cells [ 119 120 116 Beyond protecting healthy cells, gene therapy approaches also focus on improving the efficacy and safety of the immune effector cells themselves, such as CAR-T cells. Gene editing, notably with CRISPR/Cas9 technology, is used to modify CAR-T cells to address limitations like T cell exhaustion or antigen escape. Strategies include optimizing costimulatory domains or suppressing inhibitory signals within the CAR construct or the T cell [ 121 124 Furthermore, targeting alternative antigens with different expression profiles is being investigated [ 115 125 NCT04938115 126 Another target being explored is CD19, which is aberrantly expressed in certain AML subtypes, such as relapsed t(8;21) AML. While typically associated with B-cell malignancies, CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy has shown high safety and efficacy, achieving high response rates, in a clinical trial for CD19-positive relapsed t(8;21) AML patients ( NCT03896854 127 For patients who experience relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT), donor-derived CAR-T cells are being developed. One such approach involves VCAR33, a CD33-directed CAR T-cell product manufactured from the lymphocytes of the patient’s original allogeneic stem cell donor. This strategy aims to address challenges related to T-cell dysfunction and manufacturing difficulties in AML patients by utilizing healthy donor T cells. A Phase 1/2 clinical trial is currently evaluating the safety and efficacy of VCAR33 in patients who have relapsed following alloHCT [ 128 Beyond CAR-T, T cell receptor (TCR)-engineered T cell therapy is also being developed for AML, targeting antigens presented by HLA molecules. For example, Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) is a target for TCR therapy. Gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9 is being applied to develop WT1-specific TCR-engineered T cells from cord blood, specifically editing out the endogenous TCR chains to improve the expression and specificity of the introduced therapeutic TCR and avoid mispairing. Preclinical studies indicate this approach can generate potent T cells targeting AML blasts without harming healthy cells [ 129 Furthermore, combination strategies are being investigated to enhance the efficacy of CAR-T therapy in AML. Combining CAR-T cells with other agents, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) or TKIs, or epigenetic modulators like demethylating drugs, is being explored to potentially improve anti-tumor effects, overcome resistance mechanisms, or manage toxicities. Demethylating drugs, for instance, have been shown to increase antigen density in preclinical trials, which could potentially improve CAR therapy efficacy [ 115 Future perspective Enhancing survival rates among AML patients while mitigating treatment-induced toxicity stands as a primary concern for medical practitioners [ 130 131 133 134 135 136 137 138 Improved delivery methods and targeting strategies The efficient delivery of vectors to specific cells or tissues remains a significant challenge in gene therapy and is pivotal for successful gene transfer. Viral vectors dominate therapeutic gene delivery despite advancements in non-viral techniques, notably for hematopoietic cells, encompassing electroporation, nucleofection, and particle bombardment [ 139 140 141 142 144 Strategies aimed at enhancing therapeutic vector binding to target cells encompass the use of bispecific conjugates and modifications of AAV for improved targeting. Nevertheless, ensuring the universal efficacy of these modifications across diverse vector capsids presents challenges. Addressing this challenge, researchers have developed random peptide-display libraries based on gene therapy vector capsids, specifically for AAV and retroviruses [ 145 146 147 148 Combination therapies with existing treatments In the last decades, the vulnerability of malignant cells to concurrent disruption of multiple cooperative survival signaling pathways has gained attention [ 149 150 151 152 153 In AML, DNMTIs have been paired with diverse targeted agents. For instance, a phase I trial combining the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib with decitabine showcased promising results by up-regulating miR-29b, leading to the inhibition of genes involved in myeloid leukemogenesis, resulting in notable remission rates [ 154 Recent advancements in cancer epigenetics have identified potent and specific small-molecule BET (bromodomain and extra terminal) inhibitors [ 62 155 Development of personalized gene therapy Advancements in genomic technologies, including global gene-expression analysis [ 156 157 158 159 160 161 Experts increasingly envision that the integration of germline and somatic genomic data, along with epigenetic and transcriptional profiling, will form the molecular foundation for future treatment decision-making in AML. This integrated approach promises to offer the highest predictive potential for identifying actionable vulnerabilities and tailoring patient-specific therapeutic strategies [ 162 163 164 Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a powerful tool to map intratumoral heterogeneity in AML and uncover rare subpopulations responsible for therapy resistance or relapse. A 2025 study identified novel cell states and surface markers that could serve as the basis for future gene therapy targets or drug delivery systems, pushing the boundaries of precision oncology [ 165 166 Conclusion Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) remains a significant challenge in hematological oncology, characterized by its complex biology, genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity, and the frequent emergence of therapeutic resistance. While traditional chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation have long been the cornerstones of AML treatment, a deeper understanding of the molecular underpinnings of the disease has fundamentally shifted the therapeutic paradigm towards precision medicine. This article has highlighted the critical role of targeted therapies that exploit specific molecular vulnerabilities in AML cells. Agents targeting frequently mutated genes such as FLT3 (e.g., midostaurin, gilteritinib) and IDH1/2 (e.g., ivosidenib, enasidenib) have demonstrated improved outcomes, particularly in patients harboring these alterations. Furthermore, therapies like BCL2 inhibitors (e.g., venetoclax) that restore apoptosis, and novel agents such as Menin inhibitors for specific subtypes like KMT2Ar or NPM1-mutant AML, represent targeted strategies that directly address critical survival pathways in leukemia cells. Alongside targeted agents, epigenetic therapies play a crucial role by modulating reversible modifications that are dysregulated in AML. DNMT inhibitors (e.g., azacitidine, decitabine) have been established for their ability to restore proper DNA methylation patterns. HDAC inhibitors and other emerging agents targeting epigenetic regulators like LSD1 and DOT1L are also being explored to disrupt aberrant gene expression programs that maintain the leukemic state. A particularly promising frontier lies in gene therapy, which offers potential strategies to overcome inherent challenges like drug resistance and treatment toxicity. Innovative approaches include the genetic modification of healthy hematopoietic stem cells (HSPCs) using tools like CRISPR/Cas9 to render them resistant to targeted immunotherapies (e.g., against CD33 or CD123), thereby protecting normal hematopoiesis while allowing for aggressive targeting of leukemia cells. Simultaneously, gene therapy is being leveraged to enhance the anti-leukemic activity of immune cells, such as through the development of improved CAR-T and TCR-engineered therapies targeting various antigens expressed on AML blasts. Despite these significant advancements, challenges such as the emergence of resistance mechanisms and the inherent heterogeneity of AML necessitate continued innovation. The future of AML treatment will increasingly rely on synergistic combination therapies designed to simultaneously block multiple survival pathways and circumvent resistance. Critically, ongoing progress in genomic sequencing, single-cell analysis, and other molecular profiling technologies is paving the way for truly personalized treatment approaches, where therapeutic decisions are guided by the unique molecular landscape of each patient’s disease. By integrating these sophisticated molecular insights with the growing armamentarium of targeted, epigenetic, and gene therapies, the medical community aims to improve response durability, reduce treatment-related toxicity, and ultimately enhance the long-term survival and quality of life for patients with AML.
