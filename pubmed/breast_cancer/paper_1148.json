Despite many treatment options, survival rates remain low. In this study, the effect of Orox A on hepatocellular carcinoma cells was investigated. Hep3B cells were treated with a range of Orox A, and cell viability was assessed by MTT assays. Subsequent analyses using RT-qPCR demonstrated alterations in the expression of DNA damage and repair genes. To determine the damage in cancer cells, the amount of 8-OHdG and NO in the cells was measured by the ELISA method. Additionally, total antioxidant/oxidant status was measured, and the OSI value was calculated. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted to ascertain the specific cell cycle phase. The IC50 dose of Orox A for hepatocellular carcinoma cells was calculated to be 1385 μM at 24 h. According to the gene expression analysis results, NEIL1, OGG1, ATM and ATR gene expressions increased significantly, while APEX1 gene expression decreased significantly. The amount of 8-OHdG dramatically increased in cancer cells treated with Orox A, whereas the level of NO significantly decreased. Total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) were significantly decreased in Orox A-applied cancer cells, and the oxidative stress index (OSI) was significantly increased. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that Orox A treatment caused G2/M phase arrest in the cell cycle. These findings collectively suggest that Orox A exerts cytotoxic effects on Hep3B cells through mechanisms involving DNA damage, oxidative stress, and cell cycle modulation, making it a promising candidate for further anticancer therapy development. hepatocellular carcinoma DNA damage 8-OHdG redox hemostasis Oroxylin A This study was not supported by any funding from an agency or funder in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by strong tumor heterogeneity and aggressive cell processes, leading to significant tumor invasion, metastasis, poor outcomes, and high mortality [ 1 The O-methylated flavone bioactive component oroxylin A (Orox A; 5,7-dihydroxy-6 methoxyflavone) is extracted from the roots of the Scutellariae plant [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 This study sought to determine how Orox A affected DNA damage/repair genes and, consequently, the cell cycle, as well as how it inhibited the proliferation of the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Hep3B cells. 2. Results 2.1. Orox A Inhibited the Proliferation of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells Hep3B cells were treated with a concentration range of Orox A (0–2000 μM) for 24 and 48 h. It was found that as the dose increased, the viability of hepatocellular carcinoma cells decreased ( Figure 1 50 50 2.2. Orox A Altered the Expression of DNA Damage and Repair Genes in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells Based on our RT-qPCR results of Orox A treated Hep3B cells, statistically significant changes were obtained in the expression levels of NEIL1 (nei like DNA glycosylase 1), OGG1 (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase), ATR (ATR checkpoint kinase), ATM (ATM serine/threonine kinase) and APEX1(apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 1) genes, especially those involved in the DNA damage pathways, as compared to the control cells ( Figure 2 p As a result of gene expression analysis, mRNA levels of ATM and ATR increased significantly ( p Figure 2 p Figure 2 p Figure 2 p 2.3. Orox A Application Increases the Amount of DNA Damage Product 8-OHdG in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells The amount of 8-OHdG increased significantly in hepatocellular carcinoma cells treated with Orox A ( Figure 3 Table 1 p 2.4. Orox A Suppressed Nitric Oxide Synthesis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells Our ELISA results indicated that nitric oxide was significantly inhibited by Orox A treatment in Hep3B cells ( Figure 4 Table 2 p 2.5. The Effect of Orox A Treatment on Redox Balance of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells Orox A-treated Hep3B cells had significantly low TOS levels, which significantly decreased in Odo A-treated hepatocellular carcinoma cells as compared to control cells, indicating elevated oxidative stress upon our treatment ( Figure 5 p Figure 5 p Figure 5 Table 3 p Table 3 2.6. Orox A Induces Cell Cycle Arrest at the G2/M Phase Cell cycle distribution was assessed by flow cytometry using the PI method. As shown in Figure 6 3. Discussion Nowadays, many treatment options are used against cancer, which is increasingly common. Overall survival, especially in aggressive cancers, is decreasing despite these treatment options. For this reason, it is vital to discover new agents that are less toxic to healthy cells but highly toxic to cancer cells. Anti-cancer drug studies are on phytochemical compounds obtained from many herbal extracts. The effect of phytochemicals on cancer cells may occur through additional cellular mechanisms. So, only viability analysis is insufficient to reveal the mechanism of action of the agent used. Orox A is extracted from the roots of the Scutellariae plant. In this study, we investigated the effect of Orox A on DNA damage and repair mechanism genes in hepatocellular carcinoma cells, how it affects the oxidative status in the cell, and what changes it creates in the cell cycle. Orox A has been demonstrated in a prior work to induce apoptosis in cancer cells through the mitochondrial route in HepG2 cells. Reactive oxygen species produced by Orox A in HepG2 cells were found to activate mitochondrial permeability transition pores (MPTP; [ 16 17 Figure 1 2 2 2 2 18 12 18 In this study, expression analysis of DNA damage and repair genes was performed to examine the effect of Orox A on cell DNA. According to the results, it was determined that the expressions of NEIL1, OGG1, ATR, ATM, and APEX1 genes changed significantly ( Figure 2 p 19 20 21 Figure 2 p 22 By stimulating tumor-cell invasion, proliferation, and the production of angiogenic factors, NO generated from tumor cells accelerates the growth of tumors. Despite contradictory results in the literature, the inducible isoform of NOS (iNOS), which generates high NO concentrations, drives neoplastic transformation in oncogene- and chemical-induced carcinogenesis models [ 23 24 Figure 4 As a measure of oxidative DNA damage, 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG), a guanine C-8 hydroxylation mediated by OH, is the oxidative DNA damage most often seen. Interestingly, mitochondrial DNA has a higher 8-oxoG lesion than nuclear DNA, indicating that mitochondrial DNA is more vulnerable to oxidative damage [ 25 Figure 3 Figure 5 26 27 28 Many anticancer chemicals, including doxorubicin, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin [ 29 Figure 6 Cell-cycle checkpoint proteins identify high amounts of DNA damage and, when activated, cause cell-cycle arrest, which stops damaged DNA from being transferred during mitosis. Replication-associated DNA DSBs, one of the most harmful types of DNA lesions, can result from DNA lesions that happen during the S phase of the cell cycle. They also prevent replication fork progression. Cell death could occur if the damaged DNA cannot be adequately repaired. In addition to having a relaxed ability to sense and repair DNA damage, cancer cells are more likely to be able to ignore cell-cycle checkpoints, which enables them to proliferate at high rates. This makes them more vulnerable to DNA damage because replicating damaged DNA increases the risk of cell death [ 30 31 32 33 34 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture and Chemicals Hep3B (ATCC ® 2 Orox A (Cat#82615) has been commercially obtained from PhytoLab, Vestenbergsgreuth, Germany. Orox A dissolving process has been carried out using dimethylsulfoxid (DMSO). First, 1.14 g of Orox A was completely dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO in a controlled manner until no single particle was visible in a solution. Then, 10 mL of culture medium was added to DMSO-dissolved Orox-A solution, and initial stock solution was prepared. 4.2. MTT Assay A 96-well microplate was inoculated with 100 μL/well after the cell suspension concentration was adjusted to 2.5 × 10 4 4.3. RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis Total RNA isolation was performed from Hep3B cells for mRNA-level expression studies. For this purpose, 1 mL of RiboEx total RNA isolation solution (GeneAll, Hwaseong-si, Republic of Korea) was added to the cells in 6-well plates. Homogenate was transferred in Eppendorf tubes. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature, 200 μL of chloroform was added to each Eppendorf tube and pipetted again, then incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Then, it was centrifuged at 15,000× g g 35 4.4. RT-qPCR Analysis SyberGreen-I mix was completed with 1X in qPCR mixes, 5 pmol forward and 5 pmol reverse primers ( Table 4 2 4.5. Measurement of the DNA Damage Product 8-OHdG Human 8-OHdG kit (Bostonchem, Cat# BLS-8533Hu, Cambridge, MA, USA) was used to detect DNA damage. Cell lysates were prepared as recommended by the manufacturer. Moreover, 50 μL samples were placed in 96-well pre-coated microplate. Additionally, 50 μL biotinylated-conjugate solution was added to each well. It was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. It was washed 3 times with wash buffer. Then, 100 μL streptavidin-HRP solution was added to each well. It was incubated again at 37 °C for 1 h. Wells were washed 3 times with wash buffer again. Moreover, 90 μL TMB substrate solution was added to each well and covered with a plate cover and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. Furthermore, 50 μL stop reagent was added, and OD measurement was performed at 450 nm. 4.6. Nitric Oxide (NO) Measurement Using ELISA The General Nitric Oxide Assay Kit (Cat#MBS8243214, MyBioSource, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to test the levels of nitric oxide (NO). After removing Hep3B cells from culture plates, the supernatant was discarded after centrifugation. Following the addition of 500 μL of distilled water, the mix was homogenized. It was centrifuged for 20 min at 4 °C at 12,000× g g 4.7. Biochemical Evaluation of Redox Equilibrium Human TAS (SanRedBio Technology Campany, Cat#201-12-7412, Shanghai, China) and TOS (SanRedBio Technology Campany, Cat# 201-12-5539, China) ELISA kits were used to measure the total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidant status (TOS) of Orox A-treated and control Hep3B cells. By dividing TOS by TAS levels, the oxidative stress index (OSI) value was determined. The automated colorimetric method created by Erel (2004) [ 36 36 2 2 2 2 36 37 4.8.
