Introduction Key performance indicators (KPIs) measure the critical functions and activities that must be performed in an organization to provide management with an assessment of quantity and quality, from which it can aid strategic decisions to achieve objectives. Objective To map the literature review on KPIs in the context of medicine. Methods In the literature review, we adopted a proposed model and made appropriate adaptations to it. The PubMed database was chosen, with filters applied to define a path. The findings of the articles were briefly discussed in comparison with others to highlight specific findings. Results Almost 100 research articles were eligible for investigation in a wide range of third- and second-degree medical specialties. In these articles, the KPIs are numbered from 1 up to 797 qualitative and quantitative measures. Conclusions The KPIs are not limited to a financial regime; instead, in the field of medicine, they play an important role in a wide range of medical specialties, from clinics, therapeutics, surgery, pharmacy, research, regulatory affairs, hospitalization, management, and product development. These indicators can be implemented and evaluated by different means, from simple resources such as home visit, telephone survey, cross-comparison with a benchmark, questionnaires, spreadsheets, to the most sophisticated technology, such as IT resources, artificial intelligence, the linear hinges model, the Research and Development/University of California, Los Angeles (RAND/UCLA) appropriateness method, and the Monte Carlo simulation.

These authors stated that KPIs “cannot replace a mortality analysis, but enable programs to compare performance against objectives”. 2 3 4 Emergency medicine has proven that a survival benefit was identified when the response time was up to four minutes for patients at intermediate or high risk of mortality. 5 6 7 In time, KPIs were implemented in several medical specialties, including Anesthesiology, 8 9 10 11 3 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 4 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 Our team has identified tangible KPIs that are not limited to the articles cited in the foreground, but which provide a review of the literature in medicine with restrictions on time, database and type of research, as we will describe later. Hence, our objectives are to collect a set of articles in medicine in line with KPIs; to carry out a descriptive analysis of the literature on the subject, where applicable; and to summarize elements of its main conclusions, where applicable. Methods The present article is organized based on a template designed by Xiao and Watson 56 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Process of literature review. Note: 56 Step 1–Formulate the Problem Instead of zooming out too many research questions, we follow the footprints to formulate a specific problem and then look at how to map and solve that question. Cronin et al. 57 Step 2–Develop and Validate the Review Protocol In short, it is a predefined plan that specifies the methods for carrying out the review. The review protocol increases the reliability of the research, as readers can use the same protocol to repeat the study for cross-checking and verification. Our initial research found 7,720 articles. At the second try they were reduced to 1,219 articles, but both cases could be labeled as a large sample for the literature review. Our review protocol needed to move forward for the sake of reasoning. Step 3–Search for Literature We value access to full texts more than abstracts; that is why we used the virtual private network (VPN) of Universidade de São Paulo (USP) to search PubMed to ensure a secure connection and access the full texts. Refining our research led us to filter article type as a set of combinations: Action Research, Cohort, Cross-Sectional, Design of Experiments, Explanatory Design, Exploratory, Gap Analysis, Observational, Narrative Review, Randomized Controlled, Retro-Prospective, Retrospective Comparative, Phenomenological Methodology, Prospective, Prospective Cohort, Longitudinal, and Study Protocol. We used the filters as defined: Human, English, Male and Female, and, lastly, only MEDLINE. The timeframe was set as 17 September 2019 to 17 September 2023, which can be justified by considering recent research as more relevant to the current situation, therefore being able to provide more useful insights. 56 Step 4–Screen for Inclusion Once more, Xiao and Watson 56 We noticed that some summaries were blurry, so we had to search in the text itself, for example, when the term Quality is recorded 58 59 59 60 61 62 63 64 Step 5–Access Quality In time, two texts were excluded: Halling et al., 65 66 Step 6–Extract Data Our cache of 58 articles ( Supplementary Appendix 1 Step 7–Analyze and Synthesize Data Sandelowski et al. 67 Step 8–Report Findings Our primary choice treasures the convenience and clearness of spreadsheet-like format with Article, Declared Area of Interest / Related Sciences, Type of Experiment/Study, KPIs Method, KPIs Quantity, and Main Findings / Results. Our search and filtering flow are shown in Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Screening flow of the present article, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) statement. Results Descriptive Analyses Our temporal analysis tells us 2021 was the most prolific year with 31 publications (55%), followed by 2019 with 11 publications (20%), then 2018 with 5 publications (9%). The lowest ratios were found in 2023, 2022, and 2020, with three publications each (5% each), as shown in Fig. 3 Fig. 3 Literature evolution. We don't have the space to discuss each of the final 56 articles, but some deserve a few observations in the light of the KPIs. Selected Articles (2018) Two articles have a cross-comparison results with Government or Economic Bloc guidelines: Fitzpatrick et al. 68 69 The latter article makes comparative quantitative analyses of the Canadian and Australian health systems to affirm the comparatively superior performance of the Australian system on most indicators, concluding that Canada needs to adopt a more serious approach to the federal role and the introduction of a national pharmaceutical program. In one of them, 69 Selected Articles (2019) Jones et al. 70 In the Netherlands a published by Dohmen and van Raaij 71 Prospective research 72 Selected Articles (2020) An observational cohort study in Spain 73 Across 16 competitive matches a total of 15 males outfield players (5 defenders, 6 midfielders, and 4 strikers), aged 16 to 18 years, from the club's scholarship squad were subjects to perform fitness testing battery under specific circumstances. Wing et al. 74 Selected Articles (2021) Ratnovsky et al. 75 p p The British Orthopedic Association and British Geriatric Society published, in 2007, their care guide for patients with fragility fractures (Blue Book) in which the KPIs for hip fracture care were determined. Crozier-Shaw et al. 76 One case of biomaterial development was listed on our sample. Photosensitizer nanoparticles emission for precise photodynamic oral cancer therapy as an alternative for drugs. Wu et al. 61 1 A tertiary hospital with a capacity of 1,300 beds, 1,654 items in the pharmacy, and 6 robotics systems that can serve 1 thousand patients daily have a related article due to the unpredictable COVID-19 experience. The development of a near real-time pharmacy dashboard can be useful in managing this workload, but it brought obstacles regarding the integration of different database platforms, such as the Oracle Database Server (Oracle Corp.) with SQL Database (Microsoft Corp.), in which the Cloverleaf engine (Infor) was chosen. All IT must comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act at all stages of data extraction, transfer, manipulation and aggregation. Al-Jazairi et al. 77 There were two articles highlighting KPIs in sports to measure athlete performance: one is about swimming 78 79 78 79 Selected Articles (2022) Colorectal surgery is still associated with a significant burden of postoperative complications and, ultimately, costs for healthcare. Massa et al. 63 A study protocol by Opgenorth et al. 62 Selected Articles (2023) In Uganda almost 75% of the entire population is rural, while many healthcare workers are concentrated in urban areas. Minimizing such issues drove them to create community health workers (CHW) programs, with a team of 5 to 6 people as village health teams (VHTs). Agarwal et al. 80 The Shanghai Stroke Service System (4S) is a regional stroke network making use of an online database that automatically extracts data from structured electronic medical records. Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability in China. Patients who are 18-years or older with International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) stroke codes (I63, I61, and G45) as the primary diagnosis at discharge were included in the study by Xu et al., with 11 KPIs listed. 58 Discussion In the context of educational proceedings, the performance indicators can be traced back to 1880, as noted by Hogg (apud Fitz-Gibbon 81 Articles in the medical field that explore performance indicators date back to 1923. Robinson 82 83 Along with these historical records, the present article makes relevant contributions to the field of medicine by revealing that KPIs are a constant in the practice of medicine. For example, this investigation presents studies with results over 35 medicine specialties ranging from clinical, 9 12 28 42 10 63 84 8 24 31 36 4 39 77 23 30 47 48 3 58 68 85 86 87 11 72 88 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 25 27 29 32 80 41 43 44 89 90 45 61 51 52 53 74 78 79 A second contribution involves carrying out descriptive and thematic analyses together. The descriptive analysis provides a broader understanding of how medical researchers and academics have approached KPIs over time. The evolution of this subject through different methods and applications, in strictly controlled scenarios or in the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, may intrigue discerning readers to develop KPIs, both in medical practice and in the field of research. An in-depth investigation into how to overcome regular and routine obstacles is present here, for regulatory affairs or even for managers and engineers in related fields. Another contribution of the presented article tells us the KPIs can be implemented and be evaluated by different means, such as household visit, phone survey, cross-comparison with a benchmark, questionary, IT, artificial intelligence, observational, linear hinges model, Research and Development (RAND)/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) appropriateness method, and the Monte Carlo simulation. Private medicine has investors behind a decision-making process in a continuous flow. Return on investments, growth, profit margin, revenue, customer loyalty, inflation, taxes, regulation, competitors maneuvers, technology, mergers, acquisitions, and bankruptcies are all part of the intrinsic vocabulary, like non-medical, related fields (such as consumers goods, capital goods, services). Regarding the public health sector, where almost none of this vocabulary is used, the Brazilian Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde, SUS, in Portuguese) can be used as an example, as the country considers health a constitutional right. In a nutshell, SUS is universal and free for all in the fifth largest country in the world. Is there room to study and apply KPIs in a public health system like the SUS? Apart from monetary issues, does it make sense to increase efficiency and effectiveness? Is it possible to improve the availability and quality of supplies, as well as the development, training, and performance of health professionals, managerial tasks, safety, communication, reputation, and patient satisfaction in SUS? Only two articles 35 36 Lastly our research team does not propose a method, a guideline, or a model to implement KPIs as a general tool, which could be handy. This could be done in a future study, aiming to humanize KPIs, as it is currently only known as a financial tool. Limitations to the Study A superficial view of this subject may lead the reader to look at opportunities to apply for KPIs in their professional routine. With this, the authors emphasize the need for more articles to be discussed with more latitude, more topics, with different points of view. The present could be called a systematic review Conclusion This literature review concerns the use of KPIs in the context of medicine, as analyzed in the areas of clinical practice, therapeutics, surgery, pharmacy, research, regulatory affairs, hospitalization, management, and product development. There is a symmetrical conflict between infinite demand and limited resources, which KPIs can play an important role in bridging, regardless of medical science, wealth or other barriers, as there are many resources to balance the challenge, such as information technology, artificial intelligence, the linear hinges model, the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method, and the Monte Carlo simulation.
