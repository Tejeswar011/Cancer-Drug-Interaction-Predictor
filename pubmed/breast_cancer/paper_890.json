These malignancies are often diagnosed at an advanced stage, contributing to their high mortality rates. Despite significant advancements in conventional treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, the prognosis for GI cancer patients remains poor due to inherent challenges, including drug resistance, systemic toxicity, and tumor recurrence [ 26 Among these, garlic (Allium sativum) has been extensively studied for its pharmacological benefits, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic, and anticancer activities [ 74 81 43 53 111 The pharmacokinetics of allicin indicate that it is efficiently absorbed and metabolized, making it a promising drug candidate. However, its clinical application is hindered by its instability and strong odor, necessitating the development of novel delivery systems to enhance its therapeutic efficacy [ 13 15 74 Preclinical and epidemiological studies have demonstrated the potential of allicin against various GI cancers. In esophageal cancer, allicin has been found to induce apoptosis by activating caspases and generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) [ 84 30 56 86 8 107 Recent studies have expanded the scope of allicin’s therapeutic potential beyond its direct anticancer effects. Synergistic interactions between allicin and conventional chemotherapeutic agents are being explored to enhance treatment efficacy and overcome drug resistance [ 74 81 This review aims to provide a comprehensive update on the clinical potential of allicin in treating major GI cancers. It highlights recent advancements in nanoformulations and combination therapies, offering insights into the future direction of allicin-based cancer management strategies. With continued research, allicin may emerge as an effective, natural therapeutic agent, improving patient outcomes in GI oncology.

Chemistry and pharmacokinetics Allicin, chemically known as diallyl thiosulfinate, is the major bioactive compound produced from garlic ( Allium sativum 51 21 2 10 6 10 2 47 81 Fig. 2 Diagram showing the biosynthesis of allicin from alliin. Alliin is broken down by the enzyme alliinase to allyl sulfenic acid and dehydroalanine. Two molecules of allyl sulfenic acid condense spontaneously to give a molecule of allicin Pharmacokinetically, allicin undergoes very fast absorption and metabolism. Oral ingestion therefore results in the absorption of allicin in the gastrointestinal tract, although its high reactivity results in very quick metabolism [ 5 17 32 32 Once metabolized, allicin derivatives such as diallyl disulfide and allyl methyl sulfide circulate in the bloodstream [ 103 52 52 Studies have demonstrated that allicin interacts with drug metabolism pathways, particularly cytochrome P450 enzymes. Allicin was found to inhibit CYP2C19 activity, leading to increased plasma concentrations of omeprazole in individuals carrying CYP2C19*1 alleles [ 103 103 In human clinical studies, bioavailability of allicin from garlic supplements varies widely depending on formulation and dietary factors. Enteric-coated garlic tablets exhibit bioavailability ranging from 36 to 104%, which is reduced when taken with high-protein meals due to delayed gastric emptying [ 54 54 Metabolic fate refers to allicin being transformed into a variety of sulfur-containing compounds that are easily detectable in body fluids and exhaled air, thus serving as indicators of systemic distribution [ 54 7 76 80 88 27 Allicin as a natural therapeutic agent for major gastrointestinal cancers According to global cancer statistics from 2020, cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, including colorectal, liver, gastric, esophageal and pancreatic cancers, remain primary reason of deaths worldwide. The incidence and mortality rates of gastrointestinal malignancies continue to rise, and this has developed a major worldwide healthiness concern that extremely endangers wellbeing [ 40 111 89 81 93 33 Organosulfur compounds inhibit angiogenesis, metastasis, and tumour invasion in addition to slowing tumour growth and inducing apoptosis to prevent stomach cancers [ 81 111 111 72 111 12 67 70 93 Alliin, the precursor of allicin, has the ability to inhibit the growth of a human gastric cancer cell line. Furthermore, it has no influence on the growth of healthy intestinal cells when it causes stomach cancer cells to undergo apoptosis [ 63 105 64 99 9 101 The allicin-mediated apoptotic pathway in gastric cancer cells is depicted in Fig. 2 81 2 Furthermore, Bax/Bcl-2 can also halt the cell cycle by increasing phospho-p53 levels. Through activation of the JNK signaling pathway, allicin can promote JNK-Jun phosphorylation, which inhibits tumor cell proliferation. Allicin also induces activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, increasing Fas receptor expression and its binding to Fas ligand (FasL), leading to apoptosis through caspase-8 and cytochrome c activation. This dual mechanism enables allicin to initiate both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways [ 81 Allicin induces apoptosis through both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mechanisms. It promotes the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, which triggers caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation, leading to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and DNA fragmentation. Additionally, increased mitochondrial membrane permeability allows for translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (Endo G) into the nucleus, leading to caspase-independent apoptosis. Furthermore, allicin elevates intracellular free Ca 2 81 Allicin also mitigates the adverse effects of certain anticancer therapies and enhances their efficacy. For instance, by activating the Nrf2 pathway via KLF9, allicin protects against arsenic trioxide-induced liver damage, a major concern in acute promyelocytic leukemia therapy [ 102 3 90 1 Fig. 3 Schematic diagram illustrating the cellular effects of allicin, highlighting its role in inducing ER stress, leading to the activation of TGF-2, Cyclin D1 and E, which contribute to stop cell cycle. Allicin also generates ROS triggering DNA damage and trigger downstream signaling, including the stimulation of P21 and Bax/Bcl2 and the inactivation of TGF-2 Table 1 The advantages of allicin against gastrointestinal malignancies Cancer Ingredient used Amount Advantage Cell lines type References Gastric cancer Allicin 6 mg/L and 12 mg/L Stop cell cycle (G2/M phase), prevent cell division, and trigger apoptosis SGC-7901 Cell lines [ 92 Allicin 15–120 μg/ml prevent cell division, and trigger apoptosis SGC-7901 Cell lines [ 108 Allicin 0.1, μg/ml and 10 μg/ml prevent cell division, and trigger apoptosis MGC-803, BGC-823 and SGC-7901 Cell lines [ 109 Allicin 0.016 mg/ml Allicin can inhibit telomerase activity and induce apoptosis of gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells. Allicin may be more effective than AZT SGC-7901 [ 91 Colorectal cancer Allicin 25 μM Stop the growth of tumours activation of the STAT3 pathway HCT-116 [ 58 Allicin 0 to 256 μg/ml Increase colon cancer cells' radiosensitivity by blocking the NF-κB signalling pathway HCT-116 and CT26 [ 35 Allicin 0–1.2 mM Diminish the vitality and proliferation of cells HT-29 [ 38 Allicin 1.625–100 μM When 5-FU and allicin are used together, they have a synergistic impact on colon cancer cells, and better outcomes can be achieved at IC50 with a lower dosage of 5-FU than when 5-FU is used alone DLD-1 [ 94 Allicin 2.5–100 μg/ml Increased the anticancer effects of oxaliplatin and 5-FU Cell lines was Caco-2 and HT-29 [ 75 Esophagel cancer Allicin 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 100 µg/ml The apoptotic rate was significantly increased and accompanied by Cyt c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol, as well as Bax, caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 which were significantly increased Eca109 and EC9706 cells [ 18 Allicin Na LDH activity was decreased compared with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. The increased activity of caspase-3 and caspase-8 in allicin-treated cells was statistically significant, but caspase-9 activity changed without statistical significance Eca109 [ 100 Allicin Na The mitochondrial membrane potential is significantly reduced, in the early apoptosis and late apoptosis percentage increased. Compared with the control group, the mRNA and protein expressions of Bax significantly increased, but the mRNA and protein expression of Bcl-2 significantly decreased esophageal cancer EC-109 [ 44 Allicin (0 μg/ml, 10 μg/ml, 20 μg/ml and 40 μg/mL Conclusion Allicin prodrugs could effectively inhibit the proliferation of esophageal cancer cell line Eca9706,and control the proliferation of esophageal cancer cells by regulating the expression of apoptosis associated genes Esophageal cancer cell line Eca9706 [ 19 Liver cancer Allicin 0–64 μg/ml Encourage 5-FU’s antitumour action via the ROS-mediated mitochondrial mechanism SK-Hep-1 and BEL-7402 Cell lines [ 112 Allicin Na Allicin decreased the level of cytoplasmic p53, the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway, and the level of Bcl-2 and increased the expression of AMPK/TSC2 and Beclin-1 signaling pathways in Hep G2 cells liver cancer Hep G2 cells [ 23 Allicin 35 μM Induced apoptotic cell death in p53 knocked down Hep G2 cells similar to that of Hep 3B cells HCC Hep G2 [ 22 Pancreatic cancer Allicin 10 mg/kg Prevent the formation of tumours and lengthen their survival BXPC-3 [ 96 Allicin Na Allicin-induced caspase-3 expression, DNA fragmentation, cell cycle arrest, p21 Waf1/Cip1 MIA PaCa-2 cells [ 20 SGC MGC BGC HCT HT DLD-1 Caco-2 CT26 SK-Hep-1 BEL-7402 BXPC-3 Esophageal cancer About 456,000 new cases and 400,000 fatalities from esophageal cancer are recorded each year, making it the sixth most common cause of cancer-related deaths globally [ 25 3 97 59 85 Nelson et al. [ 69 69 48 65 Allicin’s effects and underlying molecular processes on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) are uncertain. An inquiry into the effect and mechanism of action of allicin in the ESCC cells Eca-109 and EC9706. The vitality and invasion ability of the two ESCC cells in the allicin group were considerably reduced following allicin treatment. Allicin decreased the percentage of G0/G1 and S phases while increasing the population of G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner. Following allicin therapy, the expression levels of p53, p21, and CHK1 increased considerably while cyclinB dropped. The apoptotic rate increased dramatically, as did Cyt c release from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm, as well as Bax, caspase-3, and cleaved caspase-9. In vivo, there was also evidence of tumor growth suppression. These findings indicate that allicin may be a unique and effective anti-oesophageal cancer agent for the treatment of ESCC [ 18 DADS significantly decreased cell viability in ESCC cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while normal liver cells showed lower toxicity, according to a study using the MTT assay. DADS experienced G2/M phase arrest, according to cell cycle studies. According to molecular analysis, the p53/p21 pathway’s activation and the decrease of cyclin B1, cdc2, p-cdc2, and cdc25c most likely caused this cell cycle arrest. Annexin V/PI staining was used to identify apoptosis. The molecular indicators demonstrated that DADS caused apoptosis through activating caspases, changing the Bax/Bcl-2 balance and inhibiting the MEK-ERK pathway. therefore DADS has the potential to be an effective and safe anticancer drug for ESCC therapy in the near future [ 105 Allicin's cell apoptosis effect on human esophageal cancer EC-109 cells is investigated, as well as the molecular pathways involved. The results showed that when human esophageal cancer EC-109 cells were treated with allicin for 48 h, the mitochondrial membrane potential was dramatically lowered, and both early and late apoptosis percentages increased. Compared to the control group, Bax mRNA and protein expressions increased considerably (p < 0.05), while Bcl-2 mRNA and protein expressions fell dramatically (p < 0.05). As a result, the study proposes that allicin can cause apoptosis in human esophageal cancer EC-109 cells in a dose-dependent manner, making it a potential therapeutic option [ 44 The apoptosis of EC109 cells induced by Z-VAD-FMK, allicin, allicin + Z-VAD-FMK, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin was investigated using flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC and PI double labelling. The variations in enzyme activity of caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 were measured using spectrophotometry. Allicin inhibited the development of EC 109 cells and killed them in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. LDH activity was lower than with 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. Caspase-3 and caspase-8 activity rose significantly in allicin-treated cells, whereas caspase-9 activity did not change significantly. Allicin reduces the development of EC109 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner via extrinsic apoptotic pathways initiated by caspase-8, with fewer adverse effects than 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin [ 100 Gastric (stomach) cancer Garlic consumption lowers the danger of stomach cancer, although data from two major prospective US cohort studies are equivocal [ 28 49 49 57 58 34 77 Allicin inhibits the growth of gastric cancer cells by arresting the SGC-7901 cell line [ 5 92 46 45 46 These two routes specifically affect the release of cytochrome c from tumor cells, the positive regulation of Bax and Fas in tumor cells, and the increased stimulation of caspase [ 108 109 In addition to TDER with protein thiols, DATS can also react with the cellular thiol glutathione to create H2S gas, which can control several other cellular functions [ 79 45 45 45 46 46 71 50 98 Colorectal cancer The evidence for diet, nutrition, and physical activity and colon cancer risk from the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) suggests that eating garlic may lower the risk of colon cancer; however, the updated evidence classifies this effect as “limited-no conclusion” [ 24 110 82 83 41 38 8 The effect of CGE on the proliferation of human cancer cell lines and a mouse macrophage line (TIB-71), comprising hepatic (Hep-G2), colon (Caco-2), prostate (PC-3), and breast (MCF-7) cell lines, was examined in a distinct study [ 4 4 4 36 Allicin may improve the cytotoxicity of CPT-11, a topoisomerase I inhibitor used as a first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic colorectal cancers [ 87 75 Pancreatic cancer Allicin's anticancer effects were supported by an epidemiological study that linked reduced pancreatic cancer risk with increased consumption of allium plants [ 106 62 Additional evidence from [ 1 96 About 50% to 75% of pancreatic tumors have inactivation of the TP53 gene on chromosome 17p, and this inactivation almost usually results from an intragenic mutation coupled with the loss of the second allele. The G1-S cell cycle checkpoint, G2-M arrest maintenance, and apoptosis induction are just a few of the crucial roles that the p53 protein plays in the cell. When p53 function is lost, cells can proliferate and survive even when their DNA is damaged, which causes more genetic abnormalities to accumulate. Neoplastic hyperplasia was detected by histological assay and it was more noticeable in the histological sections of the rats' pancreas tissue that had not received allicin treatment. According to this study, at the proper dosage, allicin may be utilized to cure NNK-induced pancreatic cancer in white albino rats [ 1 14 A study by Namita Pandey et al. found that by blocking the ROS/MAPK pathway, allicin treatment (40 µg/ml) for NSCLC lowers the expression of HIF-1 and HIF-2 in hypoxic cells [ 73 104 42 61 39 Liver cancer In Jiangsu, China, a sizable population-based case–control study was carried out on the factors that can prevent liver cancer [ 95 60 These findings were observed both in individuals who regularly consumed alcohol and in those with no family history of liver cancer. Liu et al. [ 60 23 In HepG2 cells, allicin has been demonstrated to lower the levels of cytoplasmic P53, Bcl-2, and the PI3K/mTOR signaling pathway while increasing the expression of the AMPK/TSC2 and Beclin-1 signaling pathways. It has also been demonstrated that allicin causes mitochondria in cancer cells to degrade, suggesting that it encourages the autophagy of cancer cells [ 82 22 82 Allicin and its secondary metabolites can protect cells from the damaging effects of carcinogens and chemotherapy. The antigenotoxic activity of several garlic-derived organic supercompounds (OSCs)—allicin, DAS, DADS, SAC, and AM—was assessed in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 using the comet test. The genotoxicity of the direct-acting substances methyl methane sulfonate and hydrogen peroxide was reduced by all of the OSCs that were studied [ 11 112 57 Safety aspects The safety profile of allicin is critical when this compound is used therapeutically, especially for GI cancer therapy. Allicin, derived from garlic, has been part of the diet for centuries and is most likely safe for consumption. However, because of its strong biological activity, its possible toxicity and negative effects must be carefully considered. One randomized controlled trial indicated that high doses of allicin in sensitive individuals lead to sleeplessness, vomiting, heartburn, fainting, diarrhea, tachycardia, nausea, bloating, flushing, headache, mild orthostatic hypotension, sweating, offensive odor, and flatulence [ 29 55 6 2 78 37 66 37 38 16 31 68 Conclusion and future perspectives The bioactive compound allicin, derived from garlic, has been found to hold tremendous potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of GI cancers. Allicin induces apoptosis, inhibits cell proliferation, and modulates key signaling pathways that underpin its potential as a useful addition to the armamentarium of cancer therapies. Nanotechnology advancements and synergistic therapeutic approaches have significantly increased its clinical potential because of its instability and fast metabolism. These novel approaches increase the bioavailability of allicin, ensure targeted delivery, and reduce systemic toxicity, thereby increasing its therapeutic efficacy. Additionally, this synergistic effect has been shown to combine allicin with conventional chemotherapeutic agents in the context of drug resistance to chemotherapy and better treatment outcomes, probably with reduced side effects. Allicin, induces apoptosis by activating intrinsic and extrinsic cell death mechanisms, inhibits cell proliferation by interfering with cell cycle regulators, and suppresses angiogenesis, thereby restricting tumor growth. Additionally, allicin modulates key signaling pathways such as NF-κB, MAPK, and p53, which are crucial in cancer progression. However, its effects vary across different gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, with variations in its impact on metastatic potential, immune modulation, and oxidative stress response. These cancer-specific differences highlight allicin's potential for targeted therapeutic strategies tailored to distinct tumor types. While studies performed on animals have offered a promising foundation for the application of allicin in cancer treatment, many more clinical studies are needed. Clinical research should ultimately be performed to establish optimal dosing regimens and assess long-term safety and potential drug interactions. Such studies should further test its efficacy with other therapeutic agents to better elucidate its anticancer properties. These delivery systems based on nanotechnology could be further developed and head toward increasingly sophisticated systems to increase both the stability and bioavailability of allicin. Research on the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of allicin could be pursued, and potential biomarkers for both sensitivity and resistance could be further investigated. Future studies could further substantiate new insights into the therapeutic potential of allicin by further elucidating its role in modulating the tumor microenvironment and immune response. In this context, allicin represents an exciting candidate for GI cancer treatment. If research continues and new delivery technologies evolve in the future, allicin will likely become standard for cancer therapy, providing hope for better outcomes and improvement in quality of life for patients.
