Despite significant advancements in understanding the genetic foundations of BC, numerous research initiatives have historically focused on protein-coding genes, which constitute merely about 2% of the human genome. This focus has produced significant insights into oncogenes such as HER2, TP53, and BRCA1, along with tumor suppressor genes. Nonetheless, it has led to the non-coding portions of the genome garnering relatively less focus. Recent studies illuminate the crucial significance of non-coding DNA in cancer biology, highlighting its regulatory roles and influence on tumor formation, metastasis, and treatment resistance. This review examines the importance of non-coding DNA in BC. It provides an in-depth analysis of essential non-coding regions, their functions in gene regulation and chromatin structure, and their implications for various BC subtypes. Examining these facets, we seek to reveal the potential of non-coding DNA as a viable source of novel diagnostic markers and treatment approaches.

Introduction Breast cancer (BC) remains a significant global health challenge, characterized by its prevalence and molecular complexity [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 5 Once dismissed as junk DNA, the non-coding genome is now recognized as a rich repository of regulatory components that govern gene expression, chromatin structure, and cellular identity. Approximately 98% of the human genome comprises non-coding DNA, encompassing diverse elements such as enhancers, promoters, silencers, and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) [ 7 8 9 MYC 10 BRCA1 11 Figure 1 BC is a highly heterogeneous disease characterized by distinct molecular subtypes, including luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like/TNBC [ 12 13 Figure 2 14 15 16 FOXA1 ESR1 17 18 HER2 19 20 21 22 23 HOTAIR 24 25 This review comprehensively explores the functional consequences of non-coding mutations in breast cancer (BC). We elucidate how these mutations interfere with regulatory networks controlling gene expression, chromatin structure, and cellular identity, thereby contributing to tumor heterogeneity and aggressiveness. By understanding the functional ramifications of these mutations, we can identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Integrating non-coding mutation analysis into clinical practice represents a significant advancement with the potential to revolutionize BC diagnosis, treatment, and management, ultimately improving patient outcomes. 2. Key Non-Coding Elements and Their Regulatory Functions 2.1. Enhancers and Super-Enhancers Enhancers are distal regulatory elements that significantly boost the transcription of target genes by interacting with their promoters, often through chromatin looping [ 26 27 28 29 30 In the evolving landscape of cancer research, the intricate roles of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as a central area of inquiry, moving beyond their initial perception as transcriptional noise. A series of recent studies collectively highlights their profound and multifaceted impact on tumorigenesis, particularly in BC. These ncRNAs are not mere bystanders; rather, they are active participants in fundamental cellular processes, including DNA repair, gene expression regulation, and shaping the tumor microenvironment. A nuanced understanding of their mechanisms is essential for identifying new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. A compelling and recurring theme within this research is the dual nature of ncRNAs, which can function as either tumor suppressors or oncogenic drivers, depending on the specific context. For instance, some miRNAs act as potent tumor suppressors. Recent research [ 31 32 Conversely, other ncRNAs actively promote cancer progression. A critical insight into this has been provided by focusing on lncRNA LINP1 in the TNBC [ 33 34 These studies also underscore the intricate crosstalk between ncRNAs and established oncogenes and tumor suppressors. A recent study [ 35 36 Ultimately, these findings are transforming our approach to cancer by pointing to the significant potential of ncRNAs as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. A recent article is particularly promising in this regard [ 37 38 Table 1 2.2. Introns Introns, non-coding sequences within genes, are spliced out during mRNA processing [ 39 40 41 42 2.3. Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs) Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins but play critical roles in gene regulation. They function as molecular scaffolds, decoys, or guides, influencing chromatin remodeling, transcription, and post-transcriptional regulation [ 9 43 44 2.4. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs (~22 nucleotides) that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs, leading to mRNA degradation or translational repression [ 45 46 47 pharmaceuticals-18-01370-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Diverse Roles of lncRNAs, miRNAs, circRNAs, snoRNAs, and piRNAs in BC Pathobiology. Type of ncRNA Example Functional Role in BC Implications References  Long Non-Coding RNAs (lncRNAs) HOTAIR Promotes chromatin remodeling via interaction with PRC2; silences tumor suppressor genes. Drives metastasis and therapy resistance in luminal and TNBC subtypes. [ 43 MALAT1 Regulates alternative splicing and gene expression; enhances chemoresistance. Associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis in TNBC. [ 48 NEAT1 Facilitates nuclear paraspeckle formation; regulates DNA repair and cell cycle progression. Promotes tumor growth and chemoresistance in TNBC. [ 49 PVT1 Interacts with MYC to upregulate PD-L1; promotes immune evasion. Enhances immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy in basal-like/TNBC. [ 50 XIST Regulates X-chromosome inactivation; modulates chromatin structure. Implicated in tumor progression and therapy resistance in luminal and TNBC subtypes. [ 51  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) miR-21 Targets tumor suppressors (PTEN, PDCD4); promotes oncogenic signaling. Drives tumor growth and chemoresistance in TNBC and HER2-enriched subtypes. [ 52 miR-200 family Inhibits EMT by targeting ZEB1/ZEB2; suppresses metastasis. Downregulated in TNBC; restoration inhibits EMT and reduces tumor aggressiveness. [ 53 miR-125a/b Targets HER2; inhibits oncogenic signaling. Downregulated in HER2-positive BCs; restoration reduces HER2 levels and tumor growth. [ 54 miR-34a Regulates cell cycle and apoptosis; targets MYC and BCL2. Downregulated in TNBC, restoration induces apoptosis and unsensitizeses tumors to therapy. [ 55 miR-205 Targets HER2 and other oncogenic pathways; inhibits tumor growth.

[ 61  Piwi-Interacting RNAs (piRNAs) piR-823 Regulates DNA methylation and gene silencing. Overexpressed in TNBC; promotes tumor growth and chemoresistance. [ 62 2.5. A Multi-Omic Approach to Prognostic and Therapeutic Stratification in Breast Cancer The molecular landscape of breast cancer is complex, and recent research has increasingly leveraged multi-omic and computational approaches to move beyond simple pathological staging toward personalized prognostic and therapeutic strategies. A significant body of work has successfully identified predictive signatures based on non-coding RNAs and other molecular markers. For instance, multiple studies have developed prognostic models using long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) signatures, which can accurately predict overall patient survival [ 63 64 63 65 Building on these foundational insights, the integration of AI and machine learning has enabled the creation of truly sophisticated, integrated prognostic tools. A prime example is the Metastatic and Immunogenomic Risk Score (MIRS), a neural network-based system that synthesizes transcriptomics data to simultaneously evaluate both metastatic potential and the tumor immune microenvironment [ 66 67 67 68 3. The Interplay Between Non-Coding DNA and Chromatin Organization 3.1. Chromatin Accessibility and 3D Genome Architecture Non-coding DNA elements, such as enhancers and promoters, play a critical role in regulating gene expression by influencing chromatin accessibility and the three-dimensional organization of the genome [ 69 70 The organization of the genome is a fundamental aspect of gene regulation. Chromatin looping and topologically associating domains (TADs) are key mechanisms that bring non-coding regulatory elements, such as enhancers, into physical proximity with their target genes, even when these elements are located far apart in the linear genome [ 71 72 Figure 3 73 In BC, disruptions in chromatin architecture, such as alterations in TAD boundaries or chromatin looping, can lead to the misregulation of gene expression. TAD boundary rearrangements can cause enhancers to interact with oncogenes that they would not normally regulate, leading to their aberrant activation [ 74 75 76 77 Recent studies have highlighted the importance of chromatin accessibility and 3D genome organization in BC biology. Research has shown that super-enhancers—clusters of enhancers with exceptionally high activity—are often located within accessible chromatin regions and play a critical role in driving the expression of oncogenes in BC [ 78 79 80 81 Targeting chromatin accessibility and 3D genome organization represents a promising therapeutic strategy in BC. inhibitors of chromatin remodelers or histone modifiers, such as BET inhibitors, have shown potential in preclinical studies by disrupting the activity of oncogenic enhancers and restoring normal gene expression patterns [ 82 3.2. Transcription Factor Recruitment Non-coding DNA is far from being a passive bystander in the genome; it serves as a dynamic platform for recruiting transcription factors (TFs) and co-regulators that orchestrate gene expression. This process is particularly critical in cancer, where the dysregulation of transcription factor binding to non-coding regions can drive oncogenic pathways. In hormone receptor-positive BCs, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and androgen receptor (AR) bind to specific enhancer regions, activating transcriptional programs that promote tumor growth and survival [ 83 The binding of transcription factors to non-coding regions is not random but is tightly regulated by the underlying DNA sequence and chromatin state. Enhancers and promoters, often marked by histone modifications such as H3K27ac and H3K4me3, provide accessible platforms for TF binding. However, mutations or epigenetic alterations in these regions can disrupt this finely tuned process. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or structural variations in enhancers can alter the binding affinity of TFs, leading to the aberrant activation or repression of target genes [ 84 85 One of the most compelling examples of transcription factor recruitment in cancer is the role of ERα in luminal BC. ERα binds to thousands of enhancer regions across the genome, many in non-coding regions. These enhancers, often called estrogen response elements (EREs), drive gene expression in cell proliferation and survival. Recent studies have shown that the activity of these enhancers is not static but can be dynamically regulated by hormonal signals and epigenetic modifications. The depletion of ERα-bound enhancers has been shown to suppress tumor growth in preclinical models, highlighting their potential as therapeutic targets [ 86 Similarly, the androgen receptor (AR) plays a critical role in BC, particularly in TNBC, where AR signaling can drive tumor progression. AR binds to enhancers and promoters in a ligand-dependent manner, activating transcriptional programs that promote cell survival and resistance to therapy. Recent research has revealed that AR can interact with non-coding RNAs, such as lncRNAs, to modulate its transcriptional activity. This crosstalk between TFs and non-coding elements adds another complexity to regulating gene expression in cancer [ 87 The dysregulation of transcription factor recruitment is not limited to hormone receptors. Other TFs, such as NF-κB, STAT3, and AP-1, also rely on non-coding DNA for their function. In BC, the aberrant activation of these TFs has been linked to inflammation, immune evasion, and metastasis. NF-κB binds to enhancers that drive the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, creating a tumor-promoting microenvironment. Targeting these interactions through small molecule inhibitors or epigenetic modulators represents a promising therapeutic strategy [ 82 Despite these advances, several challenges remain. The non-coding genome’s complexity and regulatory networks make it difficult to predict the functional consequences of specific mutations or alterations. Moreover, the context-dependent nature of TF binding, influenced by cell type, developmental stage, and environmental cues, adds another layer of complexity. However, recent technological advancements, such as ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and CRISPR-based screens, provide unprecedented insights into non-coding DNA’s role in transcription factor recruitment and gene regulation [ 81 4. Epigenetic Regulation by Non-Coding DNA 4.1. DNA Methylation One of the well-characterized epigenetic modifications is DNA methylation, typically occurring at CpG islands within promoter regions. Hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene promoters is a common event in BC, leading to their silencing and subsequent loss of tumor-suppressive functions. For instance, the hypermethylation of the BRCA1 88 89 4.2. Histone Modifications Histone modifications, such as acetylation and methylation, are another layer of epigenetic regulation influenced by non-coding DNA. lncRNAs like HOTAIR MALAT1 90 91 4.3. Non-Coding RNAs and Chromatin Remodeling The role of ncRNAs in chromatin remodeling extends beyond histone modifications. They can also influence chromatin compaction and accessibility, thereby regulating the transcriptional activity of genes. The lncRNA XIST 51 92 In addition to enhancers, lncRNAs play a critical role in regulating ER signaling and chromatin remodeling in luminal BCs. lncRNAs are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins but function as regulators of gene expression. They can act as molecular scaffolds, decoys, or guides, influencing chromatin structure, transcription, and post-transcriptional regulation [ 93 94 One of the well-characterized lncRNAs in luminal BC is HOTAIR (HOX transcript antisense RNA), which is frequently overexpressed in ER-positive tumors. HOTAIR interacts with the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to silence tumor suppressor genes and promote tumor growth and metastasis [ 90 43 Another lncRNA implicated in luminal BC is MALAT1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1), which regulates alternative splicing and gene expression. MALAT1 is overexpressed in luminal BCs and has been shown to enhance ERα-mediated transcription by acting as a scaffold for chromatin-modifying enzymes [ 48 Epigenetic changes in non-coding regions are not only drivers of tumorigenesis but also contribute to therapeutic resistance. For example, in hormone receptor-positive BCs, epigenetic silencing of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) target genes can lead to resistance to endocrine therapies like tamoxifen [ 95 96 4.4. Therapeutic Targeting of Epigenetic Regulators Targeting epigenetic regulators represents a promising therapeutic strategy in BC. Drugs such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDAC inhibitors) and DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMT inhibitors) have shown potential in preclinical and clinical studies by reversing aberrant epigenetic modifications and restoring normal gene expression patterns [ 97 4.5. The Dynamic Interplay of m6A Epitranscriptomics and Cancer Progression In the rapidly evolving field of oncology, a new paradigm is emerging that positions the epitranscriptome, and specifically N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modifications, as a central regulatory force in carcinogenesis and therapeutic resistance. No longer considered a static post-transcriptional event, the m6A modification landscape is a dynamic and intricate system whose dysregulation can fundamentally drive oncogenesis. A particularly compelling mechanistic revelation is how seemingly benign genomic mutations—the synonymous mutations that do not alter the amino acid sequence of a protein—can profoundly impact tumor biology by disrupting m6A modification sites. Multiple systematic studies have now established a clear prevalence of these “silent” mutations within the m6A regulatory motifs across a wide spectrum of human cancers [ 98 99 100 Moreover, the clinical ramifications of a dysregulated m6A epitranscriptome extend beyond tumor initiation, significantly impacting a tumor’s response to therapy. A striking example is seen in bladder cancer, where a reduction in m6A levels on transcripts such as SLC7A11 leads to enhanced mRNA stability and protein expression, ultimately conferring resistance to standard chemotherapy [ 101 102 103 5. Relevance of Non-Coding RNA to BC BC is a highly heterogeneous disease, encompassing multiple molecular subtypes that exhibit distinct genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic profiles. These subtypes, including luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and TNBC, are driven by unique regulatory mechanisms that influence tumor behavior, treatment response, and patient outcomes ( Figure 4 104 105 5.1. Non-Coding RNAs in Luminal Subtypes Luminal A and luminal B BCs, which are hormone receptor-positive (HR+), account for the majority of BC cases [ 106 107 Similarly, MALAT1 has been shown to enhance ERα-mediated transcription by acting as a scaffold for chromatin-modifying enzymes, leading to the activation of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival [ 108 miRNAs also play a critical role in luminal subtypes by regulating key components of hormone signaling pathways. For example, miR-206 has been identified as a negative regulator of ERα expression, and its downregulation in luminal BCs contributes to the hyperactivation of ERα signaling [ 109 110 5.2. Non-Coding RNAs in HER2-Enriched Subtypes HER2-enriched BCs are characterized by the amplification and overexpression of the HER2/ERBB2 gene, which drives aggressive tumor behavior [ 111 112 113 miRNAs also play a significant role in regulating HER2 signaling. miR-125a and miR-125b, which are frequently downregulated in HER2-positive BCs, act as tumor suppressors by targeting HER2 and other components of the HER2 signaling pathway [ 54 114 5.3. Non-Coding RNAs in Triple-Negative BC (TNBC) TNBC, which lacks expression of ERα, PR, and HER2, is the most aggressive and heterogeneous subtype of BC [ 115 116 117 lncRNAs such as HOTAIR and NEAT1 have been implicated in the pathogenesis of TNBC. HOTAIR, which is overexpressed in TNBC, promotes tumor growth and metastasis by silencing tumor suppressor genes and activating oncogenic pathways [ 118 49 miRNAs also play a critical role in TNBC by regulating key signaling pathways such as the PI3K/AKT and NF-κB pathways. For example, miR-200c, which is frequently downregulated in TNBC, acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting ZEB1 and ZEB2, key regulators of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [ 53 119 120 5.4. Non-Coding RNAs as Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets The dysregulation of ncRNAs in BC subtypes has significant implications for the development of biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. For example, the expression levels of specific lncRNAs and miRNAs have been shown to correlate with tumor stage, grade, and patient outcomes, making them valuable prognostic and predictive biomarkers [ 121 Several approaches are being explored to target ncRNAs in BC, including antisense oligonucleotides, small molecule inhibitors, and RNA-based therapies. Antisense oligonucleotides targeting HOTAIR have shown promise in preclinical studies by inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis in luminal and TNBC subtypes [ 122 123 6. Non-Coding Elements in BC Subtypes 6.1. Luminal Subtypes (ER+/PR+) Luminal BC, characterized by the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR), represents the most common subtype of BC. These tumors are driven by estrogen signaling, which promotes cell proliferation and survival by activating ER target genes. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying ER signaling are complex and involve coding genes and non-coding elements such as enhancers and lncRNAs. These elements play a critical role in shaping the transcriptional landscape of luminal BCs and contribute to the development of endocrine therapy resistance. Understanding the interplay between ER signaling, enhancers, and lncRNAs is essential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and improving outcomes for patients with luminal BC. Table 2 Luminal BC, characterized by the expression of estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR), represents the most common subtype of BC. These tumors are driven by estrogen signaling, which promotes cell proliferation and survival by activating ER target genes. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying ER signaling are complex and involve coding genes and non-coding elements such as enhancers and lncRNAs [ 157 158 159 160 Table 3 In luminal BCs, ERα binds to specific enhancer regions, known as estrogen response elements (EREs), to regulate gene expression in cell proliferation, survival, and metabolism. The enhancer landscape of luminal BCs is highly dynamic and is shaped by the interplay between ERα, co-regulators, and chromatin-modifying enzymes [ 172 8 173 174 175 6.2. HER2-Enriched Subtype The HER2-enriched subtype of BC, defined by the amplification and overexpression of the HER2 (ERBB2) oncogene, represents approximately 15–20% of all BCs [ 176 177 178 179 6.2.1. HER2 Amplification and Enhancer Activity The amplification of the HER2 gene is a hallmark of the HER2-enriched subtype, but this amplification often extends to adjacent regulatory regions, including enhancers. Enhancers are distal regulatory elements that increase the transcription of target genes by interacting with promoters through chromatin looping. In HER2-amplified BCs, enhancers within the HER2 locus are co-amplified, leading to the overexpression of HER2 and its downstream signaling pathways. Recent studies have identified super-enhancers—clusters of highly active enhancers—near the HER2 gene in HER2-enriched BCs [ 8 180 6.2.2. miRNAs in HER2 Regulation and Signaling miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding target mRNAs’ 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), leading to their degradation or translational repression. In HER2-enriched BCs, miRNAs play a dual role in regulating HER2 expression and modulating downstream signaling pathways. One of the most well-studied miRNAs in HER2-positive BC is miR-21, which is frequently overexpressed in this subtype. miR-21 promotes HER2 signaling by targeting tumor suppressor genes such as PTEN and PDCD4, which negatively regulate the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways [ 181 52 182 56 6.2.3. Non-Coding Mutations in HER2 Regulatory Regions In addition to enhancers and miRNAs, non-coding mutations in regulatory regions of HER2 or its co-expressed genes can contribute to HER2 overexpression and therapy resistance. These mutations can alter the binding of transcription factors, disrupt enhancer–promoter interactions, or create novel regulatory elements that drive HER2 expression. For example, mutations in the HER2 promoter region have been identified in HER2-positive BCs and are associated with increased HER2 expression and poor prognosis [ 183 184 185 6.3. TNBC and Basal-Like (BLBC) Subtype 6.3.1. miRNAs in TNBC/BLBC: The miR-200 Family and EMT miR-21 promotes tumor growth and chemoresistance [ 2 186 187 188 189 190 6.3.2. Immune Evasion and Therapeutic Opportunities One of the hallmarks of BLBCs is their ability to evade immune surveillance, which contributes to their aggressive behavior and resistance to therapy. Non-coding elements play a critical role in regulating immune evasion in BLBCs by modulating the expression of immune checkpoint molecules and other factors involved in the tumor-immune interaction. The lncRNA PVT1, which is frequently overexpressed in BLBCs, promotes immune evasion by upregulating the expression of PD-L1, a key immune checkpoint molecule. PVT1 interacts with the transcription factor MYC to enhance PD-L1 expression, enabling BLBC cells to evade immune detection. Inhibition of PVT1 has been shown to reduce PD-L1 levels and enhance immune-mediated tumor killing, suggesting that targeting PVT1 could be a promising strategy for immunotherapy in BLBCs [ 50 190 The basal-like subtype of BC is characterized by distinct chromatin landscapes and non-coding RNA profiles that drive tumor aggressiveness, stemness, and immune evasion [ 191 192 193 194 195 196 7. Therapeutic Challenges and Future Directions in BC Research 7.1. General Challenges and Future Directions The functional redundancy and context-dependent nature of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) complicate their therapeutic targeting. Additionally, the delivery of RNA-based therapies to tumor cells remains a significant hurdle [ 197 198 199 7.2. Endocrine Therapy Resistance: Mechanisms and Implications in Luminal BC Endocrine therapies, such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, are the cornerstone of treatment for luminal BCs [ 200 201 202 Upregulation of growth factor receptor pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling cascade, has been implicated in diminishing the efficacy of endocrine treatments [ 203 204 205 One of the key mechanisms of resistance is the dysregulation of enhancers and ER-binding sites. Mutations in the ESR1 gene, common in endocrine-resistant luminal BCs, can create novel ER-binding sites that drive the expression of genes involved in therapy resistance [ 159 206 lncRNAs also play a critical role in endocrine therapy resistance. For example, HOTAIR has been shown to promote resistance to tamoxifen by silencing tumor suppressor genes and activating oncogenic pathways [ 207 208 7.3. Therapeutic Opportunities and Future Directions in Luminal BC The dysregulation of enhancers and lncRNAs in luminal BCs presents unique therapeutic opportunities. Targeting enhancer activity could restore normal ER signaling and sensitize tumors to endocrine therapies. Small molecule inhibitors of enhancer-associated proteins, such as BET inhibitors, have shown promise in preclinical studies by disrupting super-enhancers’ activity and reducing oncogenes’ expression [ 209 Several approaches are being explored to target lncRNAs in luminal BCs, including antisense oligonucleotides, small molecule inhibitors, and RNA-based therapies. For instance, antisense oligonucleotides targeting HOTAIR have shown efficacy in preclinical models by inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis [ 122 123 Luminal BCs are driven by estrogen receptor signaling, which is tightly regulated by enhancers and lncRNAs [ 210 211 212 121 213 214 122 215 216 8. Conclusions The dysregulation of ncRNAs in BC underscores their critical role in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and therapy resistance. lncRNAs such as HOTAIR and MALAT1 drive chromatin remodeling and transcriptional reprogramming, contributing to the aggressive behavior of luminal and TNBC subtypes. miRNAs, including the miR-200 family and miR-21, regulate key signaling pathways such as EMT, HER2 signaling, and immune evasion, making them promising therapeutic targets. circRNAs and snoRNAs, though less studied, are emerging as important regulators of gene expression and RNA processing, with potential implications for biomarker development and targeted therapies. piRNAs, a relatively new class of ncRNAs, are also gaining attention for their role in epigenetic regulation and tumor progression. The integration of ncRNA profiling into clinical practice could revolutionize the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of BC. For example, targeting HOTAIR or MALAT1 with antisense oligonucleotides could modulate chemoresistance in TNBC, while restoring miR-200 family expression could inhibit metastasis in basal-like subtypes. Furthermore, developing circRNA-based biomarkers could improve the early detection of HER2-positive BCs and predict responses to therapy. By unraveling the complex regulatory networks involving ncRNAs, we can develop more effective treatments that address the root causes of BC heterogeneity and resistance.

Treat. 2015 152 199 208 10.1007/s10549-015-3431-2 26033707 Figure 1 Transcriptional regulation and non-coding mutations in BC. This figure illustrates the complex molecular mechanisms of gene regulation and transcription in eukaryotic cells, highlighting how non-coding DNA elements influence cancer development. Non-coding DNA encompasses diverse elements such as enhancers, promoters, silencers, and ncRNAs. These elements exert precise control over gene expression by modulating transcription, RNA splicing, and chromatin organization. The diagram shows DNA with various regulatory elements and protein complexes involved in transcription. Enhancers, which are distal regulatory sequences, interact with promoters through chromatin looping to enhance transcription, as visualized in the top portion of the figure. The central area shows the assembly of the transcriptional apparatus, including the activator protein (brown), mediator complex (light tan), and promoter region with a TATA box motif. The right side displays the sequential assembly of basal transcription factors (TBP, TFIID, IIB, IIA, IIE, IIF, and IIH) forming the pre-initiation complex, leading to RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) activity. In BC, mutations within these non-coding regions can disrupt intricate regulatory networks, as illustrated by the two highlighted examples: mutations near the MYC BRCA1 Figure 2 BCs are commonly classified into several subtypes based on the expression of hormone receptors and HER2. Luminal A BC is characterized by the absence of HER2 expression. Luminal B BC may be either positive or negative for progesterone receptors (PR). HER2-positive BC typically lacks both progesterone (PR) and estrogen receptor (ER) expression. TNBC is defined by the absence of all three markers: PR, ER, and HER2. Figure 3 Chromatin architecture and its role in gene regulation and BC. The spatial organization of the genome within the nucleus is structured into chromosomal territories and subdivided into topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are genomic regions with high internal chromatin interactions and are classified as either active compartments (green) or repressed compartments (pink). This 3D organization ensures precise enhancer–promoter interactions within the same TAD. In cancer, disrupted TAD boundaries may lead to the mislocalization of enhancers, resulting in aberrant oncogene activation or tumor suppressor silencing, as shown in the middle panel. The zoomed-in view depicts an active TAD compartment, highlighting super-enhancers that drive oncogene expression in BC through abnormal chromatin looping. On the right, tools like Hi-C (3D genome mapping) and ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility profiling) are shown, which help decode genome organization and enhancer landscapes in cancer research. Figure 4 Heatmap of non-coding mutations across BC subtypes. The heatmap illustrates the presence of specific non-coding mutations across three major BC subtypes: Luminal, HER2+, and TNBC. Each row represents a unique regulatory mutation or region, while each column corresponds to a cancer subtype. Color intensity reflects the presence of mutations, with deeper red shades indicating confirmed involvement of that mutation in the corresponding subtype. Data were curated from peer-reviewed genomic studies, including germline variants, somatic promoter/enhancer mutations, and structural regulatory alterations linked to subtype-specific gene expression patterns and tumor progression. pharmaceuticals-18-01370-t002_Table 2 Table 2 Key examples of non-coding mutations and their impacts in BC.

Non-Coding Mutation Location Nucleotide Change Pathogenicity/Significance Reference TERT Chromosome 5p15.33 C228T or C250T The mutations create a new binding site for ETS/TCF transcription factors, leading to the overexpression of telomerase, a key hallmark of cancer, which promotes unlimited cell proliferation. While rare in breast cancer, these mutations are considered pathogenic. [ 161 MYC Chromosome 8q24 Point mutations and SNPs (e.g., rs13281615) Mutations in this region, which is ~2 Mb from the MYC [ 162 163 164 PIM1 Chromosome 6p21.2 Various mutations Mutations within the super-enhancer of the PIM1 PIM1 [ 165 166 167 168 miR-126 promoter Chromosome 3p21 DNA methylation While not a direct mutation, hypermethylation of the miR-126 promoter silences its expression. Since miR-126 acts as a tumor suppressor, its loss promotes metastasis and is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. [ 169 170 171 ",
