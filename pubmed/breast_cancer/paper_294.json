Their neovasculature arises through both angiogenesis and vascular co-option, generating heterogeneous microvascular patterns, often associated with microvascular proliferations (MVPs). The transition from an intact blood–brain barrier (BBB) to a dysfunctional blood–brain tumor barrier (BBTB) involves progressive disruption of the neurovascular unit (NVU), yet the phenotypic identity of tumor-associated endothelial cells (ECs) remains poorly characterized. Methods We investigated the endothelial phenotype in 22 adult-type diffuse gliomas (glioblastoma, astrocytoma grade 4 and 3, oligodendroglioma grade 3 and 2) by immunohistochemical analysis of two EC markers: P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a transporter associated with mature BBB phenotype, and CD146, an adhesion molecule linked to immature, mesenchymal-like ECs. Expression was assessed in the vascular endothelium, perivascular, and extravascular compartments using both qualitative evaluation and morphometric quantification on digital slides. Results Our findings revealed heterogeneous expression patterns of P-gp and CD146 among glioma subtypes. P-gp expression decreased progressively from oligodendrogliomas to glioblastomas, in line with increasing vascular dedifferentiation. Conversely, CD146 expression was higher in high-grade tumors, particularly in proliferating vessels and perivascular regions. These opposing trends reflected a gradual phenotypic shift from BBB-like to BBTB-like microvasculature, correlating with tumor histotype and grade. Conclusion P-gp and CD146 represent complementary markers of endothelial identity in gliomas and may serve as histopathological indicators of BBB integrity and tumor vascular remodeling. Their combined evaluation offers a novel insight into the BBB–BBTB transition and may support microvascular phenotyping as an adjunct criterion for glioma grading.

According to the 2021 WHO Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System, they are divided into three molecularly and histologically distinct types: Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, which includes WHO grades 2, 3, and 4; Oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant, 1p/19q co-deleted, classified as WHO grade 2 or 3; Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype, which is intrinsically a WHO grade 4 tumor [ 1 3 Despite advances in integrated diagnostics and multimodal therapies, including maximal safe resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the prognosis of diffuse gliomas remains poor, especially for glioblastoma. Overall survival (OS) varies significantly across tumor types and grades, with glioblastoma showing a median OS of 15–18 months, astrocytoma grade 4 approximately 3 years, grade 3 up to 5–10 years, oligodendroglioma grade 3 around 14 years, and grade 2 over 17 years [ 4 5 In addition to molecular features, classical histopathological markers—such as microvascular proliferation (MVP) and necrosis—remain pivotal for tumor grading. The vascular architecture of gliomas can be highly complex and includes distinctive patterns such as microvascular sprouting, vascular clusters, garlands, and glomeruloid vessels, which are more frequently associated with high-grade gliomas such as glioblastoma and high-grade astrocytoma and oligodendroglioma (Supplementary Fig. 1) [ 6 Glioma vascularization results from both the recruitment of pre-existing vessels (vascular co-option) and newly formed vessels via angiogenesis and vasculogenesis. These processes are tightly connected to the functional integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), which is often compromised in high-grade gliomas [ 7 8 13 Recent literature has increasingly emphasized the diagnostic and prognostic relevance of vascular alterations in gliomas. Digital pathology and morphometric approaches have been employed to quantify microvascular patterns and support histological grading. At the same time, studies focusing on BBB/NVU dysfunction have underscored the dynamic nature of the BBB–BBTB transition, highlighting the loss of tight junctions, endothelial plasticity, and barrier heterogeneity [ 14 18 19 25 26 26 26 27 28 Within this context, molecules such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CD146 have gained attention as markers of the dynamic heterogeneity of tumor endothelial phenotypes. Notably, they belongs to anticorrelated groups of molecules inversely regulated in endothelial vs. tumor cells, making them potential indicators for monitoring the transition from the BBB to the BBTB, while also unveiling changes occurring within the tumor microenvironment [ 18 26 28 P-gp is the first member of the ATP-biding cassette (ABC) transporters, also known as multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) involved in both physiological protection (e.g., BBB and placental barrier) and acquired multidrug resistance in cancer [ 29 31 32 34 34 35 36 37 38 40 In this study, we investigated, by immunohistochemistry and morphometric analysis, the vascular distribution patterns of P-gp and CD146 as markers of the tumor microvascular phenotypes across a series of adult-type diffuse glioma histotypes. In this context, the dual-marker histotype-specific comparative analysis, applied as a status indicator of the BBB-BBTB transition, revealed its potential value as a histopathological grading criterion. Integrating glioma molecular markers with histopathological features and BBB-BBTB transition analytical data, may thus offer a more refined and biologically relevant classification of adult-type diffuse gliomas. Methods Case selection, patients and ethical approval A total of 22 patients diagnosed with adult-type diffuse gliomas were retrospectively selected for this study. All patients underwent neurosurgical procedures between 2021 and 2023 at the Neurosurgery Unit of the University of Bari “Aldo Moro”, Polyclinic Hospital of Bari. Surgical interventions included craniotomy with tumor resection or stereotactic biopsy, with or without the use of intraoperative neuro-navigation systems. Histopathological evaluation was performed at the Pathology Unit of the same institution, and the diagnosis was rendered according to the 5th edition of the World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System [ 1 Histological and immunohistochemical analyses All tissue samples were collected and processed at the Pathology Unit and the Human Anatomy and Histology Unit of the University of Bari “Aldo Moro”, Polyclinic Hospital of Bari. A total of 22 tumor samples were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded using standard protocols. For each case, three serial 4 µm-thick sections were obtained from representative tumor blocks. One section was stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological evaluation, while the other two were used for immunohistochemical staining to detect the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CD146. P-gp immunostaining was performed manually at Anatomy and Histology Unit, Bari University School of Medicine, according to the following protocol: deparaffination by heating slides in a tissue-drying oven for 1 h at 60°C; washing in twice in xylene for 10 min each at room temperature (RT); rehydration in a graded alcohol scale; rinsing in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.025% Triton X-100 (TBS-Tr) (TBS: pH 7.4, Cat. ab64248, Abcam, Cambridge, U.K. Triton X-100: Cat. X100, Merk Life Science S.r.l); antigen retrieval procedure in Dako Target Retrieval Solution (Cat. S1699, Agilent Dako Technologies, Glostrup, Denmark) for 20 min at 96–98°C in thermostatic bath; blocking of endogenous enzyme activity using Dual Endogenous Enzyme-Blocking solution (Cat. S2003, Dako Agilent Technologies) for 10 min at RT; incubation with anti-P-gp monoclonal antibody (1:20; Cat. SIG-38720, clone C494, Signet Laboratories, Dedham, MA, USA) for 30 min at RT; detection with HRP Plus Detection IHC Kit (Cat. ab93697, Abcam) for 10 min at RT followed by 3,3’-Diaminobenzidine DAB Chromogen Kit (Cod. DB801 L, Biocare Medical, Pacheco, CA, USA) for 2 min at RT; nuclear counterstaining with Gill no.1 hematoxylin (Cat. GHS132-1 L, Sigma-Aldrich, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Finally, slides were mounted with Glycergel Aqueous Mounting Medium (Cat. C056330-2, Dako Agilent Technologies). CD146 immunostaining was performed using the Autostainer Link 48 (Dako Agilent, Carpinteria, CA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, at the Pathology Unit, Bari University School of Medicine, according to the following protocol: dewaxing and inhibition of endogenous peroxidase activity (PBS/3% hydrogen peroxide); antigen retrieval with the Envision Flex Target Retrieval Solution High pH in a PT Link Rinse Station (Dako Agilent); incubation with anti-CD146 monoclonal antibody (1:200; Cat. MA5-29413; Thermo Fisher Scientific); detection with EnVision + HRP Labelled Polymer (Dako Agilent) followed by EnVision Flex DAB substrate chromogen (Dako Agilent); nuclear counterstaining with Mayer’s hematoxylin. Finally, slides were mounted with Glycergel Aqueous Mounting Medium (Cat. C056330-2, Dako Agilent Technologies). Negative controls were prepared by omitting the primary antibody and mismatching the secondary antibodies. Sections of human placenta and fetal brain were utilized as positive control for both P-gP and CD146. The slides were examined using an Olympus BX60 bright-field microscope at 20× magnification, and subsequently scanned with a NanoZoomer S60 digital scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics) using a 20× objective lens (resulting in 40× digital magnification) to generate a digital archive for downstream image analysis. Morphometric analysis A morphometric analysis was performed on the digitally acquired immunostained sections for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CD146, scanned using the NanoZoomer S60 digital scanner (Hamamatsu Photonics). The analysis was conducted by two independent observers (G.F. and M.A.), blinded to patient characteristics and group allocation of all biopsy specimens, using a semi-automated interactive protocol combining Adobe Photoshop and ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, USA). The mean values from the two independent observers were used for quantitative analyses and plotted data. Interobserver agreement was 81.2%. For each patient ( n  Image preparation: Each image was opened in Adobe Photoshop, and key microanatomical structures were manually identified using the free-hand selection tool. These included: (i) proliferating and non-proliferating microvessels (the evaluation was performed by a neuropathologist (AdA), who identified proliferating vessels by features such as multilayered endothelial cells, glomeruloid structures, or endothelial hyperplasia, in contrast to thin-walled, non-proliferating capillaries, according to WHO-defined morphological criteria routinely used in the diagnostic evaluation of CNS tumors [ 1 Cropping and color adjustment: Selected regions were cropped and saved as individual JPEG files. A color thresholding process was then applied to isolate DAB-positive staining, using the following path: Image > Adjust > Replace Color. Nuclear hematoxylin counterstain (violet-blue) was removed to improve contrast. Grayscale conversion and optimization: Images were converted to grayscale and further adjusted for brightness (50) and contrast (80). Quantification: Processed images were imported into ImageJ, where the Area Fraction tool (under the Analyze menu) was used to calculate the percentage of positive pixel area (area % on the total image area) corresponding to immunoreactive signal in each region. This approach allowed for semi-quantitative assessment of marker expression in the tumor vasculature, minimizing operator bias while retaining spatial context. Statistical analysis Comparisons between groups were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test, performed using GraphPad Prism (release 6.0, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, USA). The plots showed both single patient mean values and mean value for each tumor histotype. Differences were considered statistically significant at a p-value of < 0.05. Results Clinical, radiological and pathological features Clinical, radiological, and surgical data were retrospectively collected from institutional records (Supplementary Table 1). All patients underwent preoperative brain imaging by CT and/or MRI, allowing assessment of tumor localization, necrotic core, peritumoral edema, and contrast enhancement. Histopathological and molecular classifications followed the 2021 WHO CNS criteria and are reported in Supplementary Table 1. Immunohistochemical characterization of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CD146 expression patterns To investigate the phenotypic transition of glioma vasculature from blood–brain barrier (BBB) to blood–brain tumor barrier (BBTB), we performed an extensive qualitative evaluation of P-gp and CD146 immunoreactivity in endothelial and tumor compartments, across glioma histotypes.

All three tumors showed P-gp positivity in non-proliferating vessel endothelium (Fig. 1 Oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-codeleted, grade 2 (OLIG-2, n = 3) No P-gp positivity was detected in tumor cells. However, all samples showed consistent P-gp immunostaining of endothelial cells of non-proliferating vessels (Fig. 1 CD146 immunolocalization and patterns of distribution across glioma histotypes (Supplementary table 1) Glioblastoma, IDH-wildtype (GB, n = 9) All tumors demonstrated strong CD146 reactivity in endothelial cells of both proliferating and non-proliferating vessels. Six cases (66.6%) exhibited CD146-positive tumor cells, including single neoplastic elements with gemistocytic morphology and multinucleated giant cells, which displayed complex branching processes (Fig. 2  Fig. 2 Representative images of CD146 immunolocalization in adult-type diffuse gliomas. Glioblastoma IDH-wildtype (GB), ( a c d f g–i j–l m–o Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, grade 4 (ASTR-4, n = 4) CD146 immunostaining appeared diffuse in both tumor and endothelial compartments (Fig. 2 Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, grade 3 (ASTR-3, n = 3) Diffuse CD146 staining was observed in tumor cells, with scattered CD146-positive gemistocytes in one case (33%). Endothelial positivity was restricted to non-proliferating vessels (Fig. 2 Oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-codeleted, grade 3 (OLIG-3, n = 3) All tumors were positive for CD146 in tumor cells, with stronger staining in areas with anaplastic features. Endothelial CD146 staining was observed in both vessel types (Fig. 2 Oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-codeleted, grade 2 (OLIG-2, n = 3) Tumor cells were negative for CD146 in all cases. Endothelial positivity was limited to proliferating vessels (Fig. 2 Morphometric quantitative analyses P-gp expression by morphometric evaluation Endothelial cells (ECs) Morphometric analysis confirmed a striking histotype-specific pattern.

GB showed the highest P-gp AF (0.27 ± 0.11%), significantly greater than ASTR-4 (0.04 ± 0.04%) and OLIG-3 (0.09 ± 0.07%) (GB vs. ASTR-4, p 3 Extravascular tissue (EVT) Tumor cell expression of P-gp in EVT was most prominent in GB (8.29 ± 2.02%), followed by OLIG-3 (3.65 ± 3.42%), ASTR-3 (2.86 ± 3.68%), and ASTR-4 (2.61 ± 2.48%). OLIG-2 was completely negative. GB vs. OLIG-2 reached statistical significance ( p p 3 CD146 expression by morphometric evaluation Endothelial cells (ECs) CD146 expression was proportional to tumor grade. Endothelial CD146 expression was highest in GB (0.93 ± 0.26%), followed by OLIG-3 (0.70 ± 0.36%) and ASTR-4 (0.63 ± 0.54%), with significantly lower values in ASTR-3 (0.29 ± 0.13%) and OLIG-2 (0.23 ± 0.006%) (GB vs. ASTR-3, p p 3 Hypertrophied thickened vessel walls CD146 positivity was highest in ASTR-4 (0.12 ± 0.07%), while GB (0.04 ± 0.04%) and OLIG-3 (0.003 ± 0.006%) showed lower levels. The difference between ASTR-4 and OLIG-3 was significant ( p 3 Extravascular tissue (EVT) CD146 expression in neoplastic EVT was highest in GB (1.07 ± 1.43%), followed by OLIG-3 (0.51 ± 0.06%), ASTR-4 (0.37 ± 0.22%), and ASTR-3 (0.13 ± 0.19%). OLIG-2 was consistently negative. GB vs. OLIG-2: p 3 Dual-marker comparative analysis: P-gp vs. CD146 A comparative evaluation of P-gp and CD146 expression in endothelial cells, vessel wall, and tumor parenchyma further underscored the dynamic transition from a blood–brain barrier (BBB)-like to a blood–brain tumor barrier (BBTB)-like phenotype in adult-type diffuse gliomas. This analysis revealed tumor-specific profiles, reflecting not only the grade of malignancy, but also the extent of endothelial differentiation, vascular remodeling, and the presence of stem-like or therapy-resistant cellular subpopulations. (Fig. 3 Endothelial cells (ECs) In the microvascular endothelium, a clear inverse pattern emerged between OLIG-2 and GB. Oligodendrogliomas grade 2 demonstrated high P-gp expression and minimal CD146 immunoreactivity, consistent with a preserved BBB phenotype. The statistical comparison confirmed a significant difference between P-gp and CD146 expression levels in this group ( p 3 p 3 3 Hypertrophied thickened vessel wall (TVW) In the thickened vessel wall of microvascular proliferations (MVPs), the spatial distribution of P-gp and CD146 positive cells revealed tumor-specific infiltration patterns. In glioblastoma, thickened vascular walls harbored a substantial population of P-gp-positive cells, significantly outnumbering CD146-positive elements ( p 3 p 3 Extravascular tissue (EVT) In the extravascular tumor tissue (EVT), the expression of P-gp and CD146 further reinforced the distinction between high- and low-grade gliomas. OLIG-2 consistently lacked both markers, aligning with its low aggressiveness and suggesting the absence of multidrug-resistant or stem-like cancer cells in the tumor parenchyma. In contrast, glioblastomas exhibited markedly high expression of both P-gp (8.29 ± 2.02%) and CD146 (1.07 ± 1.43%) in neoplastic cells, with a statistically significant predominance of P-g positive elements ( p 3 p 3 Taken together, the co-analysis of P-gp and CD146 expression across multiple tumor compartments revealed a robust inverse correlation at the endothelial level and a complex coexistence in tumor cells and perivascular regions. This dual-marker approach provides a refined understanding of the BBB–BBTB transition and identifies distinct microvascular and neoplastic profiles that correlate with glioma histotype and grade. To illustrate and integrate the findings presented above, a graphical summary is shown in Fig. 4  Fig. 4 Schematic representation of the main findings of this study, showing how P-gp/CD146 dual-marker expression reflects glioma histotype-specific features and the main changes that settle the transition to a blood-brain tumor barrier. Glioblastoma IDH-wildtype (GB), astrocytoma IDH-mutant grade 4 (ASTR-4), astrocytoma IDH-mutant grade 3 (ASTR-3), oligodendroglioma IDH-mutant, 1p/19q-codeleted, grade 3 (OLIG-3), and grade 2 (OLIG-2). P-gp immunostaining in yellow and CD146 immunostaining in brown; ECs, endothelial cells; PCs, pericytes; CCs, cancer cells; VBL, vessel basal lamina; TJs, Tight junctions Discussion The present study investigates the endothelial phenotype across a spectrum of adult-type diffuse gliomas by analyzing the expression of two vascular markers, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CD146, using both qualitative and morphometric approaches. These markers were selected for their complementary roles: P-gp as a canonical efflux transporter associated with blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity and multidrug resistance, and CD146 as a cell adhesion molecule linked to endothelial plasticity and tumor progression [ 13 29 32 34 37 41 P-gp expression was predominantly retained in the endothelium of non-proliferating vessels within low-grade gliomas, especially oligodendroglioma grade 2 (OLIG-2), and progressively diminished in higher-grade tumors such as glioblastoma (GB) and astrocytoma grade 4 (ASTR-4). These findings are consistent with previous evidence indicating that P-gp is a hallmark of mature BBB endothelium and is progressively lost during barrier disruption [ 13 29 42 43 41 44 45 The morphometric data corroborates the immunohistochemical observations, demonstrating that P-gp expression (quantified as area fraction) in endothelial cells was significantly higher in OLIG-2 than in GB, ASTR-4, and other histotypes, supporting the hypothesis of preserved BBB function in low-grade tumors. Conversely, CD146 endothelial expression increased with tumor grade and was particularly elevated in GB and OLIG-3, suggesting that CD146 may act as a surrogate marker of BBTB formation and vascular dedifferentiation. Notably, both markers also exhibited expression in extravascular tumor areas, particularly in high-grade gliomas, further supporting their relevance in tumor cell biology beyond endothelial phenotyping. These findings offer novel insights into the histopathological continuum of BBB–BBTB transition, which has been traditionally inferred from radiological or ultrastructural data but poorly characterized at the immunophenotypic level. Our data expand on previous studies that describe heterogeneous BBB disruption in gliomas [ 31 6 19 21 The implications of our findings are both diagnostic and translational. From a diagnostic standpoint, the dual-marker approach using P-gp and CD146 may serve as an adjunct tool for glioma grading, particularly in borderline or histologically ambiguous cases. Moreover, as both markers are involved in therapeutic resistance—P-gp by limiting chemotherapeutic penetration, and CD146 through modulation of radiotherapy resistance and invasive potential—they represent potential targets for vascular-directed therapies [ 41 44 45 However, this study is not without limitations. The sample size, though larger than previous pilot studies, remains modest ( n In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of P-gp and CD146 as complementary endothelial markers delineating the BBB–BBTB continuum in adult-type diffuse gliomas. Their differential expression according to histotype and grade reflects underlying vascular remodeling processes and may inform both diagnostic classification and therapeutic targeting. Expanding the application of vascular immunophenotyping in neuropathology could improve the granularity of glioma characterization and ultimately support the development of barrier-specific interventions in neuro-oncology.

P-gp shows strong expression in non-proliferating vessels of OLIG-2, indicative of a preserved endothelial BBB phenotype. The endothelial P-gp staining progressively decreases with increasing tumor grade, until its near-complete loss in proliferating vessels of ASTR-4 and GB. Conversely, the endothelial CD146 staining increases with malignancy: it is virtually absent in OLIG-2 and prominent in GB and ASTR-4. A parallel increase is observed in the extravascular tumor areas, except for Astr-3, that shows a limited or absent CD146 tissue staining. These opposing expression patterns shown by the dual marker comparative analysis reflect a histotype-specific shift from BBB-like to BBTB-like microvascular phenotypes.
