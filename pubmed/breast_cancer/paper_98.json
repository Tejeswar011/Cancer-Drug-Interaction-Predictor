Prior studies indicate transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) regulates the tumor microenvironment, but its mechanisms in driving LUSC progression and immune evasion remain unclear. Methods The prognostic value of TGM2 was analyzed using the TCGA LUSC cohort. Key genes were screened via Results TGM2 was an independent prognostic factor for LUSC. High TGM2 expression correlated with reduced overall survival (OS, P = 0.00018) and disease-free survival (DFS, P = 0.00019). TGM2 promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, clonogenicity, and suppressed apoptosis in LUSC cells by activating p38 MAPK signaling. Elevated TGM2 levels were associated with an immunosuppressive microenvironment: decreased Th1 (R = -0.186, P < 0.0001) and NK cell infiltration (R = -0.116, P = 0.0092), and increased M2 macrophage (R = 0.164–0.528, P < 0.0001) and cancer-associated fibroblast infiltration (R = 0.469, P < 0.0001). NR3C1 was identified as a key transcription factor regulating TGM2. ChIP-qPCR analysis confirmed that NR3C1 binds to a specific site (921-935) within the TGM2 promoter, and their expression showed a strong positive correlation (R = 0.53, P < 0.0001).

According to the latest data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, although the estimated incidence of lung cancer has decreased, it remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Current treatment modalities for lung cancer include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Among these, immunotherapy has transformed oncology by providing a favorable safety profile, inducing immune memory for sustained efficacy, and demonstrating significant effectiveness across diverse patient populations ( 8 9 10 12 In preliminary research, a predictive model based on tumor immune cell infiltration within the tumor microenvironment (TME) was developed to assess immunotherapy efficacy and differentiate “cold” from “hot” tumors in patients with LUSC ( 13 Random forest algorithms combined with Cox regression analyses identified Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) as the top prognostic gene among the 17 candidates. Its independent prognostic utility was further validated in the TCGA-LUSC cohort. TGM2, a multifunctional protein, plays key roles in tumor autophagy, metastasis, drug resistance, and pro-tumor inflammation ( 14 15 19 20 21 22 23 14 24 25 Recent studies by Chang et al. ( 26 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Data sources and processing This study integrated multi-omics data with experimental validation. Publicly available datasets used included: (1) The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-LUSC Cohort ( https://cancergenome.nih.gov 27 via https://www.cancerrxgene.org 28 https://ualcan.path.uab.edu 29 http://timer.cistrome.org/ 30 2.2 Gene screening and validation Using the immune phenotype scoring model previously developed, expression profiles of the 17 genes and patient survival data were integrated. Random forest modeling was performed with the randomForestSRC package (version 3.2.3), using parameters ntree = 1000 and nodesize = 15, to assess the significance of these genes in predicting overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). TGM2, identified as the gene with the highest prognostic significance, was selected for further analysis. Survival analysis was conducted with the survival package (version 3.5-7), and survival curves were generated with the survminer package (version 0.4.9). The optimal cutoff value for OS (TPM = 210.89) was determined using the surv_cutpoint function, based on survival-specific maximally selected rank statistics, which accounts for to respect the time-to-event nature of OS data, classifying patients into high-risk (n = 51) and low-risk (n = 444) groups. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis confirmed the independent prognostic value of TGM2, and the results were visualized using the forestploter package (version 1.1.2). 2.3 Cell culture and genetic manipulation Cell Lines and Culture Conditions: Human LUSC cell lines NCI-H520 and SK-MES-1 (Shanghai QuiCell Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37°C under 5% CO 2 TGM2 Overexpression and Knockdown: Lentiviral vectors were transfected into NCI-H520 cells to establish stable TGM2-overexpressing (TGM2-OE) cell lines. Empty vector and untreated cells served as negative controls (NC) and blank controls (Ctrl), respectively. SK-MES-1 cells were transfected with three specific siRNAs (siRNA-1, siRNA-2, and siRNA-3), with NC and Ctrl used as controls. Transfection efficiency was validated by quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) under the following conditions: 95°C for 3 min (initial denaturation); 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 30 sec, 72°C for 30 sec, followed by melt curve analysis (95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 1 min, 95°C for 15 sec) to verify amplification specificity, and Western blot analysis. Primer and siRNA sequences are listed in  Supplementary Table S1 2.4 Cellular phenotypic assays Cell Proliferation Assay: Cell proliferation was assessed using a CCK-8 kit (Shanghai Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd.) at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours post-transfection by measuring absorbance at 450 nm. Proliferation curves were generated accordingly. Migration and Invasion Assays: (1) Wound Healing Assay: Cells were seeded in 6-well plates to form a monolayer. A scratch was made using a sterile pipette tip, and wound closure was observed after 24 hours. (2) Transwell Assay: For migration assays, 2×10 4 4 Colony Formation Assay: Cells (1,000 per dish) were cultured in 6 cm dishes for 10 days, followed by crystal violet (Shanghai Beyotime Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) staining was performed after fixation. Colonies were counted manually. Apoptosis Detection: Apoptosis rates were assessed using an Annexin V-APC/7-AAD apoptosis detection kit (Wuhan Elabscience Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) by flow cytometry. 2.5 Proteomic analysis and signaling pathway validation Reverse-Phase Protein Array (RPPA) Analysis: RPPA data from TCGA-LUSC samples were downloaded to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between TGM2 high-risk and low-risk groups. Correlation analysis was performed to identify proteins significantly associated with TGM2 expression. Pathway Screening: The UALCAN database was used to identify key cancer-related signaling pathways potentially influenced by TGM2 expression. Pathway Validation: Western blotting was performed to detect key proteins and their phosphorylation levels identified in RPPA and pathway screening analyses, thereby validating the regulatory role of TGM2 in these pathways. 2.6 Immune-related pathway enrichment and immune cell infiltration analysis Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) Screening: DEGs between TGM2 high-risk and low-risk groups were identified using the limma package (version 3.56.2) ( 31 Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA): The clusterProfiler package (version 4.8.3) ( 32 via https://www.kegg.jp th Immune Infiltration Analysis: Transcriptomic data from TCGA-LUSC were uploaded to TIMER2.0 with species set to “human” and cancer type to “LUSC”. Immune cell infiltration scores were obtained and correlated with TGM2 TPM values. Statistically significant results (P < 0.05) were selected for presentation. 2.7 Exploration of transcriptional regulatory factors Potential transcriptional regulators of TGM2 were predicted by integrating data from two databases: (1) Cistrome DB Toolkit ( http://cistrome.org/db/#/ https://guolab.wchscu.cn/hTFtarget/#!/ http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn 33 To validate the direct transcriptional regulation of TGM2 by NR3C1, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed using the SimpleChIP ®  Supplementary Table S1 2.8 Statistical analysis All in vitro 3 Results 3.1 TGM2 was an independent prognostic factor in LUSC The flowchart of this study is shown in  Figure 1 13  Figure 2A  Figure 2B  Figure 2C  Figure 2D  Figure 2E  Figure 2F Figure 1 Flowchart of this study. This integrated schematic outlines the multidisciplinary approach employed in this study: Clinical-level investigations (random forest modeling, univariate/multivariate survival analysis) identified key prognostic markers; cellular phenotyping (CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, Transwell, apoptosis assays) characterized malignant behaviors; pathway mechanisms were explored through proteomic profiling (reverse-phase protein array), targeted screening, and Western blot validation; immune microenvironment was assessed via transcriptomic analyses (differentially expressed genes, gene set enrichment, immune infiltration); preliminary exploration of transcriptional regulation involved multi-database TF screening, binding site prediction, and ChIP-qPCR experimental validation.

Among these, the NCI-H520 cell line exhibited the lowest TGM2 expression level, while SK-MES-1 showed the highest TGM2 expression (  Figure 3A  Figure 3B Figure 3 Overexpression of TGM2 in LUSC NCI-H520 cells enhanced malignant potential.

Specifically, compared to the TGM2 high-risk group, 3,714 genes were significantly downregulated, while 4,848 genes were upregulated in the low-risk group (  Figure 5A 2  Figure 5B 35 36 37  Figure 5C  Figure 5D 34 37 via Figure 5 TGM2 negatively regulated immune processes in LUSC.

Each plot has histograms on top and sides. Correlation coefficients (R values) and p-values indicate statistical significance. Negative correlations are seen in plots A to F, while positive correlations appear in G to L. To further validate the immunomodulatory role of TGM2, infiltration scores between TGM2 high- and low-risk groups were compared. TGM2-high tumors showed significant reductions in Th1 cells (P = 0.0048) and Th2 cells (P = 0.002), with concurrent increases in M2 macrophages (QUANTISEQ/XCELL, P < 0.0001), cancer-associated fibroblasts (P < 0.0001), hematopoietic stem cells (P < 0.0001), and endothelial cells (P < 0.0001) (  Supplementary Figure S2  Figure 6  Figures 5B–D 3.5 TGM2 expression was regulated by the transcription factor NR3C1 To explore the direct regulatory mechanisms of the TGM2 gene, its upstream regulators, particularly TFs, were identified. The Cistrome DB and hTFtarget databases were employed to predict potential TFs regulating TGM2, resulting in 23 key candidates identified through intersection analysis with DEGs (  Figure 7A  Figure 7B −60  Figure 7C  Figure 7D  Figure 7E  Figure 7F  Figure 7G Figure 7 TGM2 expression may be regulated by the transcription factor NR3C1.

These findings deepen our understanding of the role of TGM2 in LUSC pathogenesis, provide directions for future research and offer valuable insights for developing potential therapeutic strategies targeting TGM2 and its regulatory network. The schematic diagram of the scientific hypothesis in this study is shown in  Figure 9 https://www.figdraw.com Figure 9 Schematic diagram of the TGM2/NR3C1-p38 MAPK axis driving tumor progression and immune evasion in LUSC. This figure illustrates the key mechanisms of TGM2 in LUSC. The transcription factor NR3C1 binds to the promoter region of the TGM2 gene to regulate its expression. Elevated TGM2 activates the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, promoting tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis resistance, thereby accelerating tumor progression. Additionally, TGM2 may reshape the tumor microenvironment by modulating the p38 MAPK pathway, including shaping an immunosuppressive microenvironment, upregulating immune checkpoint molecules, promoting secretion of immunosuppressive factors, and enhancing immune evasion. This study is the first to elucidate the dual role of the NR3C1/TGM2-p38 MAPK axis in driving tumor malignancy and immune microenvironment imbalance, providing mechanistic insights that could support the future development of targeted-immunotherapy combination strategies in LUSC.

Key features include TGF-β, IL-10, and PD-L1 with increased expression; decreased Th1, Th2, NK, and CD4+ cells; increased cancer-associated fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and hematopoietic stem cells. The MAPK signaling pathway involves TGM2 and p38 MAPK, affecting proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis. 4 Disscussion In the context of lung cancer, two cohort studies involving patients with NSCLC have identified TGM2 as a crucial biomarker associated with increased tumor invasiveness, metastatic potential, and poor prognosis ( 38 39 38 39 in vitro 40 41 The MAPK signaling pathway is a crucial oncogenic cascade that transmits extracellular signals from cell surface receptors, primarily RTKs, to downstream effectors such as RAS, RAF, MEK, and ERK, thereby promoting cell survival, growth, and differentiation ( 42 44 45 48 49 51 52 52 54 Activation of the MAPK pathway not only drives tumor progression but also induces the expression of immunosuppressive molecules such as PD-L1, establishing a vicious cycle of immune evasion ( 55 58 + + 56 via 57 58 59 61 + 59 + + 60 61 +  Figure 6  Supplementary Figure S2 Regarding NK cells, GSEA (  Figures 5B–D  Figure 6F 34 37 In exploring the regulatory mechanisms of TGM2, NR3C1 was identified as a potential upstream regulator. Our study revealed a significant positive correlation between TGM2 and NR3C1 expression, with a trend toward poorer prognosis in patients with LUSC exhibiting high NR3C1 expression. Previous research has implicated NR3C1 in regulating inflammation ( 62 63 64 64 65 66 67 65 68 69 via 70 This study, through systematic bioinformatics and experimental validation, elucidates the critical role of TGM2 in LUSC and its potential link to immunotherapy efficacy. However, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, reliance on public databases may introduce bias due to limited sample size and data diversity. Future studies should expand sample cohorts and include multi-ethnic data to enhance generalizability. Second, while our in vitro in vivo in vivo 26 This study highlights the pivotal role of TGM2 in LUSC, establishing its potential as an independent prognostic marker. High TGM2 expression correlates with reduced OS and DFS, promoting tumor proliferation, migration, invasion, and resistance to apoptosis. Additionally, TGM2 exerts its oncogenic and immunomodulatory effects through p38 MAPK pathway activation, providing new mechanistic insights. As a key molecular marker in LUSC, TGM2 holds significant clinical translational value. Future research should focus on elucidating its regulatory mechanisms, particularly its interaction with NR3C1, to explore the potential for developing effective therapeutic strategies for patients with LUSC.
