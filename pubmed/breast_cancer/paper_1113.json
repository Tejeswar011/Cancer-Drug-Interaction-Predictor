Functional hydrogels are characterized by their three-dimensional (3D) polymeric network and high water-retention capacity. Functional hydrogels are deliberately engineered with specific chemical groups, stimuli-responsive motifs, or crosslinking strategies that impart targeted biomedical or environmental roles (e.g., drug delivery, pollutant removal). Their capacity to imitate the extracellular matrix, and their biocompatibility and customizable physicochemical properties make them highly suitable for biomedical and environmental applications. In contrast, non-functional hydrogels are defined as passive polymer networks that primarily serve as water-swollen matrices without such application-oriented modifications. Recent progress includes stimuli-responsive hydrogel designs. Stimuli such as pH, temperature, enzymes, light, etc., enable controlled drug delivery and targeted therapy. Moreover, hydrogels have shown great potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The flexibility and biofunctionality of hydrogels improve cell adhesion and tissue integration. Functional hydrogels are being explored for water purification by heavy metal ion removal and pollutant detection. The surface functionalities of hydrogels have shown selective binding and adsorption, along with porous structures that make them effective for environmental remediation. However, hydrogels have long been postulated as potential candidates to be used in clinical advancements. The first reported clinical trial was in the 1980s; however, their exploration in the last two decades has still struggled to achieve positive results. In this review, we discuss the rational hydrogel designs, synthesis techniques, application-specific performance, and the hydrogel-based materials being used in ongoing clinical trials (FDA–approved) and their mechanism of action. We also elaborate on the key challenges remaining, such as biocompatibility, mechanical stability, scalability, and future directions, to unlocking their multifunctionality and responsiveness. functional hydrogels crosslinked polymer network healthcare biomedical applications stimuli responsive environmental applications National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) South Korean government MSIT RS-2022-NR06947413582110600004 This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant, funded by the South Korean government (MSIT; RS-2022-NR06947413582110600004). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Nanoscale engineering has explored various opportunities to interact with biological systems at the molecular level [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 33 35 36 37 38 39 40 An ideal nanotherapeutic system must show potential for not only effective delivery, but also minimizing side effects [ 41 42 43 44 45 39 46 47 48 49 As mentioned earlier, issues such as poor targeting and the biological barrier, alongside the inherent properties of many first-generation nanoparticles, pose substantial problems [ 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 31 57 58 59 60 Figure 1 61 62 63 64 65 2. Rational Design Strategies for Functional Hydrogels Hydrogels have a pliable consistency, tissue-like texture, high absorption, and significant water retention while maintaining their structural integrity [ 65 66 67 64 68 69 70 71 72 73 60 74 75 76 77 Nanohydrogels are engineered from a wide range of natural polymers (chitosan, alginate, and hyaluronic acid) or synthetic polymers (poly(N-isopropylacrylamide), polyethylene glycol, etc.), that allow for precise tuning of their chemical and physical properties [ 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 41 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 Moreover, the hybrid design approach can provide versatile functionality due to multiple components being combined with a robust design. The fine tunability of synthetic polymers and the biological benefits of natural polymers can yield robust functional systems [ 98 99 100 101 70 Figure 2 70 96 102 The hydrophilic and often neutral surface charges (zwitterionic or charge-balanced surface modifications that result in an overall neutral surface potential) help to repel protein adsorptions; this approach could be a substantial step toward active control over drug delivery [ 104 105 106 107 108 109 88 89 110 111 112 113 3. Biomedical Applications of Functional Hydrogels Functional hydrogels are used in numerous biomedical applications, such as tissue generation, lubricants, wound dressing, contact lenses, and advanced drug delivery [ 114 115 95 114 116 117 118 119 Recently, several review reports have been published detailing the biomedical applications of functional hydrogels based on their material properties, additional functionalization, and intrinsic properties [ 120 121 122 123 124 Figure 3 125 126 Figure 4 Functional hydrogels are an emerging material that has shown convincing success in clinical trials. We present in Table 1 4. Environmental and Soft Robotics Applications of Functional Hydrogels Heavy metals, such as Iron (Fe), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), and Cobalt (Co), are essential in small amounts for maintaining human metabolism [ 127 128 129 2+ 2+ 3+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 130 131 132 6+ 2 2 −1 133 2+ Figure 5 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ Figure 5 2+ Figure 5 134 −1 135 136 137 138 Figure 6 139 In environmental applications, hydrogels are being studied for their ability to sense and remove pollutants from water. Similarly, recent developments in environmental remediation have seen hydrogels effectively applied to a variety of pollutant classes beyond heavy metals, particularly organic dyes, antibiotics, and microplastics. Jung et al. [ 140 141 2 2 142 143 144 145 According to a comprehensive report by Zenab et al. [ 146 Figure 7 5. The Role of Functional Hydrogels in Clinical Settings Hydrogels are known for their biocompatibility and tissue-like textures, which highlight their advancements in clinical studies [ 147 Table 1 148 These FDA–approved clinical examples demonstrate the significant advancements towards translating hydrogel-based materials into approved clinical therapies. Sustaining the clinical development progress while addressing the existing challenges will be crucial to exploring and unlocking the capabilities of functional hydrogels. 6. Challenges, Limitations, and Safety Considerations Functional hydrogels have shown great potential in various biomedical and environmental applications. However, several notable challenges limit their wider use in clinical and industrial settings. A key issue is their stability and integrity in physiological and natural environments. Functional hydrogels are especially prone to degradation due to enzymatic reactions, caused by the nucleases present in biological fluids. This vulnerability can lead to their early disassembly, loss of function, and target specificity. Conversely, synthetic polymeric hydrogels are known for their high resistance, but may undergo incomplete degradation, leaving toxic byproducts and persistent environmental impacts. Another important limitation is the potential immunogenicity of hydrogel components, which can activate unintended pathways. Regarding DNA, naturally derived polymers like hyaluronic acid are generally considered biocompatible. However, chemically modified nucleotides, crosslinkers, or synthetic polymers may trigger inflammatory responses. In environmental applications, releasing DNA-based materials into ecosystems, especially on a large scale, raises concerns about horizontal gene transfer and unforeseen effects. Some case studies have indicated that using cationic polymers to bind and deliver nucleic acids can damage membranes and cause inflammation. Overall, the development of nanomedicine faces challenges, such as reproducible large-scale manufacturing and adherence to good manufacturing practice (GMP). Likewise, batch-to-batch consistency and long-term stability with scalability also exist as significant barriers. Moreover, hydrogels’ mechanical properties and novel mechanisms of action require extensive testing to meet strict FDA and EMA safety standards. Additionally, toxicology, pharmacokinetics, and long-term biodistribution studies are necessary to assess their risk profiles. Moreover, functional hydrogels often face challenges, such as burst release, unpredictable biodegradation, and immunogenic responses, that compromise therapeutic outcomes. For instance, PEG-based injectable hydrogels have shown rapid clearance and local inflammation in animal studies, limiting their long-term stability in vivo. While natural hydrogels such as collagen or hyaluronic acid provide excellent bioactivity, their poor mechanical strength and fast degradation hinder their utility as scaffolds. Hybrid or composite systems with synthetic polymers are increasingly required to ensure durability and tunable degradation. In the context of environmental water purification, hydrogel-based adsorbents functionalized with carboxyl or amine groups have shown promising roles in the removal of heavy metals, such as Pb 2+ 2+ 7. Future Perspectives The research on functional hydrogels continues to advance; one of the promising directions is the use of bio-orthogonal chemistry. The inclusion of bio-orthogonal chemistry to design and modify functional hydrogels in situ without interfering with the biological processes might show a benefit for tackling the earlier-mentioned challenges. Earlier reports have suggested that click chemistry reactions, such as strain-promoted azid–alkyne cycloaddition, enable the conjugation of ligands, peptides, and therapeutic molecules to hydrogel matrices under mild conditions [ 149 150 The integration of 3D and 4D printing technologies with functional hydrogels has also garnered substantial attention. These advanced bioprinting methods now enable the precise spatial patterning of multiple cell types and bioactive factors within hydrogel matrices. This strategy has enabled patient-specific tissue constructs with complex architectures [ 151 152 153 154 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.Z.Q. and N.P.; writing—original draft preparation, M.Z.Q. and N.P.; writing—review and editing, M.Z.Q., A.S.Q., Y.S. and N.P.; supervision, N.P., funding acquisition, N.P.
