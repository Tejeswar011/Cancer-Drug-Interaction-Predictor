This study examined the role of CCDC6 in the progression of iCCA and gemcitabine resistance through bioinformatics analysis and functional assays. Database analysis showed that CCDC6 was significantly overexpressed in iCCA, with its expression positively correlating with TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. Although its value as an independent prognostic biomarker was not statistically significant in survival analysis, its expression profile suggested potential as a therapeutic target. Functional experiments demonstrated that CCDC6 knockdown inhibited iCCA cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro in a dose‐dependent manner, while overexpression enhanced these malignant phenotypes. Western blot analysis demonstrated that CCDC6 regulated epithelial‐mesenchymal transition (EMT) by modulating Vimentin and Snail expression, promoting metastasis. In vivo xenograft and metastasis models confirmed that CCDC6 depletion significantly reduced tumour burden and lung metastases. Moreover, CCDC6 and the EMT marker Vimentin were upregulated in gemcitabine‐resistant iCCA cells. γH2AX foci staining indicated that CCDC6 enhanced DNA damage repair (DDR), reducing chemotherapy‐induced genomic instability, while CCDC6 inhibition exacerbated DNA damage, reversing resistance. These findings suggest CCDC6 drives chemoresistance through EMT activation and enhanced DDR, making it a promising therapeutic target in iCCA. chemoresistance coiled‐coil domain‐containing 6 DNA damage repair epithelial‐mesenchymal transition intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma National Natural Science Foundation of China 10.13039/501100001809 82172966 Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province 10.13039/501100003453 2024A1515010382 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:02.10.2025  J.

The results demonstrated that the expression level of CCDC6 was elevated in hepatobiliary ductal carcinoma tissues, and bioinformatics analysis indicated that it may promote carcinoma proliferation and affect prognosis [ 25 2 Material and Methods 2.1 Public Omics Data Sets and Bioinformatics Transcriptomic data sets, The Cancer Genome Atlas–cholangiocarcinoma (TCGA‐CHOL), GSE26566 26 χ 2 2.2 Cell Culture and Transfection The human intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA) cell lines RBE, HuCCT1 and HCCC‐9810 were acquired from Procell Life Science and Technology Co. Ltd. (Wuhan, China). Cells were maintained in RPMI‐1640 medium (Gibco, Massachusetts, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution. Cultures were kept in a humidified incubator at 37°C under a 5% CO₂ atmosphere. The CCDC6 overexpression plasmid, hU6‐MCS‐CBh‐gcGFP‐IRES‐puromycin constructs, and corresponding control vectors were constructed and produced by GeneChem (Shanghai, China) (Table S1 27 28 2.3 Western Blot Analysis Protein was extracted with RIPA buffer (BESTBIO, China) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Protein concentration was assessed by BCA assay kit (Bio‐Rad, USA). Samples were denatured, separated by SDS‐PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). After blocking, membranes were incubated in the presence of primary antibodies overnight at 4°C, followed by HRP‐conjugated secondary antibodies. Protein bands were visualised by means of an ECL detection system (e‐BLOT, China). Antibody against CCDC6 (67637‐1‐Ig, 1:5000) was purchased from Proteintech Group (Chicago, IL). Vimentin (#5741, 1:1000), Snail (#3879, 1:1000) and GAPDH (#5174, 1:1000) were purchased from Cell Signalling Technology (Massachusetts, USA). Anti‐mouse and anti‐rabbit secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibodies were from Bioss (Beijing, China). All strip grey values were calculated using ImageJ (v1.54g) software. 2.4  RNA qPCR Total RNA was extracted and purified using the Total RNA Isolation Kit (Vazyme, China) and quantified with NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 μg RNA using the PrimeScript RT Kit (Vazyme, China). Real‐time qPCR was performed using a QuantStudio 6 Flex System (Applied Biosystems, USA) with SYBR Green Master Mix (Vazyme, China). Gene‐specific primers (Sangon Biotech, China) were used, and expression levels were normalised to GAPDH using the 2 −ΔΔCt S2 2.5 Cell Growth Assay iCCA cells (1 × 10 3 2.6  EdU EdU staining was completed according to the manufacturer's protocol. 3 × 10 4 2.7 In Vitro Wound‐Healing Assay Cells were cultured in a 12‐well plate and allowed to grow to confluence. They were washed 3 times with PBS, scratched with a 200 μL pipette tip, and microphotographed at 0 h and 24 h under an inverted microscope (magnification, 4×) (OLYMPUS IX73, Tokyo, Japan). Migration Rate (%) = (Initial Scratch Area − Final Scratch Area)/Initial Scratch Area × 100%. 2.8 Cell Migration and Invasion Assays For migration assays, 4 × 10 4 2.9 In Vivo Growth and Metastasis Experiments In vivo tumour growth was evaluated by subcutaneously injecting 1 × 10 7 N 2 For the lung metastasis model, 5‐week‐old male BALB/c nude mice ( N 5 2.10 Immunohistochemistry Tissue sections were deparaffinised with xylene, rehydrated through an alcohol series, and endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 10 min. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating slides in EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) and boiling for 5 min. After rinsing in PBS, slides were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C. Subsequently, slides were incubated with HRP‐conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti‐rabbit, 1:100; Invitrogen) for 15 min. Diaminobenzidine was used for detection, followed by counterstaining with haematoxylin. 2.11 Construction of the Gemcitabine‐Resistant RBE 1 × 10 4 50 50 2.12 Detection of DNA H2AX Cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 24‐well plates and treated as specified. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (Beyotime, China) for 15 min and permeabilisation with 0.1% Triton X‐100 (Sigma‐Aldrich, USA) for 10 min, cells were blocked with 5% BSA (Solarbio, China) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated overnight at 4°C with anti‐γ‐H2AX primary antibody (Beyotime, China, 1:500), followed by Alexa Fluor 488‐conjugated secondary antibody (Beyotime, China, 1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Beyotime, China) for 5 min. Images were captured using an automated inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Japan). Quantification of γ‐H2AX lesions in at least 8 fields of view per group was performed using ImageJ software (NIH, USA). 2.13 Statistical Analysis Data are summarised and presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) using GraphPad Prism 9.0 software for analysis.

N N p Additionally, γH2AX foci fluorescence staining assays demonstrated that DNA damage levels were significantly lower in gR‐RBE cells compared to control cells. However, pretreatment with the CCDC6 inhibitor P5091 (4 μM, 24 h) effectively reduced CCDC6 expression in gR‐RBE, leading to a marked increase in DNA damage (Figure 4E,F 3.5  CCDC6 iCCA To investigate the effects of CCDC6 knockdown on iCCA progression in vivo, we established a subcutaneous tumour formation model ( N N 5A 5B,C S3 5D,E FIGURE 5 CCDC6 knockdown inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of iCCA cells in vivo. (A) Establishment of subcutaneous xenograft ( N N N N N p p p p Additionally, live imaging and lung tissue histological analysis demonstrated a significant decrease in lung nodule formation in the CCDC6 loss‐of‐function group relative to the NC group (Figure 5F,G 4 Discussion CCDC6 was aberrantly expressed in various malignant tumours, including gastric, lung and ovarian cancers, with its expression closely correlated with tumour progression [ 18 20 21 24 To further delineate the functional implications of CCDC6 in iCCA, we established bidirectional genetic intervention and pharmacological inhibition models. Multidimensional in vivo and in vitro assays demonstrated that modulation of CCDC6 expression significantly influenced tumour cell proliferation, invasion and EMT, thereby driving tumour progression. However, in our study, CCDC6 expression was confirmed in both KD1 and KD2 vectors. We observed that the knockdown efficiency in the KD1 group was lower than that in KD2, which may be attributed to incomplete knockdown, potential off‐target effects, or inherent heterogeneity within iCCA cells. To ensure robustness, two distinct shRNA sequences were used to downregulate CCDC6, and relevant signalling pathways were further investigated. Collectively, these findings position CCDC6 as a promising therapeutic target for iCCA. Moreover, our study not only expands the current understanding of CCDC6's biological functions but also provides an experimental foundation for the precision treatment of iCCA. Presently, iCCA treatment relies heavily on a regimen of gemcitabine combined with cisplatin, while targeted agents exhibit limited efficacy and are prone to drug resistance. Previous studies have linked both the EMT process and the DDR mechanism to chemoresistance and recurrence in various malignancies, including iCCA [ 7 29 30 In our investigation, we initially demonstrated that CCDC6 correlates with gemcitabine chemoresistance in iCCA by comparing loss‐of‐function and overexpression models. Further validation using a gemcitabine‐resistant RBE strain revealed that CCDC6 reduces chemosensitivity by enhancing DDR and by modulating EMT markers, thereby increasing gemcitabine tolerance in iCCA cells. These results not only identified a new target for reversing chemoresistance but also highlighted the translational potential of the small molecule inhibitor P5091. P5091 is a selective inhibitor of USP7, a deubiquitinating enzyme that may maintain its protein levels by antagonising the ubiquitination and degradation of CCDC6. It has been found in studies of colorectal cancer and multiple myeloma to inhibit tumours by regulating pathways such as HDM2‐p53 and Wnt/β‐catenin [ 31 32 In the pathway enrichment analysis of CCDC6 from our previous study [ 25 Although functional assays have demonstrated the tumour‐promoting role of CCDC6, its mRNA expression did not exhibit significant prognostic value in survival analysis of public cohorts (OPE001105 database, N p N p Author Contributions  Jiaming Chen: Qiaoting Wu: Bodeng Wu: Guanbo Wang: Jiawei Li: Zhenxun Wang: Xinyi Tan: Bo Ma: Xiaoqing Jiang: Xin Zhang: Yu Wang: Ethics Statement Our study was approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of Nanfang Hospital (IACUC‐LAC‐20240325‐003).
