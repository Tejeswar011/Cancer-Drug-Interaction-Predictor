Objective Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is a rare and distinctive form of chronic cholecystitis, and it is rather challenging to differentiate it from the thick-walled type of gallbladder carcinoma. Considering that computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) each exhibit unique features in the manifestation of XGC, this study aims to deepen the understanding of XGC and explore the roles of these imaging examinations, especially PET/CT, in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of XGC. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the radiological, clinical, and surgical pathological data of five patients with XGC treated at Jiangxi Provincial People’s Hospital between January 2019 and January 2025. Results All five patients with XGC were female, aged 49–84 years. Four patients were hospitalized for recurrent abdominal pain, while one presented with limb weakness. Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels were elevated in three patients. Among the cases in this manuscript, one patient underwent contrast-enhanced MRI, two patients underwent contrast-enhanced CT, and all five patients underwent positron emission PET/CT examination. The results of the imaging examinations revealed that the gallbladder volume was enlarged in three cases and reduced in two cases. The gallbladder wall showed thickening to varying degrees (ranging approximately from 1.2 to 2.0 cm), with diffuse thickening observed in three cases and localized thickening in two cases. The enhancement pattern was characterized by progressive and sustained enhancement, and there was an increase in FDG uptake to different extents. Intramural nodules and gallstones were detected in three cases, and enlarged abdominal or retroperitoneal lymph nodes were found in two cases. The range of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was between 7.5 and 19.8, and the median uptake value was 10.04 ± 5.75. Conclusion In light of the insufficient diagnostic accuracy of FDG-PET/CT and CA 19-9 in distinguishing XGC from GBC, future efforts should prioritize the validation and adoption of advanced imaging techniques such as FLT-PET/CT. Pending these developments, radical cholecystectomy performed by experienced surgeons remains the recommended surgical strategy for suspected cases. xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis gallbladder carcinoma MRI CT 18F-FDG PET/CT The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research, and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Nuclear Medicine 1 Introduction Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC), first reported and defined by McCoy et al. ( 1 2 3 4 2 Methods and materials 2.1 Patients and materials This retrospective study analyzed data from patients with suspected XGC who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging at Jiangxi Provincial People’s Hospital between January 2019 and January 2025. Initially, a total of eight patients were enrolled. Among them, three were excluded due to lack of pathological confirmation. Consequently, five cases with complete clinical and pathological data were included in the final analysis. 2.2 Diagnostic approach All patients underwent preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT scans. Imaging of patients was conducted on a PET/CT scanner (GE Healthcare Discovery STE). 18F-FDG with a pH of 5–7 and a radiochemical purity exceeding 95% was produced using a cyclotron (MINItrace, GE Healthcare). All patients underwent fasting for at least 6 h and had blood glucose levels below 7.4 mmol/l. prior to injection with 18F-FDG. Patients were required to lay in a quiet room for 45–60 min after intravenous injection with 5.6 MBq/kg 18F-FDG. Spiral CT scanning was performed at 120 kVp and 300 mA⋅s. PET was performed after spiral CT without patient repositioning. PET images were obtained at 7–8 couch positions per patient, with an acquisition time of 1.5 min per position. We used CT scan data for attenuation correction of PET images and then fused the attenuation-corrected PET and CT images. The scans were reviewed blindly by one attending physician and one chief physician specializing in PET/CT. In cases of disagreement, a collective decision was made by the departmental physicians. All five patients eventually underwent surgical resection, and the postoperative pathological typing was determined by discussion between one chief pathologist and one attending pathologist. Informed consent for the anonymous use of clinical data and imaging for publication purposes was provided by all patients. Given the retrospective nature of this study, the institutional review board waived the requirement for approval. 3.Results 3.1 Case 1 A 49-year-old female patient presented with abdominal pain, jaundice, and weight loss for 20 days before admission. An abdominal MRI scan performed at the local hospital disclosed an abnormal thickening of the gallbladder wall, accompanied by intramural nodules and the presence of enlarged pericholedochal lymph nodes. The boundary between the gallbladder and the liver was indistinct, with no evident signs of liver cirrhosis observed. Furthermore, the scan identified multiple stones within the gallbladder, a stone in the lower portion of the common bile duct, and compression of the upper part of the common bile duct, which led to the dilation of both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts above the obstruction. The multiphase contrast-enhanced scan images revealed that the thickened gallbladder wall shows mild enhancement during the arterial phase, with progressive enhancement observed in the venous and equilibrium phases. The intramural nodules displayed delayed rim enhancement. Despite undergoing treatments with anti-inflammatory and liver-protective agents at the local hospital, her symptoms showed no significant improvement. In response, a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiographic drainage (PTCD) was carried out. To further clarify the diagnosis and treatment plan, the patient was transferred to our hospital, where a comprehensive series of corresponding laboratory tests and imaging studies were conducted. The results of the inflammatory markers indicated that white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophile granulocyte, and C-reactive protein levels were all within normal limits, with procalcitonin was slightly elevated to 0.18 ng/ml. The levels of key tumor markers were as follows: Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) was elevated to 60.04 U/ml, while Cancer Antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) was significantly higher at 433.00 U/ml. Due to the patient’s recent PTCD procedure, the follow-up abdominal CT scan showed no evident obstruction or dilation of the bile ducts. The plain scan detected thickening of the gallbladder wall with low-density intramural nodules, surrounding enlarged lymph nodes, and stones in the gallbladder and the distal common bile duct. The enhancement pattern of the lesions on the contrast-enhanced scan was similar to that seen on the MRI. Subsequently, the patient underwent an PET/CT scan to evaluate the systemic condition. The axial CT and fused axial PET-CT images revealed asymmetric thickening of the gallbladder wall, accompanied by elevated fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake, with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 7.5. Enhanced FDG uptake was observed in several enlarged lymph nodes near the gallbladder fossa, reaching a SUVmax of 3.5. The intramural nodules showed no significant uptake of FDG ( Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Female, 49 years old.

Physical examination revealed a positive Murphy’s sign. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated elevated ferritin (355.90 ng/mL), increased C-reactive protein (CRP: 15.54 mg/L), and mildly elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase (49 U/L). All tumor markers were within normal limits. Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated impacted gallbladder stones with focal wall thickening (maximally 20 mm at the fundus) showing heterogeneous density, progressive persistent enhancement, and internal septations – findings initially suspicious for gallbladder carcinoma with hepatic invasion. Subsequent PET/CT confirmed these features with additional findings of narrowed lumen, intramural hypodense nodules, and markedly increased FDG avidity (SUVmax 10.6), while maintaining mucosal continuity despite an indistinct hepatobiliary interface ( Figure 3 FIGURE 3 Female, 58 years old.

The duration of symptoms varied from 2 days to 3 months. Four patients were hospitalized due to recurrent abdominal pain, and three exhibited a positive Murphy’s sign. Laboratory findings showed elevated WBC counts and neutrophil percentages in two patients. Additionally, CRP levels were increased in three patients, and CA19-9 levels were elevated in three patients as well. Imaging studies revealed gallbladder enlargement in three patients and reduced volume in two. The gallbladder wall was thickened to varying degrees, ranging from approximately 1.2–2.0 cm. Diffuse thickening (involving > 50% of the gallbladder wall circumference) was observed in three patients, while two had localized thickening (involving ≤ 50%). The mucosal line remained intact in all five cases, and intramural nodules were detected in three. The liver-gallbladder boundary was indistinct in four patients but clearly defined in one. One patient presented with a concurrent liver abscess and duodenal bulb invasion. Gallbladder stones were identified in three patients, and enlarged abdominal or retroperitoneal lymph nodes were found in two. Two patients exhibited persistent enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT scans. FDG PET/CT imaging demonstrated increased metabolic activity in all cases, with a SUVmaxranging from 7.5 to 19.8 (median: 10.04 ± 5.75). Preoperatively, all patients were misdiagnosed with gallbladder carcinoma; however, postoperative pathological examination confirmed XGC.

The patient’s preoperative CA19-9 levels were significantly elevated at 433.00 U/ml. Subsequent to the surgical procedure, a three-month follow-up examination indicated that the CA19-9 levels had reverted to normal at 14.15 U/ml. Case 2: The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 10. Follow-up CT imaging at two months postoperatively showed no abnormalities, with complete normalization of serum CA19-9 (15 U/mL). The patient remains disease-free and in good health three years after surgery. Case 3: The patient underwent suture removal on the 7th postoperative day and was subsequently discharged from the hospital. A clinical and radiological follow-up at one month postoperatively showed no abnormalities. Case 4: Two-month postoperative follow-up CT demonstrated complete resolution of previous abnormalities, with serum tumor markers CA19-9 and CA12-5 normalizing to 21.25 and 5.0 U/mL respectively. Case 5: The patient was subsequently discharged from the hospital. The patient achieved successful discharge on postoperative day 15. Surveillance imaging performed at 2-month follow-up showed no recurrent lesions. 4 Discussion Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is characterized by destructive inflammation, intramural nodules with infiltration of foamy histiocytes and macrophages, and proliferative fibrosis ( 6 7 8 9 10 9 In clinical practice, some patients with XGC are misdiagnosed as having GBC, leading to unnecessary radical surgery or being incorrectly informed as having advanced GBC ( 11 12 Physical examination and laboratory findings are not sufficient to distinguish XGC from GBC. Tumor markers such as CEA and CA19-9 lack specificity as they can be elevated or within the normal ranges in patients with either XGC or GBC. Elevated CA19-9 in XGC maybe caused by inflammation-induced bile duct damage, resulting in increased secretion of CA19-9 by epithelial cells ( 13 14 15 In clinical practice, abdominal ultrasound (US), CT, and MRI are the commonly used imaging modalities for the assessment of gallbladder disease. The common imaging findings of XGC from CT include the diffuse type of gallbladder wall thickening (range > 50% gallbladder circumference), the co-existence of gallstones, intramural nodules, a continuous mucosal line ( 7 12 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 FDG-PET is a valuable imaging approach for differentiating between benign and malignant lesions in the gallbladder. However, there is a limitation in the ability of FDG-PET to differentiate between inflammatory and malignant lesions. It is true that the tracer can accumulate in inflammatory lesions with increased glucose metabolism, false-positive results have been obtained with benign lesions, including chronic cholecystitis, adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder ( 4 3 24 25 Despite continuous advancements in diagnostic imaging technology for gallbladder lesions, histopathology remains the gold standard for diagnosing these conditions. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) combined with fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is useful for distinguishing between benign and malignant gallbladder lesions ( 26 27 27 In summary, XGC closely mimics GBC in clinical, laboratory, and imaging features, often leading to misdiagnosis and potential overtreatment. Key discriminators include intramural nodules, continuous mucosal lining on cross-sectional imaging, and transient CA19-9 elevation that normalizes postoperatively; however, due to significant overlap, histopathological confirmation remains essential. Preoperative recognition of these characteristics-coupled with intraoperative frozen section when malignancy is suspected-can guide appropriate surgical planning, avoiding unnecessarily radical procedures while ensuring complete treatment. 5 Conclusion This study confirms that FDG-PET/CT and CA 19-9 demonstrate limited accuracy in distinguishing XGC from GBC, as evidenced by preoperative misdiagnosis in all five presented cases. These findings underscore the critical need for advanced diagnostic modalities such as FLT-PET/CT to improve preoperative differentiation. Until these novel techniques become clinically viable, radical cholecystectomy performed by experienced hepatobiliary surgeons remains the recommended approach when malignant transformation cannot be definitively excluded based on current imaging and serological markers.
