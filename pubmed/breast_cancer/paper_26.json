Coordinated protein modules define DNA damage responses to carboplatin at single cell resolution in human ovarian carcinoma models 26 11 2024 2024.11.21.624591 bioRxiv PMC11601625 39605494 Summary Tubo-ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, initially responds to platinum-based chemotherapy, but due to frequent defects in the DNA damage response (DDR), most tumors develop resistance. The molecular mechanisms underlying clinical platinum resistance remain poorly defined with no biomarkers or targeted therapies to improve outcomes. Here, applying mass cytometry, we quantify phosphorylation and abundance of DDR proteins in carboplatin-treated HGSC cell line models. Despite similar levels of intranuclear platinum, a proxy for carboplatin uptake, cells follow divergent fates, reflecting DDR heterogeneity. Unsupervised analysis reveals a continuum of DDR states, and matrix factorization identifies eight protein modules. The activity of one module, containing canonical DDR proteins, increases in carboplatin-sensitive cells. Resistant cells engage a broader DDR protein module. These findings demonstrate the ability of single-cell proteomics to identify functional DDR states and reveal a DDR sensitivity module as a promising biomarker for clinical stratification and therapeutic decisions in HGSC. Graphical abstract Highlights • Ovarian tumor cells with similar levels of carboplatin undergo different fates • Carboplatin sensitivity associates with activity of pRPA, pATM, pH2AX, and pCHK1/2 • Activity of these proteins tracks with clinical response in patient-derived models • Carboplatin resistance associates with activity of a greater number of proteins Bedia et al. apply mass cytometry to profile the carboplatin-mediated DNA damage response in ovarian tumor cell line models. Unsupervised analysis of millions of cells reveals a range of DDRs and identifies a protein module associated with carboplatin sensitivity highlighting its potential as a clinically predictive biomarker.

Critically, the DDR is regulated by protein expression levels and phosphorylation states. 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 35 , 36 , 37 38 , 39 , 40 , 41 Results Validating a CyTOF antibody panel to measure the DDR and cell cycle Our 35-antibody CyTOF panel was designed to measure the DDR in individual cells throughout all cell-cycle phases ( Figure 1 Table S1 42 , 43 103 Figure S1 44 , 45 STAR Methods STAR Methods 42 Figure S2 43 Figures 2 S3 S4 Figure 1 Characterization of the DNA damage response by CyTOF (A) Pathway map showing CyTOF antibody panel designed to measure proteins participating in the carboplatin-mediated DNA damage response.

Foundational experiments were performed using TYK-nu and UWB1.289 HGSC cell lines. Validation was performed using three spontaneously immortalized continuous HGSC cell lines (CIOV1, CIOV2, and CIOV3) derived from patient tumors. Modeling carboplatin resistance in clinically relevant HGSC cell lines In a previous CyTOF study, we characterized single-cell suspensions disaggregated from freshly resected advanced-stage HGSC tumors, along with 13 HGSC cell lines that were molecularly comparable to primary tumors. 39 , 40 , 46 Table S2 39 , 40 , 47 BRCA1 BRCA1 Table S2 41 39 38 Figure 1 Both clinical and preclinical studies showed that combining PARPi with carboplatin-based chemotherapy significantly improved progression-free survival and efficacy. 48 , 49 , 50 49 , 50 51 , 52 , 53 10 , 12 Figure S5 STAR Methods 103 STAR Methods 42 103 Figure S6 Table S3 Cell-cycle responses to carboplatin induce S-phase arrest Each cell-cycle phase was manually gated from the viable ( 103 Figures 2 S7 Table S3 STAR Methods TP53 54 55 Figure 2 Characterization of DDRs to genotoxic and microtubule-targeting agents in HeLa cells and to carboplatin in TYK-nu cells (A and B) HeLa cells respond with distinct DDRs depending on treatment and cell-cycle phase.

While examining protein expression patterns in single cells across specific cell-cycle phases revealed interesting trends ( Figure S9 Figure 3 Figures 4 S10 Figure 4 62 63 Figures 4 Figure 3 Overview of the unsupervised data analysis approach CyTOF data were normalized, arcsinh-transformed, and gated prior to unsupervised analysis according to the schema.

Each cluster is represented by a pie chart indicating the proportion of cells from different conditions that share a similar DDR. (F) DDR protein modules discovered by non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). The matrix of expression levels for 29 DDR proteins in 721,579 cells was decomposed into two matrices. One matrix discovered the most frequently co-occurring proteins in eight DDR modules (number of modules user-selected). The contribution of each protein within a specific module is given by its Z (G) The second matrix describes the activity of each module in individual cells and is overlaid on the UMAP. (H) Box plots depict the activity of each module over time. PAGA revealed that the clusters in the upper left of the UMAP were apoptotic with a DDR state that was distinct from non-apoptotic cells ( Figures 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Non-negative matrix factorization to discover modules of co-occurring DDR proteins and their activity over time in single cells The UMAP/PAGA analysis revealed clusters with different DDRs ( Figure 4 Figure 4 64 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure S11 To further characterize module activity shown in the UMAP overlays, we generated box plots ( Figure 4 Figures 4 65 Responses of UWB1.289 BRCA1− and BRCA1+ cell lines to carboplatin To determine whether the carboplatin-mediated DDR modules identified in the TYK-nu cell line are conserved in other HGSC cells, we performed a carboplatin treatment time course and DDR-CyTOF analysis ( Table S1 41 50 Figure S12 STAR Methods 66 Figure S13 Cell cycle, cell fate, and carboplatin uptake responses In the absence of carboplatin, UWB cells were primarily in G0 and S-phase, with <6% in G1 due to TP53 mutations abrogating the G1 checkpoint ( Figure S13 Table S4 54 67 Figure S13 195 Figures S13 S14 Mapping DDR states in UWB cells Using the same computational workflow applied to TYK-nu cells, we clustered the UWB CyTOF dataset and generated PAGA graphs to visualize relationships between DDR states ( Figure 3 Figure 5 Figures S14 STAR Methods Figures S14 Figure 5 Figure 5 Identification of DDR modules in UWB cells (A–E) (A) PAGA plot of Leiden clusters for UWB cells shows connectivity of clusters in high-dimensional space.

(J) Box plots depict the activity of each module over time. Whiskers depict range 1.5 × IQR ± hinges. The PAGA graph for UWB cells revealed a clear separation between untreated and 6 h-treated cells compared with their DDR states at 24, 48, and 72 h after treatment ( Figures 5 Figures 5 Figure 5 68 Figure 5 Figures 5 Time evolution of DDR in UWB cells revealed by NMF To determine changes in the DDR during carboplatin exposure in UWB cells, we discovered eight DDR modules using NMF. The relative contribution of each protein within a module was depicted with a heatmap ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Temporal changes in module activity for individual cells were depicted on box plots ( Figure 5 Further characterization of the HGSC DDR landscape in patient-derived cell lines To ascertain the generalizability of the DDR modules, we performed an independent experiment, characterizing the carboplatin-mediated DDR in our recently established CIOV1, CIOV2, and CIOV3 cell line models ( Table S5 38 TP53 BRCA1/2 KRAS MECOM BRCA1 CIOV cell lines were characterized using our previously established CyTOF HGSC tumor antibody panel. 46 Figure 6 39 , 40 Figure 6 40 39 Figure 6 Characterization of patient-derived CIOV1, CIOV2, and CIOV3 cell lines (A) Violin plots depict expression levels of tumor-associated proteins using the CyTOF tumor cell antibody panel described previously. 40 (B) Cell-cycle distributions vary across cell lines in response to treatment. (C) Pie charts indicate minimal apoptosis under treatments used. (D) Box plots depict 195 (E) Violin plots depict changes in E-cadherin (E) and vimentin (V) expression levels across cell-cycle phases in response to treatment. EV scores were computed according to the following formula: EV Score = arcsinh E-cadherin counts/arcsinh E-cadherin counts + arcsinh vimentin counts). Scores range from 0 to 1 with a score of 1 indicating a purely epithelial phenotype (high E-cadherin, low vimentin) and a score of 0 indicating a purely mesenchymal phenotype (low E-cadherin, high vimentin). Cell lines were treated with carboplatin (8 μM), carboplatin (8 μM) + paclitaxel (5 nM), carboplatin (8 μM) + rucaparib (1.2 μM), rucaparib (1.2 μM), or DMSO (control) for 48 h ( STAR Methods Figure 1 Table S1 STAR Methods Cell-cycle phase, cell fate, and carboplatin uptake in CIOV cell lines All cell lines showed different cell-cycle phase distributions before and after treatments ( Figure 6 Table S6 Figure 6 There was considerable variability in carboplatin uptake among individual cells, which was not affected by adding paclitaxel or rucaparib. While the IQRs showed significant overlap between apoptotic and non-apoptotic cells in CIOV1 and CIOV3, there was much less overlap in CIOV2. This suggests that drug efflux potentially through upregulated transporters may have a greater role in the innate-resistant CIOV2 cell line ( Figure 6 Relationship between epithelial and mesenchymal phenotypes with cell-cycle phase Given the emergence of drug resistance in EMT cells, we determined relationships between E-cadherin (E) expression, vimentin (V) expression, cell cycle, and treatments across the CIOV cell lines. As a proxy for epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypes, we computed an E-cadherin-vimentin (EV) score using a ratio between expression levels of E-cadherin and vimentin in single cells ( Figure 6 69 NMF module activity associated with clinical response Given that the CIOV cell lines closely resembled their parental tumors in genetic, molecular, and chemotherapy responses, we investigated whether the activity of DDR protein modules discovered in TYK-nu cells tracked with in vivo in vitro Figures 7 S15 38 Figure S15 Figure 7 Validation of TYK-nu NMF modules in CIOVs, JHOS22, and OVCAR3 cell lines In an independent experiment CIOV1–3, JHOS2 and OVCAR3 cell lines were treated with carboplatin, a carboplatin-based combination, or vehicle control for 48 h and then analyzed by CyTOF using the same DDR antibody panel ( Table S1 (A) Patient treatment timelines reconstructed from electronic health record data illustrating clinical treatment and interventions (further information is provided in Table S5 (B) Hierarchically clustered heatmap depicting module 6 activity (identified in TYK-nu) in CIOV1-3, JHOS2, and OVCAR3 with TYK-nu as a control. The values in the heatmap are the increase in the percentage of module 6 activity relative to vehicle control under conditions shown. Discussion Our study was predicated on the hypothesis that in response to carboplatin ovarian tumor cells selectively activate specific DDR protein sub-networks or modules through changes in phosphorylation and abundance. Activating the entire DDR network would be metabolically inefficient. We capitalized on the single-cell attributes of CyTOF to measure the carboplatin-mediated DDR. To understand why cells with comparable levels of intranuclear carboplatin underwent divergent fates, we analyzed CyTOF datasets with an unsupervised approach using UMAP embedding, PAGA, and NMF ( Figure 3 29 Figures 4 5 70 , 71 BRCA1 BRCA2 BRCA1 BRCA1 18 , 21 For TYK-nu and UWB cells, early activity of modules containing the transcription factors phosphorylated nuclear factor kappa B (pNFκB), Myc, and β-catenin (module 3 in TYK-nu and module 2 in UWB) aligned with their known roles in chemoresistance, stemness, and survival. 72 , 73 , 74 65 , 75 76 Figures 5 28 , 29 , 41 In the CIOV models, module 6 consistently emerged as the most robust indicator of carboplatin sensitivity with a clear gradient of activity: greatest in carboplatin-sensitive CIOV1, lowest in innate-resistant CIOV2, and intermediate in acquired-resistant CIOV3, underscoring its potential as a functional biomarker, independent of genetic background. Module 6 activity increased further with carboplatin plus rucaparib treatment, particularly in CIOV1, suggesting that this module may capture additive or synergistic DDRs. By contrast, carboplatin plus paclitaxel induced lower module 6 activity, perhaps because paclitaxel targets microtubules and cell division rather than a direct effect on the DDR network. The presence of EMT and mesenchymal cell phenotypes in CIOV2 and CIOV3 is consistent with their resistance characteristics. 77 MYC CCND1 78 77 This study is limited by the inherent complexity of DDR. Our CyTOF panel did not provide full coverage of the DDR, thus potentially missing additional DDR modules. Nevertheless, it successfully measured 36 phosphorylation states and protein levels with established roles in the DDR, cell-cycle regulation, and signaling. 65 , 75 , 79 Many of a tumor’s adaptive responses to therapy are targetable. 33 Limitations of the study We were not able to provide complete coverage of the carboplatin-mediated DDR owing to (1) a maximum number of 45 antibodies that can be simultaneously studied using available stable metal isotopes for CyTOF and (2) the unavailability of reliable antibodies against BRCA1 and BRCA2. Our study was designed to elucidate tumor cell-intrinsic DDR mechanisms, and we did not evaluate how cell-extrinsic factors, from immune and stromal cells in the TME, may modulate the DDR. Future experiments will test the activity of module 6 in clinically annotated samples from primary or interval debulking to evaluate its potential as a predictive marker for response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Additionally, we will evaluate the effects of immune and stromal cells on the activity of module 6 by applying spatial multiplex proteomics with expanded antibody panels to these clinical samples.

Cells were split every 2–3 days and kept in a humidified cell culture incubator at 37°C with an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO 2 Method details Research design summary To investigate tumor cell-intrinsic DDR mechanisms underlying carboplatin resistance and sensitivity, we performed single-cell mass cytometry (CyTOF) profiling across a panel of HGSC cell lines, that phenocopy human tumors, comprised of TYK-nu, the highly resistant UWB1.289 BRCA1-and UWB1.289 BRCA1+ isogenic pair, JHOS2, OVCAR3, and patient-derived models (CIOV1, CIOV2 and CIOV3). The UWB1.289 BRCA1-deficient cell line was derived from an HGSC tumor that recurred following primary debulking surgery and multiple lines of chemotherapy, including carboplatin/paclitaxel, paclitaxel alone, topotecan, and gemcitabine combined with doxorubicin. It harbors a clinically deleterious allele of BRCA1 BRCA1 BRCA1 41 Figure 3 Treatment of HeLa cells with genotoxic agents and nocodazole HeLa cells were cultured in 10 cm dishes to a confluency of ∼80%. They were exposed to the following DNA damaging agents: 5 Gy ionizing radiation (IR) using a Cesium 137 irradiator, followed by a 30 min rest, 100 J/m 2 2 Dose-response curves for carboplatin, talazoparib, rucaparib, and paclitaxel Carboplatin (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in water (13.5 mM stock solution) and talazoparib (MedChem Express) was dissolved in DMSO (10 mM stock solution). The IC 50 Figure S4 For TYK-nu cells, cells were seeded in 96-well flat-bottomed plates (5,000 cells per well for carboplatin treatment, 2,000 cells per well for talazoparib treatment, 2000 cells per well for carboplatin plus talazoparib and 2000 BRCA1-and BRCA1+ cells per well for carboplatin treatment). For measuring the IC 50 Figures S5 50 Figures S5 IC 50 Figure S12 At each time point after treatment, cells were incubated with 10 μM iododeoxyuridine (IdU) (Sigma Aldrich) to label DNA synthesis. 43 42 42 103 42 40 , 42 Antibodies used for CyTOF All antibodies used for CyTOF were conjugated in-house ( Table S1 85 40 Sample processing and antibody staining for CyTOF Frozen, fixed single-cell suspensions were thawed at room temperature (RT). For each sample, 1 × 10 6 82 , 86 191/193 40 Protocol for isolating nuclei TYK-nu cells (4–5 × 10 6 2 Processing isolated nuclei for flow cytometry Fixed frozen TYK-nu cells or nuclei were thawed at RT and transferred to FACS tubes containing 1 mL of ice-cold CSM. Samples were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Cells and nuclei were then stained with DAPI (500 μL, 0.1 μg/mL in PBS) for 10 min at RT to assess viability and nuclear content. Following staining, 1.5 mL of cold CSM was added, and samples were centrifuged again (500 × g, 10 min, 4°C). After two additional washes with ice-cold CSM, cells and nuclei were resuspended in cold CSM at a concentration of 1–2 × 10 6 6 Figure S8 Processing isolated nuclei for immunofluorescence microscopy Fixed frozen TYK-nu nuclei were thawed at RT, transferred to FACS tubes containing 1 mL of cold CSM and washed (500 × g, 10 min, 4°C). Samples were permeabilized in 100% ice-cold methanol (1 mL) for 20 min at 4°C, washed twice with cold CSM and stained with vimentin-A647 antibody (5 μL in 100 μL of reaction) (clone D21H3 from CST) for 30 min on ice. After the addition of 2 mL CSM, samples were washed twice with CSM followed by staining with DAPI (blue fluorescence channel) (1 μg/mL in CSM, 500 μL) for 10 min at room temperature. After two washes with CSM, nuclei were resuspended in 100 μL of CSM. 10 μL of nuclei in suspension were transferred onto a microscope slide, a coverslip was placed on top, and samples were imaged using the Keyence microscope BZ-X800. The images confirmed that the isolated nuclei were minimally contaminated with micronuclei or cellular debris ( Figure S8 Sample processing and antibody staining of isolated nuclei for CyTOF analysis Fixed, frozen TYK-nu nuclei were thawed at RT and transferred into cluster tubes containing 1 mL of cold CSM. The samples were washed at 600 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Next, nuclei were permeabilized by incubating in 1 mL of 100% ice-cold methanol for 20 min at 4°C, then washed twice with cold CSM. The samples were stained for 1 h at RT on a shaker with antibodies against vimentin (D21H3, CST) and intra-nuclear proteins (Histone H3 [clone D1H2, Standard BioTools] and cleaved PARP [clone F21-852, BD]). Following staining, samples were washed twice with cold CSM and incubated overnight at 4°C in 1 mL of a solution containing the 191 193 For data analysis, nuclei—comprising both non-apoptotic and apoptotic populations—were initially gated using a 2D plot of 191 193 Figure S8 103 Figure 2 Quantification and statistical analysis Data analysis tools and illustration design software All data, statistical analysis, and figures were conducted with Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, R 4.1.2, Python 3.7, and GraphPad Prism 10. CyTOF datasets were evaluated with software available from Cytobank 87 Figure 1 BioRender.com Figures 2 S6 S7 S8 S13 https://cellengine.com 50 Figures S5 S12 cellengine.com cytobank.org Initial assessment of data quality and cell fate identification CyTOF FCS files were normalized and debarcoded using algorithms reported previously 82 , 88 https://github.com/ParkerICI/premessa https://github.com/nolanlab/bead-normalization/wiki/Normalizing-FCS-Files Tailored manual gating was performed in the Cytobank or CellEngine software. Singlets were gated based on 191 193 103 44 103 Figure S1 Measurements of cell cycle Cell cycle distribution was measured by applying the manual gating strategy described previously. 88 Figure S2 Cell line DDR mutation profiles Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was performed using AmiGO2. The search was conducted using the keywords DNA + Damage + Response Homo sapiens Mutation data were obtained from DepMap (retrieved 5/16/2022). Cell lines were selected using the Cell Line Selector tool, and associated mutation data were downloaded. A custom R script was used to match genes identified through GO analysis to mutated genes in the selected cell lines. The resulting gene–mutation associations are summarized in Table S2 Computational generation of cell cycle phase distributions using pie charts Cell cycle phase pie charts were computed as the proportion of non-apoptotic cells in each cell cycle phase and generated in ggplot2. Visualization of protein expression using violin plots Violin plots were generated in ggplot2 using live cells. For HeLa cells, live cells were defined as cisplatin-, while for all other single-cell datasets, live cells were identified as 103 Quantification of platinum uptake using boxplots Notched boxplots were generated using ggplot2. The notches represent approximately 95% confidence intervals for the median, calculated as 1.58 × IQR/√n, as described by McGill et al. 89 10 Nuclear-to-cellular platinum ratio in apoptotic vs. non-apoptotic cells Median platinum levels were extracted for both non-apoptotic and apoptotic cells and nuclei. The ratio of median nuclear to cellular platinum levels for both apoptotic and non-apoptotic cells was used to construct the bar chart. Linear discriminant analysis LDA was performed using the MASS package in R. Viable single-cell data from HeLa cells were used. For each treatment condition (class), 7,000 cells were randomly sampled. Of these, 6,300 were assigned to the training set and 700 to the test set, resulting in a final training set of 31,500 cells and a test set of 3,500 cells. Linear discriminant functions (LDFs) were fit using MASSlda on DDR protein expression levels. Markers used to identify cell cycle, apoptosis, and viability were excluded from the analysis. To test the quality of fit, four LDFs were used to predict treatment from DDR protein levels on the test set and classification results were reported as a confusion matrix. The macro-F1 score was used as a summary statistic for the performance of the final fit LDFs. The macro-F1 score is defined as the average F1 score over all treatments and is summarized in the following equation: macro - F 1 = 1 n ∑ i = 1 n T P i T P i + 1 2 ( F P i + F N i ) i i i i i Figure S3 Single cell data visualization and dimensionality reduction Single-cell CyTOF data were processed and visualized using the Scanpy package in Python. 83 https://cole-trapnell-lab.github.io/monocle3 84 k Figures 2 Figure 4 Figure S14 Clustering, partition-based graph extraction (PAGA), and diffusion pseudo-time (DPT) Single cell data were clustered with the Leiden algorithm using the scanpy package in Python. 62 63 Figure 5 68 Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) NMF was computed using the consensus NMF approach with the scikit-learn package in Python. 64 Figures 4 5 Prediction of treatment-response module activity The activity of NMF DDR modules previously computed from TYK-nu cells was estimated in CIOV1, CIOV2, CIOV3, OVCAR3, and JHOS2 cell lines using the scikit-learn package in Python. 64 References 1 Pilié P.G.
