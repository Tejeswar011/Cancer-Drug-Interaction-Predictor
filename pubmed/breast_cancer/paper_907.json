Although recent advancements have been made in ONC-based molecularly targeted drugs, most are single-targeting proteins with limitations such as poor targeting precision and low efficiency. In this study, the fusion protein rONC-T7-pHLIP was constructed by linking ONC with the T7 peptide, which specifically recognizes the transferrin receptor, and the pHLIP peptide, which actively targets the acidic tumor microenvironment, using a flexible linker peptide (GGGGS) 3 E. coli Key points • The rONC-T7-pHLIP was expressed in the E. coli expression system with high yield. • The rONC-T7-pHLIP showed high stability and safety in vitro. • The rONC-T7-pHLIP significantly improved the antitumor activity of cancer cells.

The resulting double-targeting fusion protein, rONC-T7-pHLIP, was expressed using E. coli Materials and methods Materials The plasmid miniprep kit was purchased from Tiangen Biotech (China), His-tag Purification Resin and MTT from Beyotime (China), rTEV from NEB (USA), and the Annexin V-FITC/PI detection kit from Elabscience (China). E. coli E. coli Construction of expression plasmids rONC-T7-pHLIP was constructed by connecting the N-terminus of the T7 peptide with the C-terminus of ONC and the C-terminus of the T7 peptide with the N-terminus of pHLIP, with the segments linked by (Gly4Ser) 3 E. coli 2015 + Kpn Hin Mlu I Hind III https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/I-TASSER/ 2015 Expression and purification Recombinant plasmids pET-32a-ONC-T7-pHLIP, pET-32a-ONC-T7, and pET-32a-ONC-pHLIP were used to transform E. coli 600 2013 Next, bacteria were collected by centrifugation (8000 g, 4 ℃, 15 min), the pellet was resuspended with PBS, disrupted with ultrasonication on ice, and centrifuged (12,000 g, 4 ℃, 20 min). The equivalence of soluble and insoluble protein fractions (inclusion bodies) was detected by SDS-PAGE. The denatured proteins were refolded in the renaturing buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 2 M Urea, 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) with 2 M urea and then denatured and dissolved in denaturing buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, 10 mM DTT, 300 mM NaCl, 8 M Urea, pH 8.0) for 2 h. The denatured proteins were diluted and reproduced with refolding buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, 2 M urea, 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM GSH/0.4 mM GSSG, pH 8.0), and the reconstituted proteins were separated and purified using nickel columns. After equilibrating the nickel column with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, 2 M urea, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8.0), the reconstituted proteins were loaded onto the nickel column; 5 column volumes of wash buffer to wash the proteins, and 20 column volumes of elution buffer was used to elute the target proteins. The eluted protein was collected and replaced in PBS with a 15-mL, 10-kD ultrafiltration tube (Merck Millipore, Germany). All collected samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Optimization of expression conditions for engineered strains The validated engineered strain E. coli 600 E. coli 2014 TEV enzyme cleavage target protein The target protein was fused with a Trx tag at the N-terminus. The cleavage site of the Trx tag can be specifically recognized and cleaved by TEV protease (Saffari et al. 2020 RNase activity assay ONC exerts its antitumor activity primarily through tRNA degradation when acting on tumor cells. In this experiment, yeast tRNA was employed as the substrate to determine the enzymatic activity of 5 mg/mL fusion proteins rONC, rONC-T7, rONC-pHLIP, and rONC-T7-pHLIP, with nuclease-free water serving as the negative control. Yeast tRNA was reconstituted to 10 mg/mL in nuclease-free water. Aliquots (10 μL) were distributed into five microcentrifuge tubes. Tubes 1–4 received 10 μL of 5 mg/mL solutions of rONC, rONC-T7, rONC-pHLIP, and rONC-T7-pHLIP, respectively, while the control (tube 5) received 10 μL nuclease-free water. Following incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, samples were diluted and resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. Cell culture The HL-7702, HepG2, and A549 cell lines were obtained in the Cell Bank of Chinese Academy of Sciences (China). The HL-7702 normal human hepatocytes were cultured within RPMI-1640 medium that contained 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic/antifungal solution. In contrast, HepG2 and A549 human cancer cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM) that contained 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic/antifungal solution. Cells were incubated in a 5% CO 2 Cytotoxicity assay The MTT method was employed to assess the cytotoxicity of fusion proteins on tumor cells (HepG2, A549) and normal cells (HL-7702) in a 96-well plate. A total of 5 × 10 3 Flow cytometry analysis Flow cytometry was employed to assess the apoptotic effects of fusion proteins on tumor cells (Darzynkiewicz et al. 2001 Immunofluorescence assay Immunofluorescence was employed to detect the localization of the fusion protein in various cell types. The fusion protein was exchanged into a bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.0) using an ultrafiltration tube at 4 °C, and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was added to crosslink the fusion protein at a ratio of 1 mg of protein to 20 μg of FITC. The reaction was subsequently terminated with NH₄Cl at a final concentration of 50 mM. A549 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 10 4 Statistical analysis All quantitative data were measured by at least three independent experiments.

In this experiment, the growth curve of the engineered strain E. coli x 600 y S1 600 600 As a lactose analog, IPTG can regulate the target protein synthesis through the lac operon system. Unlike lactose, IPTG is not metabolized by the bacteria, providing a constant induction. Moreover, within a certain range, increasing the concentration of IPTG can enhance the expression level of the target protein. However, excessively high concentrations of IPTG may inhibit further increases in expression. Therefore, optimizing the IPTG concentration is essential for achieving the best expression results (Fig. 3 E. coli 3 3 1 2 Fig. 3 Determination of the optimal expression conditions for the engineered strain. a b c d Table 1 Orthogonal experimental design and results Groups IPTG (mmol/L) Induction time (h) Induction temperature(℃) Blank column Expression quantity (%) 1 A A A A 37.76 2 B B C A 37.93 3 B A B C 37.95 4 A B B B 41.22 5 C C B A 40.75 6 C A C B 37.76 7 B C A B 43.09 8 C B A C 47.18 9 A C C C 40.20 Mean 1 39.73 37.83 42.68 38.81 - Mean 2 39.66 42.11 39.98 40.69 - Mean 3 41.90 41.35 38.63 41.78 - Note.

FITC: Exhibit yellow-green fluorescence after binding to proteins, DAPI: Exhibit blue fluorescence after binding to double-stranded DNA, Merge: Merge of the two aforementioned fluorescent signals Discussion According to the latest statistics from the Global Cancer Organization, an estimated ten million new cancer deaths occurred worldwide in 2020 (Sung et al. 2021 2024 2024 Targeted conjugate drugs generally consist of two parts: a targeting structural peptide and a main protein drug (Rizvi et al. 2024 2002 2005 2008 2015 2013 2019b 2 1993 2002 1996 2003 2022 2008 2007 1996 1999 2005 2011 2001 2015 E. coli 2018 The T7 peptide, a small molecule derived from viral envelope proteins, binds specifically to the transferrin receptor (TfR) at a site distinct from that of transferrin (Tf), which does not affect the Tf-TfR interaction. Researchers have fused T7 peptide with anti-tumor drugs to enhance tumor cell targeting (Nhàn et al. 2023 2022 2020 2023 2022 In this study, the T7 peptide, pHLIP, and ONC were linked together to create a novel fusion protein. Expression of this protein in E. coli E. coli E. coli ONC exerts its antitumor effects predominantly through tRNA degradation. The fusion protein rONC-TFn demonstrated significantly enhanced in vitro cytotoxic activity against both HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells and HeLa cervical cancer cells compared to rONC alone (Qi et al. 2018 2000 2005 2014 2016 5 50 2007 In summary, this study successfully established a comprehensive process route from the construction of rONC-T7-pHLIP engineered bacteria to product isolation and purification. The engineered protein demonstrated enhanced tumor-targeting efficiency and consequently improved tumor cell-killing efficacy, ultimately yielding a novel broad-spectrum anti-tumor agent with precise targeting, potent cytotoxicity, and lesion-independent activity (Michaelis et al. 2007 2019a Conclusion This study successfully constructed, expressed, and optimized induction conditions for the recombinant dual-targeting fusion protein rONC-T7-pHLIP. The protein demonstrated significantly stronger cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects on tumor cells compared to single-targeting variants (rONC-T7, rONC-pHLIP) and non-targeting rONC, while showing no toxicity to normal cells at effective concentrations. Cellular localization confirmed its cytoplasmic activity in tumor cells. Collectively, rONC-T7-pHLIP emerges as a novel and promising targeted antitumor therapeutic agent.
