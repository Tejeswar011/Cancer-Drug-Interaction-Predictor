Introduction Targeted therapies and newly developed immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have led to significant improvements in the survival of patients with melanoma [ 1 2 3 2 4 5 6 7 Patients with certain conditions specific to ICIs, such as hyperprogression and resistance, could derive substantially reduced benefits from these treatments [ 8 9 10 11 Numerous mechanisms underlying primary resistance have been identified. Tumour-specific factors, such as mutations altering the tumour microenvironment, the tumour mutational burden and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels, play significant roles in resistance. Additionally, host-related factors, including the status of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and presence of immunosuppressive cytokines (e.g., interleukin 6, interleukin 10, and transforming growth factor beta) secreted by tumour cells, are among the key contributors to resistance [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Emerging evidence has shown that inflammatory processes are intimately involved in both tumour progression and the response to anticancer treatments [ 21 22 23 24 25 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Population In this single-centre retrospective study, the biochemical and clinical characteristics of patients who had previously received PD-1 therapy for metastatic melanoma between January 2016 and December 2023 were evaluated to assess treatment resistance. The inclusion criteria for the study were as follows: (i) patients aged over 18 years, (ii) with at least one distant metastasis and (iii) who have undergone at least one assessment according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Patients who received combination ICI therapy, those who died before any assessment could be performed, and patients who had uveal melanoma were excluded from the study. 2.2. Data Collection Demographic, clinical, laboratory and treatment data were extracted from Ege University’s electronic medical records. The baseline clinical characteristics included each patient’s age, gender, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, tumour location, tumour staging according to the eighth edition of the TNM classification, treatment regimen and follow-up data. All selected biomarker parameters were obtained from blood test results collected within two weeks prior to treatment initiation. A comprehensive list of the baseline haematological tests is provided in Appendix A 11 2.3. Statistical Analysis Given the lack of prior studies evaluating primary resistance using biochemical markers in this patient cohort, we utilised LASSO regression for variable selection to identify the most predictive parameters. To guard against overfitting, we incorporated bootstrap resampling into our modelling approach. Statistical modelling for the LASSO regression was performed, and the model performance metrics were calculated using R software (version 4.4.2). All other statistical analyses were conducted using Jamovi (Version 2.3.28, The Jamovi Project, 2023, https://www.jamovi.org p glmnet Table 1 Appendix B Logistic regression assumptions, such as linearity between continuous predictors and the logit of the outcome, and absence of multicollinearity among predictors, were tested and adequately met. Linearity was assessed visually and confirmed statistically using the Box-Tidwell test, whereas multicollinearity was evaluated using the variance inflation factor (VIF), with all predictor variables demonstrating VIF values below 2. 2.4. Management of Missing Data Any missing data for the candidate predictor variables in the study cohort below the 5 per cent were addressed using multiple imputation by chained equations using the ‘survival’ ‘survminer’ ‘mice’ p p 3. Results 3.1. Patient Characteristics A total of 110 patients were included in this study. The patients’ characteristics are presented in Table 1 p 3.2. Markers Selection All of the available clinical indicators, including the clinicopathological features and biomarkers ( Table 1 Appendix C Figure A2 3.3. Construction of Nomogram Logistic regression was applied to finalise the parameters associated with primary resistance based on those identified through LASSO analysis. Upon evaluation, globulin levels, having more than three metastases, BRAF mutation, and acral melanoma were found to be associated with resistance. ( Table 2 Figure 1 Figure A1 3.4. Model Performance Metrics A total of 110 observations were included in the analysis after imputing the missing data. The discriminative ability of the model was assessed using the C-statistic (area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve) ( Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 3 2 p 4. Discussion In this study, we evaluated a wide array of variables with the potential to predict primary resistance, with a particular emphasis on the contributions of biochemical parameters. The statistical analysis demonstrated that lesion localisation, BRAF mutation status, metastatic burden, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and serum globulin levels were all significant predictors of resistance. Moreover, by applying rigorous statistical methods, we identified the markers exhibiting the highest predictive accuracy. The individualisation of cancer treatment processes is crucial for optimising therapeutic responses in contemporary clinical practice. The variability in disease behaviours and patient responses to treatment necessitates employing diverse methods to select the most effective regimen at the start of treatment. In this study, we aimed to identify the patient subgroup exhibiting primary resistance to PD-1 inhibitors in metastatic melanoma. By combining patient characteristics and biochemical parameters, we aimed to investigate clinical and hematologic parameters associated with primary resistance to PD-1 inhibitors and to assemble them into a nomogram framework for hypothesis generation and future validation, rather than making definitive claims about immediate clinical implementation Since the development of therapies targeting anti-PD-1 inhibitors, numerous mechanisms underlying resistance and a variety of related biomarkers have been proposed. From the initiation of anti-PD-1 treatment, factors such as tumour mutational burden, specific mutations (e.g., STK11, KEAP), clonal architecture, aneuploidy, immune-escape mechanisms, and interferon-γ signalling pathways have all been linked to resistance [ 26 27 28 29 Alongside these complex approaches, simpler clinical predictors for melanoma resistance have also been proposed. In a multicentre study by van Duin et al., LDH level, patient sex, ECOG performance status, systemic therapy type and melanoma site, presence of satellite lesions at diagnosis, and time to metastasis were all associated with resistance [ 30 31 7 Numerous molecular and systemic mechanisms underlie the development of primary resistance. These include tumour heterogeneity driven by pre-existing mutations that permit the clonal expansion of resistant cells, therapy-induced genetic alterations accompanying disease progression, the emergence of a mutator phenotype, metabolic diversity within the tumour, and dynamic shifts in both the tumour microenvironment and systemic homeostasis [ 13 14 15 32 5 17 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 40 35 The relationship between globulin levels and resistance has not previously been evaluated. However, a correlation has been observed between the albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR) and treatment response, where a low AGR was associated with a reduced response to ICIs [ 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 The localisation of metastases is a critical parameter influencing the response to ICIs in patients with melanoma. Studies have demonstrated that the presence of brain, bone and liver metastases is associated with lower objective response rates and shorter progression-free survival [ 48 49 50 51 52 53 The distinct characteristics of melanomas in different anatomical locations contribute to the variations in treatment responses. Acral and mucosal melanomas are associated with a low tumour mutational burden, which is considered a factor that drives resistance [ 52 54 High PLRs were associated with increased platelet counts and decreased lymphocyte counts. Previous studies have demonstrated that elevated PLRs are correlated with worse survival outcomes and treatment resistance [ 55 56 57 58 59 60 What steps can we take to overcome resistance? First and foremost, combination therapies play a critical role in reducing primary resistance rates. While the primary resistance rates for anti-PD-1 therapies range between 40% and 60%, they have been observed to decrease to 30–40% with anti-PD-1 and CTLA-4 combination therapies [ 10 61 5. Limitation The principal limitation of this study is the lack of external validation owing to its single-centre, retrospective design. Also, because all data were generated under homogeneous conditions, no outlier removal or batch-effect adjustment was applied, which may limit generalizability. Additionally, the relatively small patient cohort resulted in a heterogeneous population and uneven subgroup distributions, which may have led to reduced statistical significance. To address these issues, future research should re-evaluate the current nomogram in larger, multicentre populations. 6. Conclusions In this study, parameters associated with primary resistance were evaluated in patients with metastatic melanoma who were receiving PD-1 therapy. These parameters were selected by using LASSO and logistic regression analyses to develop the most accurate model possible, which was then transformed into a nomogram. Novel markers, not previously reported in the literature, have been identified in this study. Based on our findings, this nomogram is less a decision-making algorithm and more a tool to help clinicians predict the benefits patients are likely to derive from their current treatment. The clinical applicability of these markers will become clearer following their validation in larger patient cohorts.

This heatmap illustrates the pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients among the five model predictors—PLR, Globulin, Number of Metastasis, Lesion Localisation, and BRAF Mutation. Colour intensity reflects the strength and direction of the correlation (blue for positive, red for negative), confirming the absence of high multicollinearity (|r| < 0.7) and supporting the stability of the logistic regression model. Figure A2 Range-Adjusted Feature Importance Barplot. This horizontal bar chart displays the relative impact of each predictor—PLR, Globulin, Number of Metastasis, Lesion Localisation, and BRAF Mutation—on primary resistance risk. Importance is calculated as the absolute LASSO coefficient multiplied by the variable’s observed range (max–min), thereby accounting for both effect size and measurement scale. Variables with larger bars contribute more strongly to the prediction when their full clinical range is considered. References 1. Ascierto P.A. Long G.V. Robert C. Brady B. Dutriaux C.

For each predictor, draw a vertical line to the Points scale and record the score. Sum these scores to obtain the Total Points, then project down to the Predicted Resistance Risk axis to read the estimated probability. Higher Total Points correspond to a greater risk of resistance. For the calculation, more than three metastatic sites add 53 points, acral/mucosal localisation adds 34 points, and BRAF-mutant status adds 29 points; globulin and PLR should be scored according to their levels.
