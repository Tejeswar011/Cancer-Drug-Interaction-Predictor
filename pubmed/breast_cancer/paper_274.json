This study examined multilevel factors associated with CBE uptake among women in the Northern Region of Ghana. Methods A multi-stage cluster sampling technique was employed to recruit women aged 25 years and older from 30 communities in the Tamale metropolis, Northern Region of Ghana. To determine the factors associated with CBE uptake, multilevel logistic regression models were fitted. The outcome of the fixed effects analysis was presented using adjusted odds ratios (aOR), with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a p-value of less than 0.05. Results Approximately 1,543 women were recruited from 30 communities with 48 clusters. The prevalence of CBE uptake was 23%. From the fixed effects results, women with tertiary education (aOR = 2.53, 95%CI = 1.49–4.29) were more likely to have CBE compared to those with no formal education. Women with increased knowledge of breast cancer (BC) were more likely to undergo CBE (aOR = 1.04, 95%CI = 1.00-1.07). The higher the perceived susceptibility to BC, the higher the likelihood of undergoing CBE (aOR = 1.25, 95%CI = 1.06–1.47). Women with increased perceived barriers to BC screening (aOR = 0.54, 95%CI = 0.41–0.73) and higher perceived fear of BC (aOR = 0.72, 95%CI = 0.57–0.91) were less likely to undergo CBE. Women who received recommendations from friends (aOR = 1.99, 95%CI = 1.25–3.18) and healthcare providers (aOR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.00-2.39) were more likely to utilize CBE compared to their counterparts. Women in communities with health facilities (aOR = 2.14, 95%CI = 1.43–3.21) and those who resided in urban areas (aOR = 1.72, 95%CI = 1.10–2.69) were more likely to utilize CBE than their counterparts. Conclusion The findings signify that a multifactorial systematic approach is required to increase CBE uptake among Ghanaian women. We recommend a comprehensive community-based education program about BC, targeted at raising awareness of breast health and improving the knowledge of the disease, together with the benefits of CBE uptake. Concurrently, improving access to health facilities and CBE services is needed. Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12885-025-14550-w.

This study adhered to the STROBE reporting guidelines ( https://www.strobe-statement.org/ Study setting The study was conducted in the Tamale Metropolis, in the Northern region of Ghana. The Tamale metropolis has three sub-metropolises that make up the Metropolitan Assembly, namely: Tamale North, Tamale South, and Tamale Central. The metropolis has a population of 374,744 people, with 185,051 men and 189,693 women, as per the Ghana 2021 population and housing census. There are 117 communities in the Metropolitan Assembly, including urban [41 (35%)], peri-urban [15 (13%)], and rural [61 (52%)]. In the Tamale Metropolis, there were 89,011 households and 9,234 non-household residents. There is a tertiary-level hospital that acts as a referral hub for all of Ghana’s northern regions. The city is also home to three secondary-level medical facilities. The tertiary-level facility contains a cancer unit that treats both outpatients and inpatients. The three additional secondary-level hospitals offer CBE services in outpatient departments but do not have a BC unit. Inclusion and exclusion criteria This study included Ghanaian women who resided within the Tamale metropolis and were aged between 25 and 75 years and had no history of BC. The exclusion criteria involved women who were mentally challenged or self-reported any form of breast disease. Sampling technique A multi-stage cluster sampling method, i.e., a stratified two-stage cluster sampling technique, was used as follows. First Primary Sample Units (PSUs) or clusters within communities that included both urban and rural areas were selected by systematic random sampling. Next, households within the chosen clusters were identified via a systematic random sampling procedure. The overall number of women chosen from each cluster was proportional to its population based on the demarcation by the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) clusters. Using the GDHS mapping of the enumeration areas, 33 women were selected from each cluster. In determining the sample size, a 38% CBE rate among women based on a previous study in the Northern region of Ghana [ 13 14 Measurements Outcome measures The main outcome variable was CBE uptake within the past year, through self-report to the question “In the past year, have you had your breast examined by a health professional to screen for cancer”? The response options were binary (yes/no). Independent variables Intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual variables were measured as follows. Intrapersonal factors Breast cancer knowledge BC knowledge was measured using the Breast Cancer Awareness Measure (BCAM) tool [ 15 16 16 16 Perceived susceptibility, benefits, and barriers The Champion Health Belief Model Scale (CHBMS) [ 17 18 17 18 Fatalism The 15-item Powe Fatalism Scale [ 19 20 20 Perceived treatment belief, stigma, and fear of breast cancer This study selected three out of the six subscales (perceived knowledge, perceived treatment belief, perceived need for health check, perceived stigma, perceived fear, and perceived risk) in the Breast Cancer Perception Scale [ 21 21 Cultural belief The 17-item Cultural Belief Instrument developed by Ferrans et al. [ 22 22 22 Sociodemographic characteristics Age (in years), educational attainment, marital status, employment status, religious affiliation, level of monthly income, place of residence, ease of access to hospitals and screening facilities, health insurance coverage, cost of medical care, exposure to mass media (TV, radio, newspapers), parity, menopause, and family history of BC were among the sociodemographic characteristics that were derived from the literature. Interpersonal factors Recommendations for CBE The recommendations for CBE from friends (1 item), families (1 item), and healthcare professionals (1 item) were individually assessed. Response options were yes/no for each of the questions and were analyzed separately. Social support for breast cancer screening The 19-item Medical Outcome Study (MOS) Social Support Survey [ 23 23 Contextual factors The following community-level variables were measured as contextual factors: Availability of hospital/BC screening centers was assessed using a binary response (yes/no). Distance to the health facility was assessed using GPS coordinates and measured in kilometers (km). The place of residence was categorized into binary responses (rural and urban areas). Finally, the geographical location was measured using the three subdivisions of the Tamale metropolis (Tamale Central, Tamale South, and Tamale North). Data collection procedures Prior to data collection, an organized standardized training program was carried out for the research assistants (RA, n https://www.kobotoolbox.org/ Statistical analysis Stata version 16 (StataCorp, LP, College Station, TX, USA) was used to analyze the data. Descriptive statistics were done for the distribution of CBE uptake across the categories of the explanatory variables. The association between the outcome variable (CBE) and the selected explanatory variables was estimated using a chi-square test and an independent t-test. The multivariate multilevel analyses considered the independent variables that were significant in the bivariate analysis. To determine factors associated with CBE uptake, multilevel fixed effects binary logistic regression models were fitted. In total, four models (Model 0, Model I, Model II, and Model III) were built: the first model (Model 0) was fitted as an empty model without predictors (random intercept). The second model (Model I) included intrapersonal-level factors against CBE uptake. Utilizing the interpersonal level components and CBE uptake, the third model (Model II) was fitted. By making adjustments for the contextual level variables, the final model (Model III) was fitted. The outcomes of the fixed effects analysis were presented using adjusted odds ratios (aOR), which had a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a p-value of less than 0.05.

Women in communities with available BC screening/health facilities (aOR = 2.14, 95%CI = 1.43–3.21) and those who resided in urban areas (aOR = 1.72, 95%CI = 1.10–2.69) were more likely to utilize CBE. Women who received recommendations from friends (aOR = 1.99, 95%CI = 1.25–3.18) and healthcare providers (aOR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.00-2.39) were more likely to utilize CBE than those who did not receive any recommendation. Women with increased knowledge of BC were more likely to undergo CBE (aOR = 1.04, 95%CI = 1.00-1.07). The higher the women’s perceived susceptibility to BC, the higher their likelihood of having CBE (aOR = 1.25, 95%CI = 1.06–1.47). Women with increased perceived barriers to BC screening (aOR = 0.54, 95%CI = 0.41–0.73) and higher perceived fear of BC (aOR = 0.72, 95%CI = 0.57–0.91) were less likely to utilize CBE. Women who perceived the distance to health facilities to be a problem were less likely to utilize CBE (aOR = 0.56, 95%CI = 0.39–0.80). (Table 3 Discussion This was the first community-based study employing the ecological model to examine intrapersonal, interpersonal, and community-level factors influencing CBE uptake. In the wake of rising BC incidence in Ghana, this study aimed to provide a comprehensive picture of CBE uptake among women in the Northern Region of Ghana. The present study found that only 23% of women utilized CBE, which is higher than the 14.4% reported by a recent study in the Upper West Region of Ghana [ 6 25 13 13 13 13 This study found that women who attained tertiary education were more likely to utilize CBE than those with no formal education. This finding disagrees with a recent study in the Upper West Region of Ghana, where women with tertiary education were less likely to utilize breast self-examination, CBE, and MMG [ 6 6 26 27 28 The significant positive association between BC knowledge and CBE uptake in this study aligns with studies conducted in Vietnam [ 29 30 31 31 Consistent with several other cross-sectional studies conducted in the Maldives [ 30 32 29 29 30 32 33 The present study reveals the significant positive effect of friends’ and healthcare professionals’ recommendations on CBE uptake. This finding underscores the crucial role healthcare professionals play in influencing the health behavior of women, along with the significant trust in healthcare professionals’ recommendations regarding health decisions. Since the study findings suggest the significance of health professional recommendations in promoting BC screening, integrating BC screening programs with existing health programs and services, such as reproductive health programs, maternal and child health services, or general health check-ups, would be imperative. This finding is congruent with a previous nationwide study in Kenya, which reported that women in urban settlements were more likely to undergo CBE because screening centers were more available [ 34 25 34 35 35 36 Limitations of the study This study used a cross-sectional design and therefore could not draw a causal inference; hence, the findings should be interpreted with caution. Even though the study was conducted across 30 communities with about 48 clusters, these findings cannot be generalized to the population of Ghanaian women due to regional and contextual differences. Although this study had limitations, the use of a larger sample with a robust sampling method and validated tools to collect data from women and the use of a multilevel method of analysis gives credence to the study findings. Conclusion The study revealed a very low rate, and multilevel factors associated with CBE uptake. The study findings signify that the interplay of individual, interpersonal, and community-level factors influencing women’s BC screening behavior requires a multifactorial systematic approach to increase CBE uptake among Ghanaian women. We recommend a comprehensive community-based education program about BC targeted at raising awareness of breast health and improving the knowledge of the disease, together with the benefits of CBE uptake.
