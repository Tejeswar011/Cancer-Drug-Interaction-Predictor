In this article, a comprehensive information is provided on the effectiveness of CAR-T therapy in various types of cancers some of which have shown to be particularly challenging cancers to fully eliminate. The clinical effectiveness of CAR-T therapy compared to other traditional methods of cancer treatments such as surgical, radiotherapy, high dose rate (HDR)-brachytherapy, and immunotherapy favors CAR-T cell treatment strategy. The article presents the concept of CAR-T, discuss the structure and function of this novel therapeutic and its efficacy in liquid cancers, and development of therapies in solid cancers. Partial and complete response rates in relation to the CAR-T methodologies on various cancers are critically reviewed with discussion on the durability and overall long-term effects and limitations. Potential role of CAR-T therapies in various cancer treatments is reviewed in conjunction with other therapies and the efficacies and status on the progress of those therapies. Despite the impressive efficacy of CAR-T therapy, it is associated with potentially serious side effects, particularly cardiovascular toxicities that require proper cardiovascular screening prior, during, and after CAR-T therapy. These highlight the standardized modes of monitoring, prevention, and management of the toxicities. The cytokine release storm (CRS) in the pathogenesis of CAR-T toxicities may manifest in different ways emphasizing heterogeneous clinical presentation of CAR-T adverse events, highlighting the need for vigilant monitoring and individualized management strategies. Nonetheless, additional information on the serious adverse effects and long-term effects warrants further investigation.

Cancer remains as a top three causes of death in patients aged 30–69 years in 177 of 183 countries [ 1 4 5 10 11 16 17 18 17 19 18 20 27 15 18 28 30 12 31 34 CAR-T Cell and Approved Therapies CAR-T cell therapy has shown to have potential in treating liquid cancers and allow for custom designs to be created for higher specificity and efficacy as compared to other forms of cancer therapies and they usually contain an extracellular ligand binding domain, single chain variant fragment (scFv), a spacer domain, transmembrane domain and other cytoplasmic domains [ 35 36 Figure 1 Figure 1 37 38 42 Figure 2 Mechanism of Action of CAR-T Cell Therapy CAR-T is one of the main branches of adoptive T cell therapies where tumor cell killing occurs via activation of T-cells to thereby bind to the tumor cell surface antigens. The specificity of binding can be traced back to the scFv, spacer domain, and costimulatory domains. Upon binding, anti-tumor effects can be seen via the distribution of perforins, Fas ligands, and the release of cytokines to effectively attack the stroma surrounding the tumor [ 43 44 45 46 47 Efficacy of CAR-T Cell Therapy in B-cell Lymphoma Non-Hodgkin’s B-cell Lymphoma (NHL) is a type of lymphoma that manifests in several different variations ranging from highly aggressive to less aggressive NHL and indolent NHLs. Although there are several medications available in the forms of antineoplastics, steroids, and monoclonal antibodies, all of which have shown some effectiveness and durable results in patients, they do not provide cures or resistance to cancer relapse. Outcomes for patients struggling with NHL have been revamped with the introduction of CAR-T therapy for this type of cancer [ 14 48 50 51 52 Efficacy of CAR-T Cell Therapy in Refractory Large B-cell Lymphoma Another potential usage of CAR-T has been seen in therapeutic plans for refractory large B-cell lymphoma. In a multicenter phase 2 clinical trial, 101 patients diagnosed with various B-cell lymphomas including large B-cell lymphoma, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma all of which had refractory disease were dosed with the 2×106 anti-CD19 CAR T cells by the name of axi-cel. Objective response rate was noted to be 82% with a complete response rate of 54%. Most common adverse effects noted were neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. In this study they claimed a dose-independent response with 3 noted deaths during treatment. Durability of the response rates were also mentioned, noting that after a follow up time of 1 year, the objective response rate was 82% with a complete response rate of 58% with a median duration of response was 11.1 months [ 52 53 54 Efficacy of CAR-T Cell Therapy in Mantle Cell Carcinoma Mantle-cell carcinoma is a rare-subtype of B-cell NHL which arise from naive B-cells in the mantle zone of lymphoid follicles. Most patients with this type of cancer present with very advanced stages of cancers and lymphadenopathy and bone marrow dysfunction, generally considered to be very aggressive and incurable but have shown susceptibility to CAR-T therapy [ 55 57 58 59 Efficacy of CAR-T Cell Therapy in Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma In the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cases, a meta-analysis of 14 clinical trials was conducted with a total number of 419 patients with B-cell NHL lymphomas most of which were refractory or relapsed diffuse large cell B-cell lymphomas (306 patients with diffuse large cell B-cell lymphomas) [ 59 54 61 63 Efficacy of CAR-T Cell Therapy in Solid Tumors Targeting Mesothelin Although many of the clinical trials done with CAR-T therapies have been focused on liquid cancers, CAR-T has still been trialed in solid tumors, however not without challenges. There are several FDA-approved CAR-T modalities for blood cancer such axi-cel, tisa-cel, liso-cel, and breexu-cel with durable remission rates CAR-T therapies struggle to enter the tumor microenvironment and are more susceptible to relapse. The variability of antigens located on many solid tumors such as lung cancer tumors have presented challenges [ 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 74 75 74 74 CAR-T Targeting Pancreatic Cancer Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is known to be one of the most aggressive forms of cancer that presents with high mortality rates and poor prognoses. It also presents as a cancer that has high and aggressive rates and forms metastasis with median survival times being less than 1 year and with 10% or less of people with PDAC surviving 5 or more years [ 76 77 78 79 79 79 80 81 82 CAR-T Treatment of Claudin-18.2-positive Gastro-esophageal Cancers In a very recent study gastric cancers were evaluated that were positive for Claudin-18.2 isoform. 100 patients were treated with Satri-cel CAR-T therapy vs physician’s choice chemotherapy. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) were measured. Satri-cel showed statistically significant improvement in PFS compared to chemotherapy. Toxicities were also mentioned in the abstract mentioning that toxicity remained controlled, but details were not mentioned. Overall, the study claimed Satri-cel to be improved over standard care in gastric cancer [ 81 83 CAR-T Cell Therapy-associated Cardiovascular Toxicities Despite the many advances made by CAR-T in treating hematological cancers, particularly in B-cell lymphomas and relapsing B-cell lymphomas [ 54 63 84 85 86 87 87 88 Biomarkers and Monitoring of Cardiotoxicity This ushers in the need for thorough long-term monitoring in patients requiring CAR-T therapies and perhaps a need for co-treatment with therapies that explore cardioprotective measures associated with administering CAR-T therapy [ 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 Treatment of Cytokine Release Storm Treatment modalities that have been used to treat CRS have been grade specific. Any patient who presents to the hospital with CRS first undergoes monitoring of vital signs, neurological assessments and blood counts, and biomarkers [ 99 100 101 103 Risk Factors for CAR-T-induced Cardiotoxicity CAR-T associated cardiomyopathy may be due to several causes noting vascular leak and it is not uncommon for patients to suffer from capillary leak syndrome following CAR-T therapy [ 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 117 107 118 108 110 116 110 111 85 Future Directions for CAR-T-induced Cardiotoxicity The recent advancements in CAR-T as well as the emphasis on treating relapsing cancers has made a great leap into the realm of personalized medicine which has opened the door for many ground-breaking clinical therapies but not without the presence of cardiotoxicity. Currently there is no standardized way of evaluating the cardiac function of a patient prior to treatment and many of these methods are dependent on the institutions conducting these studies [ 113 114 115 116 117 115 Funding The research work of DKA is supported by the R25AI179582 grant from the National Institutes of Health, USA.

Figure 2: Examples of the cancers in which CAR T-cell therapy is efficacious. However, further studies are required in other cancers and indeed several clinical trials in solid tumors and autoimmune diseases are currently in progress. Key Points CAR T-cell therapy is indeed a significant advancement in cancer treatment with impressive efficacy in treating certain hematological malignancies with long-term remission and even cure, The infused the CAR T cells locate and attack cancer cells that express the target antigen, leading to their destruction. The CAR T cells may multiply in the body of the patient, providing a long-term defense against the cancer. CAR T-cell therapy has been approved by the FDA in the treatment of several cancers, including Non-Hodgkin’s B-cell lymphoma, diffuse and primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma, Mantle cell carcinoma, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and multiple myeloma. Clinical trials are currently in progress investigating the effect of CAR T-cell therapies in other types of cancer, including solid tumors like breast cancer and lung cancer, and autoimmune diseases. CAR T-cell infusion can induce severe adverse effects, including cytokine release storm, cardiotoxicity, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, anemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and infections due to weakened immune system. Some patients with CAR-T cell infusion experience mild to life-threatening cardiovascular complications, such as arrhythmias or heart failure, due to the inflammatory response. The activated T-cells following CAR T-cell infusion may release inflammatory cytokines and trigger systemic inflammatory response, causing symptoms like fever, low blood pressure, and organ dysfunction. Heterogeneous clinical presentation of CAR-T adverse events underscores the need for vigilant monitoring for cardiotoxicity and individualized management strategies. Careful clinical studies are warranted for long-term efficacy and safety. ",
