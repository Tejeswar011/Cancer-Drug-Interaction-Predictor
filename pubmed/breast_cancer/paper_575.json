This randomized controlled, double-blinded superiority study aimed to quantitatively assess the effects of this technique on the resulting graft sites via functional measurements including elasticity, humidification, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), pigmentation, and erythema at 6 months after surgery. A survey was performed to evaluate the satisfaction levels of both patients and surgeons. We considered patients with full-thickness skin defects for whom split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs) were used. By random assignment, they were allocated to the ADM group or the STSG-only group. The ADM group received STSG with a ADM layer on the defect, whereas the STSG-only group was reconstructed with only STSG. At 6 months after surgery, patients were evaluated for elasticity, humidification, TEWL, erythema, and pigmentation. Defect areas before and 2 weeks after surgery were traced and measured. Patients and surgeons rated the graft sites as excellent, good, fair or poor at 6 months after the operation. Among the 89 patients who were screened, 54 patients were enrolled in this study. Compared with those in the STSG-only group, defects that were reconstructed with STSG and ADM resulted in significantly greater elasticity, lower TEWL, and less erythema. There were no significant differences in humidification or pigmentation. The ADM co-grafted with STSGs was associated with greater satisfaction among surgeons, whereas patient satisfaction was not significantly different between the two groups. Co-grafting ADM with STSG in full-thickness wounds can lead to favorable wound healing in terms of elasticity, TEWL, and erythema. This approach also has a higher satisfaction rate for surgeons.

It is an allogenic or xenogenic immunologically inert processed layer of dermis that can be utilized as an extracellular matrix that provides scaffolding and facilitating wound healing 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 One of the main functions of ADM is providing a protective and incorporable layer for wound coverage. For shallow and expansive wounds, finding a source of dermal replacement with limited donor sites is challenging. For deeper wounds, protecting the underlying structures, such as tendons, nerves, muscles, and bones, and facilitating skin graft integration is important 8 10 11 While ADM is a widely used tool, its effectiveness on STSG outcomes has not been quantitatively analyzed. Many studies have affirmed that ADM is beneficial to reconstruction with skin grafts, but few have objectively inspected the healed tissues in terms of measured parameters. Among many parameters, we have chosen to inspect elasticity, skin humidification, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), erythema, and pigmentation in order to assess the biomechanical properties of the skin barrier 12 15 This randomized, double-blinded, superiority trial investigates the effect of ADM on STSG healing by comparing tissue characteristics, including elasticity, erythema, scar humidification, transepidermal water loss, and the melanin index. In addition, patient and surgeon satisfaction was assessed using subjective surveys. Method Study design This study was a randomized, double-blinded, superiority trial that was conducted at Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, Yonsei Severance Hospital, and Seoul Asan Hospital to evaluate the efficacy of combining STSG with human ADM (L&C Bio, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea) in the reconstruction of full-thickness skin defects between 2022 and 2024. Trial protocol and data are available in supplementary files. Ethical review This study was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital, Asan Medical Center, and Severance Hospital before and throughout the experiment. Any significant modifications related to the study were subject to IRB approval, and all results have been registered in the Clinical Research Information Service on 24/02/22 ( https://cris.nih.go.kr As a postmarketing clinical study of Megaderm Plus (L&C Bio, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea) performed within the approved indications, it is not subject to approval by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS). Study population Patients between 19 and 70 years of age with full-thickness skin defects requiring reconstruction were provided with informed consent to participate in the clinical trial. Defects were acute, uninfected wounds on flat surfaces that were not affected by joint movements. Target enrollment was 84 subjects, with 42 per group, accounting for 20% dropout. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant, nursing, or had a history of potentially relevant or unsuitable conditions that could interfere with wound healing. Randomization and maintaining blindness Each enrolled patient was assigned a screening number and screened per the eligibility criteria. After completing the screening process, each eligible patient was randomly assigned a 3-digit number and assigned to either the experimental (ADM and STSG) or control group (STSG only) according to a computer-generated randomization table. This allotment was performed via the block randomization method, in which each patient was stratified to each institution so that the control group and experimental groups could be balanced. The three-digit randomization number was used as the patient identification code during the experiment. This study maintained double-blindness by establishing an independent investigator to measure and analyze the functional assessments. Because the investigator was not involved in the surgical process, he or she was able to make objective measurements without bias. The operator was aware of the patient allocation during the surgery but was blinded during the satisfaction survey. Safety analysis and discontinuation of trial Adverse events were assessed at every visit after the operation and were classified according to severity; mild, if it does not interfere with normal daily activities, moderate if it causes noticeable discomfort affecting normal daily activities, or severe if it prevents normal daily activities. If unexpected surgical complications occur in more than 30% of participants, the trial was to be discontinued. Surgical procedure and postoperative care Before skin grafting, all wounds were debrided, thoroughly irrigated, and cauterized for bleeding. When the full-thickness skin defect was prepared for skin grafting, it was traced for area measurements before grafting. Split-thickness skin grafts were harvested from either thigh with a pneumatic dermatome at 0.002 mm thickness. The ADM group received a combination of cadaveric ADM (MegadermPlus, L&C Bio, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea) and STSG, whereas the control group received STSG alone. For the ADM group, human ADM was placed on the defect and was trimmed to fit before applying the STSG (Fig. 1 2  Fig. 1 Clinical photos of reconstructing full-thickness defects with ADM and STSG. ( a b c d  Fig. 2 Clinical photos of reconstructing full-thickness defects with STSG only. ( a b c Postoperative follow-ups and evaluations Follow-up observations were performed at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. All assessments and measurements were done by a blinded investigator who had not participated in the randomization process or the surgical procedures. At each visit, the patients’ vital signs were measured, photographs of their surgical sites were taken, and any adverse effects were observed. At the 2 week visit, pictures of graft sites were taken and areas of successfully healed grafts were measured by ImageJ program. At the 6-month visit, the patients were analyzed for their functional skin assessments and satisfaction. Primary outcome was skin elasticity at 6 months after surgery. Secondary outcomes included other functional skin assessments at 6 months after surgery, such as scar humidification, TEWL, melanin index, and erythema index. Elasticity was measured with a Cutometer MPA-580 (Courage & Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Germany) under 500 mbar vacuum. Scar humidification was measured with a Corneometer (Courage & Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Germany) and a CM825 probe. TEWL was measured with a Tewameter (Courage & Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Germany) and TM300 probe. The melanin index and erythema index were measured with a Mexameter (Courage & Khazaka Electronic GmbH, Germany) with an MX18 probe. The graft areas were traced during surgery before grafting and 2 weeks after surgery. Tracings were then scanned, and the area was measured via the ImageJ program. A blinded satisfaction survey was performed at 6 months after surgery by both patients and surgeons, who rated their resulting skin graft sites as excellent, good, fair, or poor. Statistical analysis The functional assessment of skin elasticity, humidification, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), the melanin index, and erythema at 6 months postsurgery was performed. Group comparisons were performed via either the independent two-sample t test or Wilcoxon rank-sum test, which is based on normality assumptions per the Shapiro‒Wilk test. If the patient was missing any data, the data was excluded from analysis. The satisfaction scores from both the investigators and the participants are presented as frequencies. Comparisons between groups were made via Fisher’s exact test if there were more than 5 cells with expected counts of less than 5. The graft rate at 2 weeks postsurgery was calculated by comparing the engrafted area to the initial treated area for each treatment group. Group comparisons were performed via the Mann‒Whitney U test after testing for a normal distribution via the Shapiro‒Wilk test.  Fig. 3 Patient enrollment, randomization, and follow-up. Results Eighty-nine patients were screened for eligibility, and 85 patients who met the eligibility criteria were randomized into ADM-only and STSG-only groups. Forty-one and 44 patients were allocated to the ADM-only and STSG-only groups, respectively. During the surgical procedures, a different surgical method was selected for 3 patients in the ADM group and 1 patient in the STSG-only group. During postoperative follow-up, 10 and 17 patients, respectively, were withdrawn from the study because of noncompliance (4 and 7 patients, respectively), withdrawal of consent (1 and 2 patients, respectively), and otherwise, miscellaneous reasons (5 and 8 patients, respectively). As a result, a total of 54 patients were enrolled per protocol this study, with 28 in the ADM group and 26 in the STSG only group (Fig. 3 Both groups did not differ significantly in terms of demographic factors, such as age, sex, previous medical history, defect location, or cause of defects. The mean ages of the ADM and STSG-only groups were 56.6 and 57.8 years, respectively. Nearly all patients had previous illnesses, including soft tissue malignancies. Most of the defects were free flap donor sites (92.9% and 88.5%, respectively) located at thigh and forearm areas. Other defects were caused by other means such as trauma, burn, fasciotomy, and tumor excision. All defects were clean, acute wounds located on flat surfaces not associated with joint movements (Table 1 Skin assessment at 6 months after surgery revealed elasticity, humidification, transepidermal water loss (TEWL, g/hr/m 2 4 2 The graft area was measured before grafting and 2 weeks after surgery. The mean defect areas were 34.51 ± 29.81 cm 2 2 2 2 Patient and surgeon satisfaction analysis was performed at 6 months after surgery. (Table 3 5 Nine adverse events were reported among 6 subjects (21.4%) in the test group and 37 among 10 subjects (38.5%) in the control group, but none were relevant to the procedure. In the test group, the adverse events were operation site pain, hypertension, vertigo, hemoptysis, arm swelling, arm pain, soft tissue abscess, and cancer metastasis. The control group reported symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, pruritus, and facial edema, but none were relevant to the procedure. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups ( p  Table 1 Demographics.

Discussion Skin grafting is a useful reconstructive method that is versatile for most defects, but it is limited by donor site availability 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Various forms of ADMs have been explored, ranging from allografts and xenografts to artificial matrices, that can facilitate tissue growth with minimal immunologic reactions or scarring 23 24 25 26 26 27 In the clinical setting, both allogenic and xenogenic ADMs are actively used in reconstructive surgery. They are mainstay in breast reconstruction for natural aesthetic outcomes and to prevent capsular contracture in breast 28 29 30 1 31 32 31 33 31 34 32 Especially in split-thickness skin grafts, supplementation with ADM can provide a layer of acellular extracellular matrix (ECM), a kind of biocompatible scaffold for tissue ingrowth, and mimic the physiologic dermis layer that STSGs lack. Full thickness skin grafts (FTSGs), skin grafts that include the dermis layer, are often considered as an alternative, but they are limited by donor site morbidity in expansive defect coverage. ADM acts as a supplementary dermis in STSGs, and is known to facilitate wound healing by providing a template 3 35 36 36 37 37 6 9 This study aimed to assess the function and aesthetics of healed defects to objectively analyze the effect of ADM on STSG by quantitative parameters and surgeon-/patient-reported quality outcomes. Functional measures were reported by elasticity, a parameter reflecting skin plasticity and durability 37 38 13 14 39 At 6 months after surgery, the primary outcome showed that skin elasticity was higher in the STSG and ADM group. Lee et al. 40 35 37 41 For secondary outcomes, we measured other variables to attest for the biomechanical properties of grafted skin. Our experiment revealed that skin grafts with ADM presented a lower TEWL, confirming that ADM can act as a functional assistance against moisture loss. Other studies 40 ADM co-grafted STSGs were significantly less erythematous than STSG-only group, indicating that ADM co-grafted with STSGs may reduce the possibility of future scar symptoms. Pigmentation was not significantly different between the groups while other studies 40 According to our satisfaction survey, ADM was significantly favored by surgeons, while there was no significant difference among patients. Given that this is a double-blinded study, STSG sites co-grafted with ADM were rated more favorable to the professional eye. It also shows that there was no outstanding downside in the use of ADM compared to STSG only reconstructions. Limitations of this study are underscored by the shortness of the follow-up period. Evaluations of functional assessments would benefit from a longer observation to see the changes made with skin remodeling. Satisfaction survey could be done in more detail to analyze the reasons behind the responses. Conclusion This double-blinded controlled study objectively shows that human ADM can enhance the skin grafts in elasticity, TEWL, and erythema. Subjective survey showed that surgeons viewed ADM co-grafted skin as more favorable to the surgeons and that patients did not complain of significant differences. We corroborate that ADM is a beneficial tool in STSG and suggest a long-term study for its impact on skin remodeling.
