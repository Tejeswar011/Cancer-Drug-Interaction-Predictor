LSR is expressed in the plasma membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus of cancer cells with metastatic signatures ( 24 25 25 24 26 27 28 29 30 25 31 + + + in vitro in vivo This study aimed to develop and evaluate an LSR-targeted ADC to treat TNBC. High expression of LSR was confirmed in TNBC cell lines and patient tissues. Leveraging this, a new anti-LSR mAb was developed, engineered and used to conjugate with mertansine (DM1). The mAb’s surface binding, internalization, and tumor-targeting capabilities were validated using flow cytometry, confocal microscopy and In Vivo in vitro Materials and methods Animal studies were conducted according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) Protocol 2022A00000071 that was approved by the university Institutional Biosafety Committee. Cell lines and culture media The human TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-231-FLuc (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) were cultivated in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, v/v) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Pen/Strep, v/v). The mouse TNBC cell lines 4T1 and 4T1-FLuc (ATCC) were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep. The seed train of Expi293F cells for LSR mAb production was maintained in Expi293 Expression Medium containing 4 mM GlutaMAX and 4 g/L glucose. All cell cultures were incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO 2 Development, engineering, and production of anti-LSR mAb First, the anti-human LSR mAb, targeting the Ig-like V-type extracellular domain (Met1-Asp259) of the surface receptor, was developed using the well-established hybridoma technology as previously described ( 32 34 The engineered LSR mAb was produced from Expi293F cells using transient expression system (Gibco) fed with glucose (6 g/L) and L-GlutaMAX (6 mM). The antibody productions were performed in 2-L stirred-tank bioreactor with process parameters of Temp 37°C, agitation 140 rpm, DO 40% and pH 7.2, or in a 3-L shaker flask at Temp 37°C, agitation 130 rpm, and 8% CO 2 33 36 32 35 37 40 3 4 3 6 5 7 3 6 5 7 Construction of LSR mAb-DM1 The LSR mAb-DM1 ADC was constructed using our previously established conjugation platform ( 32 34 40 Characterization of ADCs The purity and drug-antibody ratio (DAR) of the ADC were analyzed using a High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD, USA) equipped with a MAbPac hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC)-butyl column (5 µm, 4.6x100 mm). Two aqueous mobile phases with flow rates of 1.0 mL/min were utilized: Buffer A, 1.5 M (NH 4 2 4 3 4 3 4  In vitro The human and mouse TNBC cells were seeded in 96-well plates at densities of 10,000 cells (MDA-MB-468), 1,000 cells (MDA-MB-231), and 500 cells (4T1) per well. The cells in each well were treated with LSR mAb-DM1 or free DM1 at final concentrations of 0, 2, 4, 10, 20, 50, 100, or 200 nM. After a 5-day incubation at 37°C and 5% CO 2 Flow cytometry analysis The surface binding of engineered LSR mAb to TNBC MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and 4T1 cells was tested using flow cytometry as described before ( 41 46 6 6 Live-cell confocal microscopy The internalization of LSR mAb into TNBC cells was assessed using live-cell confocal microscopy. Approximately 10,000 MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded in 35-mm glass-bottom dishes (Cellvis, Mountain View, CA, USA) in 1.5-mL of medium. As described before ( 47  In vivo The 6-week-old NOD SCID gamma (NSG) female mice (Jackson Lab, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were subcutaneously (s.c.) injected with 10×10 6 ex vivo MDA-MB-231 xenografted models and treatment A total of 10x10 6 3 2 4T1 xenografted models and treatment The 6-week-old BALB/cJ female mice were s.c. implanted with 2x10 6 3 Immunohistochemistry staining A TNBC patient tissue microarray (TMA, Cat# BR1102, TissueArray, Derwood, MD, USA) and normal organ tissue microarray (Cat# FDA662d, TissueArray) were stained with our engineered anti-LSR mAb following a published IHC staining protocol ( 47 TNBC positive control TCGA transcript analysis The LSR RNA data for breast cancers (TNBC, ER + + + https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/ Western blotting Lysates of TNBC cells were prepared using RIPA buffer and quantified using the Pierce protein assay kit. After separation on a NuPAGE 4-12% gradient SDS-PAGE gel, host cell proteins were transferred onto a PVDF membrane using a power supply (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA). The PVDF membrane was blocked in 5% non-fat milk in TBST buffer for 1 hour, stained with primary antibodies, i.e. our engineered LSR mAb (2 µg/mL) or anti-β-tubulin antibody (1:1000, Abcam), overnight at 4 °C, and washed three times with TBST. Following the washes, PVDF membrane was incubated with anti-human IgG-HRP (1:5000) or anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:3000) in 5% non-fat milk for 1 hour at room temperature. After color development, the washed PVDF membrane was imaged with Azure 300 imaging system (Azure Biosystems, Dublin, CA, USA). Hematoxylin and eosin staining Paraffin-embedded tumor and organ slides were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated using a graded ethanol series (100% → 50%) and distilled water, and stained with hematoxylin. After dipping in 1% HCl and 70% ethanol, slides were immersed in 1% NH 4 Statistical analysis Experimental data were analyzed and presented as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). Within-animal changes were evaluated using paired t-tests. Tumor growth and body weight were compared among groups using a two-way ANOVA followed by post-hoc P P Data and materials availability All data generated during this study are included in the main text of this article. Most materials used in the study, except the developed and engineered LSR mAb, are commercially available.

TNBC targeting and cross-species reactivity of LSR mAb To evaluate the surface binding of our engineered anti-LSR mAb to TNBC cells, we performed flow cytometry on human TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) and a murine TNBC cell line (4T1) (  Figure 3A Q86X29 Q99KG5  Figure 1A Figure 3 Evaluations of TNBC surface binding, internalization and specificity of anti-LSR mAb.

Discussion The absence of effective cell surface receptors in TNBCs has hindered the development of new targeted therapies. Recently, Trop-2 and CD276 ( 47 50 53 54 56 57 59 NCT06203210 NCT04145622 50 60 + + + The anti-LSR mAb developed in this study shows significant promise as a targeted delivery vehicle for potent payloads. The mAb demonstrated high surface binding to TNBC cells in vitro in vivo 61 62 The LSR-targeted ADC significantly inhibited TNBC tumor growth in two xenograft mouse models. However, while tumor growth was completely suppressed in syngeneic models, 15% residual tumor volume persisted in immunocompromised models. Several factors may contribute to this partial efficacy, including suboptimal dosing, reliance on a single payload (DM1), or relapse of surface receptor expression in some tumor cells. Recent studies suggest LSR suppresses CD8 + 63 To overcome these challenges and enhance TNBC treatment effectiveness, the following strategies could be implemented. First, the optimal dose and treatment schedule of LSR ADC can be identified from pharmacokinetics studies. Second, a dual-payload ADC platform, conjugating synergistic anti-cancer agents (e.g., cytotoxic and immune-enhancing payloads), could improve the anti-cancer efficacy. Dual targeting of receptors like CD276 and LSR may expand patient coverage and mitigate receptor relapse-driven resistance. Additionally, advanced cleavable linkers with high plasma stability and cancer-specific payload release could enhance drug delivery efficiency. Finally, combining LSR ADC with synergistic therapies, such as immunotherapy or gene therapy, could improve tumor clearance and reduce resistance risk. High LSR expression correlates with poor prognosis in gastric ( 49 64 65 66 67 63 68 Moving forward, we aim to develop dual-payload ADCs using our engineered LSR mAb, combining chemotherapy and immunotherapy for enhanced anti-TNBC efficacy, stability, and functionality. Dual-receptor targeting will be explored to broaden treatment coverage. The anti-LSR ADC will also be evaluated in clinically relevant models, such as patient-derived xenografts in humanized mice, non-human primates, or organ-on-chip systems, to generate preclinical data for future clinical trials.
