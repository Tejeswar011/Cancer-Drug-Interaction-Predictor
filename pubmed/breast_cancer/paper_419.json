Introduction This study aims to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in endometrial carcinoma (EC) through bioinformatics analysis and investigate their roles in early diagnosis and prognosis. Methods EC-related gene datasets were retrieved from the NCBI and analyzed using R packages to screen for DEGs. Primers were designed for selected DEGs, and their expression levels were validated via qPCR. Logistic regression, survival analysis, Cox proportional hazards models, and random forest models were employed to evaluate associations between DEGs and clinical outcomes. Results Bioinformatics analysis identified significantly upregulated genes ( Erb-B2 PIK3CA CCND1 VEGF KIT PTEN E-cadherin p53 Erb-B2 E-cadherin P53 P Erb-B2 p53 E-cadherin Conclusion The identified DEGs and clinical indicators hold significant potential for improving early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation in EC.

Total cellular RNA was extracted using an RNA extraction kit (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd., China) and reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) with a reverse transcription (RT) kit. Primers were designed for target genes identified through prior screening, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed using the synthesized cDNA as the template. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) served as the endogenous reference gene, while peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individuals undergoing routine physical examinations in our hospital were used as controls. Relative gene expression levels ≥ 2-fold compared to controls were defined as significant upregulation. Primer sequences are listed in Table 2 TABLE 2 Primer sequences.

Complete blood count parameters, including hemoglobin (Hb), white blood cell count (WBC), red blood cell count (RBC), and platelet count (PLT), were measured using an automated hematology analyzer. Serum levels of carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA199), and interleukin-9 (IL-9) were quantified via chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) following standardized protocols. 2.4 Statistical methods Data processing and analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 27.0 and R software version 4.4.3.

Each plot features color gradients indicating p-adjust values and varying circle sizes representing count. 3.2 LASSO regression for feature gene screening The 378 significant DEGs were subjected to LASSO regression to identify key predictive features. During variable selection, the penalty coefficient (λ) was systematically compressed across all 378 initial predictors. Optimal λ (λ = 0.013) was determined via cross-validation, minimizing the mean squared error while balancing model parsimony and goodness-of-fit. This process yielded a refined predictive model incorporating eight genes: Erb-B2 CCND1 PIK3CA VEGF KIT PTEN E-cadherin p53 Figure 4 FIGURE 4 Relationship between log(λ) values and model error.

Each variable is represented by a black square with lines indicating confidence intervals. The vertical line indicates HR of 1. The HR scale ranges from 0.5 to 1.5. 3.7 Construction of random forest model A random forest model was constructed using the screened clinical indicators and genetic markers. Feature importance analysis revealed that CA199 exhibited relatively prominent positive importance in the model, suggesting its potential role as a key variable in correlation analyses or predictive modeling. Random forest feature importance ranking: CA199 (0.035)>IL-9 (0.028)>CA125 (0.022)>Erb-B2 (0.018); The decision tree is based on clinically detectable indicators to construct a hierarchical rule ( Figure 7C E-cadherin p53 Erb-B2 FIGURE 7 Random Forest model outputs (A) (B) (C) (D) Composite image showing data visualizations: Panel A displays a variable importance plot with red and blue bars indicating FAL and TRL. Panel B shows a similar plot for two events. Panel C features a decision tree diagram with nodes and branches. Panel D contains scatter plots and correlation coefficients for variables like CA125, CA199, IL-9, ERBB2, E-cadherin, and P53. The decision tree diagram illustrated branching rules based on thresholds of CA125 and CA199 levels. Starting from the root node, data partitioning proceeded through sequential splits determined by these biomarkers, ultimately forming terminal leaf nodes for outcome classification. Interaction matrix analysis highlighted strong negative correlation (r = −0.473) between Erb-B2 Figure 7 4 Discussion EC, one of the most common malignancies in the female reproductive system, poses a significant threat to patient health. Beyond causing debilitating symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding, discharge, and pain that severely impair quality of life, EC progression often involves local invasion and distant metastasis, markedly increasing complications and mortality risks ( Gao et al., 2025 Cao et al., 2025 Through bioinformatics analysis, this study first screened significant DEGs, then selected feature genes via LASSO regression, and investigated their associations with the prognosis of EC patients. The results suggest a potential unique regulatory mechanism for Erb-B2 Erb-B2 Ye et al., 1996 Erb-B2 E-cadherin3 p53 E-cadherin3 Adzraku et al., 2023 p53 Bourdon, 2007 p53 Wang et al., 2023 Liu et al., 2024 p53 Kennedy and Lowe, 2022 p53 Chen et al., 2022 p53 p53 Zhao et al., 2021 Onoprienko et al., 2024 Kartikasari et al., 2021 Survival and random forest models constructed using the selected genes and clinical indicators demonstrated promising clinical utility. Survival curves showed significant differences in survival outcomes between EC patients with good and poor prognoses, providing an intuitive basis for initial clinical prognostic assessment. If there is a lack of K-M analysis to validate the effectiveness of grouping, the subsequent association analysis of the model for ‘prognostic grouping’ will lose its clinical basis. Therefore, K-M analysis is a key validation step that connects clinical grouping with statistical models. Clinically, CA19-9 could serve as a core indicator for prognostic evaluation in EC patients. Regular monitoring of its levels, combined with CA125 and IL-9, would enable dynamic assessment of disease progression and treatment response. Patients with abnormally elevated marker levels require close vigilance for poor prognosis risks and prompt treatment adjustments. Meanwhile, genetic testing for Erb-B2 p53 E-cadherin Erb-B2 p53 Erb-B2 E-cadherin From a clinical practice perspective, the results of the random forest model have clear translational value: (1) CA199, CA125, and IL-9 are all routine serum testing indicators in clinical practice, which can be carried out in primary hospitals For preoperative patients, these three indicators can be used to quickly screen high-risk populations, and more intensive postoperative follow-up is recommended as a priority. (2) For patients with high levels of CA199 and CA125, preoperative neoadjuvant therapy (such as chemotherapy combined with anti angiogenic drugs) can be considered to reduce tumor burden and postoperative recurrence; (3) Although the importance of Erb-B2 is relatively low, its inclusion in the model as a target for approved targeted drugs (such as trastuzumab) provides a basis for precise stratification and targeted therapy. For example, for patients with Erb-B2 positive and CA199 normal, postoperative combined anti-Erb-B2 treatment can further reduce the risk of recurrence and avoid overtreatment ( Wang et al., 2022 5 Conclusion In conclusion, this study successfully identified key DEGs through bioinformatics analysis and constructed a Cox proportional hazards model and a random forest model, providing important genetic targets and theoretical evidence for the early diagnosis and prognostic assessment of EC. These findings empower clinicians to predict prognosis more accurately and develop personalized treatment plans.
