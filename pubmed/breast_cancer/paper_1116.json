Although CD4+ T cell depletion is the main driver of HIV-1–induced immunodeficiency, the virus also exerts a significant and often underestimated impact by disrupting the function of STAT family members, thereby exacerbating immune imbalance and accelerating disease progression. Specifically, HIV-1 suppresses STAT1 activation, impairing the induction of antiviral genes; inhibits IL-23–driven STAT3 activation in CD4+ Th17 cells with a reduction in IL-17; alters STAT3-dependent functions in antigen-presenting cells; and imposes profound—and at times opposing—dysregulations of STAT5, including the induction of a truncated isoform that contributes to latency. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of the JAK/STAT axis, particularly with JAK2 inhibitors, has been shown to reduce integrated proviral DNA and viral replication in vitro and in early clinical studies. This review provides an updated overview of the roles of individual STAT proteins in HIV-1 infection and pathogenesis, emphasizing the intricate interplay between viral factors and host signaling, highlighting the potential therapeutic implications, and suggesting that immunological assessment in HIV-1 patients should extend beyond CD4+ T cell counts and the CD4/CD8 ratio to include functional analysis of STAT signaling for deeper insights into immune dysfunction and chronic inflammation.

Introduction Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) are a family of cytoplasmic transcription factors that play a pivotal role in transmitting signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus in response to cytokines and growth factors. Upon phosphorylation by Janus kinases (JAKs), STAT proteins dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, and regulate genes involved in immunity, inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis [ 1 1 Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1), the etiological agent of AIDS, primarily targets CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells, leading to progressive immune dysfunction and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and malignancies [ 2 3 2 3 4 Among the host signaling cascades affected by HIV-1, the JAK/STAT pathway has emerged as a critical axis. HIV-1 inhibits interferon (IFN)–mediated antiviral responses by degrading components of the JAK/STAT cascade [ 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Despite accumulating evidence, the precise roles of individual STAT proteins and their upstream JAK kinases in HIV-1 infection remain incompletely understood. Many experimental findings are challenging to interpret and, at times, yield apparently contradictory results. Nevertheless, HIV-1 plays a central and often underappreciated role in driving substantial immune suppression through the dysregulation of STAT family members. This dysregulation occurs alongside CD4+ T cell depletion and contributes to exacerbated chronic inflammation, a key factor in immunoaging among people living with HIV-1. Importantly, these STAT-related alterations frequently persist in patients on ART, even after CD4+ T cell recovery. Given these gaps in understanding, this review provides an updated overview of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in HIV-1 infection, with a particular focus on individual STAT family members. Drawing on recent advances and integrating insights from our previous work on the STAT system [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 2. The JAK/STAT Pathway The Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway is a central signaling cascade that mediates cellular responses to a wide variety of extracellular cues, including cytokines, interferons, hormones, and growth factors [ 19 20 21 12 13 14 15 22 23 24 Signal initiation occurs when a ligand binds to its cognate receptor, inducing receptor dimerization and activation of receptor-associated JAKs. Upon activation, JAKs phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors, creating docking sites for the SH2 domains of STAT proteins. Upon recruitment, STATs are themselves phosphorylated by JAKs, leading to dimerization via reciprocal SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions. The resulting dimers translocate to the nucleus, where they bind specific DNA elements to regulate gene expression programs involved in cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and immune function [ 1 12 13 14 15 22 23 24 25 Each STAT protein plays both unique and overlapping roles in immune homeostasis and host defense. STAT1 is activated by type I, II, and III IFNs and is pivotal in antiviral immunity, inducing hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) [ 12 26 27 12 27 13 28 29 14 30 31 15 32 The STAT pathway is tightly regulated by a range of negative feedback mechanisms, including suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), protein inhibitors of activated STATs (PIAS), and ubiquitin-specific proteases such as USP18. These mechanisms ensure a balance between immune activation and resolution, thus maintaining immune equilibrium and preventing pathological inflammation or autoimmunity [ 23 26 33 Beyond its immunological relevance, aberrations in JAK/STAT signaling have been linked to numerous diseases, including autoimmune syndromes, hematological malignancies, solid tumors, and chronic viral infections [ 12 13 14 15 3. HIV-1 and Host STAT Pathways Since its emergence in the early 1980s, HIV/AIDS has posed one of the most complex and devastating global health challenges. HIV-1 primarily targets CD4+ T lymphocytes, leading to a gradual collapse of cell-mediated immunity and increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections and neoplasms [ 34 35 3 36 37 HIV-1 is an RNA retrovirus capable of synthesizing double-stranded linear viral DNA (vDNA) from its RNA genome via reverse transcription, catalyzed by the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase (RT) [ 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 HIV-1 infection dynamically rewires host cytokine signaling, alters T cell subset distributions, and dysregulates transcriptional programs that maintain immune homeostasis. These effects highlight the central role of host pathways such as JAK/STAT, which may exert both protective and pathogenic functions during infection [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 Recent studies reveal a multifaceted involvement of the STAT pathway in HIV-1 infection. Intact JAK/STAT signaling—particularly via STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5—is essential for initiating antiviral responses and maintaining lymphocyte function. Conversely, the virus can exploit or inhibit STAT family members to escape immune surveillance, sustain inflammation, and preserve viral reservoirs ( Figure 1 46 47 48 Given the role of STAT signaling in HIV-1 infection, pharmacological modulation of this pathway has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy. JAK/STAT inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, are under investigation as adjunctive treatments in HIV-1 infection [ 49 50 51 52 4. The Impact of HIV-1 on STAT1 Signaling and Pathway Dysregulation STAT1 is a central mediator of IFN signaling and plays a critical role in antiviral immunity [ 12 Table 1 12 53 54 55 4.1. HIV-1–Mediated Modulation of STAT1: Context-Dependent Mechanisms Divergent findings have been reported in different studies conducted by various authors regarding the effects of HIV-1 on STAT1. Federico et al. showed that HIV-1 Nef protein selectively stimulates both the α and β isoforms of STAT1. This effect was demonstrated using two complementary approaches: infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages with HIV-1 mutants lacking specific genes and exposure of monocyte-derived macrophages to exogenous recombinant Nef protein (rNef), which these cells are capable of internalizing. The Nef-driven activation of STAT1 is subsequently associated with elevated levels of STAT1 itself and of IRF-1, a downstream transcription factor whose expression is under the control of STAT1 signaling [ 56 Similar results were obtained by Kohler et al., who examined the interaction between HIV-1 and CD4+ cells by analyzing phosphorylated STAT proteins in nuclear extracts from lymphoid and monocytic cell lines, as well as primary monocyte-derived macrophages. Their findings revealed a marked increase—ranging from six- to tenfold—in activated STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 in HUT78 and U937 cells within two hours of exposure to HIV-1 virions. Notably, STAT activation was triggered by various viral envelope proteins and occurred regardless of viral coreceptor usage or replication capacity, whereas envelope-deficient particles failed to induce any STAT activation [ 57 In contrast to the findings reported by Federico and Kohler, Nguyen et al. observed that HIV-1 impairs STAT1 activation in T lymphoblastic cells transfected with HIV plasmids, resulting in diminished ISG expression and compromised antiviral defense [ 58 Figure 2 59 Figure 2 Figure 2 59 The apparently contradictory findings regarding HIV-1’s effects on STAT1 may be reconciled by considering the context, timing, and cellular environment of these effects. HIV-1 exerts cell-type- and context-dependent modulation of STAT1. Early after exposure, HIV-1 envelope proteins and accessory proteins can induce transient STAT1 activation in monocytes/macrophages, leading to phosphorylation at Tyr701 and Ser727 and upregulation of inflammatory genes. In contrast, during or after productive infection, HIV-1 proteins (notably Vpu, Nef, and Vif) actively inhibit canonical type I IFN signaling by blocking IFN-α-induced STAT1 phosphorylation and promoting proteasomal degradation of STAT1. This results in type I IFN refractoriness, a state where exogenous IFN-α fails to induce STAT1 phosphorylation and ISG expression, thereby blunting the antiviral response. Thus, HIV-1 may initially activate STAT1 through non-IFN pathways to promote inflammation and transient antiviral activity but may later suppress IFN-driven STAT1 activation to evade the host antiviral response. Consistent with this hypothesis, Federico et al. reported that while Nef initially triggers STAT1 activation, this activation progressively declines over time in both Nef-treated and HIV-1–infected cells, despite Nef levels remaining stable in infected cells. Although direct in vivo confirmation of this temporal sequence is limited, and few studies have systematically investigated this dynamic, the proposed model offers a plausible framework to reconcile the divergent findings reported across different experimental contexts [ 56 57 58 59 Despite sustained expression of antiviral type I interferons (IFNs), HIV-1 infection persists in humans, and even exogenous IFN-α has only a modest effect on viral load, suggesting that people living with HIV-1 may develop refractoriness to type I IFN. Sugawara et al. provided evidence for this phenomenon by showing that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from both untreated and virologically suppressed HIV-1-infected patients display impaired STAT1 phosphorylation and diminished induction of ISGs following IFN stimulation, compared to healthy controls. These refractory responses were associated with markedly elevated levels of USP18 in the same T cell subsets, a finding further validated in an independent cohort of HIV–HCV co-infected individuals receiving pegylated IFN-α2b [ 60 Beyond viral interference, host factors can also downregulate STAT1 activation. Rivera et al. reported that cystatin B, a cysteine protease inhibitor, impairs STAT1 signaling and IFN-β-mediated antiviral responses, thereby promoting HIV-1 persistence in macrophage reservoirs [ 61 61 4.2. Atypical Activation of ISG and STAT1 by HIV-1 Tat Protein HIV-1 Tat can upregulate STAT1 expression independently of IFNs, representing an atypical mechanism that modulates immune signaling, primes cells for immune responses without inducing a full antiviral state, and subtly alters antigen presentation and T cell activation. Kukkonen et al. [ 62 62 MAP2K6 MAP2K3 IRF7 can activate ISGs independently of the IFN-JAK-STAT pathway. IRF7 is a master transcription factor in the innate immune response, particularly in the induction of type I IFNs and a subset of ISGs. Upon activation by pathogen recognition receptor (PRR) signaling—such as through TLR7/9 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells or RIG-I/MDA5 in other cell types—IRF7 is phosphorylated, dimerizes, translocates to the nucleus, and binds to ISREs in the promoters of ISGs, directly driving their transcription [ 62 Tat’s ability to activate ISGs independently of IFNs highlights a strategy by which HIV-1 hijacks components of the host antiviral defense while attenuating their full efficacy. The Tat protein is composed of two exons: exon 1 is essential for viral transactivation and interaction with host factors, whereas exon 2 is dispensable for transactivation. Interestingly, truncated Tat variants lacking exon 2 elicit stronger ISG expression than the full-length protein, suggesting that exon 2 functions as a regulatory domain that restrains Tat-induced immune activation. This implies that HIV-1 fine-tunes ISG expression through Tat to avoid initiating a robust antiviral state typically triggered by IFNs. Such modulation may enable the virus to induce a partial immune response, strong enough to mimic cellular activation, yet insufficient to promote effective viral clearance. In this context, the immunomodulatory role of exon 2 may be critical in shaping a host environment conducive to viral persistence or latency, particularly within APCs ( Figure 3 62 A comparative analysis of the studies by Nguyen et al. [ 58 62 Elucidating these diverse mechanisms opens new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Strategies could include targeting Vpu and Nef to restore JAK/STAT pathway responsiveness, inhibiting cystatin B to reinstate effective STAT1 activation, or blocking Tat-mediated modulation to re-establish a robust interferon-induced antiviral state. Such approaches hold the potential to enhance the efficacy of type I IFNs, counteract HIV-mediated immune evasion, and ultimately limit viral replication and reservoir persistence. 5. HIV-1 and STAT3: Molecular Interactions and Pathophysiological Implications STAT3 is a critical transcription factor involved in regulating immune responses, cell proliferation, and survival [ 63 64 13 63 9 65 66 5.1. HIV-1 gp120-Mediated Activation of the STAT3/IL-6 Axis in Dendritic Cells Dendritic cells are central to both the initiation of antiviral immunity and the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection. Their ability to sense, capture, and present antigens makes them indispensable for immune surveillance. STAT3 activation in dendritic cells suppresses their immunostimulatory function and promotes immune tolerance [ 9 9 67 HIV-1 gp120 plays a pivotal role in modulating dendritic cell function through the activation of the STAT3/interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling axis in primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells [ 9 Figure 4 9 Remarkably, gp120 also induces an early, IL-6-independent phosphorylation of STAT3, which precedes IL-6 production and serves to amplify it [ 9 9 Persistent STAT3 activation in dendritic cells has profound immunological consequences, as it interferes with their maturation, antigen-presenting capacity, and ability to activate naive T cells [ 9 67 9 5.2. Role of STAT3 in Th17 and Treg Differentiation in HIV-1 Infection Th17 and Treg cells are critical targets of HIV-1, and their respective depletion (Th17) and dysfunction (Tregs) significantly contribute to disease progression toward AIDS [ 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 Th17 cells are essential for mucosal immunity and play a protective role against opportunistic infections [ 35 72 73 74 Treg cells, by contrast, are immunosuppressive CD4+ T cells that follow a different trajectory during infection. In people with well-controlled HIV-1 under antiretroviral therapy, Tregs have been shown to contain a higher proportion of inducible, genetically intact proviruses compared to other CD4+ subsets [ 75 Notably, Th17 and Treg cells exhibit functional plasticity. Under specific cytokine conditions, they can transdifferentiate into one another. In murine models, for example, IL-6 can convert Tregs into Th17 cells in the absence of TGF-β [ 76 77 78 79 STAT3 is a central regulator of both Th17 and Treg differentiation, and its dysregulation in HIV-1 infection plays a key role in the imbalance of these subsets [ 35 80 RORC retinoic acid-related orphan receptor C) 81 RORC 81 Il17a Il17f Il23r Csf2 RORC Il-17A/F 81 In the absence of strong STAT3 signaling, Foxp3 (which promotes Treg development) is upregulated and can directly inhibit RORγt function. STAT3 suppresses Foxp3 and thus indirectly protects RORγt from inhibition, reinforcing the Th17 lineage over Treg fate. This makes the RORC 80 81 82 83 In the context of HIV-1 infection, Th17 cells are preferentially lost, while Treg frequencies are often elevated. This imbalance contributes to mucosal barrier disruption and chronic immune activation [ 35 84 85 86 Figure 4 87 RORC RORC 87 Altogether, the disruption of STAT3 signaling by HIV-1—through interference with cytokine responses and altered dendritic cell activity—represents a key mechanism underlying the immune dysregulation seen in infected individuals. 5.3. Insertional Mutagenesis and Oncogenesis HIV-1 DNA integration at the STAT3 locus in primary human CD4+ T cells directly drives T cell persistence and models the molecular pathogenesis of HIV-associated T cell lymphoma. Using an in vitro infection system, Rist et al. identified that HIV-1 proviral integration within intron 1 of the STAT3 gene leads to upregulation of STAT3 expression and activation of its downstream transcriptional program. This integration event results in a persistent population of HIV-infected T cells with a STAT3-driven gene signature characterized by enhanced anti-apoptotic phenotypes, closely resembling those observed in HIV-associated T cell lymphomas [ 88 BCL2 41 5.4. Effects of STAT3 Inhibition in HIV-1 Infected PBMCs Ibba et al. investigated the role of STAT3 in HIV-1 infection by exposing PBMCs isolated from 20 healthy donors to HIV-1 in the presence or absence of a specific STAT3 inhibitor (Stattic ® 66 Gene expression analysis revealed that STAT3 inhibition significantly upregulated several immune-related genes known to exert anti-HIV-1 effects, including CCL3 IL-1β IFN-α 89 90 These findings support the potential of STAT3 inhibitors as novel therapeutic agents against HIV-1 infection. However, caution is warranted, as STAT3 also plays roles in immune homeostasis and mucosal protection. Therapeutic inhibition of STAT3 must therefore balance antiviral effects with potential risks of exacerbating immune dysfunction. 5.5. Conclusive Considerations on the Role of STAT3 in HIV-1 Infection In summary, HIV-1 modulates STAT3 through a combination of direct viral protein interactions, cytokine-mediated signaling, insertional mutagenesis, and manipulation of post-translational modifications. These mechanisms collectively contribute to immune dysregulation, viral persistence, and increased risk of malignancy in HIV-1-infected individuals. These findings highlight the multifaceted and cell–type–specific role of STAT3 signaling in the context of HIV-1 infection. In dendritic cells, HIV-1 gp120 enhances STAT3 activation via the IL-6 axis, potentially promoting an environment favorable to viral persistence. Conversely, in Th17 cells, HIV-1 impairs IL-23-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, leading to impaired cell survival and function. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 in PBMCs resulted in reduced HIV-1 replication and enhanced expression of several antiviral genes, despite downregulation of IL-6. These apparently contrasting effects underscore the context-dependent nature of STAT3 activity and suggest that its role in HIV-1 pathogenesis varies across different immune cell subsets. Therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting STAT3 must carefully consider these divergent effects to avoid unintended immune suppression or enhancement of viral persistence. 6. Indirect Evidence for STAT4 in HIV-1 Pathogenesis STAT4 is a key transcription factor orchestrating antiviral immunity [ 91 92 14 30 91 92 92 While research has largely focused on STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 [ 93 94 95 14 A functional impairment of STAT4 can alter the Th1/Th2 balance, favoring a shift toward a Th2 profile. This skewing—frequently observed in HIV-1 infection [ 35 14 30 96 IFN-γ plays a multifaceted and context-dependent role in HIV-1 pathogenesis. Initially produced to facilitate the clearance of primary infection, IFN-γ contributes to the establishment of chronic immune activation. Unlike type I interferons, IFN-γ exhibits minimal direct antiviral activity against HIV-1 in primary cell cultures. Nevertheless, it enhances cytotoxic T lymphocyte and natural killer cell functions against HIV-1–infected cells, thereby supporting the control of viral replication. Conversely, in certain settings—particularly within mononuclear phagocytes—IFN-γ may paradoxically promote viral replication. This pro-viral effect is thought to result from its ability to sustain immune activation and induce inflammatory cytokines, thereby generating a more permissive environment for HIV-1 replication [ 97 At the molecular level, HIV-1 interferes with the regulation of SOCS proteins, particularly SOCS1 and SOCS3, which normally restrain JAK/STAT activity and prevent excessive immune activation [ 98 99 Genetic polymorphisms in STAT4 add another layer of complexity. The rs7574865 variant, for example, is associated with increased STAT4 expression and IFN-γ production and has been linked to autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and autoimmune thyroiditis [ 100 101 102 103 Beyond Th1 responses, STAT4 also influences CD4+ effector T-cell migration and contributes to the pathogenic potential of Th17 cells [ 104 7. Dysregulation of STAT5 Signaling in HIV-1 Infection: Implications for Immune Dysfunction and Viral Persistence STAT5 is a transcription factor composed of two paralogs, STAT5A and STAT5B, which are primarily activated through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in response to interleukins (e.g., IL-2, IL-3, IL-5, IL-7, IL-15, IL-21), erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, growth hormone, and prolactin [ 1 15 19 20 21 22 23 15 15 22 29 32 15 19 20 21 15 16 17 18 Table 2 7.1. Dual Roles of STAT5 Dysregulation in HIV-1 Infection: From Altered Cytokine Responsiveness to Viral Replication, and Clonal Expansion A useful framework for understanding the complex impact of HIV-1 on STAT5 signaling is to distinguish between studies assessing the activation state of the pathway and those evaluating pathway responsiveness. Activation state studies consistently report increased levels of phosphorylated STAT5 following in vitro exposure of CD4+ T-cell and monocytic cell lines to HIV-1 [ 57 94 105 106 Despite extensive evidence of cell signaling alterations induced by HIV-1 in vitro, the relevance of these changes to the clinical and/or immunologic status of HIV-1-infected individuals is often unclear. Lee et al. determined the JAK/STAT signaling changes at the single-cell level within distinct cell subsets from the primary immune cells of HIV-1-infected donors. They identified a specific defect in GM-CSF-driven STAT5 phosphorylation in the monocytes of HIV-1 donors despite normal GM-CSF receptor levels. In addition, they observed an enhancement of MAPK signaling associated with HIV-1 infection. This altered monocyte signaling response contributes to defective antigen presentation during HIV-1 infection [ 95 Beyond immune signaling, STAT5 is also implicated in HIV-1 replication dynamics. Upon activation by γc cytokines such as IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15, STAT5 translocates to the nucleus, where it binds consensus sequences within the HIV-1 LTR, enhancing viral transcription. In primary CD4+ T cells, STAT5 overexpression increases both the frequency of HIV-1 p24+ cells and overall viral protein production, indicating that STAT5 activation promotes a permissive environment for viral replication [ 107 Interestingly, the constitutively active truncated isoform STAT5Δ—prevalent in individuals with progressive HIV-1 infection—functions in an opposing manner. The STAT5Δ isoform arises through specific proteolytic activity that removes the C-terminal portion of STAT5, resulting in a constitutively active protein, particularly in myeloid cells and monocytes of HIV-positive patients. The main consequence of STAT5Δ expression in HIV infection is the negative regulation of HIV-1 transcription [ 94 108 109 Adding further complexity to this regulatory landscape, HIV-1 infection disrupts IL-7 signaling by impairing the nuclear translocation of phosphorylated STAT5. Landier et al. investigated IL-7 signaling in CD4+ T cells from viremic patients and healthy blood donors, using intracellular flow cytometry to monitor phosphorylation of STAT5 at the regulatory serine residue S726 and the critical tyrosine residue Y694. Their analysis revealed that progressive HIV infection leads to hyperphosphorylation of both S726 and Y694 in naive CD4+ T cells. However, quantitative image analysis demonstrated a defect in the nuclear relocalization of both phospho-STAT5 forms, which correlated with elevated HLA-DR expression. These findings suggest that chronic immune activation contributes to the disruption of IL-7 signal transduction [ 110 STAT5 dysregulation in HIV-1-infected cells is also implicated in the clonal expansion of infected cells. In hematopoietic cells, HIV-1 preferentially integrates within the transcription unit of expressed genes and may induce aberrant RNA splicing mechanisms leading to the formation of chimeric transcripts harboring HIV sequences fused to cellular exon sequences. Moreover, HIV-1 and lentiviruses with active LTRs can effectively integrate and activate cancer-related genes, such as through promoter insertion, and thus induce uncontrolled clonal expansion. Cesana et al. identified HIV-1-mediated insertional activation of STAT5B BACH2 111 Follow-up studies using CRISPR/Cas9 modeling further demonstrated that HIV-1 LTR-driven expression of BACH2 112 BACH2 113 114 7.2. The STAT5–CCR5 Axis: Mechanistic Insights and Implications for HIV-1 Cure Approaches Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has demonstrated the potential to cure HIV-1 infection, though such cases remain exceptionally rare. The most prominent examples include Timothy Ray Brown, the “Berlin Patient,” and the “London Patient,” both of whom received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants from donors carrying the homozygous CCR5-Δ32 mutation, a naturally occurring 32-base pair deletion in the CCR5 gene that renders the CCR5 receptor nonfunctional and confers resistance to HIV-1 infection [ 115 116 CCR5 is a G protein-coupled receptor predominantly expressed on immune cells, including CD4+ T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and microglia. It plays a critical role in immune surveillance by mediating leukocyte chemotaxis toward sites of inflammation in response to ligands such as CCL3 (MIP-1α), CCL4 (MIP-1β), and CCL5 (RANTES). Beyond its function in HIV-1 entry, CCR5 is implicated in a wide range of pathological conditions, including cancer and chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and atherosclerosis, further highlighting its value as a therapeutic target [ 117 118 119 120 In HIV-1 infection, CCR5 serves as a major co-receptor facilitating viral entry into CD4+ T cells. After initial binding to the CD4 molecule, HIV-1 engages CCR5 to promote membrane fusion and viral entry. Individuals homozygous for the CCR5-Δ32 allele lack functional surface expression of CCR5 and are highly resistant to HIV-1 acquisition [ 121 The expression of CCR5 is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level. The transcription factor CREB-1 (cAMP response element-binding protein 1) activates CCR5 122 123 CCR5 Recent evidence has revealed that the JAK/STAT signaling pathway plays a central role in regulating CCR5 expression. JAK inhibitors such as tofacitinib and ruxolitinib have been shown to reduce CCR5 surface levels on CD4+ T cells in vitro, leading to decreased HIV-1 production and reduced levels of integrated proviral DNA. This effect is likely mediated through inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation. Importantly, elevated STAT5 activity is associated with higher levels of HIV-1 integration in infected individuals, suggesting that its inhibition could alter the cellular environment necessary for HIV-1 persistence [ 50 The role of STAT signaling is particularly relevant in the context of interleukin-15 (IL-15), a γ-chain cytokine that promotes survival and proliferation of memory CD4+ T cells and NK cells, two key components of the latent HIV-1 reservoir and antiviral immune response, respectively [ 35 124 IL-15 exerts its effects through a receptor complex composed of IL-15Rα, IL-2/IL-15Rβ (CD122), and the common γ-chain (CD132), which together activate the JAK/STAT pathway—particularly STAT5—promoting both immune activation and HIV-1 reactivation. JAK inhibitors suppress this IL-15-mediated STAT activation, thereby blocking reactivation of latent HIV-1 and reducing the potential for reservoir replenishment [ 125 Further insights into the role of JAK/STAT signaling in regulating CCR5 have come from the work of Wang et al., who demonstrated that JAK/STAT inhibitors—including tofacitinib, ruxolitinib, baricitinib, IQDMA, FLLL32, and WP1066—consistently reduced CCR5 and CCR2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in primary human CD4+ T cells [ 126 126 127 128 129 Taken together, these findings strongly support a central role for the JAK/STAT signaling pathway—especially STAT5—in modulating CCR5 expression and shaping the cellular environment conducive to HIV-1 persistence. This regulatory axis provides a compelling therapeutic target for limiting viral entry, reactivation from latency, and long-term reservoir maintenance. 7.3. STAT5 at the Crossroads of HIV-1 Latency and Persistence Despite the effectiveness of ART in suppressing viral replication, a small subset of cells harboring integrated, replication-competent HIV-1 DNA remains, constituting a major barrier to cure [ 35 35 50 50 130 131 STAT5 exerts a context-dependent influence on HIV-1 biology. On one hand, STAT5 activation generally promotes viral replication, as discussed in Section 7.1 Figure 5 94 108 109 The dual role of STAT5—facilitating viral replication while promoting reservoir expansion—is exemplified by the study of De Armas et al., who demonstrated that the JAK1/2 inhibitors ruxolitinib and baricitinib significantly curtailed both latent and productive infection when administered 24 h post-infection in tonsillar CD4+ T cells. Their findings further underscored the STAT pathway as a key regulator of reservoir stability and reactivation potential. Notably, they reported a dose-dependent reduction in T cell activation markers: CD25 expression declined by more than 80% at the highest drug concentrations, while HLA-DR and CD69 were reduced by approximately 60% and 50%, respectively [ 130 In line with these findings, Janssens et al. showed that small-molecule JAK/STAT inhibitors suppress HIV-1 reactivation ex vivo. Screening of 26 compounds in PBMCs from ART-suppressed individuals revealed that JAK/STAT inhibitors interfere with transcriptional initiation and elongation, thereby reducing viral RNA production upon T cell activation. Several agents demonstrated broad inhibitory effects across multiple transcriptional checkpoints, reinforcing the view that STAT signaling is integral to both maintenance and reversal of latency [ 132 Beyond latency maintenance, the STAT system also mediates the effects of latency-reversing agents (LRAs). Systems biology approaches have identified JAK/STAT signaling as a key node in the transcriptional network driving HIV-1 reactivation, acting in concert with NF-κB, JNK, and ERK pathways. STAT activation is particularly important in the immediate early phase of latency reversal, positioning it as a potential dual-use target—capable of limiting reservoir persistence while modulating the efficacy of “shock and kill” strategies [ 131 In summary, the role of STAT5 in HIV-1 latency is inherently dual and, at times, contradictory. While STAT5 activation can promote viral transcription in response to immune stimuli—a property exploitable in latency reversal—its survival and proliferative signals also support the persistence of memory CD4+ T cells, the main reservoir of latent HIV-1. This paradox underscores the need for therapeutic balance: strategies that harness STAT5 for latency reversal must avoid inadvertently promoting reservoir stability. 8. STAT6 as a Host Factor Manipulated by KSHV: Implications for Kaposi’s Sarcoma in HIV-1 Infection STAT6 is a transcription factor primarily activated by IL-4 and IL-13, playing a central role in Th2 cell differentiation, B cell activation, alternative (M2) macrophage polarization, and humoral immunity [ 14 133 134 Beyond classical cytokine signaling, STAT6 is also activated in response to viral nucleic acids via the STING-TBK1 pathway, independent of JAKs. This non-canonical activation leads to STAT6 phosphorylation, dimerization, and nuclear translocation, inducing genes involved in immune cell homing and antiviral defense. However, viruses can subvert this pathway by interfering with STAT6 post-translational modifications, nuclear translocation, or promoting its degradation, thereby evading innate immune responses, although this has not been specifically delineated in HIV-1 pathogenesis in vivo [ 135 136 137 138 139 In summary, Tat-mediated lytic activation increases the risk and severity of Kaposi’s sarcoma, whereas LANA/STAT6–mediated latency promotes the survival of infected cells and viral persistence. The interplay between these two mechanisms drives clinical progression: predominance of the lytic phase leads to rapid Kaposi’s sarcoma development and greater immune compromise, while latency favors viral persistence and therapeutic resistance, contributing to disease recurrence and chronicity. This highlights STAT6 as a key host factor subverted by KSHV to regulate the balance between latency and lytic replication, with implications for viral persistence and pathogenesis of KS in HIV infected individuals. 9. Conclusions The STAT family of transcription factors plays a central role in orchestrating host immune responses, particularly during viral infections. Among the seven mammalian STAT proteins, STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 are most prominently affected by HIV-1, and their dysregulation drives immune dysfunction, viral persistence, and latency. HIV-1–mediated alterations in STAT signaling contribute to chronic, yet ineffective, immune activation. Persistent STAT3 activation in dendritic cells, combined with STAT5 downregulation in CD8+ T cells and macrophages, further impairs immune function, while STAT5 activation in CD4+ T cells enhances viral replication. Notably, HIV-1 inhibits IL-23–driven STAT3 activation in Th17 cells, reducing IL-17 production, compromising intestinal mucosal barrier integrity, and promoting microbial translocation that fuels chronic immune activation. These changes also disturb the Th17/Treg balance and increase susceptibility to opportunistic infections. STAT5 additionally supports viral latency, particularly through the truncated STAT5Δ isoform. Together, these findings highlight how HIV-1 exerts divergent, context-dependent effects on the STAT pathway to evade immunity and maintain persistent infection. This complexity presents both challenges and opportunities for therapeutic intervention. While JAK/STAT inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, show potential as adjunctive treatments, clinical evidence of their efficacy in improving HIV-1 outcomes remains limited, and their broad immunomodulatory effects may carry unintended risks [ 140 141 In conclusion, HIV-1 manipulation of the STAT signaling network exemplifies a sophisticated viral strategy to subvert host immunity. Therapeutic targeting of this pathway offers a promising avenue, but a deeper understanding of isoform-specific roles and cell-type–specific dynamics will be essential to safely and effectively harness JAK/STAT modulation in HIV-1 infection and cure strategies.

HIV-1 accessory proteins Vpu and Nef inhibit STAT1 activation or promote its proteasomal degradation, thereby preventing STAT1-mediated induction of genes encoding key antiviral proteins. In addition, the viral protein Tat triggers an atypical and inefficient activation of STAT1, which sustains chronic immune activation without effectively contributing to HIV-1 clearance. The state of immunodeficiency is further exacerbated by persistent STAT3 activation in dendritic cells, which interferes with antigen presentation and T-cell priming, together with an impaired IL-23–induced STAT3 activation in Th17 cells, leading to reduced IL-17 production. The modulation of STAT5 by HIV-1 is even more complex. On one hand, infected cells produce a truncated STAT5 isoform (STAT5Δ) that suppresses HIV-1 transcription and promotes viral latency. On the other hand, STAT5 enhances proviral transcription in CD4+ T cells, thereby increasing virion production and viral spread. Conversely, in CD8+ T cells and macrophages, HIV-1 induces a downregulation of STAT5, which further compromises the immune system and promotes a state of chronic but ineffective immune activation that fails to eliminate the virus. HIV-1 appears to exert only indirect and potentially uncertain effects on STAT4 and STAT6, which is why they have been omitted from this schematic representation. STAT2 can dimerize with STAT1 to form the ISGF3 complex. No specific or relevant data regarding STAT2 and HIV-1 are reported in the literature. Figure 2 HIV-1 protein Vpu and Nef interfere with the kinase activity of JAK-STAT1, inhibiting the phosphorylation/activation of STAT1. In addition, Vif interacts with STAT1, promoting its ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. These effects avoid antiviral protection induced by IFN-α. Figure 3 HIV-1 Tat directly regulates the expression of ISGs in antigen-presenting cells by interacting with specific gene promoters and transcription factors, bypassing the canonical IFN-induced JAK-STAT pathway. Tat exon 2 functions as a regulatory domain that restrains Tat-induced ISGs activation. This implies that HIV-1 fine-tunes ISG expression through Tat to avoid initiating a robust antiviral state typically triggered by IFNs.
