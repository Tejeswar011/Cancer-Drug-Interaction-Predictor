Moreover, the characteristics of the acoustic flow field under linear, quasi-circular, elliptical, and higher-order vibration modes were intensively studied, and the rotational manipulation performance of polystyrene microbeads and cancer cells was optimized by adjusting the frequency and voltage. The results showed that the rotational speed and direction of the particles varied significantly in different vibration modes, with the particles and cells achieving the highest rotational speed in the elliptical vibration mode (frequency: 44.9 kHz, and voltage: 60 Vpp). In addition, the technique successfully achieved in-plane and out-of-plane rotation of cancer cells, and cell viability tests showed that 94% of the cells remained active after manipulation, demonstrating the low damage and biocompatibility of the method.

Introduction Cell rotation has broad implications in modern biomedical research and applications, covering a wide range of fields from basic research to clinical applications. By precisely controlling the rotation of cells, researchers can better understand the structure and function of cells, develop new diagnostic and therapeutic methods, and advance tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Cell rotation can achieve multi-angle cell imaging [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 The methods of cell rotation can be divided into contact manipulation and field manipulation. Contact manipulation includes mechanical contact and optical tweezers manipulation (OTs) [ 20 21 22 4 9 10 9 10 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 Field manipulations include electric field manipulations, magnetic field manipulations, acoustic field manipulations, and hydrodynamic field manipulations [ 20 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 Therefore, in order to overcome the shortcomings of the aforementioned manipulation methods, this study proposes an acoustic microcolumn array (AMPA) chip based on BAW control. The device uses piezoelectric transducers (PZT) to generate BAW, which have a simple structure and are low-cost. Furthermore, in our experiment, the control frequency of BAW (kHz) is much lower than that of SAW (MHz), causing less damage to cells. It utilizes the vibration of micropillars induced by BAW to generate an acoustic flow field, and precisely rotates and manipulates cells in multiple dimensions with the force of the acoustic flow field. The vibration mode of the sound waves has a significant impact on the flow characteristics of the acoustic flow field. We focus on the characteristics of the acoustic flow field in linear, quasi-circular, and elliptical vibration modes. In different vibration modes, the motion state of polystyrene particles in the acoustic flow field was observed by adjusting the frequency and voltage, the rotational maneuverability of the micro-particles in the acoustic flow field was evaluated, and the above research results were used for the study of cell manipulation. Finally, we investigated the impact of this manipulation method on cell viability. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. AMPA Chip Composition and Manipulation Working Principle As shown in Figure 1 In practice, the signal source causes the piezoelectric transducer to vibrate by giving it a signal of a certain frequency and voltage, which is then transmitted through a thin glass plate to the microcolumn in the microchannel, causing it to vibrate and generate an acoustic flow. The x and y direction velocity components of the vibration of the microcolumn can be expressed as follows [ 56 (1a) V x = ω d x e i ω t (1b) V y = − i ω d y e i ω t In the formula, V x V y ω d x d y Section 3 2.2. Sample Preparation A suspension of monodisperse polystyrene microspheres with a diameter of 5 µm (5 mL, 1 wt%, Shanghai Yiyuan Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) was added to Tween 20 at a concentration of 0.3% v v Human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were purchased from the National Experimental Cell Resource Sharing Platform. The cancer cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 1% penicillin–streptomycin (PS) (Solarbio, Beijing, China), and 1% glutamine, in a 5% C O 2 4 The cell activity of the collected cancer cells was detected using a double staining technique-fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI). FDA can freely enter living cells and be broken down by intracellular lipase to produce polar fluorescein, which emits green fluorescence in living cells. PI can only pass through the damaged cell membranes of dead cells, staining the DNA and emitting red fluorescence. Staining working solution preparation: (1) FDA stock: Add 4.16 mg of FDA powder to 100 µL of DMSO, shake or gently shake until completely dissolved to obtain an FDA stock of 1 mmol/L concentration; (2) PI stock: Add 1 mg of PI powder to 1 mL of DMSO, shake or gently shake until completely dissolved to obtain a PI stock with a concentration of 1.5 mmol/L; (3) Working solution preparation: Take 2 µL of the FDA stock and 4 µL of the PI stock and add them to 1 mL of PBS, gently shake until well combined. At this point, the concentration of the FDA solution is 2 µmol/L, and the concentration of the PI stock is 6 µmol/L, which is the final concentration of the working solution; (4) Storage of the stock solution: Due to the large amount of high-concentration FDA and PI stock solutions prepared, the volume of the working solution prepared is smaller. Therefore, they should be aliquot and stored separately in a refrigerator at −20 °C away from light. Before use, they should be stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C for thawing, with appropriate shaking during the thawing process. For better fluorescence, use only once after thawing. 2.3. Experimental Setup As shown in Figure 2 To characterize the cell activity, the collected cells are stained. The staining steps are as follows: (1) the cells collected from the outlet are first centrifuged; (2) wash the cells 2–3 times with PBS buffer and then add 200 µL of PBS to make a cell suspension; (3) take 100 µL of the prepared working solution and add it to 200 µL of cell suspension. Incubate the cells in the dark at 37 °C for 30 min; (4) finally, observe the live cells with green fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 490 nm and the dead cells at an excitation wavelength of 535 nm, and then superposition the fluorescence images of the live cells with the images of the dead cells to show the final cell viability. 3. Experimental Study of Particle Manipulation Based on AMPA-Based Chips 3.1. Research on Different Vibration Modes It is known from the experimental principle that different amplitudes of vibration will produce different vibration modes. In the actual experiment, the vibration of the microcolumn presents multiple modes, the most common of which are linear, quasi-circular, and elliptical vibrations. Linear vibration is when a vibration is applied in one direction and the vibration is stationary or minimal in the other direction. In this case, d x / d y  ( d x = 0 , d y ≠ 0 ) . π / 2 d x / d y d x / d y When the vibration modes are different, the distribution of acoustic flow generated around the microcolumn is also different. The elliptical vibration mode is composed of one main vortex and two secondary vortices, as shown in Figure 3 Figure 3 Video S2 Figure 3 V m a x 57 In this study, COMSOL Multiphysics 6.2 was used for numerical solutions to effectively characterize the acoustic streaming distribution around the microstructure vibration. Under the action of acoustic streaming, particles were introduced into the microchannel, and the motion trajectories and forces of the particles suspended around the microstructure were solved. This solution process usually includes the following three steps [ 58 3 −4 −1 3 Figure 3 For the acoustic streaming velocity, based on the perturbation theory, the parameters in the field are decomposed into undisturbed, oscillating, and steady parts. The time-averaged acoustic streaming velocity is obtained by solving the second-order continuity equation and the Navier–Stokes equation. The relevant formula is [ 59 (2a) ρ 0 ∇ ⋅ ⟨ v 2 ⟩ = − ∇ ⋅ ⟨ ρ 1 v 1 ⟩ (2b) η ∇ 2 v 2 + β η ∇ ∇ ⋅ v 2 − ∇ p 2 = ρ 1 ∂ v 1 ∂ t + ρ 0 ⟨ v 1 ⋅ ∇ v 1 ⟩ In the formula, ρ 0 ⟨ . . . ⟩ v 1 v 2 η β p 2 t Among them, ⟨ v 2 ⟩ v 1 ρ 1 The motion of the particle velocity is jointly determined by the acoustic radiation force and the acoustic streaming-induced drag. In a standing wave sound field, the acoustic radiation force acting on a compressible, spherical particle in a viscous fluid is as follows: (2c) F r a d = − ∇ U r a d (2d) U r a d = 4 π 3 r 3 f 1 κ 0 2 p i n 2 − f r 2 3 ρ 0 4 v i n 2 (2e) f 1 κ ~ = 1 − κ ~ (2f) κ ~ = κ p κ 0 (2g) f 2 ρ ~ , δ ~ = 2 1 − γ δ ~ ρ ~ − 1 2 ρ ~ + 1 − 3 γ δ ~ (2h) γ δ ~ = − 3 2 R e 1 + i 1 + δ ~ δ ~ In the formula, U r a d k 0 , k p f 1 f 2 p i n , v i n a n d  ρ ~ = ρ p ρ 0 δ ~ = δ r The formula for calculating the acoustic streaming-induced drag F d (2i) F d = 6 π a η ⟨ v 2 ⟩ − u In the formula, a u The motion of particles follows Newton’s laws of motion: m j d v j d t = ∑ F i r j 3.2. Research on the Effects of Frequency and Voltage on the Rotational Speed of a Single Particle Experiments show that adjusting the frequency over a wide range would change the vibration mode of the acoustic flow, but changing it over a small range would only affect the rotational speed of the particles. Therefore, the same voltage (30 Vpp) was maintained in different vibration modes, and the effect of the power supply frequency on the rotational speed was measured by adjusting the frequency over a small range. And the experiment found that the power supply voltage also affects the rotational speed of the cells, so keeping the frequency constant in different vibration modes investigated the effect of the power supply voltage on rotational speed by adjusting the power supply voltage from 0 to 60 VPP, with a step of 10 VPP each time. When the driving frequency is set to 45 kHz, the system forms an elliptical vibration mode, pumping 5 µm particles into the microchannel. After the piezoelectric transducer is activated to generate ultrasonic waves (US), the particles are captured on the microstructure and rotate rapidly around the Z-axis under the action of acoustic vortices ( Figure 4 Video S1 Figure 4 When the driving frequency is adjusted to 42.8 kHz, the system enters a linear vibration mode. At this point, the particles are captured by the US device and rotate rapidly within the plane ( Figure 4 Video S1 Figure 4 Video S1 ω g Figure 4 Video S1 To evaluate the effect of the driving voltage of the US device on the rotational angular velocity of the particles in different vibration modes, repeated experiments were conducted using 5 µm diameter polystyrene spherical particles at the optimal frequency in different modes. The 5 µm particles were first pumped into the microchannel, with the particles randomly distributed around the microcolumn. Then, the US device was activated, the particles were rapidly captured and began to rotate, and the voltage was gradually increased from 0 to 60 Vpp, with a step size of 10 Vpp. Adjust the drive frequency to 44.9 kHz to form an elliptical vibration mode, where the rotational angular velocity of the particles increases rapidly with the increase in the drive voltage up to 800 r/min; adjust the drive frequency to 42.6 kHz to form a linear vibration mode in which the rotational angular velocity of the particles increases rapidly with the increase in the drive voltage, up to 620 r/min; adjust the drive frequency to 42.6 kHz to form a quasi-circular vibration mode, in which the rotational angular velocity of the particles increases rapidly with the increase in the drive voltage, up to 328 r/min; adjust the drive frequency to 52.8 kHz to form a high-order vibration mode, in which the rotational angular velocity of the particles increases rapidly with the increase in the drive voltage, up to 550 r/min. The relationship between the driving voltages of various vibration modes and the rotational angular velocity of the particles is shown in Figure 4 3.3. Multi-Particle Rotation Experiment In addition, experiments have found that this method can not only manipulate a single particle, but also multiple particles simultaneously. As shown in Figure 5 3.4. Rotational Manipulation of Cancer Cells Understanding the in-plane and out-of-plane rotation of cells can provide a deeper insight into cell behavior and the micro-environment, enabling better extraction of the morphological characteristics of cancer cells and facilitating the analysis of heterogeneity among cancer cells. Through the study of particle rotation, it was discovered that there are different vibration patterns at different frequencies. Therefore, for subsequent cancer cell rotation experiments, 44.9 kHz and 52.8 kHz were selected as the driving frequencies, respectively, to achieve in-plane and out-of-plane rotations of cancer cells. First, the cancer cells were inserted into the microchannel and randomly distributed around the microstructure. Then, the US device was turned on, and the cancer cells were rapidly captured and began to rotate under torque. The cancer cells are captured around the rhombic microcolumn at different times and rotate continuously in the plane along the Z-axis under torque, as shown in Figure 6 Video S3 Subsequently, the frequency of the US device was adjusted to 52.8 kHz to enable the out-of-plane rotation of the cancer cells. The cancer cells were captured around the rhombic microcolumn at different times and rotated out of plane along the M-axis under torque, as shown in Figure 6 Video S3 Figure 6 3.5. Effects of Biological Activity To test whether the acoustic flow had an effect on cell activity, fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI) were used to detect the cell activity of cancer cells collected at the outlet after the rinse was controlled. Based on the cell viability assay method presented in Section 2 4 Figure 7 4. Conclusions In this work, we propose a non-invasive three-dimensional cell manipulation method based on acoustic microfluidic chips and study the acoustic field conditions of four vibration forms of micropillars. We investigated the rotation status of the particles in these four vibration modes and the relationship between rotational speed and frequency, and voltage. Subsequently, we conducted manipulation experiments on cells and studied the effect of driving voltage on rotational speed at the optimal vibration frequency. In addition, we evaluated the activity of the cells after manipulation, addressing the problem that most existing manipulation methods cause damage to the cells. Although we conducted manipulation experiments on cells, the actual size and shape of the cells have an impact on the manipulation results, which makes precise manipulation of cells difficult in some tasks. Therefore, improving the precision of manipulation is an essential direction for future development. This manipulation method has the characteristic of being directionless in rotational direction control. Because under the same power and voltage conditions, regardless of how the positive and negative poles of the power amplifier are connected to the positive and negative poles of the piezoelectric transducer, the acoustic flow field generated by the microcolumn is consistent in both direction and magnitude. This leads to the fact that the rotational direction of the particles or cells will not change. Therefore, at present, this method cannot achieve active control of the rotational direction. The current data only represents this trial. Further trials will be conducted in the future to expand the data volume and conduct more comprehensive verification.
