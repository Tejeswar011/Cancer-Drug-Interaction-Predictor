This article is available from https://cureus.com/articles/397830-psychological-well-being-in-breast-cancer-a-literature-review-of-the-impact-of-precision-oncology-and-radiogenomics Radiogenomic testing, including tools such as Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, and Prosigna, has transformed breast cancer management through improved risk stratification and personalized therapy. However, several potential psychological burdens can result as consequences for these genomic tools. This literature review includes 25 peer-reviewed studies published between 2015 and 2025 that examined the psychological outcomes associated with radiogenomic testing in breast cancer patients. Anxiety, depression, fear of recurrence, and decision conflict were the most common themes encountered in these studies, particularly among those receiving intermediate or high genomic risk scores. Additional moderation factors such as age, health literacy, socioeconomic status, and communication quality were also linked to variations in distress levels. Thematic analysis highlights the importance of integrating psychological support, patient education, and counseling throughout the genomic testing process. This review emphasizes the need for a holistic, patient-centered approach that addresses the emotional and cognitive consequences of precision oncology and identifies key areas for future psychosocial intervention research. anxiety breast cancer depression fear of recurrence genetic testing oncotype dx precision medicine psychological distress psycho-oncology radiogenomics pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Introduction and background In oncology, several interdisciplinary approaches are emerging, with radiogenomic testing representing one of the most advanced methods for breast cancer management. Radiogenomics integrates radiologic imaging with tumor biology and precision oncology to improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning [ 1 2 3 4 Historically, treatment decisions for early-stage breast cancer relied on clinicopathological factors such as tumor size, grade, nodal involvement, and receptor status. However, these markers often lacked sufficient prognostic accuracy [ 5 6 8 9 While these advances enhance clinical precision, they also carry important psychological implications. Many women undergoing genomic or radiogenomic testing experience distress related to diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions, including anxiety, fear of recurrence, and uncertainty about the future [ 10 11 12 13 14 15 Despite growing research on radiogenomic testing, important gaps remain. Few longitudinal studies track long-term mental health outcomes, minority and underserved populations remain underrepresented, and validated psychological assessment tools are inconsistently applied. Addressing these limitations is critical for developing equitable, patient-centered care models that integrate psychological well-being alongside clinical precision [ 16 Purpose of this study and research question identification The emotional and cognitive effects of radiogenomic testing on patients with breast cancer are the focus of this study. It seeks to combine the possible psychological effects, such as depression, anxiety, fear of recurrence, and conflict over treatment decisions. To investigate the relationship between radiogenomic risk scores and psychological distress, research questions were generated: (1) What are the psychological outcomes associated with radiogenomic testing in breast cancer patients? (2) How do radiogenomic-associated risk scores influence psychological outcomes? (3) How can psychosocial factors, mediators, and moderators influence psychological outcomes? (4) What are the coping strategies utilized to alleviate potential psychological outcomes? This literature review's goal is to highlight important areas for further research and to inform the best practices for a holistic patient approach that incorporates psychosocial support into precision oncology. Review Materials and methods Peer-reviewed observational studies published between 2015 and 2025 were collected and assessed using a methodical process. This review followed the PRISMA 2020 guidelines for systematic reviews. A total of 123 records were identified across six databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Psycho-oncology, Web of Science, and Scopus) using a combination of keywords (“breast cancer,” “Oncotype DX,” “MammaPrint,” “radiogenomic,” “psychological distress,” “anxiety,” “depression,” and “fear of recurrence”). After removing 49 duplicates, 74 records were screened. Based on the title and abstract review, 49 records were excluded. The remaining 25 full-text articles met all inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The selection process is summarized in the PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1 Figure 1 PRISMA flow diagram PRISMA: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses The selected research had to meet the following inclusion criteria: it had to be about female breast cancer patients; involve radiogenomic or multigene assay testing, such as Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, or Prosigna; report psychological outcomes such as anxiety, depression, fear of recurrence, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or general distress; and be published in peer-reviewed journals in English within the specified time frame. Research that did not report psychological outcomes, was not peer-reviewed, had duplicate publications, or focused on male patients or non-breast cancer populations was disqualified. To ensure methodological rigor and quality of the review, both qualitative and quantitative studies were included. The quality of the observational studies was evaluated using validated instruments: the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort and case-control designs and the AXIS tool for cross-sectional studies. Results and thematic analysis The selected 25 literature reviews were published between 2015 and 2025, with sample sizes ranging from roughly 50 to over 1,000 breast cancer patients. Women with early-stage breast cancer who underwent radiogenomic testing with Oncotype DX (n = 15), MammaPrint (n = 5), Prosigna (n = 3), and other multigene panels (n = 2) made up most of the selected populations in the reviewed research. Most studies used cross-sectional or observational cohort designs and evaluated psychological distress outcomes at different times after receiving the results of genomic tests and receiving a diagnosis, mainly depression and anxiety. Data extraction was carried out using a standardized charting method to record study attributes, like author, publication year, country of study, participant demographics, the genomic test used, psychological evaluation instruments, and important findings (see Table 1 Table 1 Extracted data from included literatures BC: breast cancer; QoL: quality of life; PTSD: post-traumatic stress disorder Author (year) Radiogenomic tool Population Key theme Psychological outcome Main findings Yanes et al.

Theme I: Potential Psychological Challenges Associated With Radiogenomic Testing In the reviewed literature, anxiety, depression, and fear of recurrence are the most measured psychological outcomes related to radiogenomic testing. Reliable measures of these symptoms, such as the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), have been used in numerous studies to measure distress levels [ 16 17 18 18 19 6 20 21 Studies consistently showed that patients with high or intermediate genomic risk scores experienced noticeably higher levels of psychological distress than patients with low-risk scores. At least 18 studies found that patients with intermediate- or high-risk genomic profiles had higher levels of anxiety, making it the most measured psychological outcome [ 8 22 23 16 Twelve studies reported depressive symptoms, and while the extent and consistency of these effects varied more than those for anxiety, they generally indicated a trend toward higher depression scores in higher-risk patients [ 6 24 25 26 According to 10 studies, FCR was a major psychological concern. The findings consistently demonstrated a strong positive relationship between fear of recurrence and genomic risk categories, with intermediate- and high-risk patients expressing concerns that persisted for longer than a year after the end of treatment [ 17 20 Theme II: Relationship Between Psychological Distress and Various Radiogenomic Risk Scores In general, patients with higher genomic risk scores report higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, according to the association between psychological distress and radiogenomic risk scores, specifically Oncotype DX and MammaPrint [ 27 25 28 29 24 33 The timing of psychological assessment also appeared to be crucial in the identification of the induced psychological effect. Studies differed widely when psychological evaluations were conducted, ranging from right after disclosure of radiogenomic results to years after survivorship. Peak distress, particularly anxiety and fear of recurrence, was usually observed in early post-test evaluations (within three months) [ 20 3 28 3 Theme III: Psychosocial Mediators and Moderators Psychosocial factors have been found in several studies to mediate or moderate the relationship between psychological distress and genomic risk. Adequate counseling and clear communication of results seem to lessen the potential negative psychological effects [ 7 The strongest protective factor was found to be social support, especially from peers and family, which mitigated distress irrespective of the level of genomic risk [ 26 28 8 30 13 13 Patients' psychological reactions to radiogenomic testing have been found to be significantly influenced by additional psychosocial factors, such as cultural background, family involvement, and communication quality [ 8 29 2 31 Theme IV: Coping Strategies and Interventions The reviewed literatures showed a recurring theme about the most popular methods to alleviate anxiety and improve coping mechanisms among breast cancer patients. Yanes et al. and Muktar et al. examined cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), particularly for patients with high-risk genomic results [ 16 27 30 29 32 18 34 34 Discussion A distinct pattern emerges from the review's combined data: patients with breast cancer who have intermediate or high radiogenomic risk scores typically endure noticeably more psychological distress than those who have low-risk results. The most prevalent and immediate emotional reaction after learning one's genetic risk status seems to be anxiety. The uncertainty surrounding a higher chance of recurrence and the consequences for more intensive or drawn-out treatment plans are probably the root causes of this anxiety. According to studies like Yanes et al. and Klafke et al., the psychological effects can last throughout the crucial decision-making phase that follows diagnosis and are not just a temporary reaction [ 16 23 Numerous studies have documented a strong fear of recurrence, which emphasizes how genomic testing, although medically advantageous, also imposes a psychological burden that may impair patients' everyday functioning and quality of life. Relationship stress and general well-being may result from this fear, which frequently shows up as hypervigilance to physical symptoms, sleep issues, and elevated health anxiety [ 17 20 It is interesting to note that PTSD and depression symptoms were not as consistently linked to genomic risk scores. This variability could be explained by variations in measurement instruments, sample characteristics, and assessment timing among studies. For instance, a subset of patients who already have vulnerabilities or who encounter other stressors in their lives that are unrelated to their cancer prognosis may develop depressive symptoms. People who have had traumatic medical experiences in the past or who are more sensitive to stress related to their health may develop symptoms of PTSD [ 25 Commonly Measured Psychological Outcomes The two psychological outcomes that are most frequently measured in breast cancer patients undergoing radiogenomic testing, according to the reviewed literature, are anxiety and depression, with additional focus on the fear of recurrence. To accurately measure these symptoms, several studies used validated tools like the PHQ-9 and the HADS [ 16 17 6 20 21 Psychological Distress and Radiogenomic Risk Score Correlation In general, patients with intermediate or high genomic risk scores report more anxiety and depressive symptoms than those with low-risk scores, according to the correlation between psychological distress and radiogenomic risk scores, mainly Oncotype DX and MammaPrint. For instance, Malgaroli et al. and Willis et al. concluded that patients with intermediate to high Oncotype DX scores showed noticeably greater distress [ 25 28 29 24 7 Time and Longitudinal Factors A key factor in clinical intervention is the timing of psychological distress after radiogenomic testing. Most studies found that anxiety and recurrence fear peaked shortly after test results were received, which corresponded with increased uncertainty and treatment planning [ 3 20 20 Clinical Implications and Psychosocial Moderators Numerous studies have highlighted how important psychosocial moderators are in influencing psychological outcomes, including coping strategies, social support, and health literacy. According to research by Balitsky et al. and Willis et al., patients who had strong social networks-such as friends, family, and peer support groups-reported feeling less distressed [ 1 28 35 Another crucial element that surfaced was health literacy. Patients are better able to make decisions and experience less helplessness and uncertainty when they are fully informed about their genomic results and the implications for treatment options [ 8 30 Coping mechanisms also have a big impact on results. Avoidant coping, which is characterized by denial or disengagement, predicted worse emotional adjustment, according to Omari et al., while active coping strategies, such as information-seeking, problem-solving, and emotional expression, were associated with lower psychological distress [ 26  Coping Strategies and Interventions  Although there is still a dearth of intervention research in this area, recent studies show encouraging methods for helping patients understand the results of radiogenomic tests [ 2 16 27 30 19 18 Limitations and future directions Several limitations inherent in the existing literature must be acknowledged when interpreting the findings of this review. First, the heterogeneity in study designs, sample characteristics, and psychological outcome measures complicates synthesis and precludes the possibility of robust meta-analytic aggregation. Many studies predominantly relied on self-report questionnaires, which are vulnerable to response biases such as social desirability or recall inaccuracies. Additionally, most of the research has focused on early-stage female breast cancer patients, limiting the generalizability of findings to patients with advanced disease stages, male breast cancer patients, or individuals with other cancer types where genomic testing is increasingly utilized. Future research should prioritize longitudinal study designs that track psychological distress trajectories from diagnosis through survivorship to better elucidate causal pathways and identify critical windows for intervention. Expanding demographic and clinical diversity within study samples-including male patients, advanced-stage cancer, and diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds-will enhance the external validity of findings. Furthermore, well-designed randomized controlled trials evaluating psychosocial interventions tailored specifically to genomic risk communication are urgently needed to provide evidence-based guidelines for integrating mental health support into genomic-informed cancer care. Conclusions Radiogenomic testing tools such as Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, and Prosigna have revolutionized personalized breast cancer care by enabling more precise, tailored treatment decisions that improve clinical outcomes. However, this review highlights the significant psychological impact these genomic risk scores impose on patients, particularly through heightened anxiety and FCR. The emotional burden associated with receiving intermediate- or high-risk genomic results underscores the critical need to integrate psychosocial care into standard oncology practice. Routine mental health screening, comprehensive patient education, and supportive psychosocial interventions should be embedded alongside genomic testing protocols. Clear, compassionate communication regarding risk results, combined with strategies to foster adaptive coping, can effectively mitigate distress and empower patients during their treatment journey. Given the persistence of fear of recurrence and the variability in depressive and trauma-related symptoms, psychosocial support must extend beyond the immediate diagnostic and treatment phases into long-term survivorship care. Multidisciplinary collaboration involving oncologists, mental health professionals, genetic counselors, and patient navigators is essential to address the multifaceted needs of breast cancer patients in the genomic era. Ultimately, genomic information is not solely clinical data but deep personal knowledge that shapes patients’ lived experiences. Bridging precision oncology with compassionate psychosocial care enables healthcare providers to support patients more holistically, improving both medical outcomes and quality of life. This review emphasizes that anxiety, depression, and fear of recurrence are the most prominent psychological outcomes linked to radiogenomic risk scores, with higher scores generally correlating with greater distress. Effective communication and psychosocial support emerge as critical moderators of these outcomes. Although interventions such as CBT, mindfulness, and enhanced patient education show promise, the current evidence base remains insufficient to establish definitive clinical guidelines. Future research should focus on large-scale psychosocial intervention trials and explore less frequently studied outcomes like post-traumatic stress symptoms to inform comprehensive care models. Integrating psychosocial support into radiogenomic testing pathways is vital to optimize both psychological well-being and oncologic outcomes for breast cancer patients.
