It also remains poorly understood how the transcription of HERV-K loci is regulated in cells that can produce Env. Results We aligned our neutrophil RNA sequencing data to the new telomere-to-telomere reference genome and found uniquely mapping transcripts from HERV-K101, K102, K104, K108, K109, K117 and ERVK5, of which only K102, K108, and K109 encode an intact Env. Expression of K102 and K108 were higher in SLE than in healthy donors or RA (p adj adj Conclusions Our data establish a role for interferons in maintaining increased HERV-K expression in SLE and suggest that interferons or other cytokines can upregulate HERV-K to similar levels in RA. A transient increase may also accompany normal immune responses, suggesting that endogenous retroviruses may have been co-opted for efficient immune responses.

We measured K102 and K108 transcripts by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), used immunofluorescence microscopy to detect Env protein, RNA sequencing to illuminate gene expression, and tested HERV-K102 transcriptional control with a luciferase reporter driven by the 5’ long-terminal repeat (LTR) of HERV-K102. Our hypothesis is that myeloid cells in SLE express increased levels of HERV-K because of the elevated type I interferons in this disease. In contrast, myeloid cells from RA patients express K102 and K108 at levels that are similar to healthy controls but respond more vigorously to cytokines or TLR ligands to reach the same levels as in SLE. During a normal immune response, myeloid cells from healthy donors also increase K102 and K108 expression, but, at least ex vivo, this is less pronounced and more transient than in RA cells. The purpose of our study was to determine how dynamic HERV-K expression is in immune cells from patients with autoimmune conditions compared to healthy donors and to build a basis for further exploration of their epigenetic and transcriptional control and possible contribution to antiviral or autoimmune disorders.

To ask if the effect of IFNα in RA PBMC was modest because only a subset of immune cells responded, we purified monocytes, B cells, CD8 T cells, and (separately) neutrophils from RA and SLE patients, as well as from heathy donors, and tested them individually for HERV-K102 expression after treatment with IFNα. In purified CD8 T cells, HERV-K102 expression increased less than two-fold (Supplemental Fig. S1B), while, as a positive control, they reacted with a more than 60-fold induction of the IFNα-responsive gene IFI6 IFNα induced a rapid, but transient, 2.5-fold increase in K102 transcript levels in healthy monocytes (Fig. 2 2 IFI6 2 2 2 7 2 50 IFI6 Since monocytes remain viable for many days in cell culture, we also stimulated RA monocytes with IFNα for longer time-courses and observed that HERV-K102 expression was maintained at the elevated level for up to 2 days after the initial rapid increase (Fig. 2 p 2 IFI6 2 2 IFI6 2 p IFNα also induced a rapid, but transient, tenfold increase in HERV-K102 expression in healthy donor neutrophils (Fig. 3 IFI6 3 3 3 Fig. 3 Induction of HERV-K102 expression in neutrophils by interferon α and other stimuli.

As shown in Fig. 3 3 3 3 Expression of HERV-K108/109 is similarly induced by interferon and cytokines We also quantified transcripts from the type 2 provirus HERV-K108 using a forward primer located in the 292-bp region that is missing in K102 and other type 1 HML-2 proviruses (Fig. 4 1 Fig. 4 Induction of HERV-K108 (including K109) expression.

This antibody recognizes the pre-fusion conformation of Env (manuscript submitted). These experiments showed that the majority of untreated monocytes lacked detectable Env protein (Fig. 5 5 5 5 p Fig. 5 Induction of detectable Env by interferon α. A B C D E F G H I J p p p p Monocytes from RA patients maintained in cell culture for 3 days differentiated into adherent macrophage-like cells with a much larger diameter and a more rounded nucleus. These cells were more frequently Env-positive (Fig. 5 5 5 Similarly, immunofluorescence staining of neutrophils for Env revealed that untreated RA neutrophils had detectable Env in a portion of the cells (Fig. 5 47 5 5 Neutrophils from untreated SLE patients contained Env with a very similar distribution to IFNα-treated RA neutrophils (Supplemental Fig. S2B), while healthy donor neutrophils were devoid of any detectable Env (Supplemental Fig. S2B, right hand panels). The secondary antibody alone did not stain anything (Supplemental Fig. S2B, lower panels). Expression of HERV-K silencing genes and relevant transcription factors To gain more insight into the mechanisms leading to the higher basal expression of HERV-K102 and K108 in SLE neutrophils and monocytes compared to healthy cells, as well as its response to cytokines, we examined the expression of known epigenetic and transcriptional regulators of HERV-K transcription [ 32 33 6 DNMT1 DNMT3A DNMT3B 6 56 58 TRIM28 adj 6 SETDB1 PPHLN1, TASOR ZNF93 6 MPP8 Fig. 6 The 5’LTR of HERV-K and expression of key regulatory factors binding to it.

However, the differences we observe in HERV-K102 induction in RA neutrophils compared to healthy neutrophils cannot be readily explained by differences in expression of epigenetic silencers or transcription factors. HERV-K promoter 5’LTR reporter gene induction Next, we constructed a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the entire 1,110-bp 5’LTR of HERV-K102 (Fig. 7 7 7 7 Fig. 7 Transcriptional activation of HERV-K102 reporter and the expression of HERV-K proviruses in patients. A B C D E F G H I p p p p HERV-K provirus expression is higher in SLE patient with a type I interferon gene signature To ask if the induction of HERV-K expression by IFNα in cell culture is relevant in patients with autoimmune disease, we segregated the SLE patients included in our RNAseq data set (n = 35) into those who have an interferon gene signature indicative of elevated IFNα or lack such a signature. The average expression of 111 interferon induced genes (ISGs) was calculated per sample and SLE samples were considered having high interferon signatures if the average expression of ISGs was higher than the 90th percentile of ISG expression in healthy controls, which was the case in 27 of the 35 patients. As shown in Fig. 7 59 60 pol Discussion The presence of IgG autoantibodies against the Env protein encoded by HERV-K in patients with autoimmune disorders implies that this protein has been present and that it elicited an immune response typically not seen in healthy individuals. Our finding that neutrophils from SLE [ 49 47 1 env 47 5 Our data are in agreement with the well-recognized silencing of HERV-K expression by a DNA methylation-dependent mechanism in healthy individuals [ 32 35 61 64 65 66 37 41 67 68 45 69 70 43 67 Immunity against HERV-K Env is found in several cancers, including breast cancer [ 71 72 73 73 74 47 48 49 75 47 72 76 A paper by Chuong and co-workers [ 77 Our study has some caveats. First, the young HML-2 loci are so similar (except for deleted parts) that it is challenging to construct PCR primers that are completely specific for any individual provirus. While our primers for K102 were highly specific among the set of HERV-K transcripts detected by RNAseq in neutrophils, our primers for HERV-K108 also match HERV-K104 and K109, two highly homologous and recently acquired type 2 HERV-K transcripts. While the former has an incomplete env Second, although our LTR-luciferase reporter responded to IFNα (Fig. 7 Conclusions In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that several young HERV-K proviruses, notably K102, K108, and K109, are expressed at elevated levels in SLE myeloid cells because their transcription is stimulated by the chronically increased type I interferons in the majority of patients. In contrast, myeloid cells from RA patients require cytokine or TLR stimulation to reach the same elevated levels of HERV-K transcripts. In addition, this induction is longer lasting and, in monocytes, of higher magnitude than in healthy donors. Nevertheless, even healthy immune responses may be accompanied by upregulation of HERV-K transcripts and perhaps the encoded proteins, such as Env. Given that endogenous retroviruses have been present in our genome for tens of millions of years, it would not be surprising if the immune system had evolved beneficial uses for them, such as in the defense against exogenous viruses. Methods Human subjects Venous blood was obtained for RNAseq from de-identified SLE patients ( n n n n Isolation of monocytes and neutrophils Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and neutrophils were isolated from freshly drawn venous blood by gradient centrifugation on PolymorphPrep (CosmoBio, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed and suspended in Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline at 10 7 Stimulation of PBMCs, monocytes, B cells, CD8-positive T cells and neutrophils Freshly isolated PBMCs, monocytes, B cells, CD8-positive T cells or neutrophils were seeded in 24-well or 48-well plates suspended in RPMI 1640 media (Gibco cat# 11,875,093), supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals cat# S11150H) and 1 × Antibiotic/Antifungal (Cytiva Cat# SV30079.01). Cells were then stimulated with 500U/mL of human recombinant interferon alpha 2b (IFNα−2b; abcam cat# ab187208) either alone or in combination with Human T-Activator CD3/CD28 Dynabeads (Gibco cat# 11131D) at a bead to cell ratio of one to one, 1–30 µM 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC; Sigma-Aldrich cat #A3656) either alone or in combination with 500 U/ml of IFNα−2b (abcam cat# ab187208), 20 ng/ml IFN-γ (Invivogen cat# rcyec-hifng), 100 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Invitrogen eBioscience cat# 501,122,025), 10 µg/ml imiqumod (Invivogen cat# R837), 8 ng/ml tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; R&D Systems cat# 210-TA/CF), 100 ng/ml human granulocyte–macrophage colony stimulating Factor (GM-CSF; PeproTech Cat# 300–3), 10 ng/ml IL-1β (R&D systems cat# 20-1LB-010), 10 ng/ml IL-3 (R&D systems cat# 203IL010CF), 10 ng/ml IL-4 (PeproTech cat#200–04), 10 ng/ml IL-6 (abcam cat# ab259381), 100 ng/ml IL-8 (eBioscience cat# 14–8089-63), 100 ng/ml IL-10 (R&D systems cat# 1064ILB010), 60 ng/ml IL-17A (R&D systems cat# 79-55I-L010CF), 100 ng/ml IL-18 (R&D systems cat# 91-24I-L010CF), 100 ng/ml IL-22 (R&D systems cat# 782IL010CF), or 50 ng/ml IL-33 (R&D systems cat# 3625IL010CF). An unstimulated control was also included at 0h. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C, with 5% CO 2 RNA isolation and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis RNA was isolated from patient or healthy donor immune cells using the Quick RNA whole blood kit (Zymo Research Cat# R1201), samples were treated with DNase I before proceeding to cDNA synthesis. RNA concentration and purity (260/280) were measured using the Thermo Scientific NanoDrop 1000. cDNA was synthesized using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen Cat# 205,311), with the genomic DNA removal step that was performed according to the manufacture’s protocol. PCR was then carried out using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase with 18S primers, and primers for HERV-K102 [ 48 IFI6 RNA sequencing RNA sequencing was performed on neutrophils as described before [ 47 78 n n n GSE261866 Bioinformatics of HERV-K proviruses Read quality was analyzed with FASTQC ( http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/ 79 80 81 82 https://web.expasy.org/translate/ 18 Antibodies and other reagents The following primary antibodies were used: anti-Env mAbs Kenv1 and Kenv6, which recognize a linear epitope in the distal portion of the N-terminal (extracellular) region of Env and a conformational epitope in the N-terminus of Env, respectively (obtainable from Saphire lab). Secondary antibodies were: Goat anti-mouse IgG secondary Ab conjugated to AF647 (#A-21235) or AF488 (#A-11001) (Invitrogen). Non-specific binding of antibodies to Fc FcγRII was prevented by including anti-human CD32 (#MAB1300SP, Fisher Scientific, USA) and normal goat serum (ThermoFisher, #50062Z). Paraformaldehyde was from ThermoFisher Scientific, Triton X-100 from Millipore-Sigma, Germany, and BlockAid solution from ThermoFisher Scientific. DNA staining was with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) or Hoechst 33,342, both from ThermoFisher. Immunofluorescence microscopy Freshly isolated neutrophils were cultured for 30 min at 37 °C on 96-well glass bottom plates (Cellvis #P96-1-N) pre-coated with poly-L-lysine (Millipore-Sigma # P4707). Macrophages were generated by leaving monocytes on the plates for 3 days at 37°C. The adherent cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 20 min, followed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min followed by three washes with PBS. To prevent nonspecific binding, neutrophils were blocked using 10% normal mouse and/or goat serum in BlockAid solution with anti-human FcγRII antibody overnight at 4 °C. Neutrophils were then incubated with a 1:50 dilution of mouse anti-Env mAb Kenv6, followed by three washes with PBS. The cells were subsequently stained with goat anti-mouse IgG secondary Ab conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (red). Negative controls consisted of cells stained without primary antibody or with only secondary antibodies. DNA was stained with either DAPI or Hoechst33342. Images were captured at 40 X, 60 X, or 100 X magnification using a Keyence BZ-X800 Fluorescence microscope and analyzed using BZ-X800 Analyzer software. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry Neutrophils were lysed by mixing 10 7 5’LTR luciferase reporter experiments Nucleotides 1–1,110 of the 5’LTR of HERV-K102 (GenBank: JN675014.1 Statistical analyses The statistical significance of the data sets from patient samples was calculated using ANOVA and the paired t-test.
