However, advances in the understanding of its biology have led to the development of several new therapeutic approaches. One of these novel treatment strategies is based on the targeting of the mitochondrial bioenergetic and networks responsible for tumor initiation and progression. Indeed, it has recently emerged that changes in mitochondrial metabolism, dynamics, redox homeostasis, and apoptosis are strictly associated with tumor growth, metastasis, and drug resistance. In this review, we summarize current evidence about the multiple biological functions exerted by mitochondria in melanoma, also focusing on the role of these organelles as promising targets for pharmacological intervention.

In 1956, Otto Warburg reported that, in contrast to non-malignant cells, cancer cells display a glycolytic phenotype characterized by high lactate production and low oxygen consumption even in normoxic conditions. However, in the last years it has clearly emerged that melanoma cells have a hybrid phenotype, in which mitochondrial respiration is still functional, allowing high flexibility and plasticity As noted earlier, melanoma cells exhibit a remarkable ability to reprogram their metabolism in response to a wide range of both intracellular and extracellular stimuli. In this scenario, both glutaminolysis and FAO play a pivotal role in sustaining the activity of the TCA cycle and OXPHOS. Focusing on the first, melanoma cells often exhibit a strong dependency on glutamine, a phenomenon commonly referred to as \"glutamine addiction\". This is largely driven by cataplerotic reactions involving glutamate and asparagine, which serve to replenish TCA cycle intermediates while also supporting the synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and other macromolecules [ 30 31 32 33 34 35 i.e. Within melanoma microenvironment, metabolic plasticity also orchestrates the interactions between cancer cells and immune components. Specifically, the upregulation of glycolysis in melanoma cells produces a glucose-deprived microenvironment, contributing to the functional exhaustion of CD4 + T lymphocytes [ 36 37 38 39 40 Mitochondrial dynamics and quality control in melanoma Mitochondrial dynamics encompass biogenesis, fission, fusion, and mitophagy—processes essential for maintaining mitochondrial quality control and overall cellular health [ 30 2 Fig. 2 Mitochondrial dynamics are dysregulated during melanoma development and progression. Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles undergoing continuous processes of biogenesis, fission, fusion, and mitophagy. In melanoma, PGC-1α-driven mitochondrial biogenesis is activated in proliferative tumors, cancer stem cells, and after BRAF or MAPK pharmacological inhibition, while being suppressed during metastasis. Drp1, the main regulator of mitochondrial fission, is upregulated upon Ras-induced malignant transformation, while being inactivated by MAPK inhibitors. Mfn1-related mitochondrial fusion correlates with a senescence-associated secretory phenotype; on the other hand, Mfn2 is degraded in cancer cells undergoing ER stress, leading to mitophagy. Regarding the latter, it seems to be non-canonical, with Parkin being absent in NRAS-mutant malignancies and BNIP3 being overexpressed in hypoxic conditions PGC-1α is a key transcriptional coactivator regulating mitochondrial biogenesis [ 41 42 43 44 46 47 23 48 50 Mitochondrial shape, tightly controlled by the balance of fission and fusion, reflects and regulates metabolic activity and apoptosis [ 51 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 Mitophagy, a selective form of autophagy, clears damaged mitochondria to maintain cellular homeostasis [ 58 58 59 60 60 61 62 As discussed above, mitochondrial integrity is preserved via mitochondrial biogenesis, activated in response to context-specific cellular demands, and mitophagy, triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction [ 41 63 64 65 66 67 Mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) are a type of extracellular vesicles (EVs) that originate from mitochondria. They are formed from mitochondrial sub-compartments and released into the cytosol, and can also be incorporated into larger EVs and excreted from the cell. MDVs are deeply implicated in mitochondrial quality control, intercellular communication, and potentially in various diseases. In this regard, it should be noted that functional mitochondria are actively transported by melanoma EVs and lipidosomes, influencing both donor and recipient cells and significantly impacting tumor growth and dissemination [ 68 69 70 It is now well-established that some malignancies, including thyroid, renal, and colorectal carcinoma, accumulate loss-of-function mtDNA mutations and adopt an oncocytic phenotype characterized by high mitochondrial content [ 71 72 73 74 75 Mitochondria contain 13 proteins encoded by mtDNA and more than 1000 proteins encoded by nuclear DNA [ 76 76 77 78 79 As shown in the previous paragraphs of this chapter, mitochondria dynamically adapt to the changing environment by adjusting their nucleic acid and protein contents. Additionally, the mitochondrial components are modulated in terms of activity and interactions. In this context, multi-omics approaches offer comprehensive insight into mitochondrial regulation in melanoma [ 75 75 Mitochondrial redox homeostasis in melanoma ROS are widely recognized as key drivers of melanomagenesis, due to their ability to damage DNA and induce genetic and epigenetic alterations associated with cancer development [ 80 80 80 81 3 Fig. 3 Mitochondrial ROS regulate several tumorigenic processes in melanoma. Mitochondrial ROS have been found to exert a pleiotropic role in melanoma. First, they inhibit prolyl hydroxylases, leading to HIF-1α stabilization and contributing to Myc and Met activation. Then, they activate the Akt and ERK pathways, resulting in TGF-β and IL-13 release and subsequent M2 TAM polarization. Finally, they control the autophagic flux, determining cell survival or death The relationship between mitochondrial ROS and HIF-1α has been largely investigated in melanoma. In particular, mitochondrial oxidative stress has been found to stabilize HIF-1α protein by inhibiting prolyl hydroxylases [ 82 83 84 85 In addition to modulating transcriptional programs, mitochondrial ROS facilitate the release of inflammatory cytokines, such as transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) and interleukin 13 (IL-13), from melanoma cells. In particular, both the ERK and Akt pathways appear to positively regulate the induction of this inflammatory state [ 86 65 87 ROS also play a critical role in regulating cellular stress responses, particularly through the activation of autophagy—a major pathway for maintaining cellular homeostasis [ 88 89 90 89 90 Mitochondrial apoptosis in melanoma Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a fundamental biological process essential for embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and the removal of damaged or abnormal cells [ 91 92 91 92 91 93 BCL2A1 94 96 97 103 MCL1 104 108 4 Fig. 4 Mitochondrial apoptosis is reduced in melanoma. Melanoma is characterized by the upregulation of different anti-apoptotic proteins belonging to the Bcl-2 mitochondrial family, including Bcl-2A1, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. Targeting these proteins with ad hoc drugs might result in improved therapeutic outcomes Mitochondria in melanoma therapy Based on the above evidence, many new anticancer therapies are currently targeting mitochondria in the attempt to eradicate melanoma (Table 1 Table 1 Mitochondrial inhibitors in melanoma therapy Drug Mechanism of action Clinical development References CPI613 PDHA1 and OGDH inhibition Preclinical studies [ 14 BAY 87-2243, IACS-010759, metformin, and phenformin OXPHOS inhibition Preclinical studies; phase I/II trial (metformin) [ 109 120 Mensacarcin, cryptolepine, deguelin, tocotrienols, and limonoids OXPHOS inhibition Preclinical studies [ 122 126 Mdivi-1 Drp1 inhibition Preclinical studies [ 127 ONC201, ONC206, and ONC212 ClpP agonism Preclinical studies [ 130 132 Tigecycline, doxycycline, and azithromycin Mitochondrial translation inhibition Preclinical studies [ 131 133 138 Elesclomol, simvastatin, resveratrol, curcumin, tocotrienols, and chalcone derivatives ROS induction Preclinical studies [ 141 145 SAR405, 3-MA, and chloroquine Pro-survival autophagy inhibition Preclinical studies [ 147 149 Everolimus, GSK621, and trehalose Pro-death autophagy induction Preclinical studies; phase II trial (Everolimus) [ 150 153 Antisense oligonucleotides Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibition Preclinical studies [ 154 155 A-1331852, GX15-070 (Obatoclax), ABT-263 (Navitoclax), and ABT-737 BH3 mimicry Preclinical studies; phase I/II trial (Navitoclax) [ 156 159 162 SC-2001, S63845 S64315 Mcl-1 inhibition Preclinical studies [ 160 161 Paraptosis inducers Ca 2+ Preclinical studies [ 163 Ferroptosis inducers Intracellular iron accumulation and lipid peroxidation Preclinical studies [ 164 Both TCA and OXPHOS have been exploited for melanoma treatment. In particular, CPI613, a lipoic acid analog that inhibits PDHA1 and OGDH, has been shown to dramatically attenuate the progression of melanoma and improve the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD-1 against this tumor [ 14 109 113 110 114 120 NCT04114136 NCT03311308 121 122 126 Drp1 has been recently proposed as a promising target for melanoma management. Indeed, Akita et al. have found that mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (mdivi-1), a specific Drp1 inactivator, sensitizes melanoma cells to apoptosis induced by the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), by causing robust mitochondrial hyperfusion and eliciting both the ER and oxidative stress responses. Importantly, mdivi-1 cytotoxic effects are minimal in normal melanocytes and fibroblasts, suggesting the possibility to exploit melanoma cell susceptibility to mitochondrial breakdown to improve therapy outcomes [ 127 Mitochondrial UPR (mtUPR) occurs when an excess of unfolded or misfolded proteins accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix, eventually culminating into mitochondrial dysfunction [ 128 i.e. i.e. 129 130 132 Inhibition of mitochondrial translation is rapidly emerging as a novel anti-tumor strategy. In melanoma, several antibiotics, such as tigecycline, doxycycline, and azithromycin, have been shown to suppress OXPHOS capacity by reducing the levels of ETC complexes [ 131 133 137 138 139 140 Given their crucial role in determining cancer cell survival or death, ROS levels can be pharmacologically modulated for melanoma eradication [ 80 141 145 80 141 145 80 As previously illustrated, autophagy is a critical process in melanoma, involving autophagosome formation and its subsequent fusion with lysosomes for cargo degradation; from a molecular point of view, its regulation is based on mTOR-dependent and independent pathways, such as adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), MAPK, ER, and oxidative stress [ 90 146 90 146 147 153 90 Because of its relevance in the evasion of apoptosis, different strategies have been evaluated to inhibit the Bcl-2 protein family in melanoma. These include antisense oligonucleotides targeting Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL mRNAs and small molecules, such as the BH3 mimetics A-1331852, GX15-070 (Obatoclax), ABT-263 (Navitoclax), and ABT-737 [ 154 159 S63845 S64315 160 161 162 NCT01989585 2+ 163 164 While promising, mitochondria-targeted therapies still face challenges in selectivity, often leading to side effects in healthy tissues. Nanotechnology presents an innovative solution to this issue, by enhancing drug delivery precision, reducing off-target effects, and improving mitochondrial targeting [ 165 165 Conclusion and future perspectives In recent years, advancements in melanoma research have underscored the pivotal role of TCA cycle and OXPHOS in regulating tumor initiation and progression, shifting the focus towards mitochondrial metabolism. This progress has deepened our understanding of mitochondrial dynamics and quality control in the metabolic adaptability of melanoma. Studies have also explored the mitochondrial alterations responsible for redox imbalance and the evasion of apoptosis, revealing new pharmacological targets for treating melanoma. In fact, it has become clear that targeting mitochondrial function could be a highly effective approach for melanoma therapy. Several compounds directed against mitochondrial proteins have shown promise in preclinical studies, although translating these findings into clinical applications remains challenging; currently, only a few of these agents are in early-stage clinical trials. The use of next-generation technologies, such as metabolic profiling and single-cell sequencing, will likely provide further insights into the mechanisms controlling mitochondrial metabolism in melanoma. These technologies could enable more personalized and less toxic treatment options, while combining mitochondrial inhibitors with standard targeted and immunotherapeutic therapies could offer a novel strategy for melanoma management.
