Here, we assess whether parity-related reproductive factors impact breast cancer risk independently of each other and other causally related or genetically correlated factors: adiposity, age at menarche, and age at menopause. Methods We used genetic data from UK Biobank for reproductive factors and adiposity, and the Breast Cancer Association Consortium for risk of overall, estrogen receptor (ER) positive and negative breast cancer, and breast cancer subtypes. We applied univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate genetically predicted direct effects of ever parous status, ages at first birth and last birth, and number of births on breast cancer risk. Results We found limited evidence for a genetically predicted protective effect of an earlier age at first birth on breast cancer risk. While the univariable analysis revealed later age at first birth decreased ER-negative breast cancer risk (odds ratio (OR): 0.76; 95% confidence interval: 0.61, 0.95 per standard deviation (SD) increase in age at first birth), this effect attenuated with separate adjustment for age at menarche (potential confounder) (OR: 0.83; 0.62, 1.06) and age at menopause (genetically correlated factor) (OR: 0.80; 0.66, 1.01). Furthermore, we found evidence that a later age at first birth decreased HER2-enriched breast cancer risk but only after adjusting for number of births (potential mediator) (OR: 0.28; 0.11, 0.57 per SD increase in age at first birth). In the multivariable analysis, we found little evidence for genetically predicted effects of ever-parous status, age at last birth, or number of births on breast cancer risk; however, analyses of ever-parous status and age at last birth were limited by weak instruments. Conclusions This study found minimal evidence of a genetically predicted protective effect of earlier age at first birth on breast cancer risk, while identifying some evidence for a genetically predicted adverse effect on ER-negative breast cancer risk. However, weak instruments limited the multivariable analysis of ever parous status and age at last birth, which may be improved with larger sample sizes.

Mendelian randomization (MR), a method less likely to be affected by confounding and reverse causation [ 17 18 19 20 20 19 It is currently unclear how each reproductive event affects risk in isolation since these traits are highly correlated with, and/or causally linked to, other reproductive factors as well as age at menarche and menopause, and adiposity measures [ 21 22 23 24 25 26 19 27 33 30 33 34 35 Aims We aimed to use univariable and multivariable MR methods to evaluate whether the observational evidence that an earlier age at first birth and ever having children decreases breast cancer risk is supported by causal inference methodology. Additionally, we aimed to assess the effects of age at last birth and number of children birthed on breast cancer risk. We further aimed to investigate whether effects are independent of age at menarche and menopause, and adiposity measures as well as the other parity-related reproductive factors, and whether effects differ for ER-positive compared to ER-negative breast cancer. Furthermore, based on these findings, we aimed to assess the effects of reproductive factors on the risk of breast cancer subtypes. Methods UK Biobank The UK Biobank study is a large population-based cohort of 502,682 individuals who were recruited at ages 37–73 years across the UK between 2006 and 2010. The study includes extensive health and lifestyle questionnaire data, physical measures, and biological samples from which genetic data has been generated. The study protocol is available online, and more details have been published elsewhere [ 36 Reproductive factors The reproductive factors investigated in this study were: age at first live birth, age at last live birth, number of live births, and parous status (ever/never given birth at the time of assessment). We will refer to these factors when in groups or subgroups as primary exposures hereafter. To identify genetic variants robustly related to each of the reproductive factors, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for each reproductive factor among women in the UK Biobank. Further details can be found in Additional File 1 [ 37 39 Additional variables We additionally included age at menarche and menopause, and adiposity measures in childhood and adulthood. We will refer to these factors as adjustment variables when in groups or subgroups. Further details on how these variables are defined can be found in Additional File 1 [ 37 44 We performed GWAS for age at menarche and menopause among women in the UK Biobank similarly to the primary exposures as stated above. We obtained female-only GWAS summary statistics for childhood and adulthood body size from Richardson et al. (2020), where they performed GWAS using a similar approach [ 42 Breast cancer association consortium Overall (33,384 cases and 113,789 controls), ER-positive (69,501 cases and 105,974 controls), ER-negative (21,468 and 105,974 controls), HER2-enriched (718 cases and 20,815 controls), and triple-negative (2006 cases and 20,815 controls) breast cancer risk GWAS summary statistics were obtained from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). [ 45 46 45 46 Genetic correlation Genetic correlations between the primary exposures, adjustment variables, and breast cancer risk outcomes were calculated using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and the UK Biobank, and BCAC GWAS summary statistics [ 47 48 47 49 Prior to MR analyses, GWAS estimates for age at first birth, age at last birth, and number of births were standardized based on the standard deviation of the phenotypic exposure (mean: 0 and SD: 1). Further details on the analysis performed and functions used can be found in Additional File 1 [ 18 25 26 38 50 55 SNPs selected for MR analyses Five SNPs were robustly associated with ever-parous status, 43 with age at first birth, and 10 with both age at last birth and number of births.

We additionally performed UVMR on the primary exposures that appear to have an effect on the risk of ER-negative breast cancer, on ER-negative breast cancer subtypes (HER2-enriched and triple-negative). Mendelian randomization has three main assumptions: the relevance assumption states the genetic variants instrumented are associated with the exposure of interest; the independence assumption states the genetic variants and outcome under investigation do not share any common causes; the exclusion restriction assumption states that the instrumented genetic variants do not affect the outcomes via any pathway other than the exposure being examined, i.e., there are no pleiotropic effects [ 53 To evaluate whether the genetic instruments were robustly associated with each primary exposure, we determined the mean F 53 F 58 59 60 61 60 52 Multivariable analysis Given the evidence for genetic correlation and causal relationship between the primary exposures and additional variables, we performed MVMR to evaluate the direct causal effect of the primary exposures on overall, ER-positive, and ER-negative breast cancer risk. We additionally performed MVMR of the primary exposures that appeared to have an effect on risk of ER-negative breast cancer, on breast cancer subtypes (HER2-enriched and triple-negative). Previous research has identified genetic correlation and causal relationships between the primary exposures, other established and potential breast cancer risk factors, and breast cancer risk. The causal relationships are demonstrated in Fig. 1 21 22 25 Fig. 1 Causal relationships estimated using Mendelian randomization in previous work (Vabistsevits et al. (2022) [ 19 21 22 42 We adjusted for the adjustment variables shown in Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Variables included in multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses It is worth noting that the ever-parous status phenotype was derived from the number of births, and therefore the two variables were not included in a multivariable model together. It may seem implausible to adjust for ever parous status in the analysis of age at first and last birth on breast cancer risk since these events only occur in women who have given birth and therefore ever parous status could not observationally confound or mediate this relationship. However, a recent study has shown that performing MR without adjusting for a factor that was conditioned on in one of the exposure or outcome GWAS can bias the resulting MR estimate, and adjusting for that factor can allow estimation of direct effects [ 62 We evaluated the instrument strength in the multivariable analysis using a conditional F 63 Q 54 Q 54 We did not use this method when the F 54 Q 55 64 Results UK Biobank Two hundred seventy-three thousand two hundred thirty-eight women from UK Biobank were included.

In the multivariable analysis, the conditional F Q 4 Age at first birth We identified little evidence for an effect of age at first birth on overall breast cancer risk (UVMR OR: 1.00, 95% CI 0.85, 1.18); however, adjusting for ever parous status (genetically correlated factor) revealed an inverse effect (MVMR estimated using Q Q Q Q 4 Age at last birth We found little evidence for an effect of age at last birth on overall (UVMR OR: 0.98; 0.75, 1.29), ER-positive (UVMR OR: 0.97; 0.73, 1.29) and ER-negative (UVMR OR: 0.83; 0.48, 1.45) breast cancer risk in the univariable analysis (Fig. 4 However, we found evidence of an inverse effect of age at last birth adjusting for adulthood body size (potential mediator) on overall (MVMR OR: 0.70; 0.49, 0.99), and ER-negative breast cancer risk (MVMR OR: 0.54; 0.34, 0.87). Stronger evidence for an effect was revealed after adjustment for adulthood body size (potential mediator) in the multivariable analysis of ER-negative breast cancer risk, although instruments were weak (Fig. 4 Number of births We found limited evidence for an effect of number of births on overall (UVMR OR: 0.78; 0.43, 1.41), ER-positive (UVMR OR: 0.78; 0.46, 1.34) or ER-negative breast cancer risk (UVMR OR: 0.73; 0.37, 1.43) in the univariable analysis, with a similar result in the multivariable analyses (Fig. 4 Estrogen receptor negative subtypes Since we found some evidence for an effect of age at first birth on ER-negative breast cancer risk with relatively strong instruments, we investigated the effects of age at first birth on HER2-enriched and triple-negative breast cancer risk in a similar manner as in relation to overall, ER-positive, and ER-negative breast cancer risk. The univariable analysis revealed limited evidence of an effect of age at first birth on HER2-enriched breast cancer risk (UVMR OR: 0.78; 0.47, 1.30), while adjusting for number of births (potential mediator) (MVMR estimated using Q Q Evaluating Mendelian randomization assumptions While there was some consistency between the univariable analysis using the IVW method and the additional MR methods (MR Egger, weighted median and weighted mode), there were inconsistencies in the analysis of ever parous status and age at first birth, which may suggest pleiotropy in these analyses (Additional File 2: Table 7). However, while the MR-PRESSO methods identified some pleiotropic outliers in the univariable analysis, correcting for identified outliers did not appear to change the evidence for effects identified in the initial analysis using the IVW method (Additional File 2: Table 8). The Egger intercept test did not identify evidence for pleiotropy across any relationships investigated (Additional File 2: Table 9). Further details on these analyses are found in Additional File 1. In the multivariable analysis, we identified evidence of heterogeneity with some exceptions (Additional File 1, Additional File 2: Table 10). We performed the multivariable analysis using the MR Egger method to assess for pleiotropy, and the estimates were mostly consistent with the main analysis, although in many cases, the confidence intervals spanned the null. However, there were inconsistencies, suggestive of pleiotropy. The MR Egger method in the multivariable analysis revealed an inverse effect of number of births, adjusted for age at first birth, on overall (OR: 0.49; 0.26, 0.91) and ER-negative breast cancer risk (OR: 0.42; 0.19, 0.91) which was not identified in the main analysis (Additional File 2: Table 11, Additional File 3: Fig. S2). Further details on these analyses are found in Additional File 1, Additional File 3: Fig. S3–S5. Where we identified an effect of age at first birth on HER2-enriched breast cancer risk in the multivariable IVW analysis, wide confidence intervals mostly included the null using the MR Egger method. We additionally identified minimal evidence for an effect of age at first birth on triple-negative breast cancer risk in the MVMR analysis using the MR Egger method, similarly to the IVW method (Additional File 2: Table 11). Discussion In this study, we used Mendelian randomization methods to investigate the role of parity-related reproductive factors on breast cancer risk. While univariable analysis revealed evidence to support that having children has a protective effect on breast cancer risk, we could not determine the direct effect independently of other reproductive factors and adiposity measures due to the analysis being subject to weak instruments across the multivariable models. It may be that a larger GWAS of ever parous status is required to identify a higher number of robustly associated SNPs and increase instrument strength. Similar to previous studies, we found little evidence to support a protective effect of an earlier age at first birth on breast cancer risk in our univariable analysis [ 19 20 We did, however, identify that an earlier age at first birth leads to increased overall breast cancer risk after adjusting for ever parous status (genetically correlated factor), and in the ER status stratified analyses, we also find evidence of this effect on ER-negative breast cancer risk, but not in relation to ER-positive breast cancer risk. This inverse effect of later age at first birth on ER-negative breast cancer risk attenuated somewhat with adjustment for age at menarche (potential confounder) and menopause (potential mediator), where confidence intervals crossed the null. While age at menarche might be a true confounder of this relationship and age at menopause may be a true mediator, the attenuation of this effect in both multivariable MR models may also be explained by shared genetic confounding. This is particularly likely in the case of age at menopause, given the positive indirect effect that may occur via age at menopause highlighted in Fig. 1 3 When evaluating the HER2-enriched and triple-negative subtypes, we found that, after adjustment for number of births (potential mediator) and ever parous status (genetically correlated factor), an earlier age at first birth increases HER2-enriched but not triple-negative breast cancer risk. Since ER-negative breast cancer is typically seen in premenopausal women, increased risk from an earlier first pregnancy is more likely to be related to ER-negative breast cancer. The effect of age at first birth on HER2-enriched breast cancer risk that we find could be due to an increased risk of HER2 mutations during pregnancy, leading to HER2 overexpression, driving the development of breast cancer [ 65 6 Previous observational research has identified that having an age at first birth at or younger than 25 is associated with a lower level of estrogen post-menopause compared to nulliparous women [ 66 Point estimates identified in the univariable analysis of age at last birth, and across the multivariable models suggest an adverse effect of a younger age at last birth on ER-negative breast cancer risk, which is consistent with a previous univariable MR study [ 20 8 15 Although it may seem implausible to adjust for ever parous status in the analysis of age at first and last birth on breast cancer risk, we highlight the importance of this adjustment in the methods section to avoid bias as described by Gilbody et al. [ 62 Due to weak instruments, we cannot make any definitive conclusions regarding age at last birth or ever parous status for most multivariable models. Where instruments were at least slightly stronger, with an F Q We find limited evidence that the number of births has an impact on breast cancer risk, which is consistent with a previous MR study [ 19 We used the MR Egger method to assess for evidence of pleiotropy; for the most part, this method revealed similar evidence to the main analysis. In addition, using the MR Egger method, adjusting for age at first birth uncovered evidence that a higher number of children leads to reduced overall and ER-negative breast cancer risk. While this suggests the main analysis may be biased by pleiotropy, the instrument strength was deemed weak in the multivariable analyses, which limited confidence in these results and prevented further assessment of pleiotropy using robust methods [ 67 Strengths The main strength of this study is the use of a multivariable approach allowing the evaluation of direct effects of reproductive factors on breast cancer risk. This has been informed by established genetic correlations and causal relationships between the reproductive factors of interest and other reproductive factors and adiposity measures [ 21 22 Additionally, this study uses the UK Biobank study, which has phenotypic and genetic data on a large number of individuals, which increases the likelihood of identifying strong genetic instruments for each exposure of interest. Another strength is the use of GWAS data from the BCAC consortium, allowing the investigation of the risk of breast cancer by ER status and the risk of breast cancer subtypes. Limitations This study has a number of limitations that should be considered when interpreting results. Firstly, weak instruments were a key limitation in the analysis of age at last birth and ever parous status. This can be attributed to the genetic correlation that is present between these traits and the other factors included in the multivariable analyses [ 21 Q F Secondly, as previously mentioned, we may not find a protective effect of an early age at first birth on breast cancer risk because of biases due to violations of the MR assumptions. It is plausible that we may be capturing residual pleiotropic effects as a result of age at menarche confounding the relationship between age at first birth and breast cancer risk. The univariable analysis reveals little evidence for an effect of age at first birth on ER-positive breast cancer risk, while the effect in the multivariable analysis, adjusted for age at menarche, is larger in the protective direction, although confidence intervals crossed the null. Given the conditional F Thirdly, the reproductive factors were self-reported, which can be unreliable. However, we can be relatively confident that reports of age at first and last birth and number of births are accurate since these are significant life events that are likely to be reliably recalled. Additionally, there has typically been good replication of the genetic scores for the reproductive traits in other cohorts [ 68 69 70 In addition, since the reproductive factors investigated in this study are bio-social, findings may not be generalizable to other non-UK populations that have different social norms. Additionally, the findings may not be generalizable to younger populations. It would have been valuable to compare the findings in the study, where the population was predominately European, to populations with other ancestries such as Asian and African. However, while Asian and African ancestry GWAS summary statistics for breast cancer risk are available, those for the four reproductive factors investigated here are not, to the best of our knowledge. While the reproductive factors examined in this study are in part underpinned by social mechanisms, there is evidence for heritability of these traits, giving biological plausibility to the genetic variants used in this study. Mills et al. (2021) reported a heritability estimate for age at first birth of 22% (CI: 19, 25) for women born in 1965, an increase from the previous years [ 71 72 73 73 Finally, the MR analysis performed assumes a constant effect of age at first and last birth, and number of births, on breast cancer risk. Future studies could use MR to evaluate the effects of an early age at first birth compared to an average and late age, and vice versa. This approach would also enable the evaluation of whether there is a cross-over point where breast cancer risk changes from parous women to nulliparous women at a certain age at first birth as previously proposed [ 12 Conclusions Using a series of Mendelian randomization analyses, we found minimal evidence for a protective effect of early age at first birth on breast cancer risk that has been previously identified, which may be due to unmeasured biases in previous observational studies. On the other hand, we identify some evidence of an adverse effect on ER-negative breast cancer risk, which supports the notion that there is an immediate increase in breast cancer risk post-pregnancy. Understanding the mechanism behind ER-negative breast cancers is important since they have worse prognosis compared with those that are ER-positive. Future studies considering non-linear relationships between age at first birth and breast cancer risk may provide additional insights. In addition, we show the number of births that women have has little effect on breast cancer risk. While our findings for ever parous status and age at last birth do not all concur with the existing literature from non-genetic studies, this may partly be due to limitations of the multivariable Mendelian randomization approach, specifically relating to weak conditional instrument strength, which may be overcome with larger GWAS of these traits.
