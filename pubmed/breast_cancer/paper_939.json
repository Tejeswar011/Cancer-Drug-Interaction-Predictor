Introduction The field of recombinant therapeutic proteins has experienced a substantial evolution and growth since the advent of technological innovations based on recombinant DNA, which facilitates the combination of genetic material for the design of different varieties of proteins [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Traditionally, therapeutic formulations include a buffer system to control pH, in addition to stabilizers (e.g., sugars, amino acids), surfactants, and salts [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 In recent years, there has been a notable paradigm shift towards the use of buffer-free formulations, aiming to optimize protein stability while minimizing immunogenicity and adverse reactions observed with conventional buffer-containing formulations [ 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 However, one of the biggest drawbacks with this type of drugs is the high cost of treatments based on these proteins, which can make it unattainable for many low-income patients throughout the world [ 39 40 41 42 43 26 44 33 45 21 25 24 46 However, it should be noted that a critical element is related to the complexities inherent in patented formulations, which often complicates the dissemination of knowledge about formulations in the field of recombinant therapeutic proteins and their respective biosimilars [ 7 47 48 49 22 50 51 52 53 54 55 A fundamental aspect that must be addressed in the production of both recombinant therapeutic proteins and biosimilars derived from these recombinant therapeutic proteins is related to strict regulations, which are essential in the development and approval of new therapeutic proteins [ 22 27 56 57 14 49 25 58 59 60 Regulatory frameworks established by leading agencies, such as the FDA and EMA, are critical to assessing the safety of formulation components, including excipients and impurities. These regulatory frameworks establish traditional toxicological assessments and methodologies related to computational modeling and risk assessment approaches and artificial intelligence [ 22 27 61 62 63 64 62 65 66 27 67 This article provides, based on a comprehensive documentary analysis of scientific literature, a critical and updated review of formulation technologies applied to recombinant therapeutic proteins. This review focuses on the development, application, and evaluation of buffer-free formulations with a comparative perspective between buffered and non-buffered formulations. Throughout this review, buffer-free/self-buffering’ refers to final drug product designs feasible mainly at high protein concentrations; this approach does not apply to upstream cell culture/expression and is not universally suitable at low concentrations. The Progressive Transition from traditional buffered formulations to Minimal approaches based on protein Self-Buffered Excipients and strategically selected excipients, the regulations governing these formulations (FDA/EMA), and intellectual property rights (patents). It also delves into the importance and safety impact of commonly used excipients in buffered and non-buffered formulations (amino acids, sugars, polyols, surfactants, and antioxidants), classifying them according to their toxicological profile and regulatory approval for parenteral use. From a regulatory perspective, the requirements imposed by agencies such as the FDA and the EMA are examined, highlighting the growing acceptance of simplified formulations, provided comparability in quality, safety, and immunogenicity is demonstrated, especially in the context of biosimilars. A detailed discussion on the legal and intellectual property implications faced by developers is included, given the limited transparency in the disclosure of formulations protected by expired patents. Finally, an analytical compendium of FDA and EMA-approved formulations for recombinant therapeutic proteins between 2020 and 2025 is presented, highlighting emblematic cases, innovations in excipients, and patterns of transition to buffer-free formulations. These trends are contextualized in relation to emerging technological platforms and current industrial challenges in biomanufacturing, purification, and scale-up. 2. Documentary Methodology Since this research is a review, it is not necessary to describe the methodology as such, but for greater clarification on the selection of the different documents and to proceed with their validation, a framework of the different steps used in the documentary review is provided. It starts from a documentary bibliographic search focused on the identified keywords. The methodology framework is adapted from the document review process (PSALSAR) and specifically refined for recombinant therapeutic protein formulations, with an emphasis on buffer-free strategies, regulatory aspects, and intellectual property [ 68 69 The methodology steps are divided into six sections, which are explained below. ○ Protocol Definition: Defines clear research objectives, focusing on buffer-free formulations, regulatory guidelines (FDA, EMA), safety profiles, and intellectual property challenges. ○ Document Search: Systematic search of scientific databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science), patent databases (USPTO, EPO, Derwent), regulatory databases (FDA Drugs@FDA, EMA EPAR) and complementary searches in Google Scholar. Coverage from 2020 to 2025. ○ Critical evaluation: Selection and quality assessment of sources according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, which can be seen in Table 1 ○ Content Synthesis: Extraction and synthesis of relevant information in structured tables and descriptive sections, organized by topics: technological innovation, formulation strategies, excipient safety, regulatory compliance, and intellectual property challenges. ○ Analytical Interpretation: Comparative analysis of buffered and unbuffered formulations, technological platforms, excipient classification, and regulatory trends. ○ Report Generation: Manuscript development, including sections such as introduction, detailed methodology, results, in-depth discussion, and clearly articulated conclusions. Furthermore, Table 2 The methodological process began with an exploratory phase based on the research objective, in which representative keywords of the thematic domain addressed in this systematic review were defined. These keywords were selected for their high scientific relevance, their ability to effectively delimit the study universe, and their methodological usefulness in establishing inclusion and exclusion criteria, in accordance with the principles of transparency and reproducibility established by the PRISMA methodology. To guarantee effective and specific document retrieval during the identification phase, a set of strategic keywords was defined that allowed the search to be precisely and systematically guided through scientific databases and search engines with high scientific visibility such as Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct and Google Scholar, Core Collections, Science Direct, Compendex, Derwent, Google Scholar, Innovation Index, and GeoIndex. These sources were complemented by interdisciplinary research tools that expanded the coverage and precision of the results obtained. To this end, both controlled and uncontrolled terms were integrated using Boolean operators and truncation strategies. The keywords used were: “Recombinant therapeutic proteins”; “buffer-free formulations”; “buffer formulations”; “protein formulation strategies”; “high-concentration subcutaneous biologics”; “regulation frameworks”; “Food and Drug Administration (FDA)”; “European Medicines Agency (EMA)”; “excipient safety classification”; “immunogenicity”; “biosimilars”; “biosimilar formulation”; “pharmaceutical innovation”; “Intellectual property strategies (IP)”. Each of these words was selected for its relevance using “AND” and “OR”, to capture the central dynamics of the study objective, covering regulatory, technological, clinical and legal aspects related to the development and formulation of biosimilars. Likewise, they were formulated in English to maximize coverage in the high-visibility scientific databases used [ 27 The documentary strategy included a systematic review that resulted in a repository of 1932 documents (28 from websites). This repository seeks not only to offer a representative sample of the state of the art on the research topic but also to integrate perspectives from different disciplines with an emphasis on the formulation of biosimilars in the current and future biopharmaceutical context. The review process incorporates a flow chart depicted in Figure 1 Table 3 Advantages of this “documentary methodology”: Systematic Rigor: Structured and reproducible steps ensure methodological transparency and reliability. Holistic Integration: Combines technologies, regulatory, safety, and intellectual property perspectives into one comprehensive review. Analytical Depth: Allows for in-depth comparative analysis, identifying critical trends and future research needs. Flexibility and Applicability: Adaptable across related fields within pharmaceutical development, enabling consistent analytical standards and expanding the potential for future research. 3. Recombinant Therapeutic Proteins Recombinant therapeutic proteins have occupied a prominent place in the biopharmaceutical sector since the approval of recombinant insulin in 1982 [ 70 5 22 71 55 33 3.1. Mechanisms of Expression of Recombinant Proteins At the core of the production of recombinant proteins is the genetically modified DNA that encodes the target polypeptide [ 72 73 74 75 76 1 77 E. coli 78 3.2. Host Organisms in Protein Production The choice of host organism plays a fundamental role in the efficiency of recombinant protein expression. In this regard, E. coli 79 80 81 82 83 84 E. coli 41 The E. coli 81 85 86 87 E. coli 88 89 E. coli 90 71 91 92 93 94 The efficiency of recombinant protein expression does not depend solely on the structural design of the expression vectors, but is also significantly influenced by the biological characteristics of the selected host system [ 95 96 E. coli 71 97 98 99 100 71 101 3.3. Advances in Analytical Methodologies for Recombinant Therapeutic Proteins Analytical methodologies for obtaining recombinant therapeutic proteins are essential to improve their stability and efficacy, while seeking to understand the complex interactions between proteins, excipients, and the patient’s immune system [ 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 38 114 115 116 117 Eliminating buffers in recombinant therapeutic protein formulations arises from the desire to reduce the complexity of the formulation matrix while decreasing interactions that lead to immune activation [ 19 102 55 118 119 120 37 3.4. Advances in Bioprocessing and Purification Advances in bioprocessing and purification have highlighted the importance of controlling host cell impurities and other contaminants that can arise during the production of recombinant therapeutic proteins [ 121 122 123 124 12 29 125 The transition to these simplified formulations marks a significant operational advancement that improves biological manufacturing capacity while aligning with cost-effective production strategies [ 126 127 128 129 130 130 21 28 3.5. Advantages of Recombinant Proteins The application of recombinant proteins has significantly impacted various fields of life sciences and medicine [ 5 73 131 132 133 Recombinant proteins also facilitate the study of protein function, structure, and interactions, thus contributing to a deeper understanding of biological processes [ 134 6 135 136 It is a fact that the pharmaceutical industry has greatly benefited from the versatility of recombinant proteins in the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents [ 137 138 92 139 3.6. Innovative Applications and Platforms in the Pharmaceutical Industry The most prominent use of recombinant proteins in industry includes monoclonal antibodies, which specifically target antigens associated with diseases, offering specific treatment options for conditions such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and infectious diseases [ 140 In addition to antibodies, other recombinant proteins, such as enzymes and hormones, have contributed significantly to therapeutic practices [ 141 E. coli 6 142 143 144 145 146 The development and refinement of recombinant protein technologies also drives personalized medicine, an evolving field where treatments are tailored to the individual characteristics of each patient [ 11 146 147 79 The confluence of formulation chemistry, immunology, and protein engineering has led to some “breakthrough platforms”, those designed to generate recombinant therapeutic proteins with PD and PK profiles. Table 4 19 148 Innovative Platforms for Generating Recombinant Therapeutic Proteins with Improved PD and PK Platforms for generating Recombinant Therapeutic Proteins with improved PD and PK essentially refer to technological systems or strategies that combine advances in formulation chemistry, immunology, and protein engineering to optimize the functioning of therapeutic proteins in the body and their duration [ 160 161 162 163 164 165 146 Some of the main innovative platforms used and grouped by technological category are: Protein Engineering Platforms Protein engineering platforms modify the structure of therapeutic proteins to achieve desired PD and PK properties. For example, recent strategies have focused on the use of deep mutational scanning and CRISPR techniques to design proteins with increased stability and bioactivity, which facilitates improved therapeutic outcomes [ 166 167 168 169 Table 5 Chemical formulation platforms. The formulation chemistry is critical for the stability and delivery of recombinant proteins [ 102 170 171 172 Table 6 Advanced Management Systems Advanced delivery systems facilitate controlled release and targeted delivery of therapeutic proteins to specific tissues, improving their efficacy and reducing side effects. Platforms using genetically modified bacteria have shown promise in drug delivery, as these bacteria can autonomously release therapeutic agents in response to specific environmental triggers [ 173 174 Table 7 Immunology-Based Platforms Immune modifications are crucial to optimizing the safety and efficacy profile of treatments. Proteins. For example, the use of synthetic receptors and modified immune cells enhances the immune response to cancer therapies, thereby improving treatment outcomes [ 175 176 177 Table 8 Synthetic Biology and Next-Generation Engineering Platforms Synthetic biology integrates diverse engineering disciplines to create multifunctional biological systems capable of producing recombinant proteins with improved properties. Recent advances include the use of modular genetic circuits that allow for more precise control of gene expression, thereby influencing the dynamics of protein production [ 166 178 179 180 181 Table 9 The technological advances of these innovative platforms are revolutionizing the landscape of the development of recombinant therapeutic proteins, offering safer and more effective treatment options for various diseases. Table 10 4. Immunogenicity, Excipients, and Differences Between Buffered and Unbuffered Formulations It is important to distinguish and distinguish between “unbuffered” and simply “citrate-free” or “phosphate-free.” Many modern formulations eliminate phosphate or citrate buffers, but replace them with alternative pH stabilizers such as histidine or acetate. These products are buffered but with a different agent. 4.1. Buffered Formulations In conventional buffered formulations, a buffering agent is added to maintain a balanced pH that optimizes stability and solubility over the shelf life of the product [ 182 183 184 185 186 187 19 188 2 189 190 191 192 193 188 187 194 195 182 18 196 Table 11 4.1.1. Comparative Stability of Buffered vs. Buffer-Free (Self-Buffering) Formulations Buffered systems maintain pH within narrow ranges and often minimize pH-driven degradation when the setpoint is close to the protein’s minimum-aggregation pH. However, specific buffers can introduce stress-linked liabilities, for example, phosphate crystallization on freeze, thaw with local pH shifts and citrate-associated opalescence in particular contexts. In contrast, buffer-free/self-buffering drug products reduce ionic-strength-driven interactions and may show equal or lower aggregation and opalescence under agitation and freeze–thaw, especially at high protein concentration. Their limitation is the lack of extrinsic buffering capacity, which places a premium on (i) precise initial pH set during manufacture, (ii) vigilant control of storage and headspace CO 2 189 190 4.1.2. Immunogenicity in Buffered Formulations The formulation of recombinant therapeutic proteins has originally been based on established buffer systems (phosphate, histidine, citrate/acetate, etc.) combined with stabilizers (sugars, polyols, surfactants) to maintain pH, prevent aggregation, degradation, and ensure isotonicity [ 27 37 119 197 198 28 33 The risk of immunogenicity is primarily due to aggregates/impurities and the effects of excipients, rather than the binary presence/absence of buffers. The implications of immunogenicity in the field of recombinant therapeutic proteins are critical, as small changes in formulation can lead to significant variations in clinical outcomes [ 67 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 198 207 Innovative strategies to reduce the immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins are constantly evolving. Some research highlights different techniques to address the risk of immunogenicity, such as rational design approaches that use nanoparticles to modify the immune response [ 146 208 54 21 201 4.2. Buffer-Free Formulations The evolution of recombinant therapeutic protein formulations is toward unbuffered proteins. This refers to the ability to express a protein without additional buffer salts, relying on its own buffering capacity or other harmless excipients to maintain pH [ 27 209 182 210 211 212 213 27 182 214 215 Recent studies indicate that buffer-free formulations can achieve comparable stability and activity in certain recombinant therapeutic proteins [ 102 216 1 27 217 Constant innovation in the formulation of technologies allows the effective elimination of traditional buffers without sacrificing product efficacy or stability [ 218 14 219 54 129 220 However, it is important to emphasize that, as buffer-free formulations are adopted, potential drawbacks related to immunogenicity and long-term protein stability must also be considered [ 102 46 221 222 146 223 Some of the advantages and a description of the potential benefits of buffer-free formulations are included in Table 12 4.3. Excipients and Safety Profile of Buffer-Free Formulations There is a transition towards a better understanding of the mechanisms that drive immunogenicity, with particular attention to the role of excipients and contaminants in therapeutic formulations [ 37 224 119 48 50 54 Incorporation of innovative polymeric excipients into buffer-free formulations is emerging as an important strategy to achieve protein stabilization without traditional buffers [ 225 226 227 228 102 Table 13 4.4. Traditional Buffered Formulations vs. Innovative Unbuffered Formulations The classification of recombinant therapeutic proteins requires a detailed understanding of their mechanisms of action and their formulation contexts [ 103 27 119 229 On the other hand, Table 14 In established formulations, such as those of monoclonal antibodies, particular attention has been paid to their in vivo behavior and the role of the physicochemical properties that affect PK. The approval of these therapeutic agents often depends on the demonstration that changes in formulation, such as those caused by buffer removal, do not adversely affect crucial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties [ 185 230 231 Table 15 4.5. Buffer-Free Formulations in Biosimilars The shift towards buffer-free formulations also presents an interesting avenue for research into biosimilars [ 22 27 129 33 48 50 33 232 Biosimilars are biological drugs that are very similar to an approved reference biological product, without clinically significant differences in efficacy or safety and whose patent protection has expired [ 26 27 21 233 234 ® 235 In recent years, several recombinant therapeutic protein biosimilars have adopted buffer-free (or specifically citrate-free) formulations, especially in fields such as immunology and endocrinology, to improve patient experience and differentiate them from reference products [ 236 5 24 27 43 4.6. Understanding Biosimilars Through Some Examples Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO): rHuEPO is commonly used for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease. Following the expiration of the rHuEPO patent, multiple biosimilars have emerged, such as epoetin alfa and darbepoetin alfa [ 237 238 Etanercept and its biosimilars: Another critical case study involves biosimilars of etanercept, a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor widely used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis [ 239 240 241 Adalimumab: This represents another important biological agent for which several biosimilars have been developed [ 242 81 243 4.6.1. Analytical Strategies in the Development of Biosimilars. Cost-Effectiveness Effective analytical strategies are crucial to establish the similarity of biosimilars to reference biologics. Techniques such as mass spectrometry, chromatography, and peptide mapping are commonly employed to identify and compare physicochemical and functional attributes that determine biological activity [ 244 22 27 245 Regarding the cost-effectiveness of biosimilars and their impact on the market, their introduction significantly impacts pharmaceutical expenditure and market dynamics [ 246 27 247 248 24 249 4.6.2. Recombinant Proteins Approved Between 2020 and July 2025 Adalimumab biosimilar is a Buffer-free formulation and the most prominent example in immunology. In the monoclonal antibody (mAb) category, adalimumab was one of the first cases where the buffer (citrate) was eliminated to alleviate injection pain [ 57 250 251 On the other hand, Table 16 EMA Status (EPAR #; Authorization Date), where EPAR #: The European Medicines Agency’s “European Public Assessment Report” number for that product. Authorization Date is the date on which the EMA (via a European Commission decision) granted the marketing authorization in the EU. The Authorization In this context, the common name or international nonproprietary name (INN) of the active ingredient is used, i.e., the official chemical or pharmacological name of the medicine, while the “brand name” (or trade name) is the commercial name under which the company markets it. 5. IP Rights in the Protection of Recombinant and Biosimilar Therapeutic Proteins IP related to the development and commercialization of recombinant therapeutic proteins is a key element in protecting the knowledge generated by the manufacturers of these proteins. However, protection of IP rights, primarily through patents, can also pose significant barriers to collaborative research and, in some cases, hinder the advancement and development of innovations [ 252 253 254 27 255 24 256 5.1. IP Rights—Importance of Patents Intellectual property rights, particularly patents, play an essential role in protecting innovations in recombinant protein formulations. Patents can cover various aspects of biological products, such as specific genetic sequences, production methods, formulations, and new therapeutic uses [ 27 257 27 129 The characteristics of recombinant proteins, including their biosimilarity to reference products, are based on several compositional factors, such as excipients and stabilizers [ 33 14 219 22 32 Due to these high risks, a systematic examination of existing patents and scientific literature becomes essential to better understand patented formulations and formulation technologies used within the biopharmaceutical industry [ 14 27 258 219 49 129 Barriers to Information Exchange Strict patent protection can inhibit collaborative information sharing between researchers and formulators, limiting access to critical data on formulations and processes [ 259 260 Biosimilar developers face numerous challenges in navigating the complexities of IP laws that protect patented formulations and methods used in the creation of original biopharmaceuticals [ 255 22 129 60 48 The delicate interaction of IP rights and the competitiveness of biosimilars requires an ongoing dialogue on international harmonization of intellectual property laws and regulations for these medicines to ensure that regulations encourage innovation rather than stifle it [ 255 261 46 223 6. Regulations (FDA–EMA) Involved in the Development and Approval of Recombinant and Biosimilar Therapeutic Proteins Frameworks are essential due to the need for complete transparency on the safety of new recombinant therapeutic protein formulations and biosimilars that may be approved to enter the pharmaceutical market [ 22 27 1 The development and approval processes for recombinant proteins and their biosimilars are highly influenced by strict regulatory measures from agencies such as the FDA and EMA, which are essential to ensure the safety and efficacy of products in important markets such as the United States and Europe [ 56 65 262 21 236 263 These regulatory agencies have promoted strict guidelines to ensure that biosimilars offer an efficacy and safety profile comparable to that of their reference products [ 264 33 6.1. Regulatory Challenges in the Development of Recombinant Therapeutic Protein Formulations Regarding the safety profiles of the formulations, it is evident that they play a crucial role in determining clinical efficacy and defining regulatory approval pathways [ 146 265 33 1 59 266 14 219 32 129 49 60 48 201 204 50 6.2. Regulatory Overview of Recombinant and Biosimilar Proteins—FDA and EMA The FDA and EMA are responsible for ensuring the safety, efficacy, and quality of new recombinant therapeutic proteins and biosimilars [ 265 267 268 The FDA’s Biosimilar User Fee Act (BSUFA) facilitates the biosimilar review process, while the EMA guidelines define criteria for demonstrating biosimilarity to reference products [ 25 262 269 33 259 270 27 271 272 273 270 22 259 271 274 275 276 1 6.3. Approval Processes for Recombinant Proteins and Biosimilars Although developers disclose some formulation components during drug approval processes, as is the case with the FDA or EMA, the full details often remain confidential, with strict industry regulations protecting this sensitive information [ 22 33 1 27 The formulation of these therapeutic agents is particularly complex due to the multifaceted nature of the proteins involved, and their stability is influenced by many factors, including environmental conditions, concentration levels, pH, and the presence of excipients [ 102 277 21 14 Despite the importance of formulation knowledge in the development of recombinant therapeutic proteins and biosimilars, there remains a notable lack of transparency when it comes to disclosing detailed formulation components. Although biopharmaceutical developers are required to submit formulation data to regulatory bodies such as the FDA and EMA during the approval process, the sensitive nature of this information often leads to a reluctance to disclose details [ 27 219 223 278 Recent advances in analytical methodologies have developed a more nuanced understanding of the complex interactions facilitated by excipients and their effect on protein behavior [ 279 26 280 281 282 283 The FDA and EMA have established strict guidelines to ensure that biosimilars demonstrate an efficacy and safety profile comparable to that of their reference products, which promotes confidence in their therapeutic equivalence [ 59 14 219 284 6.4. Regulation of Excipients The selection of specific active ingredients allowed in recombinant protein formulations as well as in biosimilars is a meticulous process influenced by different regulations [ 5 146 265 Regulators classify excipients according to their prior use and safety for buffered and unbuffered recombinant protein formulations [ 285 286 27 28 25 287 288 7. Discussion and Conclusions 7.1. Discussion The advancement of formulation strategies in the pharmaceutical sector, particularly the transition to buffer-free systems for recombinant therapeutic proteins, has important implications for the addressing of immunogenicity and improving therapeutic efficacy. This transition is especially crucial in the development of biosimilars, where even small variations in formulation can significantly influence patient outcomes and the overall success of therapies. The meticulous design of pharmaceutical formulations is crucial not only to stabilize proteins, but also to minimize aggregation, a phenomenon closely linked to increased immunogenicity [ 27 289 Buffer-free formulations have emerged as a preferred alternative, showing profound benefits in stabilizing therapeutic proteins and reducing injection site reactions, as demonstrated with adalimumab biosimilars. By eliminating traditional buffers such as citrate, researchers have observed a marked reduction in discomfort in administration, thereby improving the overall patient experience and promoting adherence to treatment [ 290 24 216 291 However, these advances come with complex regulatory and intellectual property challenges that must be addressed to facilitate greater acceptance and implementation of recombinant proteins and biosimilars in healthcare. The evolving landscape requires a regulatory framework that balances intellectual property rights with the need for greater transparency and scientific collaboration. This is crucial in the context of biosimilars, where achieving precise replicability of complex therapeutic proteins is inherently difficult due to their complex nature [ 292 293 Furthermore, studies have shown that the legal and clinical implications of transitioning to buffer-free formulations require a thorough analysis. The proposed frameworks seek to guide future research and industrial development by offering strategies to optimize formulations and thus minimize immunogenic and regulatory challenges [ 294 295 Current challenges surrounding biosimilar immunogenicity underscore the importance of continued research and development, not only to improve patient-centered outcomes but also to ensure rigorous safety protocols during the preclinical and clinical phases of development. The need for educational initiatives targeting healthcare stakeholders is critical to dispel myths about biosimilar safety, thereby fostering a more favorable environment for their adoption in clinical practice [ 293 296 As biopharmaceutical innovations advance, collaboration between academia, industry, and regulatory bodies will be critical to address the numerous challenges associated with biosimilar development. A comprehensive regulatory approach, considering both innovation and patient safety, will be essential to promote the successful integration of these new formulations into therapeutic regimens. Aligning regulatory strategies with scientific innovation will foster an enabling environment for biosimilar market growth, thereby improving patient access to essential therapies [ 297 298 299 The phenomenon of protein aggregation is a major concern in the biopharmaceutical sector, particularly because of its direct implications for the immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins. Aggregation can trigger an immune response by which the body produces antibodies against these proteins, affecting their safety and treatment efficacy, especially in chronic therapies where patient tolerance is crucial [ 27 289 Recent advances in formulation strategies have demonstrated that the elimination of traditional buffers in formulations, as observed with adalimumab biosimilars, can significantly improve patient comfort during administration. This formulation improvement has shown potential to reduce discomfort at the injection site and could ultimately lead to improved patient adherence [ 291 24 Research has extensively documented the interplay between aggregation and immunogenicity, particularly in the context of recombinant proteins. Some studies highlight that even small alterations in protein formulations can lead to significant variations in patient response to therapies, reinforcing the need for rigorous formulation optimization processes [ 216 300 To address these challenges, the development of advanced formulation methodologies, focusing on optimizing the stability of therapeutic peptides in aqueous solutions, has become increasingly relevant [ 26 301 Further investigations into the mechanics of protein stabilization have revealed the crucial importance of specific interactions between excipients. According to Pan et al., studying protein-excipient interactions using advanced techniques, such as hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, can reveal how excipients mitigate aggregation in protein formulations [ 59 Furthermore, it has been recognized that aggregation can reduce therapeutic efficacy and improve immunogenicity, causing many formulations to incorporate surfactants such as polysorbate 20 to stabilize proteins in solution [ 297 292 In addition, modeling techniques have been developed to predict aggregation kinetics based on molecular dynamics simulations, offering new strategies to preemptively identify and contrast potential aggregation risks in therapeutic proteins [ 293 Recent studies underscore a significant shift toward buffer-free formulations in the biopharmaceutical landscape, reflecting a strategic evolution aimed at optimizing therapeutic product compositions while maintaining their integrity and efficacy. This trend is particularly relevant in the context of recombinant therapeutic proteins and biosimilars, where the product formulation can directly influence both the stability and safety profile of these biologics. Simplifying formulation components not only optimizes the manufacturing process, but also promotes improved patient adherence and experience [ 289 As industry adopts buffer-free formulations, advanced analytical methods have become crucial to ensure thorough characterization of these products. These methods allow researchers to assess the comparative stability and safety of various formulations, specifically the risk of immunogenicity [ 25 27 291 Emerging technologies, such as high-throughput screening (HTS) and sophisticated biochemical characterization techniques, play an essential role in this modern formulation strategy. These technologies not only streamline the development process, but also improve the ability to produce robust formulations that withstand physical and chemical stress [ 300 216 301 The integration of these innovative approaches requires the establishment of a rigorous evaluation framework that supports the safety and efficacy claims associated with these new formulations [ 59 297 292 Recent research exemplifies how buffer-less formulations are gaining ground, especially in the development of therapies that require frequent administration. Patient comfort and adherence to therapeutic regimens are critical in chronic treatment protocols, and buffer-less therapeutic protein formulations can result in less pain and a more tolerable injection experience [ 291 293 In addition, special attention is paid to regulatory frameworks that support innovation in formulation practices. Regulatory bodies increasingly recognize the need to adapt their guidelines to reflect emerging evidence supporting buffer-less formulations. These developments require a collaborative dialogue between pharmaceutical developers and regulatory bodies to streamline the approval process while maintaining public safety standards [ 294 27 Immunogenicity remains a key obstacle to the approval and adoption of biosimilars, compounded by the rigorous regulatory review process in jurisdictions. Several studies highlight that demonstrating equivalence to reference products through analytical and functional similarity is crucial for biosimilars. This requires extensive preclinical and clinical evaluations, especially given the complexity of therapeutic proteins [ 25 289 216 291 For biosimilars, regulatory agencies prioritize rigorous equivalence testing standards, reflecting the complex nature of biologics. WHO guidelines emphasize the importance of comprehensive assessments, requiring biosimilars to demons the world-duality attributes comparable to those of their reference products [ 27 296 25 289 295 The regulatory landscape is evolving, but it still faces challenges related to immunogenicity. For example, while progress has been made in establishing parameters for clinical studies, regulatory expectations can be inconsistent. This inconsistency reinforces the need for comprehensive clinical evaluations to detect and quantify immunogenicity [ 26 301 The implications of immunogenicity go beyond simple regulatory hurdles; they significantly affect ‘physicians and patients’ perceptions of biosimilars. Several studies demonstrate that concerns about safety and efficacy impact the willingness of healthcare professionals’ to adopt biosimilars in treatment regimens [ 291 297 292 293 Furthermore, the influence of health policies and economic factors on the adoption of biosimilars cannot be overlooked. The market dynamics, driven by the potential for savings and greater access to biological products, are often contrasted with concerns about immunogenicity [ 294 295 296 302 The acceptance and integration of biosimilars into clinical practice faces significant barriers, primarily due to misconceptions about their safety and efficacy among healthcare professionals. Therefore, it is essential to establish a robust educational framework aimed at various stakeholders, particularly healthcare professionals. Such initiatives can alleviate concerns and foster a more favorable environment for the routine use of biosimilars in clinical settings [ 25 Educational programs should focus on demystifying biosimilars, emphasizing their clinical equivalence to reference products, and describing the rigorous regulatory processes that these treatments require prior to approval. Evidence suggests that increased awareness and understanding among healthcare professionals can improve conversations between patients and healthcare professionals about biosimilars, ultimately contributing to their acceptance. In addition, specialized training and resources should be provided to prescribers and insurers to highlight the economic benefits of biosimilars, which can significantly reduce healthcare costs while maintaining therapeutic effectiveness [ 216 291 The participation of clinicians in educational initiatives is especially crucial, as many healthcare professionals are unfamiliar with biosimilars or hesitant to prescribe them. Abitbol and Chu [ 303 300 Incorporating comprehensive educational tools, such as informative workshops, webinars, and accessible educational materials, could significantly improve understanding. Using a biosimilar portfolio that includes clear explanations of manufacturing processes and clinical data can facilitate informed conversations between healthcare professionals and patients [ 26 The economic landscape surrounding biosimilars further underscores the urgency of educational initiatives. Bas [ 27 291 298 216 The sustainability and accessibility of biosimilars on the market are determined by a complex interplay of scientific, regulatory, and intellectual property considerations. These elements are crucial in addressing the challenges posed by chronic diseases that require biologic therapy. The evolving biosimilar landscape must focus on improving patient access while ensuring product safety and quality throughout the approval process [ 25 27 289 Recent advances in regulatory frameworks have significantly contributed to streamlining biosimilar approval processes, promoting a more inclusive market. Regulatory bodies are adapting to the growing demand for biological products and the need for efficient pathways to facilitate the introduction of biosimilars, while maintaining rigorous standards [ 301 304 216 300 A comprehensive review by Luo et al. [ 305 26 291 300 Some research articulates the need for global cooperation in regulatory standards to improve biosimilar availability, advocating for harmonised practices in jurisdictions to facilitate smoother market entry [ 27 289 Furthermore, continued stakeholder participation, including healthcare professionals, regulatory agencies, and patients, in the educational discourse on biosimilars is critical. Educating healthcare professionals about the scientific basis for biosimilars, their equivalence in safety and efficacy compared to reference products, and the cost benefits they offer could help overcome the current misconceptions [ 59 297 7.2. Conclusions This article highlights how technological innovation, regulatory convergence, and rigorous risk management are driving the evolution of recombinant therapeutic protein formulations, with a specific focus on the shift towards buffer-free systems The rise of buffer-free formulations represents a crucial transformation in pharmaceutical development, driven primarily by the need to improve patient outcomes and optimize manufacturing processes. The interaction between advanced analytical technologies and a rigorous evaluation framework demonstrates a concerted effort to ensure safety and efficacy while fostering innovation in the biopharmaceutical industry. As this trend continues to evolve, the commitment to patient-centered practices will undoubtedly drive further advances in the formulation of therapeutic proteins and biosimilars. In addition, the ICH guidelines play a crucial role in promoting regulatory convergence across different international frameworks, particularly with respect to the evaluation and approval of biosimilars. These guidelines promote a scientific approach that allows for comparability between various biotech products, which is essential for ensuring patient safety and therapeutic efficacy. Specifically, ICH Q5E outlines standards for comparative studies related to biotechnology-derived products, which is instrumental in managing post-approval changes while maintaining product consistency globally [ 289 ICH Q8 emphasizes the principles of Quality by Design (QbD), advocating a flexible approach to pharmaceutical development that improves innovation in formulations [ 26 306 66 With respect to AI and machine learning in biopharmaceutical regulation, the FDA has initiated several programs aimed at harnessing these technologies to enhance the evaluation of biologics. A notable effort is the establishment of the FDA’s Emerging Sciences Working Group, which collaborates with various stakeholders to develop predictive modeling techniques, particularly for key concerns such as protein stability and aggregation [ 307 308 Furthermore, the integration of AI into regulatory processes has shown promise in expediting the evaluation of biosimilar formulations, thereby enhancing access to therapies and potentially reducing healthcare costs [ 295 309 The importance of continuous bioprocessing, sustainable manufacturing practices, and robust educational frameworks should be addressed to improve biosimilar acceptance. These combined efforts position buffer-free recombinant protein formulations as a cornerstone of patient-centered biopharmaceutical innovation. 7.3. Tendencies Emerging trends in the development of recombinant therapeutic proteins are redefining manufacturing and regulatory strategies. Continuous bioprocessing is moving from pilot applications to mainstream adoption, offering shorter production cycles, consistent quality, and reduced costs compared to traditional batch processes. When paired with advanced bioreactor designs, these systems enable real-time process monitoring and tighter control, aligning with industry goals for efficiency and sustainability. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based models can predict product behavior under various environmental conditions, facilitating the optimization of both formulations and manufacturing processes. This innovation is crucial to managing production efficiency and ensuring that therapeutic proteins consistently meet rigorous quality standards [ 25 289 26 300 301 59 297 291 216 A major technological shift is the integration of AI-driven predictive stability models, which forecast protein degradation pathways and optimize formulations without the need for prolonged real-time stability testing. Described AI (XAI) protocols are being developed to improve transparency and regulatory trust, ensuring that AI-generated decisions, such as predicting aggregation risks or refining excipient ratios, are scientifically interpretable [ 293 294 Other innovations gaining traction include eco-friendly excipients, patient-centric delivery systems (e.g., autoinjectors with precision dosing algorithms) and high-throughput screening platforms coupled with artificial intelligence to accelerate the optimization of the purification process. On the regulatory side, agencies such as the FDA and EMA are piloting adaptive review processes that incorporate digital analytics into dossier evaluation, enabling earlier identification of risks and more efficient approval timelines. In manufacturing lifecycle management, AI-enabled model predictive control systems are used to dynamically adjust parameters in response to material or environmental changes, improving yield while ensuring compliance with stringent quality standards. This convergence of advanced manufacturing and data-driven oversight marks a clear departure from traditional approaches, signaling a future in which therapeutic protein production is faster, more sustainable, and more responsive to patient needs.

Category Description Buffers and pH Control Phosphate, histidine, citrate and acetate buffers with molarities of 0.01 to 0.10 M are the most common and provide robust pH control in the range of 4.8 to 8.0. Stabilizers Sugars/Polyols (sucrose, trehalose, glycerol) to protect against freeze–thaw and dehydration stress. Surfactants Polysorbate 20/80 to prevent interfacial aggregation. Amino acids Arginine and glycine were used to improve solubility and inhibit aggregation. Presentation Formats Liquid: Immediate use is usually refrigerated. pharmaceutics-17-01183-t012_Table 12 Table 12 Advantages of Buffer-less Formulations. Advantage Description Simplicity Fewer excipients in the formulation simplifies development and eliminates potential incompatibilities. This aligns with a minimalist formulation philosophy that uses only what is necessary to stabilize the protein. Reduced Injection Site Pain Eliminating acidic solutions such as citrate can significantly reduce local pain after subcutaneous injection. Patients often tolerate injections better when foreign ionic ingredients are minimized. Improved Stability in Some Cases Eliminating a buffer can prevent certain instability issues. For example, buffer salts can sometimes promote protein aggregation or opalescence; one study found that citrate-buffered mAb solutions exhibited higher levels of opalescence and aggregation than unbuffered solutions. Buffer-free formulations also avoid pH disturbances caused by crystallization or buffer degradation (e.g., phosphate precipitation during freezing). Lower Risk of Excipient Interactions Without multivalent anions or other buffer components, there is a lower risk of interactions with diluents or leachable from the packaging. For intravenous drugs, a self-buffering concentrate can be diluted in saline without the risk of buffer dilution altering the pH or causing precipitation. Regulatory Flexibility The use of fewer excipients means fewer variables to control in the manufacturing process and, potentially, fewer regulatory concerns about the purity or origin of the excipients. A buffer-free formulation could simplify regulatory review, as all components (except the protein) are inert stabilizers. pharmaceutics-17-01183-t013_Table 13 Table 13 Excipients and Safety Profile of Buffer-Free Formulations. Excipient Type Description/Safety Profile Amino Acids (e.g., histidine, arginine, glycine, aspartic acid, proline) Natural amino acids are generally safe for injectable use. Histidine and arginine are widely used in approved biologics (~82% of high potency mAb formulations). Typically, non-toxic at 1–50 mM. Glycine serves as a stabilizer/tonic in immunoglobulin products. Arginine in high concentrations may have osmotic effects orally but is well tolerated in moderate injectable doses. Recognized as safe by FDA/EMA. Sugars and Polyols (e.g., sucrose, trehalose, sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol) Serve as stabilizers (especially in lyophilized or liquid forms to prevent aggregation) and tonicity adjusters. The antiviral agent has been well established as safe for parenteral use. Trehalose and sucrose protect against freeze/thaw or heat stress. Sorbitol and mannitol ensure isotonicity (~5% w v Salts (e.g., NaCl) NaCl is commonly added for isotonicity, widely considered safe in small doses (e.g., 9 mg per 1 mL SC injection). Some buffer-free products such as Humira (where mannitol is used) are omitted. Acetate or succinate is used as buffers and not in strict buffer-free formulations. The salts used in biologics are chosen from food/pharma-grade sources. Surfactants (e.g., polysorbate 80, polysorbate 20, poloxamer 188) Prevent protein adsorption and interface-induced aggregation. PS-80 appears in >90% of antibody products. Safe at ~0.01–0.1%, although rare hypersensitivity reactions have been noted. Can degrade into particles or peroxides. PS-20 is used in interferon-beta, poloxamer 188 in Hemlibra and Enspryng. These surfactants are pharmacopeia-listed and approved for injectables. Chelators and Antioxidants (e.g., EDTA, methionine) Chelators like EDTA (used in ppm levels) bind to trace metals, methionine acts as a sacrificial antioxidant. Rare in minimalist buffer-free designs, but used in specific cases like Cyltezo ® pharmaceutics-17-01183-t014_Table 14 Table 14 Innovation in Self-Buffering and Buffer-Free Formulations. Feature Description Protein Self-Buffering Studies demonstrate that intrinsic titratable groups of antibodies can maintain pH within a therapeutic window, even under stress conditions. Reduced Aggregation and Opalescence Buffer-free preparations show significantly less aggregation and opalescence compared to their phosphate-buffered counterparts during the shaking and freeze–thaw cycles. High-concentration Formats The transition to formulations of ≥100 mg/mL (essential for subcutaneous administration) has been facilitated by eliminating high-ionic-strength buffers, which can promote viscosity and protein–protein interactions. Patient Comfort Citrate buffers are known to cause injection site pain; Replacement with self-buffering proteins or minimal excipients has significantly reduced discomfort. pharmaceutics-17-01183-t015_Table 15 Table 15 Comparison of characteristics and selected biosimilars with buffer-free formulations. Aspect Traditional Buffered Formulations Buffer-Free (Self-Buffering) Formulations Practical Implications pH control The external buffer controls pH within its effective range (e.g., phosphate, citrate, histidine). Initial pH is set during manufacturing; intrinsic ionizable residues provide limited extrinsic buffering. Buffers are reliable across concentrations, and self-buffering works best at high protein concentrations or for inherently stable proteins. Stability Excellent when pH is optimized; some buffers can cause issues (e.g., phosphate crystallization on freeze/thaw; citrate interactions). Equal or better for high-concentration proteins; often less aggregation/opalescence compared to buffered counterparts. Choose buffer-free to reduce the aggregation pathways linked to buffer salts; monitor storage tightly to avoid pH drift. Injection tolerability (SC) Depending on the type/level of buffer; acidic citrate may sting and increase pain. Often superior; removal of citrate reduces injection pain and enables smaller volumes at high concentration. Patient-centric advantage for SC biologics; “citrate-free” positioning supports comfort claims. Immunogenicity Driven more by aggregates/impurities than by “buffer vs. no buffer”; good control can reduce risk. Comparable to buffered; reduced aggregation may further reduce anti-drug antibody risk; no regulator-attributed issues to absence of buffers to date. Focus analytical control on aggregate minimization in either approach. Formulation complexity More components (buffer + stabilizers/surfactants/salts) increase interaction space but leverage mature platform know-how. Fewer excipients simplify supply chain/QC; may require deeper protein-focused stability work. Buffer-free can streamline CMC and messaging; buffered can speed development via established platforms. Typical use cases IV products at low–moderate concentration; lyophilized products; proteins with narrow pH stability windows. High-concentration SC biologics (≥100 mg/mL); IV concentrates intended for immediate dilution; excipient-minimizing designs. Match approach to the route, concentration, and pH tolerance of API. Representative buffer-free products (regulatory status)  Adalimumab biosimilars: Cyltezo ® ® ® ® ® ® The Buffer-free approach has already been approved in major markets and therapy areas; examples support comfort and simplicity narratives for SC use while maintaining regulatory acceptance. pharmaceutics-17-01183-t016_Table 16 Table 16 List of the most recent approved recombinant therapeutic proteins between 2020 and 11 July 2025.
