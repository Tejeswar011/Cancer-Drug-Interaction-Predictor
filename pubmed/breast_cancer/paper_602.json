While combinatorial regimens show promise through synergistic pharmacological interactions, traditional pathway enrichment methods relying on static gene sets fail to capture drug-induced dynamic transcriptional perturbations. Methods To address this challenge, we developed the Pathway-Responsive Gene Sets (PRGS) framework to systematically identify chemoresistance-associated pathways and guide therapeutic intervention. Comparative evaluation of three computational strategies (GSEA-like method, Hypergeometric test-based method, Bates test-based method) revealed that the GSEA-like methodology exhibited superior performance, enabling precise identification of drug-induced pathway dysregulation. Results Key experimental findings demonstrated PRGS’s superiority over conventional Pathway Member Gene Sets (PMGS), exhibiting statistical independence ( p in vitro Discussion This study establishes a PRGS-based methodological framework that integrates genomic perturbations with precision oncology, demonstrating its capacity to decode resistance mechanisms and guide therapeutic development through dynamic pathway analysis. chemotherapeutic resistance pathway-responsive gene sets drug discovery drug combination therapy precision oncology The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article.

(2010) Song et al., 2022 Traditional pathway gene annotations are predominantly curated through subjective methodologies, wherein constituent genes exhibit functionally coordinated interactions to execute specific biological processes or pathways ( Chicco and Agapito, 2022 Kanehisa and Goto, 2000 Venet et al., 2011 Zhang et al., 2011 Li et al., 2017 Atkinson et al., 2019 A substantial body of publicly available perturbation experiments has been systematically curated to identify treatment-responsive genes ( Rydenfelt et al., 2020 Parikh et al., 2010 Emerging evidence underscores the critical association between post-treatment response gene signatures and therapeutic outcomes, including both drug sensitivity and acquired resistance. Functional interrogation of these genes has revealed their dual capacity to delineate pathway perturbations driving resistance while simultaneously identifying actionable therapeutic targets. For instance, Cai et al. (2023) Zhao et al. (2024) In SPEED ( Parikh, Klinger, Xia, Marto and Bluthgen, 2010 Rydenfelt, Klinger, Klunemann and Bluthgen, 2020 The evolution of enrichment analysis methodologies has been driven by the need to address limitations in detecting biologically meaningful gene sets. Over-representation analysis (ORA), a foundational method in enrichment analysis, employs the Hypergeometric test to assess statistical over-representation of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within predefined pathways ( Liu et al., 2022 Peng et al., 2023 Cai et al., 2022 Hou et al., 2020 Rydenfelt, Klinger, Klunemann and Bluthgen, 2020 In this study, we aim to identify potential therapeutic agents to address chemoresistance in cancer treatment. We constructed PRGS by systematically integrating multiple experimental perturbation datasets. Subsequent application of enrichment analysis methods (GSEA-like, Hypergeometric test-based, Bates test-based) to PRGS in GDSC data revealed candidate drugs with the capacity to reduce cancer cell resistance. Finally, experimental validation was conducted to assess the synergistic therapeutic effects of these drug combinations. 2 Materials and methods The overall process of data preparation, differential expression analysis, dataset construction, enrichment analysis, and cellular experimental validation in this study is shown in the flowchart ( Figure 1 FIGURE 1 Comprehensive workflow for identifying chemoresistance-associated pathways and therapeutic candidates through PRGS-based enrichment analysis frameworks.

(2020) 2.1.2 Drug sensitivity data in breast cancer cell line We curated a panel of 78 chemotherapeutic agents approved by the American Cancer Society (ACS, https://www.cancer.org/ Narayanan and Honavar, 2017 Yang et al., 2013 The GDSC repository provided chemosensitivity profiles across 51 breast cancer cell lines, with individual drug sensitivity data coverage ranging from 38 to 51 cell lines per agent among the 12 selected agents. Drug sensitivity was quantified using the area under the concentration-response curve (AUC) metric. Drug-sensitive and drug-resistant groups were defined using predefined AUC thresholds: drug-sensitive groups by AUC<0.8 and drug-resistant groups by AUC≥0.8 ( Callari et al., 2023 2.1.3 Gene expression in breast cancer cell line Gene expression profiling data comprising 17,737 genes across 1,018 cancer cell lines were retrieved from the GDSC database. Subsequently, gene expression data were extracted from breast cancer cell lines for drug sensitivity analysis, encompassing 17,419 genes and 51 distinct breast cancer cell lines. 2.2 Differentially expressed genes between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant groups Breast cancer datasets were categorized into drug-sensitive and drug-resistant groups based on responses to 12 chemotherapeutic agents (5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel, etc. p 2.3 Pathway-responsive gene sets construction For each experimental perturbation dataset, genes with expression below the median were excluded. When a gene was expressed in multiple datasets, the z-value corresponding to the highest expression was selected; conversely, for genes expressed in a single dataset, their observed z-values were retained. An adjusted z-value reflecting gene expression changes specific to each perturbation type was calculated using Formula 1 z a d j u s t e d = z r a w * s i g n t y p e (1) adjusted raw For each pathway, z-transformed values were derived by applying Gaussian transformation to all adjusted z-values within each dataset ( Hanzelmann et al., 2013 Supplementary Figure S1 Subsequently, the mean of these z-transformed values across all experiments was calculated for each gene (hereafter termed z-score), with genes expressed in fewer than two datasets excluded from the analysis. Pathway-related gene signatures (PRGS) were identified using a stringent statistical threshold |z-score|>2.58, p 2.4 PRGS-based enrichment analysis We conducted systematic pathway enrichment analysis using the PRGS framework to identify dysregulated pathways between chemoresistant and chemosensitive breast cancer subtypes. Pathway significance was determined with p p Input variables for the three PRGS-based enrichment analysis methods were as follows: discrete PRGS and total genes were used for the GSEA-like methodology; continuous PRGS and DEGs were employed for the Bates test-based methodology; DEGs and discrete PRGS were used for the Hypergeometric test-based methodology ( Figure 2 FIGURE 2 Systematic workflow for PRGS-based enrichment analysis methodologies.

Panel A shows estrogen-responsive signatures ranked by t-statistic, with results visualized in a running enrichment score plot.

Targeted inhibitors were identified by screening the Selleck platform ( Wojtaszek et al., 2019 https://www.selleck.cn/index.html in vitro in vivo 2.6  In vitro The predicted synergistic interaction between bortezomib and bleomycin was systematically validated through a two-phase pharmacodynamic evaluation in STR-authenticated T47D breast cancer cells maintained under standardized culture conditions (37 °C, 5% CO 2 via Ling and Huang (2020) Supplementary Material 3 Results 3.1 Pathway-responsive gene sets Heterogeneous data distribution across cross-experimental gene expression datasets poses significant challenges to robust analytical outcomes, particularly when dealing with heavy-tailed distributions that violate normality assumptions. To address this issue, we systematically evaluated three normalization strategies to determine the most suitable preprocessing approach. The most appropriate method was selected from Gaussian normalization, Logarithmic transformation, and Quantile normalization. Using the GSE13837 Supplementary Figure S2 Supplementary Figure S3 In contrast, the Logarithmic transformation resulted in data clustering predominantly within the range [−5, 5], while the overall distribution remained skewed. Notably, the ratio of negative to positive values shifted markedly to 25.1:74.9. Although the distribution resulting from Quantile normalization approximates a normal distribution within the interval [−15, 15], a limited number of extreme values persist beyond these boundaries. Similar patterns were observed in the other two datasets ( Supplementary Figures S2 and S3 Overall, Gaussian normalization emerged as the optimal method. It maps data onto a standard normal distribution, effectively compressing extreme values and improving distributional balance. Substantial inter-dataset distributional disparities were observed, and we systematically applied Gaussian normalization to all pathway-derived datasets, achieving scale consistency across expression datasets ( Hai et al., 2023 A systematic analysis of these post-normalization datasets spanning multiple pathways identified genes with consistent regulation patterns across experimental conditions, enabling the construction of PRGS ( Supplementary Figure S4A Supplementary Figure S4B Xiao et al., 2022 Despite variations in the number of responsive genes, they provide a robust foundation for subsequent functional analysis, enabling more effective identification of pathway dysregulation in specific biological samples. For instance, in a study by Gregory et al., their analysis of dysregulated genes in response to imatinib therapy identified the Wnt pathway as a therapeutic target ( Gregory et al., 2010 3.2 Differential expression of drug-sensitive genes across drug groups DEGs between drug-sensitive and resistant breast cancer cell groups across 12 chemotherapeutic agents were identified through differential expression analysis. To focus on genes with significant directional expression changes, we applied an additional filter (|t-statistic|>2.8) to prioritize biologically impactful candidates. This analysis revealed substantial heterogeneity in t-statistic distributions across agents ( Table 1 Supplementary Figure S5A TABLE 1 The number of DEGs of drug-sensitive genes.

These genes were analyzed to compare drug-sensitive and -resistant subgroups within the GDSC dataset, facilitating the identification of pathways driving chemoresistance. The GSEA-like methodology demonstrated superior performance, identifying eight key pathways ( p Figure 3A Feng et al., 2025 Gao et al., 2024 FIGURE 3 Identification of significant pathways by three enrichment analyses. (A–C) (D) p Circular diagrams (A, B, C) show connections between cytokines, pathways, and drugs like Vorinostat, Vincristine, and Docetaxel. Diagram D is a heatmap displaying p-values for different tests (GSEA-like, Bates, Hypergeometric, PMGS-based GSEA-like) with color gradients representing significance levels in pathways such as PPAR, Notch, and Hypoxia. Three chemoresistance-associated pathways were identified through Hypergeometric test-based methodology across two drug-sensitive/resistant subgroup comparisons ( Figure 3B Figure 3D Seven chemoresistance-associated pathways were identified through Bates test-based analysis, with Hippo, PPAR, and JAK-STAT pathways showing consistent activation across multiple subgroups ( Figure 3C Nascimento et al., 2017 Zeng and Dong, 2021 Zhang et al., 2024 Figure 3D The comparative analysis demonstrated that pathways identified through the GSEA-like methodology achieved superior statistical significance ( p 3.4 Comparing differences between PRGS and PMGS Gene sets for ten pathways were retrieved from the KEGG database to evaluate differences between PRGS and PMGS. The Jaccard index and the number of overlaps for each pathway were calculated ( Supplementary Figure S6 Supplementary Table S1 From a biological perspective, this limited overlap stems from their distinct design objectives. PMGS includes genes that are annotated as components of well-known canonical pathways and signaling cascades ( Gerling et al., 2013 Rashidiani et al., 2024 Rahem et al., 2020 Wang, Karikomi, et al., 2019 Krolick and Shi, 2022 The GSEA-like methodology demonstrated superior performance when applied to PRGS using GDSC data ( p Supplementary Figure S7 Han et al., 2021 Macaulay et al., 2013 p < Figure 3D 3.5 Discovering potential drugs to overcome chemoresistance in breast cancer Eight key pathways associated with chemoresistance in breast cancer were identified using the PRGS-based GSEA-like approach. These pathways are dysregulated in response to specific chemotherapeutic agents, and can be targeted for therapeutic intervention with pathway-specific inhibitors ( Figure 4 FIGURE 4 Discovery of drug candidates to overcome chemoresistance in cancer treatment. The Sankey diagram illustrates the relationships between chemotherapeutic drugs, dysregulated pathways, and pathway inhibitors. Nodes on the left represent chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment, central nodes correspond to dysregulated pathways associated with these drugs, and nodes on the right indicate pathway inhibitors capable of modulating these pathways. Distinct colors and node shapes correspond to various chemotherapy agents, dysregulated pathways, and inhibitors, respectively. The connecting lines illustrate the directional flow between these three elements. Sankey diagram illustrating relationships among chemotherapy drugs, pathways, and pathway inhibitors. Drugs like 5-Fluorouracil, Vinblastine, and Paclitaxel connect to pathways such as Hippo, Notch, and TNFa, which further connect to inhibitors like CAY10585, Verteporfin, and Tamoxifen. Each pathway and connection is color-coded to indicate the relationships. The estrogen pathway was found to be dysregulated in paclitaxel-resistant subgroups. Tamoxifen and fulvestrant, both explicitly classified as “estrogen receptor antagonists” in the Selleck database, function by inhibiting estrogen activity and suppressing the proliferation of breast cancer cells. Previous studies have shown that fulvestrant can make estrogen receptor-negative breast tumors more susceptible to chemotherapy, whereas tamoxifen can mitigate paclitaxel resistance mediated by ERα-positive signaling ( Jiang et al., 2014 Nzegwu et al., 2021 in vitro Bortezomib, while primarily a proteasome inhibitor, also inhibits NF-kB activity. Its combined administration with IL-1 receptor antagonists has been shown to reduce tumor formation and growth in vivo McLoed et al., 2016 Maseda et al., 2014 In addition, drugs that had previously been validated as inhibitors of specific pathways were considered. ST-162 and ST-168 are small-molecule bifunctional inhibitors targeting both the MEK and PI3K pathways, demonstrating dose-dependent suppression of MEK and PI3K signal transduction ( Smith et al., 2018 Promising drug combinations targeting resistant cell lines were identified through this workflow ( Supplementary Table S2 Yang et al., 2013 Wakeling et al., 1991 3.6 Bleomycin-bortezomib synergistic effects validation in T47D cells Both IL-1 and TNFα pathways were identified as key pathways in both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subgroups through GSEA-like and Hypergeometric test-based analyses. Studies have shown that the IL-1 pathway increases drug resistance by activating and reinforcing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( Stanam et al., 2016 Rho et al., 2022 Overexpression of TNFα can fragment tumor DNA, thereby contributing to resistance to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents ( Adrian et al., 2023 Cruceriu et al., 2020 The T47D cell line represents the luminal A subtype of breast cancer, characterized by positivity for estrogen receptor (ER+) and progesterone receptor (PR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2-) ( Ahmed et al., 2022 Fiorillo et al., 2020 Gaffney and Tsai, 1986 Mao et al., 2012 Under optimal drug concentrations, this combination reduced cellular viability to 20% ( Figure 5 FIGURE 5 The effect of bleomycin, bortezomib monotherapy and their combination on T47D cell viability. The x-axis represents the different treatment groups (bleomycin, bortezomib, combination therapy), while the y-axis represents cell viability. Box plot comparing cell activity for three groups: Bleomycin, Bortezomib, and their combination. Bleomycin shows lower median activity, Bortezomib has a wider range, and the combination group exhibits intermediate activity. 4 Discussion Despite the increasing application of gene set analysis, systematic investigations into gene set selection criteria remain limited. The impact of distinct gene set definitions on analytical outcomes remains underexplored. Two gene set categories, PRGS and PMGS, were compared in this study. PMGS comprise curated gene sets associated with biological processes, chromosomal locations, disease associations, or pathway membership ( Hermida et al., 2013 Three enrichment analysis methodologies based on PRGS were implemented. The GSEA-like approach demonstrated superior performance, identifying a greater number of statistically significant pathways compared to alternative methods. This superiority was attributed to its emphasis on aggregate gene set trends within ranked lists. Notably, predefined gene lists exhibited substantial differential expression levels, contributing to substantial pathway enrichment. The Bates test-based method involves multiple sorting of gene z-values, focusing on the average ranking of genes within a given gene set. Conversely, Hypergeometric test-based analysis was constrained by limited gene overlap between PRGS and DEGs, with overlapping gene quantity prioritized over expression magnitude. This methodological limitation resulted in the lowest number of detected pathways among all evaluated approaches. Current strategies to address chemotherapeutic resistance include combination therapies, nanomedicine platforms, and gene therapeutic approaches. A self-delivery nanomedicine incorporating α-tocopherol succinate and doxorubicin was developed by Zheng et al. to overcome drug resistance through synergistic chemotherapy ( Zheng et al., 2021 Wang et al., 2019 Dong et al., 2021 In summary, this study highlights the importance of PRGS in characterizing chemotherapy resistance-associated expression patterns. By prioritizing PRGS over PMGS, we were able to capture dynamic pathway-specific expression changes and their causal relationships with pathway activity, providing a more accurate representation of biological mechanisms underlying chemoresistance. The GSEA-like approach, with its focus on aggregate gene set trends, outperformed other methodologies in identifying statistically significant pathways, underscoring its utility in pathway analysis. These findings not only advance our understanding of chemoresistance mechanisms but also offer a robust framework for developing targeted therapeutic strategies. The proposed method exhibits broad applicability beyond chemotherapy resistance, extending to other drug class-associated resistance mechanisms through the integration of pathway inhibitors. Thus it provides a foundation for future research aimed at overcoming treatment resistance and improving therapeutic outcomes in cancer patients.
