This study examined the potential protective effects of montelukast (ML), an anti-asthmatic drug with anti-inflammatory characteristics, against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) in breast cancer (BC) patients. Method A prospective, randomized, controlled clinical study including fifty individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of BC, individuals scheduled to receive DOX 60 mg/m 2 2 Results After treatment, a significant reduction in N-terminal Pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT pro-BNP) levels was observed in the ML group compared to the control group (1756.0 [1054.0–2334.0] vs. 3788.0 [2226.0–4401.1] pg/mL, p < 0.001). Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) levels also decreased significantly in the ML group (2.23 [1.18–3.05] vs. 3.11 [2.39–3.25] pg/mL, p = 0.009). The median percentage reduction in Soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (sST2) levels was more pronounced in the ML group (20.93 ± 5.45 ng/mL) than in the control group (24.16 ± 5.14 ng/mL, p = 0.036). Additionally, a strong positive correlation between NT pro-BNP and NF-κB levels was observed post-treatment (rs = 0.644, p < 0.001), supporting ML’s potential anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective effects. Conclusion The incorporation of ML into AC led to a substantial decrease in cardiac biomarkers confirming the feasibility of incorporating ML in individuals with breast cancer as an auxiliary treatment to prevent DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.

Early detection and management of chemotherapy-induced cardiac impairment is facilitated by various cardiac biomarkers such as N-terminal pro B-type Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP), which is a crucial indicator of cardiac stress, and elevated levels of this biomarker have been connected to the cardiotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents like anthracyclines [ 38 39 40 Patients and methods Study design Participants were recruited from Damanhour Oncology Center in Egypt for this randomized, controlled clinical investigation, which was intended to be conducted in parallel groups. The study protocol was authorized by the Damanhour University Research Ethical Committee (Approval number: 123PP64) and the Research Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health (Approval Number: 2–2024/12). Additionally, it was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov“ https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05959889?cond=breast%20cancer&term=Montelukast&rank=1 NCT05959889 Study participants 119 individuals were eventually chosen during the study's eligibility review phase, which ran from March 2023 to December 2024. Ultimately, 50 patients, 25 in the control group and 25 in the ML group, were enrolled to assess the study's main and secondary outcomes. The research included adult females (ranging in age from 18 to 70 years) who had a BC diagnosis that was verified by a biopsy, according to the TNM staging criteria by the American Joint Committee on Cancer [ 41 Randomization and study interventions Eligible patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the Control or ML groups using block randomization. Four days before AC therapy began, each patient was assigned to one of the two groups. The control group received 4 cycles of the AC regimen which consisted of an intravenous (IV) infusion of DOX (dose/cycle = 60 mg/m 2 2 42 43 Blood sampling and biochemical analyses Antecubital venipuncture was used to obtain approximately 5 mL of venous blood from each participant at two different times: approximately one hour prior to the first chemotherapy cycle (Baseline) and one hour after the final AC dosage (After). Blood samples were collected in EDTA test tubes, centrifuged for 10 min at 4,500 × g, and then stored at −80 °C. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits that were purchased from DL develop (Wuxi Donglin Sci & Tech Development Co., Ltd., China) and Sun Red Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China, to measure the plasma levels of NT-proBNP, NF-κB, and sST2. The respective catalog numbers for the kits were DL-NT-ProBNP-Hu, DL-NFkB-Hu, and 201–12-5940. Every assay was carried out in compliance with the manufacturer's instructions. Patient assessment and follow-up schedule ML treatment began with the patients' first AC dosage and continued concurrently for four cycles of AC doses, ending after their fourth dosage. The drug was provided to the patients every 21 days, in accordance with their revised AC dosage. Adherence was tracked via drug refill rates, bi-weekly phone calls, and direct meetings every 21 days at the time of their prescribed AC doses and to report any adverse effects. To assess adherence, pill counts were used. Patients were eliminated from the trial after being judged non-compliant if they received less than 90% of their medication. Notably, no participants were excluded due to non-compliance, and the medication adherence rate was 100%, with all participants following their prescribed regimen precisely. Sample size calculations The sample size was estimated based on a previous study [ 44 Statistical analysis The results were analyzed with the assistance of IBM SPSS version 20.0. The standard deviation, median, and interquartile range were used to express the quantitative data. However, qualitative data was represented by percentages and numbers. Statistical significance was set at a 5% significance level. Group differences were evaluated using the following statistical tests: the Student t-test for normally distributed quantitative variables, Fisher's Exact Test Correction for chi-square tests when more than 20% of cells had expected counts that were less than five, the Mann–Whitney for non-normally distributed quantitative variables, and the Wilcoxon signed-rank ranks for categorical variables. Results Out of the 119 participants screened, 4 declined to participate, 10 were enrolled in a different trial, and 51 were not eligible to participate. Ultimately, 54 patients who satisfied the inclusion requirements were enrolled in the study. The individuals were then randomized to either the Control or ML groups. During the follow-up period, patients were excluded from the trial due to three instances of lost follow-up, one instance of regimen change, and zero exclusions related to non-compliance. The CONSORT 1 Fig. 1 The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Characteristics of the baseline population: demographic and clinical Age, weight, height, and BMI were among the demographic variables that showed no statistically significant differences between the study groups.

Regarding the NT-proBNP biomarker analysis, Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Comparison between the two groups according to A) , B) C) p: p 0 : *: Examining the inflammatory marker NF-κB revealed that the control group had significantly higher levels of the marker, with a median of 3.11 pg/mL (p = 0.026). However, as illustrated in Fig. 2 Regarding the sST2 biomarker, the control and ML groups' baseline sST2 levels did not differ significantly (p = 0.747). Likewise, there was no significant change in the control group's sST2 levels before and after therapy (p = 0.980). Even though the ML group's sST2 levels decreased (24.91 ± 7.91 vs. 20.93 ± 5.45), the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.061). However, following treatment, the ML group's sST2 levels (20.93 ± 5.45 ng/mL) demonstrated a significant decrease (p = 0.036) in comparison to its corresponding control group (24.16 ± 5.14 ng/mL), as illustrated in Fig. 2 The correlations between NT-proBNP, NF-κB, and sST2 levels A non-significant correlation was demonstrated between sST2 and both NT-proBNP and NF-κB either before or after the treatment, Table 2 3 Table 2 Correlation between NT-proBNP, NF-κB, and sST2 biomarkers (n = 50) Baseline After r s P r s P NT-proBNP vs. NF-κB 0.619 * < 0.001 * 0.644 * < 0.001 * NT-proBNP vs. sST2 −0.095 0.511 0.138 0.338 NF-κB vs. sST2 −0.054 0.708 0.104 0.471 r s * Fig. 3 Correlation between NT-proBNP and NF-κB at a b n The effect of ML on the adverse events of both studied groups The safety results showed that, in terms of adverse events, the ML group and the control group exhibited similar profiles.

Regarding the hematological parameters, hemoglobin, RBCs, and hematocrit all exhibited a significant intra-group decrease (p < 0.001), whereas MCV, MCH, and MCHC in both the control and ML groups showed non-significant changes (p > 0.05). Both the control and ML groups experienced a significant increase in RDW/CV with time (p = 0.002 and p < 0.001, respectively). Regarding WBC count, there were no significant differences between the control and ML groups; nevertheless, both groups showed a significant decrease over time (p < 0.001 and p = 0.003). Compared to the control group, the ML group's platelet counts changed significantly (p < 0.001). Neutrophil and lymphocyte count showed significant within-group changes without inter-group differences. In terms of the liver function tests, AST demonstrated a significant decrease in cycle 3 when compared to its comparable control (p = 0.005); however, ALT did not change significantly between the control and ML groups across the cycles. Both ALT and AST levels within the ML group showed intragroup variation across the cycles, with a significant elevation observed (p = 0.009 for ALT and < 0.001 for AST), but the control group showed no significant changes. Kidney functions including serum creatinine and urea levels showed no significant differences between or within groups across the cycles (p > 0.05). Also, the fasting plasma glucose levels showed non-significant differences either within the same group or between the control or ML groups, Table 4 Table 4 Comparison between control and ML groups according to different biological parameters in each cycle Cycle 1 Cycle 2 Cycle 3 Cycle 4 p 0 Red Blood Cell (RBC) Parameters Hemoglobin (g/dl) Control group 12.79 ± 1.39 12.36 ± 1.08 12.26 ± 0.89 11.84 ± 1.0 F * ML group 12.70 ± 1.12 11.93 ± 1.06 11.96 ± 1.04 11.85 ± 0.95 F * t 0.798 0.159 0.274 0.977 RBCs (10 6 Control group 4.84 ± 0.67 4.60 ± 0.53 4.56 ± 0.60 4.38 ± 0.58 F * ML group 4.81 ± 0.63 4.45 ± 0.40 4.45 ± 0.48 4.32 ± 0.54 F * t 0.880 0.255 0.471 0.688 Hematocrit (%) Control group 38.83 ± 4.22 37.82 ± 2.94 37.26 ± 3.53 35.92 ± 3.24 F * ML group 38.60 ± 3.22 36.60 ± 2.82 36.20 ± 3.12 36.06 ± 3.08 F * t 0.828 0.142 0.268 0.869 MCV (FL) Control group 81.03 ± 6.41 82.14 ± 6.23 82.31 ± 7.19 82.84 ± 7.31 F ML group 81.11 ± 5.72 82.60 ± 6.14 82.11 ± 6.64 84.20 ± 6.67 F t 0.963 0.794 0.921 0.496 MCH (pg) Control group 26.73 ± 2.17 26.93 ± 1.79 27.30 ± 2.36 27.31 ± 2.68 F ML group 27.0 ± 2.54 27.07 ± 1.81 27.07 ± 1.82 27.66 ± 1.77 F t 0.686 0.784 0.698 0.591 MCHC (g/dL) Control group 32.93 ± 1.39 32.67 ± 1.04 33.0 ± 1.79 33.05 ± 1.96 F ML group 33.29 ± 2.61 32.63 ± 1.87 33.02 ± 1.66 32.41 ± 2.28 F t 0.546 0.926 0.961 0.296 RDW/CV (%) Control group 14.92 ± 1.34 14.37 ± 1.67 15.22 ± 1.86 15.87 ± 2.03 F * ML group 14.49 ± 1.52 14.45 ± 1.83 15.17 ± 2.33 15.78 ± 2.42 F * t 0.301 0.873 0.936 0.885 Platelet Parameter PLT (× 10 3 Control group 321.4 ± 180.41 397.0 ± 150.73 375.9 ± 109.80 364.3 ± 104.15 F ML group 289.8 ± 71.51 398.0 ± 123.96 350.7 ± 80.54 353.3 ± 95.35 F * t 0.420 0.980 0.359 0.698 White Blood Cell (WBC) Parameters WBCs (× 10 3 Control group 8.0 ± 3.24 7.33 ± 3.28 6.10 ± 1.69 5.87 ± 1.46 F * ML group 7.01 ± 2.41 5.81 ± 2.50 5.26 ± 1.35 5.45 ± 1.91 F * t 0.228 0.072 0.059 0.387 Neutrophils absolute (/cm) Control group 4.85 ± 2.82 4.29 ± 3.19 3.22 ± 1.37 3.0 ± 1.30 F * ML group 3.86 ± 1.71 3.03 ± 1.75 2.56 ± 1.13 3.07 ± 1.44 F * t 0.139 0.092 0.068 0.870 Lymphocytes absolute (/cm) Control group 2.44 ± 0.83 2.14 ± 0.63 2.03 ± 0.59 1.96 ± 0.62 F * ML group 2.45 ± 0.74 2.01 ± 0.88 1.88 ± 0.69 1.68 ± 0.53 F * t 0.950 0.541 0.427 0.094 Liver Function Tests ALT (IU/l) Control group 20 (15.8–31) 23 (19–31) 22 (18–25) 23.7 (17.9–30) Fr ML group 16 (13–18.2) 21.7 (17.9–27) 20 (17.5–26.3) 22 (20–31.4) Fr * U 0.051 0.356 0.473 0.992 AST(IU/l) Control group 24.4 (19–29) 25.7(23.4–30) 27.3(25.4–29.3) 29.8 (25.3–33) Fr ML group 22 (19–24) 28.3(23–30.8) 23.3(20.9–27.3) 30 (24.5–34.7) Fr * U 0.130 0.676 0.005 * 0.938 Kidney Function Tests Serum Creatinine (mg/dl) Control group 0.80 (0.70–1.0) 0.80(0.70–1.10) 0.80(0.70–0.90) 0.90 (0.70–1.0) Fr ML group 0.70 (0.70–1.0) 0.80 (0.70–1.0) 0.90 (0.70–1.0) 0.70(0.70–0.90) Fr U 0.785 0.690 0.330 0.107 Urea (mg/dl) Control group 28(22.4–35.4) 27.9(20.1–34.6) 23.3(18.3–31.4) 22.8(19.1–33.7) Fr ML group 25.2(23.3–29.1) 24.2(19.2–30.3) 23.8(21.2–31.4) 22.1(17.4–26.6) Fr U 0.327 0.393 0.554 0.367 Fasting plasma glucose (mg/dl) Control group 118.5(100–128) 112(102–129.8) 108(102.2–130.6) 115(106–125) Fr ML group 104(97–112.4) 107(99.6–114.9) 103.3(96–115) 103(95–116) Fr U 0.067 0.426 0.165 0.123 RBCs MCV MCH MCHC RDW/CV PLT WBCs ALT AST SD t U Fr F p p 0 Discussion The underlying mechanisms of DIC are complex, involving oxidative stress, excessive production of ROS, lipid peroxidation, and inflammatory signaling cascades mediated by NF-κB [ 45 46 47 48 49 Both NT-proBNP and NF-κB were significantly reduced by ML. Hafez and Hassanein (2022) highlighted the role of ML in lowering cardiac stress and inflammation. Using an in vivo animal model, they showed that ML may reduce DIC by modifying oxidative stress and regulating inflammatory markers. Their research showed a noteworthy reduction in NT-proBNP levels, confirming ML's potential to reduce inflammatory reactions and related cardiovascular issues [ 32 49 50 The findings of this study imply that ML might potentially lower sST2 levels, a biomarker linked to inflammation, fibrosis, and cardiac remodeling. The ML group's reported decrease in sST2 levels provides preliminary evidence of its cardioprotective benefits, especially in reducing cardiac remodeling linked to DOX therapy. Increased sST2 levels have been linked to worse outcomes for individuals with heart failure as well as those receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy [ 51 52 53 54 55 56 Although the correlation between sST2 and other biomarkers, such as NT-proBNP and NF-κB did not approach statistical significance, the direction of the correlation was positive after treatment which may support the role of ML in improving cardiac functions. This lack of significant correlation between sST2 and NT-proBNP was aligned with a clinical trial that involved patients with stable chronic heart failure during 1-year follow-up after hospitalization. The study supported the role of sST2 in cardiac risk stratification, while demonstrating no correlation between sST2 and NT-proBNP [ 57 58 59 60 61 62 66 The strong positive correlation between NT-proBNP and NF-κB in the two groups, especially after therapy, highlights the interconnected roles of cardiac stress and inflammation in DIC. This result aligns with earlier in vivo, in vitro, and clinical studies demonstrating that inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress are key contributors to anthracycline-induced heart damage [ 67 68 The safety outcomes of this study demonstrate that ML was well-tolerated among BC patients undergoing DOX-based chemotherapy, with no significant differences in most adverse effects between the ML and control groups, consistent with prior research showing that ML is generally safe with minimal severe side effects [ 69 49 The hematological parameters showed notable intra-group changes over the treatment cycles, with few significant differences between the groups that suggest that the AC regimen itself influenced parameters such as hemoglobin, RBC count, and hematocrit, rather than the addition of ML. The significant within-group changes in hemoglobin and RBC levels are consistent with the known myelosuppressive effects of DOX [ 70 71 Regarding liver function tests, including ALT and AST, both control and ML groups showed slight increase in liver enzymes across the cycles. These fluctuations were more pronounced in ML group across the cycles. However, these changes remained within the normal reference range, suggesting no clinically significant hepatotoxicity. Since the patients were receiving DOX, such minor variations were anticipated during therapy and were not considered clinically relevant. Since DOX has been linked to up to 40% of patients experiencing asymptomatic increases in liver enzymes, and because combining it with medications like cyclophosphamide seems to increase the risk of hepatotoxicity [ 72 73 74 75 76 Finally, while NT-proBNP and NF-κB showed consistent trends, the interpretation of sST2 remains inconclusive and should be approached as a promising marker warranting further investigations. The study also suggested the probable cardioprotective effect of ML especially in DOX-based regimen. However, several limitations should be considered. The statistical power and generalizability of our findings may have been restricted by the comparatively small sample size. In addition, the short duration of follow-up that prevented assessment of late-onset anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Furthermore, the absence of imaging-based modalities, such as echocardiography, to assess cardiotoxicity. Therefore, to validate our findings and provide a more comprehensive assessment of the role of ML against DIC in BC patients, recommendations for additional large-scale clinical trials with expanded sample sizes that incorporate other cardiac evaluation parameters and imaging are strongly warranted. Longer monitoring and follow-up times are also necessary to ascertain clinical parameters, the incidence of late cardiotoxicity, and survival outcomes. Furthermore, other relevant pathways such as apoptosis, fibrosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction were not thoroughly investigated and warrant further exploration. To properly evaluate the therapeutic potential of ML in this context and to validate the preliminary and exploratory nature of our findings, it is essential to address these gaps through larger, long-term clinical trials. Conclusion This research presented as preliminary significant evidence for the cardioprotective benefits of ML in breast cancer patients receiving DOX-based chemotherapy. According to the study results, ML effectively decreased NT-proBNP and NF-κB levels, indicating that it can mitigate inflammation and DIC. The significant reduction in sST2 levels may suggest a potential role in attenuating cardiac remodeling sST2. These findings also confirm the feasibility of incorporating ML as an adjunct therapy to enhance the safety of anthracycline-based regimens However, larger and longer-term studies are needed to evaluate the broader implications of ML on survival and treatment outcomes. This study lays the groundwork for future clinical trials to confirm ML's effectiveness and long-term safety in a variety of patients by highlighting it as a promising, low-cost, well-tolerated cardioprotective drug against DIC in BC patients to improve chemotherapy safety. Recommendations These findings are preliminary and need validation via other further studies with larger sample sizes and more cardiac evaluation parameters and imaging modalities. Likewise, to ascertain whether the protective benefits endure over time and whether they result in better long-term cardiovascular outcomes and survival rates, future studies should incorporate longer follow-up periods. Study limitations This study is limited by its small sample size, short follow-up period, and its dependance on few biomarkers without imaging support. Late-onset cardiotoxicity and additional mechanisms were not fully assessed, warranting larger, longer-term studies with broader evaluation tools. Further larger-scale, multi-center trials are essential before ML can be routinely recommended in this setting.
