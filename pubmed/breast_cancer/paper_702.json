Statins are commonly used for lowering cholesterol; however, evidence indicates that statins have multiple pleiotropic effects. Although statins are anticipated to exert neuroprotective actions against OIPN, no large‐scale investigations have been conducted in real‐world clinical settings. Our investigation aimed to determine if statins protected against OIPN. This multicentre retrospective study enrolled Japanese patients with cancer, including those with colorectal cancer (CRC), who received oxaliplatin‐containing chemotherapy between April 2009 and December 2019. Propensity score matching between groups was performed to assess the relationship between the occurrence of OIPN and statin use. Among the examined 2657 patients receiving oxaliplatin, 24.7% had Grade ≥ 2 OIPN. There was no significant difference in the incidence of OIPN between the statin and non‐statin groups, even after propensity score matching.

Study Highlights  What is the current knowledge on the topic? ○ Statins possess potential neuroprotective benefits against CIPN and OIPN; however, reports on the impacts of statins on CIPN in patients with CRC are inconsistent. What question did this study address? ○ We explored the effects of statins on OIPN in patients treated with oxaliplatin‐containing chemotherapy. What does this study add to our knowledge? ○ We found that statins reduced the incidence of Grade ≥ 2 OIPN in patients with CRC. How might this change clinical pharmacology or translational science? ○ Our findings support the conclusions suggesting statins as neuroprotective agents. 1 Introduction Chemotherapy‐induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common and serious adverse effect of anticancer drugs [ 1 2 2 Oxaliplatin is a cytotoxic, platinum‐based anticancer agent, most frequently used for the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). First‐line chemotherapy consisting of oxaliplatin with fluorouracil is offered to patients with initially unresectable microsatellite‐stable or proficient mismatch repair CRC [ 3 1 2 4 2 2 5 6 2 7 8 Despite the increased use of CIPN‐inducing agents such as oxaliplatin and taxane paclitaxel, supportive care for CIPN remains challenging because of difficulty in determining the efficacies of drug and nondrug therapies [ 2 6 9 2 6 10 11 Accumulating evidence suggests that statins, which are commonly used for lowering cholesterol, have multiple pleiotropic effects, including potential neuroprotective benefits against CIPN and OIPN. Preliminary studies indicate that statins, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin, can reduce mechanical allodynia in OIPN animal models [ 12 13 12 14 We therefore conducted a large multicentre retrospective study to explore the effect of statins on OIPN in patients treated with oxaliplatin‐containing chemotherapy, using propensity score matching. In particular, we examined the effect of statins on OIPN in patients with CRC, since oxaliplatin is most frequently used for this cancer type. 2 Methods 2.1 Ethical Considerations The study was conducted following the Basic & Clinical Pharmacology & Toxicology policy for experimental and clinical studies [ 15 2.2 Study Period and Participants A total of 2657 Japanese individuals aged > 18 years, who received oxaliplatin‐based chemotherapy at the 13 participating institutions between April 2009 and December 2019, were included in this study. The following exclusion criteria were applied: patients with previous use of oxaliplatin, peripheral neuropathy due to other agents or diseases, and patients who received nerve block therapy. 2.3 Survey Parameters The following data were collected from electronic medical records: patient age, sex, body mass index (BMI), medical history, cancer type, chemotherapy regimens, number of doses, initial and cumulative doses of oxaliplatin, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, concomitant medications, and medications for peripheral neuropathy and pain relief. The peripheral neuropathy was assessed based on data collected from electronic medical records written by physicians, pharmacists, and nurses; the grading was classified using JCOG, the Japanese translation of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (v4.0). The occurrence of chronic peripheral neuropathy (Grade ≥ 2 with symptoms lasting ≥ 1 week) and the timing of the first onset of peripheral neuropathy were analyzed retrospectively. Grade 2 CIPN was defined as pain/numbness or functional movement disorders that limited the instrumental activities of daily living. Patients were categorized into ‘statin’ and ‘non‐statin’ groups based on the continuous use of statins before initiating oxaliplatin treatment. Statin use was continued during chemotherapy. 2.4 Statistical Analyses Continuous and categorical patient background variables were analyzed using the Mann–Whitney U 2 p p p 16 3 Results 3.1 Patient Characteristics Among 2657 patients treated with oxaliplatin, 368 patients (14%) received statins prior to the initiation of and during the oxaliplatin‐containing regimen. The patient characteristics according to statin use are summarized in Table 1 TABLE 1 Clinical characteristics of patients in the statin and non‐statin groups.

They may involve upregulation of glutathione S‐transferase (GST), an enzyme involved in detoxification of oxidative stress and alleviating reactive compounds in cells, in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord, providing neuroprotection [ 12 12 12 24 25 26 27 28 13 29 30 Drug repositioning is a process of identifying new uses for existing drugs, outside their original indications [ 31 12 14 In addition to oxaliplatin, various anticancer drugs are neurotoxic and can cause peripheral neuropathy [ 1 2 9 32 Statins can be subgrouped according to their lipophilicity or cholesterol‐lowering potency. In this study, patients used six different statins, but the incidence of OIPN was similar in patients receiving the hydrophilic statin pravastatin (with a limited number of patients) compared with patients receiving lipophilic statins. The lipid‐lowering potency varies among statins [ 33 This study had some limitations. First, it was a retrospective study, and the assessment of CIPN was based on clinical records. The diagnosis of CIPN is based on the patient's clinical records, including the use of neuropathy‐inducing drugs and neurological symptoms [ 2 6 6 34 35 36 5 20 37 38 39 In conclusion, the current study found that statin use reduced the incidence of OIPN in patients with CRC. The use of statins might help to prevent OIPN; however, further prospective studies with matched patient backgrounds are warranted to confirm these findings.
