A significant proportion of these patients exhibit primary or acquired drug resistance, limiting improvements in the five-year survival rate. In this study, an analysis of patient-derived samples demonstrated a strong correlation between cholesterol levels and ovarian cancer progression. Membrane lipid therapy, a strategy that targets the composition, structure, and function of the cell membrane, has demonstrated notable potential in tumor therapy. Subsequently, a novel cholesterol oxidation-mediated membrane lipid therapy employing PLGA microspheres co-loaded with miriplatin (MiR) and cholesterol oxidase (COD) was proposed for drug-resistant advanced ovarian cancer therapy. The microspheres had a particle size of approximately 2.58 μm, with encapsulation efficiencies of 82.98 ± 0.09% for MiR and 32.83 ± 4.30% for COD. In vitro experiments demonstrated that COD-induced cholesterol oxidation modulated the membrane rigidity and fluidity of SKOV3-TR cells, thereby compromising membrane structural integrity and attenuating tumor cell migration. Additionally, the reactive oxygen species generated during cholesterol oxidation disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and adenosine triphosphate production. The resulting energy deficiency and compromised membrane integrity reduced the expression and function of drug resistance-associated proteins, thereby enhancing chemosensitivity. Moreover, the combined effects of reactive oxygen species and MiR drove resistant cells towards apoptosis. In vivo studies demonstrated that the large-particle PLGA formulation effectively resided in the peritoneal cavity, resulting in superior therapeutic outcomes against drug-resistant metastatic ovarian tumor, as evidenced by fewer peritoneal metastatic nodules and diaphragmatic colonization sites, more extensive tumor tissue destruction, and prolonged survival. More importantly, PLGA encapsulation significantly decreased the toxic side effects associated with continuous platinum-based chemotherapy. Overall, cholesterol oxidation-mediated membrane lipid therapy represented a promising approach for treating advanced ovarian cancer.

This complexity greatly hinders surgical resection, positioning chemotherapy as the primary treatment option for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. The standard first-line treatment typically involves a combination of paclitaxel and platinum-based chemotherapy. Unfortunately, approximately 20% of OC patients exhibit inherent resistance to this chemotherapy regimen, while about 80% develop secondary resistance during the course of treatment [ 1 2 2 Recent studies have demonstrated that the plasma membrane functions not only as a barrier to drug delivery but also as a critical target in cancer therapy [ 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Besides its association with tumor drug resistance, the metastatic potential of tumor cells is also closely linked to the physical properties of the plasma membrane [ 21 22 23 24 6 25 Cholesterol oxidase (COD) is a key enzyme involved in cholesterol metabolism and is widely utilized as a diagnostic agent for cholesterol detection in medical practice. It effectively catalyzes the selective oxidation of cholesterol, leading to the production of 4-cholesten-3-one and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 2 26 27 28 2 2 2+ 3+ 14 As a natural enzyme, COD may pose potential risks to normal tissues. Polylactic-hydroxyacetic acid copolymer (PLGA) is extensively utilized as a drug delivery carrier in clinical formulations owing to its multiple advantages. Compared to smaller nanocarriers such as liposomes or hexosomes, PLGA microspheres offer advantages for delivering hydrophilic macromolecules like COD. The polymeric matrix of PLGA provides effective protection for labile protein drugs and enables controlled, sustained release for long-term therapeutic effects. Moreover, the particle size and surface characteristics of PLGA microspheres may promote better adhesion to the peritoneal surface after intraperitoneal ( I.P.

The SKOV3-TR cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin solution. Female BALB/c nude mice, aged 4 to 6 weeks, were purchased from Shanghai SLACK Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and kept in the specific pathogen-free (SPF) facility at the Zhejiang University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Animal Experiment Center. Collection of retrospective data from OC patients This study analyzed the clinical data from 192 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), previously included in our published research cohort [ 29 Determination of cholesterol levels in patient tumor tissues In this study, 10 platinum-resistant and 10 platinum-sensitive patients were selected by a matched sampling approach based on age, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, and tumor grade, aiming to evaluate cholesterol levels in both serum and postoperative tumor tissues of ovarian cancer patients. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 20 EOC patients were subjected to Filipin fluorescence staining. The process of dewaxing and staining the samples was performed according to the reagent instructions, and the fluorescence intensity was subsequently examined under a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany). Fluorescence intensity of Filipin-stained sections was quantified using ImageJ software. Preparation and characterization of drug-loaded microspheres In this study, PLGA microspheres were prepared using a double emulsion method. The initial selection of the solvent, ultrasound power, and sonication time was guided by previously published protocols [ 30 31 via zeta Encapsulation efficiency determination and in vitro release study The encapsulation efficiency of PLGA microspheres was determined using a centrifugal method. Following the absorption of the supernatant, the concentration of COD in the supernatant was measured using a protein concentration determination kit, and the concentration of MiR in the supernatant was quantified by an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer (Agilent, USA). Finally, the encapsulation rates of PLGA microspheres for MiR and COD were calculated according to the following formulas: encapsulation efficiency (%) = (mass of encapsulated drug/mass of drug initially added during preparation) × 100%. The in vitro release study was conducted using the dialysis method. The freshly prepared PLGA@MiR&COD dispersed liquid was diluted with PBS solution to a total volume of 9 mL and then placed into a 10 mL dialysis tube (MWCO: 3500 Da). The tube was submerged in 500 mL of PBS at pH 7.4 with or without 10% FBS, or at pH 6.5 with 10% FBS, and incubated at 37°C with continuous shaking at 100 rpm. At predetermined time points (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h), 1 mL samples were withdrawn, and an equal volume of fresh PBS was added to maintain the volume. The collected samples were diluted to a final volume of 5 mL with 0.1 M HCl solution and subsequently filtered through a membrane prior to analysis. Platinum concentrations were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Calibration was conducted using a series of platinum standard solutions with concentrations of 0, 3.0, 6.0, 9.0, 15.0, 30.0, 60.0, and 120.0 µg/L. The resulting calibration curve demonstrated excellent linearity, with a correlation coefficient (R²) greater than 0.999. The detection limit for platinum was established at 0.01 µg/L. The release profile was then constructed based on these measurements. Hemolysis assay Fresh anticoagulated rat blood was centrifuged to remove plasma. The erythrocytes were washed three times with saline and resuspended to form a 2% (v/v) suspension. Samples were divided into five groups: pure water (positive control), saline (negative control), and test formulations at 25, 50, and 100 µg/mL. Each group was mixed with an equal volume of erythrocyte suspension and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. After centrifugation, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 545 nm. Hemolysis ratio = (OD T N P N T N P Cellular uptake and intracellular localization study The MiR was replaced with Cy5 to prepare Cy5-labeled PLGA microspheres (PLGA@Cy5). The SKOV3-TR cells were exposed to a culture medium with or without PLGA@Cy5 for 0.5, 1, 4, or 8 h. Fluorescence intensity was measured using flow cytometry (BD Biosciences, USA). The intracellular localization of PLGA@Cy5 was observed via Cytotoxicity analysis The cytotoxic effects of free MiR, free COD, the physical mixture of MiR and COD (MiR + COD), and PLGA@MiR&COD on SKOV3-TR cells were assessed using CCK-8 assays. The SKOV3-TR cells were exposed to free MiR, free COD, MiR + COD, or PLGA@MiR&COD for 24–48 h. After treatment, 15 µL of CCK-8 reagent (5 mg/mL) was added to each well, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm following a 2-hour incubation period. Measurement of membrane cholesterol content SKOV3-TR cells were exposed to various treatments, including drug-free medium, β-CD, free MiR, free COD, MiR + COD, or PLGA@MiR&COD-containing medium. The β-CD, widely recognized for its ability to deplete membrane cholesterol, was selected as a positive control in this study [ 32 Determination of membrane lipid raft levels SKOV3-TR cells were seeded in confocal chambers and cultured for 24 h. After that cells were treated with drug-free medium, free MiR, free COD, MiR + COD, or PLGA@MiR&COD, each containing MiR and/or COD. After 24 h of incubation, cells were then incubated with AF488-CTB (5 µg/mL) for 30 min, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and stained with DAPI for another 15 min. Membrane lipid raft levels were observed using CLSM. Examination of plasma membrane fluidity This study utilized the pyrene fluorescence method to measure the membrane fluidity of cells after different treatments. Following an overnight culture, the SKOV3-TR cells were exposed to either drug-free medium, free MiR, free COD, MiR + COD, or PLGA@MiR&COD-containing medium. After that, cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. Post-incubation, cells were subsequently incubated with 1-pyrenyldiacrylamide for 15 min. Membrane fluidity was determined based on the ratio of optical density values at 475 nm (aggregates) and 397 nm (monomers) using a Microplate Reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Quantification of p-gp mRNA and protein expression in SKOV3-TR cells SKOV3-TR cells were treated with drug-free medium, free MiR, free COD, MiR + COD, or PLGA@MiR&COD-containing medium for 24 h. Total RNA and protein were extracted using TRIzol reagent and RIPA buffer, respectively. For mRNA analysis, cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit, and quantitative real-time PCR was performed on a Bio-Rad PCR system (California, USA). The p-gp mRNA levels were determined using specific primers (forward: 5’-GGTTGCTGCTTACATTCAGGTTT-3’; reverse: 5’-CAGCCTATCTCCTGTCGCATTA-3’), with GAPDH as the internal control (forward: 5’-GGAAGCTTGTCATCAATGGAAATC-3’; reverse: 5’-TGATGACCCTTTTGGCTCCC-3’). For protein analysis, p-gp expression was assessed by Western blot using a specific antibody, with β-actin as the loading control. Measurement of intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species SKOV3-TR cells were plated in confocal chambers. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed using the DCFH-DA probe. Cells were incubated for 24 h with either drug-free medium or medium containing free MiR, free COD, a combination of MiR and COD, or PLGA@MiR&COD. After that, cells were incubated with DCFH-DA (10 µM) for 20 min and then analyzed using CLSM to capture fluorescence images. Determination of intracellular drug concentration SKOV3-TR cells were plated in 6-well plates. After 24 h of initial incubation, cells were exposed to drug-free medium, free MiR, MiR + COD, or PLGA@MiR&COD-containing medium, followed by an additional incubation period of 2–8 h. Upon completion of the co-incubation, the cells were digested, and 5 × 10 5 2 2 via Mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP level determination The changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential induced by different treatments were assessed using the JC-1 probe. SKOV3-TR cells were treated with drug-free medium, free MiR, free COD, MiR + COD, or PLGA@MiR&COD-containing medium. The concentration of COD and MiR was set at 40 µg/mL. After a 24-hour incubation with the agents, cells were stained with JC-1 solution (2 µM) and subsequently washed twice with cold PBS to remove excess dye. The samples were subsequently analyzed using CLSM, with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 530 nm for green fluorescence, and excitation at 525 nm and emission at 590 nm for red fluorescence. For intracellular ATP analysis, the SKOV3-TR cells were treated with drug-free medium, free MiR, free COD, MiR + COD, or PLGA@MiR&COD-containing medium. After co-incubation of the cells with the drugs for 12–24 h, a luminescent ATP detection assay kit was used to analyze the intracellular ATP level. Apoptosis analysis Apoptosis in SKOV3-TR cells was assessed using the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I. SKOV3-TR cells were treated with either drug-free medium, free MiR, free COD, MiR + COD, or a medium containing PLGA@MiR&COD for 24 h. Both COD and MiR were set at a concentration of 40 µg/mL. All subsequent procedures were performed according to the reagent instructions. Cell apoptosis was then analyzed by flow cytometry. Wound healing and transwell migration assay To synchronize the cells and reduce proliferation, SKOV3-TR cells were serum-starved in medium containing 0.5% FBS for 24 h. A linear scratch was then made across the cell monolayer using sterile 10 µL pipette tips. After washing with PBS to remove detached cells, the cultures were incubated in complete medium with (free MiR, free COD, MiR + COD, or PLGA@MiR&COD) or without drugs at 37°C in a 5% CO₂ incubator for 3 to 12 h. Wound closure was monitored using the brightfield mode of an inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica, Germany). To assess migration, SKOV3-TR cells were seeded into transwell inserts and incubated with 10% FBS in the lower chamber as a chemoattractant. After 24–48 h, migrated cells were fixed, stained, and counted under a microscope. Establishment of drug-resistant ovarian cancer peritoneal metastasis models A platinum-resistant ovarian cancer metastasis model was established by intraperitoneal injection of 2.0 × 10⁶ SKOV3-TR-luc cells into 5-week-old female BALB/c nude mice. Mice were housed under SPF conditions, and the model was used 12 days post-injection once the abdominal fluorescence intensity reached 1.0 × 10 8 In vivo pharmacodynamics study Mice were randomly divided into six groups ( n Determination of tumor tissue cholesterol and ROS levels The tumor tissue obtained from the animal experiment in each group was fixed with formalin and paraffin. Subsequently, the tissue samples were stained with DCFH-DA dye or Filipin fluorescent dye. Dewaxing and sample staining were performed according to the reagent instructions. The slides were then scanned and analyzed using a fluorescence slide scanner (Olympus, Japan). Quantitative RT-PCR for p-gp mRNA expression in tumor tissues To assess p-gp mRNA expression, one peritoneal metastatic tumor nodule was collected from each nude mouse, immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and homogenized in TRIzol reagent. Total RNA was then extracted, and cDNA was synthesized using a reverse transcription kit. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using a Bio-Rad PCR system (California, USA). The mRNA expression of p-gp was measured using specific primers (forward: 5’-TCTGGCATTCTGGTATGGGACT-3’; reverse: 5’-CTGGTTTGTGCCCACTCTTTG-3’), with GAPDH as the internal control (forward: 5’-CCTCGTCCCGTAGACAAAATG-3’; reverse: 5’-TGAGGTCAATGAAGGGGTCGT-3’). Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor tissues Tumor tissues were fixed, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned for H&E, TUNEL, and Ki67 staining. H&E staining followed standard procedures. TUNEL staining was performed using a commercial kit, with apoptotic cells visualized as red fluorescence after DAPI counterstaining. Ki67 immunohistochemistry involved antigen retrieval, blocking, incubation with primary antibody, and detection using the 3,3’-diaminobenzidine substrate kit, followed by hematoxylin counterstaining. All sections were imaged using a digital scanning microscope (Grundium, Finland). Serum toxicity evaluation To assess the serum toxicity of treatments, plasma samples from mice in all groups were analyzed. The concentrations of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the plasma were determined using a fully automated blood biochemical analyzer (Hitachi, Japan). Evaluation of major organ toxicity To assess normal tissue damage, the major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney) from each group in the pharmacodynamics analysis were harvested and weighed. The tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h, followed by sectioning and histological analysis using H&E and Masson’s trichrome staining to assess tissue morphology and fibrosis. Statistical analysis and mapping software The normality of continuous variables was assessed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. For comparisons between two groups, Student’s t U To evaluate the diagnostic or predictive performance of significant variables identified in previous comparative analyses, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were Generated. A variable was considered to have discriminative potential when the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the area under the curve (AUC) did not include 0.5. Trajectory analysis and visualization of repeatedly measured continuous data were conducted using Stata software (version 18.0; StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). Group comparisons involving more than two groups were performed using one-way analysis of variance with SPSS software (version 25.0; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). A two-tailed p p Results and discussion Clinical description of EOC patients Existing reports have documented elevated cholesterol levels in breast cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer [ 33 35 29 Serum cholesterol detection in EOC patients Among the 192 patients, a total of 172 underwent preoperative serum cholesterol evaluation. The serum cholesterol levels were measured in 101, 138, 134, 131, 127, and 116 patients before the first to sixth cycles of chemotherapy, respectively. Serum cholesterol levels decreased in both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant groups following the first chemotherapy cycle (Fig. 1 1 1 1 p 1 ( p p Fig. 1 Serum cholesterol levels in EOC patients with complete response ( A B C D E F G H I Cholesterol measurement in EOC tumor tissues The cholesterol measurement assay included 15 patients, comprising 8 with platinum-resistant tumors and 7 with platinum-sensitive tumors. After exclusion, no significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of FIGO stage, age, and tumor grade (Table S1). Filipin staining was employed to assess cholesterol levels in tumor tissues from both patient groups (Fig. 1 p Analysis of serum cholesterol levels predicts platinum resistance To reveal the changes in serum cholesterol levels during chemotherapy and their relationship with platinum sensitivity, this study conducted a trajectory analysis of serum cholesterol levels in patients with platinum-resistant and platinum-sensitive tumors. The computer simulation divided the patients in both groups into three categories based on their cholesterol levels: high (green line), medium (red line), and low (blue line). The findings demonstrated significant differences in cholesterol level changes between patients with platinum-sensitive tumors and those with platinum-resistant tumors (Fig. 1 Based on the cholesterol staining results of EOC tumors, we could also predict the resistance of EOC patients to platinum drugs using the ROC curve of Filipin fluorescence density (Fig. S4). When the cut-off value was set at 2.022, the Youden index reached its peak (marked by the arrow), exhibiting a sensitivity of 75.00% and specificity of 85.70%. Consequently, patients with tissue Filipin fluorescence density greater than 2.022 are more likely to develop platinum resistance. With an increasing number of patients, the two predictive models will emerge as valuable tools for anticipating drug resistance and assessing clinical outcomes, thus informing and optimizing treatment strategies. The above results demonstrated that cholesterol levels in ovarian cancer tissues of platinum-resistant patients were higher than those of platinum-sensitive patients. Therefore, regulating the level of plasma membrane cholesterol may represent a potential strategy for managing advanced ovarian cancer with drug-resistant features. Preparation and characterization of drug-loaded PLGA microspheres While cisplatin and carboplatin are standard platinum-based agents for ovarian cancer, their use in recurrent or platinum-resistant cases is often limited by cumulative toxicities such as nephrotoxicity and gastrointestinal side effects. Miriplatin, a lipophilic second-generation platinum compound, was developed to reduce these adverse effects and has been approved in several countries, including Japan, as an alternative to conventional platinum drugs [ 36 38 2 2 3 3 3 zeta zeta 3 Fig. 2 Schematic illustration of PLGA@MiR&COD preparation ( A B C D E Fig. 3 ( A B C via zeta D E F G H I n Encapsulation efficiency determination and in vitro release study PLGA@MiR&COD achieved an encapsulation efficiency of 82.98 ± 0.09% for MiR and 32.83 ± 4.30% for COD. In the PLGA@MiR&COD formulation, the mass ratio of MiR to COD was 1.01. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis revealed that, under equal COD loading conditions, the intensity of the protein band (55 kDa) in the freshly prepared PLGA@MiR&COD group (lane 3) was markedly lower than that in the free COD group (lane 2), indicating successful encapsulation of COD into PLGA microspheres (Fig. 3 The in vitro release study demonstrated that PLGA@MiR&COD exhibited sustained drug release behavior, with cumulative release rates at 48 h reaching 57.1 ± 7.7% in pH 7.4 without FBS, 51.6 ± 5.4% in pH 7.4 with 10% FBS, and 63.5 ± 9.8% in pH 6.5 with 10% FBS (Fig. 3 Cellular uptake and intracellular localization Figure 4 4 Micron-sized PLGA particles are primarily internalized via 39 40 41 Cellular toxicity analysis As displayed in Fig. 4 50 50 4 4 Fig. 4 ( A B n C D E F 50 p p p p Evaluation of cholesterol and lipid raft levels of plasma membrane To elucidate the mechanism underlying the enhanced cytotoxicity of the formulations, Filipin staining was used to assess cellular cholesterol levels, where increased blue fluorescence indicated higher cholesterol content.

Cholesterol and sphingolipids are essential for the formation of lipid raft microdomains, which support the structural integrity and membrane localization of receptors like Toll-like receptor 4 and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2b [ 46 47 48 49 Lipid rafts enriched in cholesterol also support receptor recycling, helping maintain surface expression of receptors such as brassinosteroid-insensitive 1 and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 [ 47 50 17 51 Plasma membrane fluidity evaluation Reduced cholesterol levels and disrupted lipid rafts can alter the structural properties of the tumor cell membrane [ 6 5 Analysis of drug-resistant protein and intracellular drug concentration Cholesterol modulates the rigidity and fluidity of lipid rafts, influencing the conformation and function of embedded proteins like p-gp, and facilitating the export of chemotherapeutic agents [ 52 53 54 5 p 5 Intracellular ROS level detection The H 2 2 2+ 3+ 14 5 Fig. 5 CLSM images of cholesterol ( A B C n D E n F n G H p p p p p p p p p p Mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptosis analysis Compared to the MiR group, the intracellular red fluorescence of J-aggregates in the MiR + COD group and PLGA@MiR&COD group was reduced (Fig. 5 55 6 p 6 Fig. 6 Intracellular ATP levels ( A B n C D p p p p p p p p p p p The above cytological studies demonstrated how cholesterol oxidation-mediated membrane lipid therapy enhanced the sensitivity of platinum-resistant OC cells (as shown in Fig. 2 In vitro wound healing and transwell experiments To assess the impact of PLGA@MiR&COD on the metastasis and invasion of SKOV3-TR cells, wound healing and transwell assays were conducted. The results demonstrated that the cell migration rate in the MiR monotherapy group was similar to that in the control group (Fig. 6 6 Pharmacodynamic analysis Chemotherapy is typically administered intravenously or orally, but the blood-peritoneal barrier limits drug delivery to the peritoneal cavity [ 56 I.P. I.P. 57 58 The experimental design is detailed in Fig. S10A. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the synergistic therapeutic effect of MiR and COD. To align with ethical principles and minimize animal usage, the COD-loaded PLGA formulation was not included in the experimental design. Before the establishment of the peritoneal metastasis model, the background fluorescence in nude mice was negligible (Fig. S10B). Between days 12 and 20, there was a substantial increase in fluorescence intensity across all groups (Fig. 7 7 7 7 7 Fig. 7 Bioluminescence images ( A B n C D E F n G n p p p p p These findings demonstrated that PLGA@MiR&COD exhibited the most superior therapeutic effect among all treatment groups, showing its profound therapeutic effect on animals with drug-resistant OC metastasis.

Notably, the PLGA@MiR&COD group exhibited the lowest Ki67 positivity rate (Fig. 8 59 Effects of plga@mir&cod on septal tumor colonization A notable phenomenon observed in this study was the unique colonization pattern of SKOV3-TR cells in the diaphragm. Compared to the saline group, the area and mass of OC colonization in the diaphragm decreased in all drug treatment groups, with the PLGA@MiR&COD treatment group exhibiting the smallest membrane mass and overall mass (Fig. 8 Serological biosafety assessment Nephrotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and ototoxicity are common adverse reactions associated with platinum-based chemotherapy for OC, which seriously affect the life quality of patients [ 60 61 62 I.P. 9 9 Fig. 9 Serum ALT ( A B C n D n E ( F G ) H ( I n J p p Evaluation of normal tissue damage The body weight and the mass of key organs, such as the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney, were evaluated to determine the toxicity effects of the treatments (Fig. 9 Subsequently, the primary organs from mice in each group were harvested and subjected to H&E staining to assess potential organ toxicity (Fig. 9 After treated with MiR + COD, the local interstitial thickened and fibrosis appeared. Many cardiomyocytes lost their normal morphology, resulting in heart tissue necrosis (Fig. 9 via Normal tissue fibrosis toxicity assessment Masson staining was conducted on heart and spleen tissue sections to assess the fibrotic side effects induced by the drugs. As depicted in Fig. S19, the heart tissue of the MiR + COD group showed serious fibrosis, while the free MiR group and PLGA@MiR group displayed mild fibrosis. In addition, the MiR + COD group showed pronounced myocardial tissue edema, with a blurred interface and more severe inflammatory infiltration. In contrast, no evident myocardial tissue fibrosis was observed in the saline, free COD, and PLGA@MiR&COD groups. In the Masson-stained sections of spleen tissue, the fibrosis induced by different treatments was not obvious, with the free MiR and PLGA@MiR groups showing only mild spleen fibrosis (Fig. S20). The safety evaluation results demonstrated that the MiR and MiR + COD groups experienced significant damage to normal tissue. In contrast, encapsulating MiR within PLGA effectively reduced the exposure of normal tissue to high concentration of drugs, thereby minimizing toxic side effects. The study presented in this section demonstrated that PLGA@MiR&COD could mitigate the toxicity and side effects associated with MiR significantly. Nevertheless, the safety of all drug formulations must be thoroughly validated before clinical translation. Conclusion Retrospective analysis of EOC patients revealed a progressive increase in serum cholesterol levels during the first six chemotherapy cycles, with higher tissue cholesterol levels observed in platinum-resistant tumor tissues compared to platinum-sensitive ones. These findings highlighted the potential of targeting plasma membrane cholesterol as a therapeutic strategy for advanced ovarian cancer. The designed PLGA@MiR&COD restored the sensitivity of drug-resistant ovarian cancer cells to MiR and inhibited metastatic colonization by inducing cholesterol oxidation in the plasma membrane. Therefore, PLGA@MiR&COD exhibited satisfactory therapeutic effects on advanced ovarian cancer. Moreover, the preparation reduced MiR-associated adverse effects. In summary, this study proposed a clinically relevant and innovative therapeutic strategy based on cholesterol-targeted membrane lipid therapy, laying a promising foundation for future translational research and personalized treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.
