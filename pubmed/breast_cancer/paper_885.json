However, there are individual differences and not everyone exposed to stress or adversity early during development develops chronic adult disease. Insulin regulates peripheral glucose metabolism, acts as a neuromodulator in the brain, and is possibly implicated in individual differences in response to early adversity. Expression-based polygenic scores (ePRS) reflect variations in the expression of a tissue-specific gene co-expression network. We have previously shown that brain-based insulin receptor ePRS (ePRS-IR) can identify risk for metabolic and frailty outcomes in older adults. Here, we show that the mesocorticolimbic ePRS-IR moderates the association between early adversity and increased visceral adipose tissue as well as metabolic syndrome in a large sample of adult women (UK Biobank). These findings suggest that variations in the function of the brain insulin receptor network influence the susceptibility to the long-term effects of adversity, highlighting a target system for prevention and novel treatments. How the brain responds to early-life stress may shape future health: individual differences in the expression of an insulin receptor gene network in the prefrontal cortex and striatum influence the risk of visceral fat accumulation and metabolic syndrome, especially in women exposed to early-life stress.

Genes with an absolute co-expression correlation r > |0.5 | in PFC and in STR were identified using GeneNetwork 19 25 26 20 We characterized the ePRS-IR-PFC-STR gene network by identifying its structure and hub-bottleneck genes using Cytoscape. Gene-gene interaction data were obtained through GeneMANIA. Centrality measures of each gene were calculated using Centiscape 2.2. From the original input dataset of 263 genes, GeneMANIA generated a human network comprising most of them – 258 genes – suggesting that indeed the score reflects a highly co-expressed network in humans.

This score was calculated by assigning positive points (+ 1) for each supportive/enriching experience and negative points (−1) for the adversity experiences, with the final score obtained by summing these values. The resulting score reflects the overall quality of the early environment, where more negative values indicate a predominantly adverse environment, and more positive values represent a supportive/enriching environment 30 As expected, our results demonstrate that greater exposure to early life adversity, reflected by a more negative composite early life exposure score, is associated with increased VAT and abdominal SAT adipose tissue volumes, as well as a higher risk of metabolic syndrome. These associations were observed in the overall sample and were consistent across both women and men (Table 3 3 5 6 Table 3 Main effect Total sample Women Men n β SE P n β SE P n β SE P Predictor: Composite early life exposure score VAT volume, L 2169 −0.10 0.02 4.98E-05 1292 −0.09 0.02 1.12E-04 877 −0.11 0.05 2.47E-02 Abdominal SAT volume, L 2169 −0.20 0.04 5.51E-07 1292 −0.24 0.06 1.23E-05 877 −0.11 0.05 4.58E-02 Metabolic syndrome 32017 −0.08 0.01 5.67E-26 20239 −0.08 0.01 4.96E-17 11778 −0.08 0.01 1.45E-10 Predictor: ePRS-IR-PFC-STR VAT volume, L 2169 5.45E-06 0.04 1.00e + 00 1292 0.005 0.04 9.16E-01 877 0.04 0.08 6.58E-01 Abdominal SAT volume, L 2169 −0.01 0.07 8.38E-01 1292 0.05 0.10 6.53E-01 877 −0.11 0.09 2.28E-01 Metabolic syndrome 32017 0.01 0.01 5.09E-01 20239 0.03 0.02 1.01E-01 11778 −0.02 0.02 3.83E-01 Associations between composite early life exposure score and ePRS-IR-PFC-STR on risk factors for chronic non-communicable diseases in the UK Biobank cohort.

VAT SAT FDR-P As supplementary analyses, we conducted Generalized Estimating Equations to examine whether the ePRS-IR-PFC-STR moderates the association between early life exposure and dietary intake variables. A significant interaction effect was observed between the ePRS-IR-PFC-STR and early life exposure on the percentage of energy derived from fat in women ( β β β β β 11 12 Discussion In a large adult cohort, we utilized a well-characterized expression-based polygenic score targeting the mesocorticolimbic insulin receptor gene co-expression network to examine individual variability in insulin signaling. Our findings reveal that variations in this gene network interact with early-life stress, increasing visceral fat accumulation, metabolic syndrome risk, and a high daily energy intake from fat in adult women from the UK Biobank. These insights contribute to the identification of potential targets for intervention and disease prevention. We observed that greater early-life adversity exposure was associated with increased visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue volumes, as well as a higher risk of metabolic syndrome. Previous research has shown that exposure to early life adversity is associated with elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers and increased insulin resistance in adults 4 32 3 33 30 Our analyses did not reveal a significant main effect of the ePRS-IR-PFC-STR on central fat accumulation or metabolic syndrome. In contrast, we have reported that a greater mesocorticolimbic ePRS-IR was linked to lower IGF-1 in women 21 19 21 22 21 21 20 This study focused on the PFC and STR ePRS-IR and included an extended metabolic syndrome definition that considers C-reactive protein (CRP) as an inflammatory marker to comprehensively evaluate risk factors for chronic non-communicable diseases. These outcomes were chosen based on their well-documented association with type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease 34 35 36 Although BMI and waist circumference are easier to collect in large cohorts, they are limited in their ability to distinguish between different fat compartments. In addition, while simple anthropometric measures such as BMI, weight, and waist circumference are useful for screening, the UK Biobank provides more precise and comprehensive imaging-based measures 37 38 39 40 41 Potential processes linking early life adversity and adult metabolic alterations involve behavioral alterations such as increased preference for palatable foods and poor behavioral inhibition 42 43 44 46 47 42 43 48 15 49 7 8 50 51 52 53 19 46 54 58 23 Sex differences in central fat distribution have been well-documented, with men exhibiting higher levels of visceral fat, while women tend to have greater subcutaneous abdominal fat 59 60 4 61 4 62 63 64 65 66 The brain specificity of our ePRS-IR-PFC-STR score, as well as its distinction from broader insulin signaling across brain regions and peripheral tissues, has been previously established. Hari et al. showed that genes within the ePRS-IR-PFC-STR are highly co-expressed in the PFC and STR, whereas genes identified in fasting insulin GWAS showed less consistent co-expression in these brain regions 19 19 19 20 22 23 This study used data from the UK Biobank, which is a large database including sophisticated methods to determine visceral adipose tissue 67 68 70 20 23 24 30 71 73 19 24 74 Our study provides evidence supporting the role of gene-environment interactions in the development of risk factors for chronic non-communicable diseases, which are among the leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and disability worldwide. Our results reinforce previous research linking early life exposure to central fat accumulation, excessive weight, inflammatory/metabolic biomarkers, metabolic syndrome and its components. Additionally, we present novel evidence showing that individual variations in mesocorticolimbic insulin receptor gene network interact with early life stress, thereby increasing visceral fat accumulation, metabolic syndrome and a high percentage of daily energy intake from fat in adults. Notably, our consistently stronger effects in women versus men suggest sex-specific differences, with women exhibiting more adverse outcomes than men. We have conceptualized our findings and discussion in Fig. 4 Fig. 4 Conceptual framework. Gene-environment interactions influencing risk factors for non-communicable diseases. A co-expression network involving the insulin receptor in the prefrontal cortex and striatum interacts with early life environment (with adversity exposures written in red and supportive influences written in green), influencing visceral fat accumulation and risk for metabolic syndrome, particularly in adult women. The emergence of these risk factors may increase the likelihood of developing adult non-communicable diseases. Altered eating behaviors, such as increased dietary fat intake, may contribute to the development of these adverse health outcomes. This figure was created using BioRender ( https://biorender.com/ Methods UK Biobank cohort Analyses were conducted using data from adult participants in the UK Biobank cohort. UK Biobank is a large population-based study that enrolled over 500,000 participants aged 37–73 years between 2006 and 2010 through 22 assessment centers across the United Kingdom. At baseline, they collected data in person using questionnaires and physical measures on sociodemographics, family history and early life exposures, lifestyle, anthropometrics, biochemical assays, and genotyping for the entire cohort 29 29 Genotyping Blood samples from UK Biobank were genotyped at the Affymetrix Research Services Laboratory in Santa Clara, California, USA. Genotyping was conducted using a bespoke BiLEVE Axiom array for 50,000 participants, and the remaining 450,000 participants were genotyped using the Affymetrix UK Biobank Axiom array. The two SNP arrays are very similar, with over 95% shared marker content. Axiom Array plates were processed on the Affymetrix GeneTitan® Multi-Channel Instrument. Genotypes were then called from the resulting intensities in batches of ~4700 samples (~4800 including the controls) using the Affymetrix Power Tools software and the Affymetrix Best Practices Workflow. Individuals with the same genotype at any given SNP will cluster together in a two-dimensional intensity space (one dimension for each targeted allele). For the interim data release, Affymetrix performed further rounds of genotype calling using algorithms customized for the UK Biobank project. These algorithms targeted very rare SNPs with 6 or fewer minor alleles in a batch and a subset of SNPs for which the generic calling algorithm did not perform optimally. After genotype calling, Affymetrix performed quality control in each batch separately to exclude SNPs with poor cluster properties. If an SNP did not meet the Affymetrix-prescribed quality control (QC) thresholds in a given batch, it was set to missing in all individuals from that batch. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was performed for each batch. Affymetrix also checked sample quality (such as DNA concentration), and genotype calls were provided only for samples with sufficient DNA metrics. For SNP-based QC metrics, only individuals with similar ancestry and population structure were characterized by computing principal components using only UK Biobank individuals. The array also includes coding variants across a range of minor allele frequencies (MAFs), including rare markers (<1% MAF) and markers that provide good genome-wide coverage for imputation in European populations in common (>5%) and low-frequency (1–5%) MAF ranges. Genotyping was available for 488,175 subjects. We excluded participants who withdrew their consent, participants without genotyping data, related participants (genetic kinship to other participants > 0.04), subjects with inconsistencies in genetic and reported sex, and outliers for heterozygosity. There were 339,255 unrelated subjects. From the subsample of related subjects (147,579 participants) we selected one participant per each group of related participants (genetic relatedness < 0.025) based on genomic relationship matrix (calculated using Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA 1.93.2), adding 65,944 subjects to the unrelated subset, which resulted in 405,199 unrelated subjects considered for the analyses. Population structure The population structure was evaluated using the fastPCA algorithm for principal component analysis (PC) 75 76 Characterization of the early life environment Early life environment exposure was assessed using a previously established composite score, which has been validated in gene-environment interaction studies 77 30 78 79 13 https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/ Visceral and abdominal subcutaneous fat accumulation Magnetic Resonance Imagining (MRI) was used to obtain the VAT and abdominal SAT adipose tissue volumes as previously reported 67 80 80 80 81 Metabolic syndrome Metabolic syndrome was defined according to the 2009 Harmonized Criteria, using established thresholds for each component 82 83 84 1c 85 86 87 1c 14 Absolute values (mmol/L) of triglycerides and HDL-C, as well as HbA 1c 68 70 For the analyses presented in this manuscript, all participants with data on genotyping, early life exposure measures, outcomes, and covariates were included. Expression-based polygenic risk score The ePRS calculation was informed by the gene co-expression network of the insulin receptor in the PFC and STR, and we used the same gene list from the previous work where we identified and characterized this co-expression network 19 22 http://genenetwork.org r http://brainspan.org 19 22 19 20 22 25 26 Gene network structure The gene network structure was constructed using GeneMANIA and Centiscape within the Cytoscape platform based on 263 genes included in the ePRS-IR-PFC-STR. First, using co-expression interaction data derived from all studies available in the GeneMANIA database and using the Homo sapiens (human) dataset, correlation values between genes included were obtained. Then, Centiscape 2.2 was used to compute degree and betweenness centrality metrics, and these were applied to characterize the network structure and evaluate the relative importance of nodes. Betweenness centrality quantifies the frequency with which a node acts as a bridge along the shortest paths between two other nodes, highlighting its role in facilitating communication across the network. Nodes with high betweenness are critical bottlenecks or key connectors. Degree centrality represents the total number of direct connections (edges) associated with a node, identifying nodes with a high level of connectivity. An undirected network configuration was employed for the analysis. The network visualization was generated based on the degree of nodes and edges. Nodes with higher degrees were emphasized using darker colors and increased node size to enhance interpretability. This approach enabled the identification of key genes and their potential roles within the network structure, providing insights into their functional significance. Topological properties of the gene network The topological properties of the gene network were analyzed to identify hub and bottleneck genes using degree and betweenness centrality metrics. Hub genes were defined as nodes with a degree value greater than 1 SD above the mean. These genes represent highly connected critical points in the network, influencing a large number of other genes or proteins. Bottleneck genes were identified as nodes with betweenness centrality values exceeding 1 SD above the mean. These genes act as key bridges, facilitating communication between distinct regions or modules of the network. Hub-bottleneck genes were classified as nodes with both high degree and high betweenness centrality, representing genes that are not only highly connected but also strategically positioned to integrate and regulate network communication. These analyses provide insights into the structural and functional importance of specific genes within the network, highlighting their potential roles in coordinating biological processes. Functional annotation To investigate the biological relevance of the genes included in the ePRS-IR-PFC-STR, we used the GENE2FUNC module of the Functional Mapping and Annotation of Genome-Wide Association Studies (FUMA GWAS) platform 88 89 Reporting summary Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary Statistics and Reproducibility Descriptive statistics of baseline characteristics Mean (SD) or number (percentage) for continuous and categorical variables, respectively, for the whole group and separately for women and men were reported; comparisons by sex were made using Student´s t Main effect analyses We performed multiple linear and logistic regression analyses to examine the association between the ePRS-IR-PFC-STR or early life exposure and the outcomes. Covariates were added to the model as it is shown here: VAT, abdominal SAT or metabolic syndrome ~ sex + age + PC1 to PC40 + Townsend deprivation index (TDI) + genotype array + assessment center + ePRS-IR-PFC-STR or Moderation analyses We employed multiple linear and logistic regression analyses to examine the moderating effect of the ePRS-IR-PFC-STR on the association between early life exposure and the outcomes. We included an interaction term between ePRS-IR-PFC-STR and the composite early life exposure score. When the interaction effect was significant, we conducted simple slope analyses. ePRS-IR-PFC-STR slopes at +1 SD and −1 SD representing the high and low groups, respectively. Covariates were added to the model as it is shown here: VAT, abdominal SAT or metabolic syndrome ~ sex + age PC1 to PC40 TDI + genotype array + assessment center ePRS-IR-PFC-STR + composite early life exposure score ePRS-IR-PFC-STR* The same analyses were performed separately for women and men to explore whether there is a sex-dependent effect. We performed multiple linear regression analyses in the full datasets. A p p 90 Supplementary analyses To further support the hypothesis that behavioral alterations, such as increased preference for palatable foods, connect early life adversity to adult metabolic outcomes, we examined interaction effects of the ePRS-IR-PFC-STR and early life exposure on dietary intake variables. Dietary intake was assessed using 24-h dietary recalls and the web-based tool Oxford WebQ. From these assessments, we calculated macronutrient intake as the percentage of energy (%E) from carbohydrates, fat, and protein. Participants with at least one 24-h recall were included, and all recalls collected during instances 0 to 4 and reported as “non-special occasions” were considered. Detailed procedures for data collection and variable computation have been described previously 91 93 To account for potential dietary misreporting, we calculated the ratio of energy intake to estimated energy requirement (EI:EER ratio) and included it as a covariate, following previously established methods 94 95 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${{\\mathrm{EER}}}\\,{{\\mathrm{men}}} = \t \\;662-(9.53\\times {{\\mathrm{age}}}[{{\\mathrm{years}}}])+PA\\\\ \t\\times (15.91\\times {{\\mathrm{weight}}}[{{\\mathrm{kg}}}]+539.6\\times {{\\mathrm{height}}}[m]),$$\\end{document} EER men = 662 − ( 9.53 × age [ years ] ) + P A × ( 15.91 × weight [ kg ] + 539.6 × height [ m ] ) , \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${{\\mathrm{EER}}}\\,{{\\mathrm{women}}} = \t \\;354 - (6.91\\times {{\\mathrm{age}}}[{{\\mathrm{years}}}])+PA \\\\ \t \\times(9.36\\times {{\\mathrm{weight}}}[{{\\mathrm{kg}}}])+726\\times {{\\mathrm{height}}}[m]\\left)\\right.,$$\\end{document} EER women = 354 − ( 6.91 × age [ years ] ) + P A × ( 9.36 × weight [ kg ] ) + 726 × height [ m ] , Statistical analyses were conducted using GEE to account for repeated measures. The following covariates were included in the models: sex, age, genetic PCs 1 to 40 (PC1–PC40), genotype array, assessment center, EI:EER ratio, and body mass index (BMI). The full model used was specified as follows: Dietary outcomes ~ sex + age PC1 to PC40 + genotype array + assessment center EI:EER ratio BMI ePRS-IR-PFC-STR + composite early life exposure score ePRS-IR-PFC-STR* An interaction term between ePRS-IR-PFC-STR and the composite early life exposure score was included. Where a significant interaction was observed, simple slope analyses were conducted by estimating the effect of early life adversity at +1 SD and −1 SD of the ePRS-IR-PFC-STR distribution, representing high and low genetic risk, respectively. Models were run in the full dataset and stratified by sex (women and men). A p Ethical aspects Informed written consent was obtained from all participants of the UK Biobank cohort.
