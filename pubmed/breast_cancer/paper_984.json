To that end, chemical reactivity profiling in binary/ternary systems was investigated synthetically, revealing unique structural correlations between mononuclear (Ti(IV)-Chr) and tetranuclear assemblies (Ti(IV)-Chr-phen). Chemical profiling involved physicochemical characterization through elemental analysis, FT-IR, UV–Visible, 1D-2D NMR, ESI-MS spectrometry, solid-state luminescence, and X-ray crystallography, with theoretical work on intra(inter)molecular interactions of 3D assemblies pursued through Hirshfeld analysis and BVS calculations.

Introduction Inflammation is an essential biological process in the human immune system [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 In this context, natural products come into the forefront of research, as potential candidates of protective therapeutics, with the family of polyphenols exhibiting high biological activity against oxidative stress linked to inflammation and bacterial invasion. Representative molecules of that family are flavonoids [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 19 20 21 22 23 24 Based on the above grounds, the herein presented work focuses on the development of hybrid metal–organic compounds of Ti(IV) and Chr, in binary formation or ternary assemblies involving N,N’-organic chelators, exemplifying key binding motifs capable of interacting with (sub)cellular targets, thereby affecting their state of cell physiology or disease. The synthetically isolated crystalline materials are well-characterized in the solid-state and in solution, as discrete species, with their conversion chemical reactivity supporting the broad structural speciation in the studied binary and ternary systems, further supplementing the experimentally derived profile through theoretical calculations. The collective experimental data justify further inquiry of the emerging materials as potential antibacterial (Gram(−) ( E. coli S. aureus 2. Results 2.1.

The latter molecule is also interacting with the hydrogen from the second bound methanol molecule, finally giving rise to an extended 3D lattice, as shown in Figure 1 Compound 2 Figure 2 P 2 n Figure 2 2 Table 2 Figure 2 2.4. Hirshfeld Surface Analysis In order to investigate and further evaluate the solid-state structural properties emanating from the aforementioned structures and 3D assemblies, Hirshfeld surface analysis has been pursued for the delineation of intermolecular and intramolecular interactions. Interactions were visualized through 3D mapping, using d norm Figure 3 1 norm Figure 3 25 26 Figure 3 Figure 3 In the case of the tetranuclear assembly of the ternary Ti(IV)-Chr-phen ( Figure 4 Figure 4 Specifically, the phenolic group of the metal-bound Chr, as shown in d norm Figure 4 1 2 Figure 5 The most dominant interactions correspond to H···H contacts, shown as diffuse areas of blue points in the deconvoluted plot, comprising 50.8% of the binary and 55.6% of the ternary system. Moreover, a pair of wings (blue area) point out the contribution of C–H···C interactions reaching 11.0% (Ti(IV)-Chr) and 16.1% (Ti(IV)-Chr-phen). In the case of the Ti(IV)-Chr assembly, there is a characteristic pair of sharp spikes (blue area) attributed to H···Cl interactions with the bound and/or lattice chloride ion at a level of 15.7%, as shown in Figure S1 2.5.

Cytotoxicity Results 2.12.1. Cell Viability The new metal–organic compounds were investigated for their (a) toxicity profile ( Figure 12 Figure 13 1 2 Figures S7 and S8 1 2 Figure 12 Figure 13 2 Specifically, the cancerous MCF7 cell line reveals atoxicity in DMSO solution (80–89% survival) compared to the control group, whereas 1% Triton X solution reveals significant cytotoxicity with 2–6% survival depending on the exposure time. With respect to hybrid material 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 As for the ligand cytotoxicity, Chr at 10 μM reveals a slight cytotoxicity in the MCF7 cell line, with the survival rate being in the range 67–75% in all exposure times (24–48–72 h). Increasing the Chr concentration to 40 μM raises the cytotoxicity, revealing a reduced survival to 56–57% at 24 h and 48 h, and 42% at 72 h. Similarly, incubation of the cells with 40 μM phen exhibits significant time-dependent cytotoxicity, with the survival rates at 24 h and 48 h being 69% and 63%, respectively, whereas incubation for 72 h drops the survival rate to 49%. Finally, in the physiological MCF10A cell line, incubation with 10 μM Chr reveals slight cytotoxicity only in the 72 h phase (83% survival rate), with an adaptation period of 24 h, whereas at the same time, increasing the concentration to 40 μM increases cytotoxicity in the shorter incubation phases (83% in 48 h and 54% in 72 h), with the same adaptation period of 24 h as in the case of the 10 μM Chr. Finally, incubating MCF10A cells with 40 μM phen reveals significant cytotoxicity, with survival rates at 31% and 36% at 48 h and 72 h, respectively, whereas, for the 24 h viability reduction, that might be caused either by adaptation of the cells or cell cytotoxicity in this time period. Moving to the lung tissue and, specifically, the physiological MRC-5 cell line, there is no significant impairment of the survival rate in any of the exposure times tested (24, 48, and 72 h) following incubation of the cells with DMSO, or compound 1 2 1 Regarding compound 2 Summarizing the viability results, it can be stated that breast tissue cell cultures reveal reduced viability of the physiological phenotype cell line (MCF10A), compared to the cancer cell line (MCF7), whereas, on the other hand, the physiological lung tissue cell line (MRC-5) has a greater adaptation period compared to the cancerous cell line (A549), with increased viability at the end of the incubation period (72 h). Interestingly, both physiological cell lines (MCF10A and MRC-5) have an adaptation period of nearly 48 h, under specific treatment conditions, during which they reveal reduced metabolic activity, with the MRC-5 case being more evident.

Structural Speciation of Ti(IV)-Flavonoid Compounds Metal–organic compounds are increasingly attracting the attention of the scientific community as promising biologically active materials in the field of treating heterogeneous diseases, such as cancer. It is well-known that many cases of cancer are linked to inflammation and mostly to chronic inflammation associated with oxidative stress. Addressing targeted therapies toward designated tumor tissues, without affecting healthy tissues and concurrently minimizing or eliminating side-effects, is a great challenge in the field of biomolecular engineering linked to the synthesis of new pharmaceutical agents bearing such properties. In that respect, in the herein presented study, titanium(IV) was selected as the metal center of purportedly bioactive new metalloforms bearing antioxidant flavonoids. Ti(IV) is a non-platinum metal ion, which has been shown to exhibit antitumor activity through different ways of biochemical reactivity [ 41 It appears that Ti(IV) is isoelectronic to V(V) (3d 0 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 Synthetic investigations were carried out in alcoholic media investigating the aforementioned binary and ternary systems, with an optimized molar stoichiometry of Ti(IV):Chr 5:1 and Ti(IV):Chr:phen 1:1:1, respectively. In the case of the binary system, a mononuclear assembly was isolated [Ti(C 15 9 4 3 3 2 3 1 4 4 15 9 4 4 12 8 2 4 4 3 3 2 2 3 4 1 2 1 2 3.2. Theoretical Interactions and Solid-Solution Properties To further understand the properties of the structural assemblies of Ti(IV)-Chr ( 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 The presence of the Chr flavonoid bound to the metal center as well as the phen chelator was verified through FT-IR and the UV–Visible electronic patterns. Specifically, shifts related to the carbonyl group of the flavonoid are depicted in the FT-IR spectra, showing a shift of 19 cm −1 1 −1 2 −1 2 Figure 6 1 2 1 1 Figure 7 13 2 1 13 Figure S4A,B 1 1 1 13 Figure 7 Figure S4A 1 13 21 22 28 3.3.

To that end, the anti-inflammatory activity of Ti(IV)-Chr ( 1 2 50 Both compounds exhibited significant inhibition of BSA denaturation in a concentration-dependent manner (0.001 μg/mL–20 μg/mL), with maximum inhibition observed at 0.364 ± 0.031 μg/mL in the case of Ti(IV)-Chr ( 1 2 3.4.

Physical Measurements Quantitative determination of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen was pursued using a ThermoFinnigan Flash EA 1112 CHNS elemental analyzer (Thermo Fisher scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) with a dynamic flash combustion of samples at 1800 °C. Further rapid determination of the products was evaluated through reduction, trapping, complete GC separation, and detection in a fully automated manner and controlled by PC via the Eager 300 dedicated software system. FT-Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet FT-IR 200 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA), using KBr pellets, at room temperature conditions. UV–Visible spectroscopy measurements of all solutions prepared were carried out on a Hitachi U-1900 spectrophotometer (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), in the range 190–1100 nm. The SYSTAT Inc. peakfit (v 4.11) program was employed for the spectral fitting of the Ti(IV) hybrid metal–organic compound solution spectra.
