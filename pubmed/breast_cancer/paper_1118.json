It is upregulated in these malignancies and promotes tumor progression through mechanisms involving EMT, autophagy, and the release of pro-malignant lysosomal contents. P2RX4 also influences cellular signaling pathways by interacting with oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Certain genetic variants of P2RX4 are associated with an increased risk of developing these cancers. Hence, targeting P2RX4 represents a promising therapeutic approach, with potential strategies including antibody and CAR-T cell therapies and the development of small-molecule inhibitors. Further investigation is needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which P2RX4 drives cancer progression and to translate these findings into effective and safe clinical therapies. purinergic signaling tumor autophagy lysosomes Industry Alignment Fund Pre-Positioning Programme H22J1A0046 Provost Graduate Award from NTU SPMS This work is funded by the Industry Alignment Fund Pre-Positioning Programme (IAF-PP: H22J1A0046) awarded to Prof Anh Tuân Phan from NTU School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS) and Prof Kong-Peng Lam from A*STAR SIgN.

Introduction Cancer is a leading cause of death globally and is associated with abnormal and uncontrolled cell growth and the spread of malignant cells to healthy tissues. One in six deaths worldwide is caused by cancer [ 1 From a study point of view, healthy and cancerous cells can be sequenced to identify their genetic defects, particularly in oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes [ 2 2 3 Though not considered as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, the P2X family of receptors has been shown to play physiologically important roles in cell signaling [ 4 5 6 7 7 1 8 9 2. Purinergic Receptors To better understand P2RX4, we first review the broader family of P2X receptors and purinergic signaling and their roles in various physiological processes. Purinergic signaling is mediated by 7 subtypes of purinergic receptors of the P2X (also known as P2RX) family. P2X receptors (P2RX1–7) are 6-pass transmembrane ion channels activated by ATP, the universal currency of cellular energy [ 10 11 12 13 Figure 1 + + 2+ 11 14 2+ 14 + 2+ 15 P2X receptors are widely expressed in various tissues and cells such as the brain, muscle, epithelial, endothelial and immune cells. One or more P2X receptor subtypes can be expressed on the same cell type. Most P2X receptors are found on neurons and muscle cells. We summarized the distribution of P2X receptors in Table 1 3. P2X Receptors and Their Roles in Disease and Cancer ATP is the currency of cell energetics and can regulate the functions of P2X receptors. At physiological states, ATP is mostly absent in the extracellular matrix (ECM). ATP-regulated cell processes are tightly controlled and terminated quickly due to the actions of surface membrane proteins such as CD23 and CD79 that cleaves extracellular ATP (eATP) to adenosine, which is then taken up by cells to be converted into ATP for intracellular storage [ 21 22 23 24 22 ATP in pathological environments can activate P2X receptors, leading to inflammatory signaling and the release of cytokines and pro-inflammatory molecules [ 23 25 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 Table 2 In the past few years, there have been studies showing the involvement of ion channels in cell growth, proliferation and differentiation, especially in oncogenesis. Ion channels expressed on cancer cells are potential targets for cancer treatment, such as the L-type voltage-gated ion channels [ 44 4 6 45 46 47 46 47 48 P2RX7 is one of the most studied P2X receptors due to its role as a mediator of ATP-dependent apoptotic or necrotic cell death [ 49 50 5 51 52 53 Other P2X receptors have also been gaining attention for the development of cancer therapeutics due to their overexpression in cancers. For instance, P2RX4 is overexpressed in leukemia [ 54 55 7 56 45 38 4. P2RX4: A Dual-Function Purinergic Receptor P2RX4 stands out as the most unique of the P2X family of receptors. It has the widest expression and is found on epithelial, endothelial, neuronal, skeletal muscle and immune cells [ 57 58 57 2+ 57 59 60 59 60 ATP binding desensitizes the functional receptor and P2RX4 is trafficked to the lysosomes where the bound ATP detaches, and the process enables P2RX4 recycling. The acidity of the lysosomes resensitizes the P2RX4 receptor through protonation of histidine residues [ 61 62 63 64 65 The localization of P2RX4 to the plasma membranes is also physiologically important. Firstly, ATP binds tightly to P2RX4 subunits to activate the ion channel, allowing non-specific ions such as K + 2+ + 66 67 Figure 2 6 46 5. P2RX4 in Breast Cancer Aggressiveness, Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition & Autophagy Breast cancer is currently one of the most prevalently diagnosed cancers affecting women with an estimated number of 2.3 million new cases worldwide and is the 5th cause of cancer-related deaths [ 1 68 68 69 The ability of breast cancer cells to undergo Epithelial–Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) contributes to its aggressiveness and invasiveness. EMT causes the typically polarized epithelial cells to lose their polarity and gain the ability to enter circulation [ 70 71 55 55 P2RX4 signaling also affects autophagy, which could increase the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells ( Figure 3 72 71 72 73 74 75 55 55 76 55 73 76 77 6. P2RX4-Mediated Lysosomal Exocytosis in Breast Cancer Lysosomal exocytosis, a membrane-fusion process, which results in the expulsion of soluble debris after autophagic digestion, serves as a waste clearance mechanism [ 78 79 78 79 79 80 81 79 80 81 82 83 55 84 85 86 Lysosomal exocytosis is a calcium-mediated process, which can be regulated by P2RX4 ( Figure 4 87 60 84 88 60 89 The localized spike in calcium concentration signals lysosomes docking and fusion near the plasma membrane in a process known as ‘Fusion-Activated Ca 2+ 84 55 7. P2RX4 and Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness and Tumor Growth Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men. Like breast cancer, early intervention allows an almost 100% survival rate for patients with localized tumors, but complications arise in more advanced cases [ 1 90 8 90 91 92 8 91 Studies have found that among the seven P2X receptor family members, P2RX4 is the highest expressed functional P2X receptor in PCa [ 56 93 56 93 56 P2RX4 mediates tumor growth and invasiveness in prostate cancer [ 56 93 93 93 Like breast cancer, P2RX4 also promotes EMT in PCa cells [ 56 94 56 94 56 94 8. P2RX4 Modulates Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressor Genes in Prostate Cancer PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene encoding a phosphatase, is commonly inactivated and linked to more aggressive outcome in PCa. Interestingly, P2RX4 is expressed significantly higher in PTEN-inactivated PCa tissues compared to PTEN-expressing PCa tissues [ 56 94 95 56 95 96 56 Exposing PCa cells to TGFβ-1 induces EMT [ 97 98 94 98 56 94 61 94 94 94 9. P2RX4 Variants and Risk of Breast and Prostate Cancer P2RX4 polymorphism has been linked to the development of various cancers. The P2RX4 homozygous gene variant rs25644:G/G is associated with a high risk of prostate cancer [ 99 99 The P2RX4 genotypes GA/GG in rs28360472 were associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, mesothelial and soft tissue cancers. This variant causes a mutation from tyrosine to cysteine at position 315 supposedly causing a ‘loss of function’ by not binding ATP [ 99 100 10. P2X-Related Cancer Therapeutics Currently, there is no P2RX4-targeting drug on the market for cancer therapy. Small molecules used in studies such as PSB-12062 or 5-BDBD remain solely for experimental purposes [ 61 101 101 Antibody and cell-based therapies show great promises in targeting P2X4 for cancer treatment. As anti-P2RX7 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for BCC [ 53 102 In addition, conjugation of anti-P2RX4 Ab with cytotoxic drugs (ADCs) or oligonucleotides (AOCs) can deliver anti-cancer drug payloads [ 103 104 105 106 CAR-T cell therapy can offer another powerful approach to target P2RX4-expressing cancers. T cells from patients can be harvested and engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific to P2RX4 to effectively recognize and eliminate cancer cells overexpressing P2RX4 [ 107 108 109 110 Immunotherapeutic strategies hold potential for the treatment of breast and prostate cancers that overexpress P2RX4, and further research is needed to optimize their efficacy and minimize side effects. Rigorous preclinical and clinical studies are essential to evaluate the safety and efficacy of these therapies given the expression pattern of P2RX4. By developing targeted therapies against P2RX4, we may be able to improve patient outcomes and combat the devastating effects of aggressive cancers as shown in the case of targeting P2RX4 in pathogenic plasma cells [ 110 11. Concluding Thoughts In this review, we highlighted the role of the purinergic receptor P2RX4 in promoting tumor aggressiveness, particularly in breast and prostate cancers. Upregulation of P2RX4 has been linked to increased tumor cell proliferation, migration, and invasion through several processes such as the promotion of EMT, autophagy and lysosomal exocytosis, as well as in the modulation of oncogene and tumor suppressor gene crosstalk via unelucidated mechanisms. We also showcased some P2RX4 polymorphisms that could be linked to an increased risk of cancer. Targeting P2RX4 presents a promising therapeutic approach for combating some of these aggressive cancers. Future studies should delve deeper into the molecular mechanisms underlying P2RX4-mediated cancer progression, such as the role of P2RX4 in PTEN-PHLLP crosstalk, and to engineer novel anti-P2RX4 therapeutics with improved efficacy and selectivity. Potential immunotherapies such as CAR-T, mAbs or ADCs should be developed to specifically target cancer cells while avoiding normal tissues to reduce undesired toxicities. By advancing our understanding of P2X4 and developing highly specific therapies, we hope to improve patient treatments and outcomes in cases of more aggressive cancers.

Lysosomal exocytosis is dependent on the fusion of the lysosome with the plasma membrane, which involves VNUT and P2RX4. VNUT is responsible for loading ATP into the lysosomal lumen which is needed for P2RX4 activation. P2RX4 is only activated by the loaded ATP when the lysosome pH is neutralized during initial docking and pore formation at the plasma membrane. P2RX4 promotes fusion pore expansion which drives exocytosis via a process known as FACE, which involves inflow of Ca 2+ 2+ ijms-26-09043-t001_Table 1 Table 1 General tissue distribution of P2X receptors.
