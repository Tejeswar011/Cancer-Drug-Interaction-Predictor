This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license ( https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ This review covers the roles of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), an established biomarker of cartilage breakdown in pathological tissues in osteoarthritis, and in emerging areas in extracellular matrix and vascular remodeling associated with trauma, fibrosis and cancer. COMP is produced by chondrocytes, tenocytes, myofibroblasts, and in some specialized tissue contexts, endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. COMP expression by tendon and cartilage cells is sensitive to weight bearing and tensional mechanical stimulation. Vascular smooth muscle cells are sensitive to shear forces which regulate COMP expression in vascular tissues in atherosclerosis and in carotid stenosis. COMP is a multivalent bridging molecule that stabilizes tissues. It facilitates the signaling of TGF-β and BMP-2 in chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, tissue fibrosis, vascular and ECM remodeling and tumor development by providing a multimeric environment through which growth factor binding and receptor activation can occur. Engineered COMP proteins have been used as molecular templates in the development of chimeric therapeutic proteins of potential application in repair biology. Tie2 (Angiopoietin-1 receptor, Tyrosine-protein kinase receptor TEK), when activated by an engineered COMP-inspired angiopoietin-2 pentamer, is a potent angiogenic molecule of obvious application in wound healing. COMP’s multifunctional properties show it is much more than a biomolecular marker protein through its ability to participate in many biological processes. Further studies are warranted to fully explore the biology of this fascinating molecule, particularly in the wound repair processes.

Introduction Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), also known as thrombospondin-5 (TSP-5), is an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein with critical roles in collagen and ECM assembly and consequently matrix stabilization [ 1 2 3 4 5 1.1. COMP and Matrix Stabilization The complexities of the structure and function of the ECM, where roles for COMP in tissue stabilization have been delineated, have been covered by a number of excellent reviews; the reader is referred to these for further background information [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 The modular bridging structure of COMP facilitates interaction with multiple cartilage ECM components, such as collagens I, II, IX, XII, XIV, fibronectin, matrilins-1, 3, 4, and proteoglycans aiding in ECM stabilization [ 24 25 Figure 1 26 27 28 29 2 28 27 Figure 1 Schematic representation of the COMP pentameric structure showing the disulphide linked coiled-coil domains, which form the stalk from which the COMP monomers radiate away in a flower-head like arrangement with important interactive properties with other ECM components. The two central EGF domains in COMP have predicted Ca 2+ 30 31 High-resolution atomic force microscopy (hrAFM) has demonstrated TGF-β1 and COMP complexes containing one to three COMP and multiple TGF-β1 molecules; such multivalent presentation of growth factors may explain COMP’s unique properties in growth factor presentation and the activation of receptors operative in chondrogenesis, osteogenesis, tissue fibrosis and tumor biology [ 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 34 Caenorhabditis elegans Drosophila COMP participates in cell signaling through CD36 [ 39 40 41 40 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 45 Figure 1 Figure 2 53 54 55 3 56 57 58 Table 1 ijms-26-09182-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Serum COMP As A Discriminative Biomarker Of Cartilage Destruction. Study Features Ref Clark et al., 1999 Serum COMP levels can distinguish OA from a normal unaffected subgroup, reflecting OA disease severity and the involvement of multiple tissues in the knee joint OA process. The focus should not just be on the articular cartilage. Knee OA is a global disease, and the synovium, meniscus, ligaments, subchondral bone and infrapatellar fat pad all have roles to play in the disease process. [ 59 Vilim et al., 2001 Serum COMP is a measure of synovitis in knee OA. [ 60 Vilim et al., 2002 Correlation of serum COMP levels with radiographic progression of knee OA. Serum COMP levels are a prognostic marker of progressive joint disease and have been shown to persist over a 3-year study period. [ 61 Wisłowska et al., 2005 Serum COMP levels correlate with the severity of systemic lupus erythematosus and knee OA. In systemic lupus erythematosus patients ( n p n [ 62 Andersson et al., 2006 Serum COMP levels increased temporarily after physical exercise in 58 patients with knee OA. Exercise increases serum COMP levels in individuals affected with knee OA, COMP levels were decreased during rest. The increased serum COMP levels were normalized 30 min after an exercise session. This demonstrates the dynamic nature of COMP release from knee joint tissues. [ 63 Fernandes et al., 2007 Correlation of serum COMP levels with clinical and radiological knee OA in a Brazilian population. Patients with symptomatic knee OA had significantly higher serum COMP levels than healthy non-OA affected controls or non-symptomatic knees that showed radiographic evidence of narrowing of the joint space. This shows the potential of COMP as a prognostic and diagnostic factor in knee joint OA. [ 64 Tseng et al., 2009 Serum COMP is a marker of knee arthritis and a biomarker of ECM changes following joint trauma or cartilage degeneration. COMP is a diagnostic and prognostic marker of OA severity and can be used to assess the efficacy of anti-arthritic drugs in prospective OA treatments. [ 1 Hoch et al., 2011 Elevation of serum COMP in patients with knee OA: meta-analysis. A meta-analysis of a number of studies which examined serum COMP levels in knees with radiographically diagnosed OA of variable severity showed serum COMP levels were consistently elevated in patients with knee OA and were sensitive to OA disease progression. This confirmed that COMP is a biomarker for OA development and progression. [ 55 Zivanović et al., 2011 COMP, an inflammation biomarker in knee OA. Measurement of serum COMP levels in 88 OA patients examined by ultrasound to assess severity of OA disease and presence of synovitis showed serum COMP levels ranging from 52 to 66.5 ng/mL and correlated with the clinical severity of OA and the involvement of synovitis in knee OA. COMP thus was a biomarker of the severity of inflammation in knee OA. [ 5 Verma et al., 2013 Serum COMP is a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of knee OA. Measurement of serum COMP and inflammatory cytokine levels in OA and normal control patients by ELISA demonstrated COMP levels in OA patients were 1117.21 ng/mL (125.03–4209.75 ng/mL) compared to 338.62 ng/mL (118–589 ng/mL) in control subjects ( p [ 4 Lotz et al., 2013 Current status and perspectives of OA biomarkers. OA biomarkers have been classified into burden of disease, investigative, prognostic, efficacy of intervention, diagnostic and safety categories. Serum COMP as a biomarker falls into the burden of disease, prognostic and diagnostic categories. [ 65 Kluzek et al., 2015 Serum COMP in the development of radiographic, painful knee OA in a community-based cohort of middle-aged women. A study of serum COMP levels in a group of 593 middle-aged women in the development of radiographically diagnosed painful knee OA demonstrated that serum COMP levels were predictive of structural knee-joint tissue changes and the incidence of painful knee OA, independently of age and BMI. [ 56 Henroitin et al., 2016 Current status of cartilage ECM OA biomarkers. Soluble cartilage biomarkers such as COMP have been proposed to be complementary drug development tools useful in the discovery of anti-arthritic drugs from preclinical stages of their development up to their evaluation in the clinic. Such biomarkers should be considered surrogate indicators of clinical and/or imaging outcomes. Use of automated assays for biomarker panels may eventually lead to personalized medicines for enhanced management of OA. [ 54 Ben Achour et al., 2018 Correlation of bone and cartilage biomarkers with structural damage in RA: Cross sectional study. COMP is a biomarker of cartilage destruction that has been shown to be associated with joint erosions characteristic of RA and is predictive of radiographic damage to joint tissue in RA. [ 66 Georgiev et al., 2018 Correlation of serum COMP with knee OA: a meta-analysis. The measurement of COMP is a novel knee OA diagnostic. A meta-analysis of nine knee OA studies where serum COMP levels were measured showed consistent significantly elevated serum COMP levels in knee OA patients compared to controls. Meta-analysis showed serum COMP levels could distinguish OA from non-OA patients and were discriminative enough to distinguish between different clinical grades of OA. [ 67 Laudon et al., 2019 Serum COMP levels in individuals who sustained a youth sport-related intra-articular knee injury 3–10 years previously have been shown to display symptoms of knee RA-induced COMP levels and/or COMP degradation. COMP is thus a historical marker of cartilage injury and the pre-history of knee-joint loading and trauma, which both contribute to knee joint OA development. [ 57 Udomsinprasert et al., 2024 Correlation of COMP protein and mRNA levels with histological evidence of damage to knee joint tissues in OA. A recent study has confirmed COMP levels were significantly elevated in serum and synovial fluid of knee OA patients, especially in advanced OA stages, and correlated with radiological severity, body composition, physical performance, knee pain, and disability. COMP mRNA expression is markedly upregulated in the inflamed synovium in knee OA, consistent with immunohistochemical localization of COMP in the inflamed lining and sub-lining layers of knee OA synovium, and positively correlated with COMP levels in OA serum and synovial fluid samples. [ 58 COMP is primarily a protein of the cartilage ECM; however, high levels of COMP also occur in fibrotic scars, systemic sclerosis of the skin and in tendon, with COMP levels elevated in response to physical activity and tissue loading post-injury [ 68 69 70 27 71 72 73 24 74 75 76 Figure 2 Immunolocalization of COMP in early human bone, cartilage in diarthrodial joint development and in meniscus and plaque formations in carotid blood vessels ( a b c d c d d e g h i j k 77 a d i k 69 e g 1.2. COMP Is a Biomarker of Tissue Degradation COMP is widely associated with multiple diseases and can act as a biomarker for osteoarthritis (OA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), and psoriatic arthritis. Serum levels of circulating COMP have been used as a diagnostic, prognostic indicator of OA disease severity and responses to treatment (reviewed in [ 1 Table 1 78 79 58 3 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 Batimastat 80 87 82 83 Serum COMP measurements have been used to monitor longitudinal cartilage degradation associated with cruciate ligament injury and the development of degenerative joint changes [ 78 19 88 24 1 1.3. Serum COMP Levels in Variably Loaded Skeletal Tissues Serum COMP levels show some association with OA severity and the loading experienced by joint tissues [ 89 90 91 91 92 93 94 95 96 Animal OA Models Animal OA models have proved useful in the investigation of the early stages of OA and are considered to offer the most effective therapeutic window where therapeutic interventions that reverse disease pathology are most likely to succeed. Animal models are also useful for longitudinal studies on OA development and identification of biomarkers that are potentially predictive of the development of the OA condition [ 97 97 98 99 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 104 97 2. COMP and Tissue Fibrosis Skin fibrosis by activated fibroblasts results in altered ECM organization. Excessive matrix deposition due to altered cytokine profiles occurs in pathological conditions such as scleroderma and keloids with excessive dermal collagen deposition. COMP interacts with type I collagen and organizes fibrillar networks in normal healthy skin [ 119 29 COMP Interactions with Collagen Networks in Tissue Fibrosis and Cancer COMP/TSP-5 interaction with type I and type II collagen networks regulates ECM assembly and stabilization [ 120 121 35 121 Pentameric COMP enhances TGF-β-dependent cell signaling by clustering multiple TGF-β1 molecules and receptors at the cell surface, promoting the activation of cell receptors and TGF-β activity. Direct visualization of multivalent binding of TGF-β and BMP-2 with COMP has been achieved using high-resolution atomic force microscopy [ 34 35 122 123 124 COMP/TSP-5 interaction with type I and type II collagen networks regulates ECM assembly and stabilization [ 120 121 35 121 125 126 Skin fibrosis by activated fibroblasts results in altered ECM organization. Excessive matrix deposition due to altered cytokine profiles occurs in pathological conditions such as scleroderma and keloids with excessive dermal collagen deposition. COMP interacts with type I collagen and organizes fibrillar networks in normal healthy skin [ 119 29 3. COMP and Regulation of the Complement System COMP is the first extracellular matrix protein for which an active role in inflammation has been demonstrated in vivo [ 127 Small COMP fragments have been identified in synovial fluid, and these serve as biomarkers of cartilage degradation [ 128 129 85 84 86 87 Proteomic analysis of tendon shows disease stage-specific fragmentation of COMP and differential cleavages with disease severity [ 130 131 132 Identification of Specific COMP Fragments in Diseased Tissues COMP fragments also occur in vascular tissues with the development of atherosclerotic lesions. A specific COMP neoepitope fragment has been identified in such lesions; this may represent a novel biomarker for the detection of symptomatic carotid stenosis [ 70 133 Table 2 A COMP neoepitope has also been identified in horses; this neoepitope, detected by ELISA, was elevated in synovial fluid samples from horses with acute lameness and may be useful as a biomarker of early molecular changes in articular cartilage associated with OA [ 247 n n p 248 4. COMP and TGF-β Signaling Pentameric COMP enhances TGF-β-dependent cell signaling by clustering multiple TGF-β1 molecules and receptors at the cell surface, promoting the activation of cell receptors and TGF-β activity. COMP regulates the TGF-β signaling pathway in skin, pulmonary fibrosis, and, in atrial fibrosis, is a major pathogenetic factor acting in combination with Ang 2 in the development of atrial fibrillation. Protein levels of TGF-β1, P-Smad2, and P-Smad3 are decreased after silencing COMP, showing that COMP knockdown can inhibit TGF-β activation in atrial cells, and this effect is reversed upon re-activation of TGF-β [ 123 124 Identification of Biomarker Proteins Including COMP in Arthritis Sub-Types In a recent comprehensive knee OA proteomics study [ 249 250 5. The Bioregulatory Roles of Matricryptins/Matrikines in Tissue Homeostasis: Emergence of COMP Fragments as New Matricryptin Members Matricryptins [ 251 252 191 253 254 255 253 256 251 252 256 257 COMP and Complement in Arthritic and Inflammatory Disorders A number of SLRP proteoglycan family members modulate the Complement system. Decorin and biglycan both strongly inhibit C1q binding to human endothelial cells and pro-monocytic U937 cells, suppressing C1q-induced MCP-1 and IL-8 production by human endothelial cells and downregulating proinflammatory effects mediated by C1q [ 258 259 260 127 261 Fibromodulin, Osteoadherin, and biglycan display Complement-modulatory activity that enhances the killing of Moraxella catarrhalis 262 263 258 Several ECM components also contain anti-angiogenic peptide modules with a diverse range of bioregulatory properties, as shown in Table 2 COMP is also degraded in disease processes, generating a number of peptide fragments. These are useful as biomarkers of disease progression and severity in arthritic disorders, tendinopathy and vascular disease ( Table 2 Table 2 Proteoglycan and proteoglycan fragments have been used as biomarkers for several diseases characterized by dysregulated ECM remodeling in OA, RA, atherosclerosis, thoracic aortic aneurysms, CNS disorders, viral infections, and cancer [ 264 265 251 266 Table 2 6. COMP Has Roles in Malignancy, Cardiovascular Diseases, and Tissue Fibrosis COMP also has multiple roles in malignancy, cardiovascular diseases, and tissue fibrosis in a range of tissues [ 37 53 267 268 53 124 269 270 70 38 271 272 72 273 Figure 3 274 275 276 COMP binds to the cell surface and activates the PI3k (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/AKT (protein kinase B)/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway. This is an intracellular signaling pathway important in the regulation of the cell cycle directly related to cellular quiescence. COMP expression provides radiation resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The PI3k/AKT pathway promotes the repair of breakages in double stranded DNA [ 278 v 3 v 5 120 Proteomic studies show COMP promotes oxidative phosphorylation and drug resistance pathways [ 279 279 Overexpression of sirtuin, a potent tumor suppressor, downregulates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in NSCLC cells. SIRT6 promotes the radiosensitivity of NSCLC and inhibits the development of tumors [ 280 stress responsive histone deacetylase and mono-ADP ribosyltransferase 281 Sirtuin 6 is localized to the 7. COMP Expression in Skin and Vascular Tissues COMP is induced in granulation tissue in skin following injury and is present in dermal scar tissue and found in vascular plaques in atherosclerosis [ 69 29 36 38 53 267 268 270 282 28 27 283 284 47 285 70 51 52 286 287 8. COMP Activates the Complement System The Complement system is central to the innate immune response and is critical to host defense against pathogens, aiding in the removal of pathogens and dying cells [ 288 289 290 291 292 127 127 293 294 295 9. Mutations in COMP Impact Tissue Organization and Function Mutations in COMP cause pseudoachondroplasia [ 73 72 296 36 297 298 299 Figure 4 299 299 300 301 10. Emerging New Areas of COMP Biology 10.1. Roles for COMP in Tumor Biology While COMP has roles in ECM stabilization through interactions with collagen in normal tissue development, a few studies have recently emerged showing COMP also has roles in tumor development in a number of cancers [ 302 303 272 Figure 3 278 279 272 304 305 306 126 271 307 38 308 309 274 37 10.2. COMP in Vascular and ECM Remodeling COMP expression by vascular smooth muscle cells and interaction with Ang-1 results in sustained vascular remodeling [ 310 311 312 313 19 20 21 22 25 314 314 10.3. COMP-Mediated TGF-β Signaling and Tissue Fibrosis COMP expression by myofibroblasts can be modulated by TGF-β [ 269 315 123 267 124 268 270 316 317 54 64 67 124 269 315 18 19 310 311 312 313 314 126 302 304 307 11. Roles for the Coiled-Coil COMP Domain in Tissue Organization/Stabilization The coiled coil (CC) motif is common in cytoskeletal motor proteins, transcription factors and attachment protein receptors [ 318 319 320 321 322 318 323 323 171 324 325 320 The CC domain of COMP is a particularly fascinating and useful molecular template in protein engineering. Pentameric chimeras have been developed containing bioactive molecules using the CC domain [ 51 52 312 Intravitreal angiopoietin-1 combined with the short CC domain of COMP delivered by adeno-associated viral serotype 2 (AAV2.COMP-Ang1) following the onset of vascular damage can rescue or repair damaged vascular beds and attenuate neuronal atrophy and dysfunction in the retinas of aged diabetic mice [ 326 Tie2 mediates vascular stabilization and ameliorates neovascular age-related macular degeneration. Mice that received subretinal injections of AAV2.COMP-Ang1 underwent a significant reduction in VEGF levels (29–33%, p p Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the adult population in the USA. Neuroglial and vascular dysfunction in diabetic retinopathy are vision-threatening events that occur in concert, driven by hyperglycemia along a pathway of inflammation, ischemia, vasodegeneration, and blood retinal barrier breakdown. Currently, no therapies exist for normalizing the vasculature in diabetic retinopathy. A single intravitreal dose of AAV2.COMP-Ang1 ameliorates structural and functional disruption in diabetic retinopathy in Ins2Akita mice. Sustained recovery of the retinal vasculature was observed over a 6-month recovery period [ 327 Tie2 is activated by an oligo-multimeric complex containing multiple Ang 1 domains that clusters Tie2, phosphorylating the Tie2 kinase domain initiating downstream signaling [ 328 329 330 328 330 330 331 51 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 Chondrocyte COMP organizes cartilage ECM components and is of potential application in cartilage repair strategies [ 339 75 16 32 34 35 340 341 342 12. Therapeutic Opportunities with COMP Engineered chimeras based on the pentameric CC domain of COMP have potential roles in repair biology. COMP is also a useful diagnostic in several disease processes and has been used to monitor the effectiveness of drugs in development to treat these diseases. COMP is thus useful in the assessment of the efficacy of therapeutics in many diseases. As already discussed, COMP is an established biomarker of cartilage destruction [ 343 344 345 346 347 250 348 349 12.1. COMP as a Biomarker of Disease COMP is a cancer biomarker and is useful in staging the progressive/poor prognosis/cancer remission phases of diseases including colon, prostate, pancreas, stomach and rectal adenocarcinomas, lymphoid neoplasms, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and kidney and ovarian adenocarcinomas. Melanoma, testicular germ cell tumors, epithelial tumors of the pre-vascular mediastinum (a space in the chest that holds the heart and other major structures) and uterine carcinosarcoma are also troublesome tumors in urgent need of effective treatments. COMP has been proposed as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for the treatment of gastric cancer [ 274 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal, rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease with unpredictable clinical outcome. COMP is a potential diagnostic marker for the IPF gene, opening the possibility for novel investigations into pathogenic IPF pathways and therapeutic approaches with COMP, integrating machine learning and neural networks in new diagnostic therapeutic approaches [ 350 12.2. Application of COMP Ang 1 and COMP Ang 2 Chimeric Proteins in Repair Biology Angiopoietin 1 (Ang 1) is a specific growth factor that generates a stable, mature vasculature through the Tie2 (angiopoietin-1 receptor, tyrosine-protein kinase receptor) TEK)/PI3K/AKT cell signaling pathway, which has important roles in skeletogenesis and the maintenance of mature tissue functional properties. Ang 1 also promotes LYVE-1 positive lymphatic vessel formation [ 351 51 351 352 45 51 353 COMP-Ang 2 strongly binds and activates Tie2, whereas GCN4-Ang 2 and MAT-Ang 2 bind weakly or with moderate affinity and activate Tie2. Although native Ang 2 strongly binds to Tie2, it does not activate Tie2; however, the multimeric environment provided by COMP pentameric Ang 1 or Ang 2 constructs promotes this activation process. COMP-Ang 1 and BMP-2 have been administered to critical sized calvarial defects in mice using absorbable collagen sponges. This resulted in recruitment of pericytes into the defect site, osteoblast proliferation and an elevation in osteoblast-specific gene expression for bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin and osterix and phosphorylation of Smad/1/5/8, resulting in formation of mineralized bone in the defect site [ 354 52 13. Concluding Remarks The CC domain of COMP is a key domain in its pentameric structure, spatially organizing it as a bridging structure in a highly effective multimeric interactive platform for cell receptors and growth factors. The CC structure is an interesting molecular template that has been used to engineer stable chimeric proteins with multimeric functional ligands that aid in the activation of cellular receptors. An engineered COMP-Ang 2 chimeric protein is a highly effective angiogenic molecule that shows significant potential in wound repair [ 312 Poor wound healing in traumatized tissues after surgery, acute illness, or chronic disease impacts the welfare of millions of people worldwide each year and is exacerbated by dysregulation or the poor performance of key components in the tissue repair response [ 355 356 Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization: M.M.S.; Writing—original draft preparation, J.M.; Writing—review and editing, J.M., M.M.S.; Supervision, M.M.S.
