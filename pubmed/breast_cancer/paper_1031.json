Introduction Marine environments are a treasure trove of microbial diversity, harboring some of the most ancient and resilient life forms on Earth. Over millions of years, marine microorganisms have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to thrive in dynamic and extreme oceanic conditions, including frigid temperatures, fluctuating salinity, and immense pressure [ 1 2 3 1 2 3 Among marine microorganisms, Gram-negative bacteria are widespread, thriving in diverse habitats ranging from the deep sea to coastal waters and from free-living forms to symbiotic relationships with other organisms [ 1 4 4 5 4 Beyond their role in microbial adaptation, LPS molecules are involved in host–microbe interactions, including colonization, virulence, and symbiosis. In mammals, LPS is recognized by the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/myeloid differentiation protein-2 (MD-2) complex, triggering immune responses [ 6 7 8 9 In addition to its well-characterized interactions with TLR4/MD-2, LPS can form complexes with cytosolic structures to amplify the host immune response. A striking example is its direct binding to inflammatory caspases, which act as intracellular sentinels for LPS detection. Upon cytosolic entry, LPS is specifically recognized by human caspase-4 and caspase-5 (or caspase-11 in mice). These receptors exhibit high affinity and selectivity for LPS, initiating the assembly of the noncanonical inflammasome (NLRP3). Mechanistically, LPS binding induces the oligomerization of caspase-4 monomers, unleashing their proteolytic activity. Activated caspase-4/5/11 triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation, leading to caspase-1-dependent processing and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, as well as the induction of pyroptotic cell death, a critical driver of endotoxin-mediated pathology [ 9 10 11 However, the immunostimulatory potential of LPS is highly structure-dependent, with some LPS variants acting as potent receptor agonists and others exhibiting weak or antagonistic properties. Indeed, structural variations in lipid A, including differences in acylation patterns, fatty acid length and composition, and phosphate group modifications, are closely linked to its diverse immunological effects [ 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 This variability has sparked interest in LPS as a source of immunomodulatory compounds, particularly those with unique structural features that could serve as receptor antagonists. Marine bacteria synthesize LPS molecules with distinct chemical properties, some of which exhibit desirable characteristics. These unique LPS structures offer significant potential for modulating immune responses and advancing the development of innovative therapeutics, especially for treating conditions such as endotoxic shock [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 This study focused on the LOS derived from Kangiella japonica 19 Kangiella 20 21 20 21 22 K. japonica 2. Results 2.1. LOS Extraction, Purification, and Characterization Dried cells of K. japonica 23 Figure S1 20 K. japonica T 20 K. japonica 21 1 Figure S2 Analysis of the total fatty acid content in the LPS preparation revealed the presence of 3-hydroxyisoundecanoic acid [i11:0 (3-OH)], undecanoic acid (11:0), and isoundecanoic acid (i11:0) in a ratio of 3.8:1.1:1 (detector response). To obtain detailed compositional and structural information on the oligosaccharide components, the LPS underwent complete deacylation, followed by separation using gel-permeation chromatography. Given that the O-polysaccharide of the LPS contains uronic acids, which are subject to decomposition by the β-elimination mechanism, the resulting fragments included the core oligosaccharide and the carbohydrate backbone of lipid A, the latter featuring a glycosyl phosphate group at the reducing end that remains stable under alkaline conditions. Monosaccharide analysis of the oligosaccharide (OS) preparation, conducted by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of acetylated methyl- and ( S glycero manno manno 2.2.

MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Lipid A To elucidate the full structure of the glycolipid component and identify the distribution of acyl chains across the glucosamine disaccharide backbone, mild acid hydrolysis of the LPS was carried out. The resulting lipid A fraction was subsequently analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and MS/MS. The negative-ion MALDI-TOF mass spectrum of the lipid A revealed three distinct clusters of peaks, each corresponding to unique glycoforms characterized by variations in fatty acid composition and phosphate content ( Figure 4 m z m z m z m z m z m z Table 2 m z Negative-ion MS/MS analysis was employed to precisely determine the positioning of acyl chains relative to the glucosamine disaccharide backbone of lipid A.

Their exact positions remain to be elucidated and confirmed. Thus, by integrating the results from compositional analysis, NMR spectroscopy, MS, and MS/MS, the structure of the LOS from K. japonica Figure 7 2.4. Immunological Properties of LOS The biological activity of LPS molecules, whether agonistic or antagonistic, is determined by the composition and arrangement of their acyl chains on the lipid A moiety. A classic example is the bis-phosphorylated hexa-acylated lipid A from E. coli 6 7 8 9 9 10 11 In this context, given the elucidated structure of the LOS from K. japonica E. coli We investigated the immunomodulatory effects of K. japonica K. japonica E. coli K. japonica E. coli Figure 8 Next, we explored the capacity of K. japonica E. coli K. japonica E. coli Figure 8 K. japonica E. coli Figure 8 K. japonica K. japonica In the final set of experiments, we evaluated the ability of K. japonica E. coli Figure 9 K. japonica E. coli K. japonica E. coli As shown in Figure 9 K. japonica E. coli K. japonica Figure 9 Figure S6 Figure S7 3. Discussion The discovery of microbial life thriving in diverse marine ecosystems worldwide has spurred the development of compelling hypotheses about the mechanisms that enable these microorganisms to endure extreme environmental conditions. Central to these hypotheses is the growing recognition that the chemical architecture of LPS in Gram-negative bacteria is critical to their ability to adapt and flourish in aquatic habitats [ 4 4 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 4 28 40 41 42 43 4 5 6 7 8 9 15 Given this, we report the structural characterization of the LOS isolated from the marine bacterium K. japonica mono glycero manno manno p p From a biological perspective, we evaluated the immunostimulatory activity of K. japonica E. coli K. japonica E. coli 4 28 29 32 44 K. japonica K. japonica E. coli Recent studies reveal intriguing differences in how caspase-4/11 and TLR4/MD-2 detect lipid A, challenging the assumption that both sensors share identical structural preferences [ 9 10 11 p 10 11 Rhizobium Rhodobacter 10 11 11 18 10 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Materials The organic solvents, inorganic acids, and salts were commercial products (Vekton, Russia). The Protein Plus molecular weight marker was purchased from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA, USA). Acetyl chloride and trihydroxyacetophenone (THAP) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). For the protein detection by Western blotting, the following antibodies were used: caspase-4 (Cloud-Clone Corp., Wuhan, China, #PAB735Hu01, 1:1000), GAPDH (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA, #2118T, 1:1000), and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA, #7074, 1:5000). For the cytokine detection, the following ELISA kits were used: TNF-α (Vector-Best, Novosibirsk, Russia, #8756), IL-1β (Vector-Best, Novosibirsk, Russia, #8766), IL-6 (Vector-Best, Novosibirsk, Russia, #8768), and IL-18 (Vector-Best, Novosibirsk, Russia, #8770). 4.2. Bacterial Strain, Isolation, and Purification of LOS, OS, and Lipid A The bacterial strain K. japonica 45 24 v v v 4.3. Chemical Analysis of LOS Monosaccharides were analyzed as acetylated methyl glycosides, using appropriate authentic standards as references. For methanolysis, a LOS sample (1 mg) was treated with 1.25 M acetyl chloride in methanol (1 mL) at 80 °C for 16 h. The resulting mixture was extracted three times with hexane to separate fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) from O-methyl glycosides. The hexane phase was dried and analyzed by GC-MS. The remaining methanolic phase was dried, and the O-methyl glycosides were acetylated with acetic anhydride in pyridine at room temperature for 16 h. The absolute configurations of the sugar residues were determined by GC-MS analysis of the acetylated ( S 46 S 4.4.

Data Analysis The results are expressed as a % relative to the negative control (100%). Each bar represents the mean ± SEM of three independent replicates ( n p 5. Conclusions In conclusion, our preliminary results align with the established research while highlighting the potential of marine microorganisms as sources of immune response modifiers. The dual capacity to simultaneously inhibit TLR4/MD-2 and caspase-4/5 activation could provide instruments to control acute inflammatory responses and reduce LPS-induced toxic effects. While these preliminary findings demonstrate applicable immunomodulatory properties, their therapeutic potential requires further validation. Future studies should address comparative analysis across phylogenetically diverse marine Gram-negative bacterial strains, in vivo efficacy testing, and detailed mechanistic studies elucidating structure–activity relationships.
