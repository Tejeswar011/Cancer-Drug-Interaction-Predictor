Objectives Subcutaneous administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab offers a faster alternative to intravenous infusion for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. However, real-world data on its impact on costs and capacity remain limited. Therefore, this study aimed to compare healthcare resource utilization and costs associated with subcutaneous versus intravenous administration of pertuzumab and trastuzumab from a societal perspective. Methods This study was conducted at two Dutch hospitals. Observational data were collected on drug preparation, administration times, and resource use for both formulations. Patient questionnaires assessed societal costs, including travel expenses and productivity losses. Costs were calculated for patient chair time, healthcare professional time, disposables, societal expenses, and drug costs. A nationwide impact analysis estimated potential capacity and productivity gains from switching from intravenous to subcutaneous administration across the Netherlands. Results Subcutaneous administration reduced patient chair time compared to intravenous administration, by an average of 106 min (85.5%) for maintenance doses (from 124.3 to 18.1 min) and 287 min (96.0%) for loading doses (from 299.0 to 12.0 min). Active healthcare professional time decreased by 17 min (54.1%) for maintenance doses and 25 min (66.7%) for loading doses. Drug administration costs (excluding drug costs) were lower subcutaneous administration saved approximately €172 per maintenance dose and €403 per loading dose. Nationwide adoption could create capacity for around 22,000 additional treatments annually and save 4.0 full-time equivalent healthcare professionals. Conclusion Switching from intravenous to subcutaneous pertuzumab/trastuzumab administration substantially reduces healthcare resource use and may offer cost savings, supporting more efficient delivery of HER2-targeted therapies. Highlights • Subcutaneous pertuzumab/trastuzumab reduces chair time by over 100 min. • Healthcare professional time halved with subcutaneous administration per dose. • Subcutaneous administration of pertuzumab/trastuzumab leads to potential societal cost savings.

[ 1 [2] [3] [4] Conventionally, pertuzumab and trastuzumab (PT) are administered intravenously, requiring up to 2.5 h of chair time per patient. [ 5 6 7 8 9 In response, a fixed-dose combination subcutaneous (SC) formulation of PT (SC-PT) approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2021, offers an injection time of 5–8 min. [ 10 11 [12] [13] [14] Although SC mAb administration reduces patient chair time and healthcare professional (HCP) involvement compared to IV [ 13 15 16 2 Material and methods 2.1 Study design The EASE-SC study was a cross-sectional, observational study employing a bottom-up microcosting approach to quantify and compare the resource use and costs of drug preparation and administration PT-SC versus PT-IV from a societal perspective. The study also estimated the nationwide impact of switching all PT-IV patients in the Netherlands to PT-SC. The study was conducted between September 2023 and June 2024 at Alrijne Hospital (Leiden), where patients received PT-IV as standard care, and Erasmus University Medical Center Cancer Institute (Rotterdam), where patients received either PT-SC or PT-IV. Eligible participants were patients diagnosed with HER2+ breast cancer and receiving a loading or maintenance dose, administered either as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy. 2.2 Data collection Drug preparation and administration data of PT-SC and PT-IV were collected through observations using standardized case report forms (CRFs), capturing disposables used and active HCP time. Drug preparation times were measured with a stopwatch (minutes:seconds) at the drug preparation area of the hospital pharmacy or oncology daycare unit (Erasmus University Medical Center), recording three phases: material collection, preparation, and finishing. Drug administration data were collected at the oncology daycare unit, with a maximum of two treatment cycles per participant to avoid overrepresentation. Patient chair time was measured as the duration from when patients occupied a chair to their discharge. Administration-related activities and definitions are detailed in Supplementary Appendix Table 1 For each drug administration, the number of vials used (rounded to whole vials) was calculated based on the prescribed dose. Our study distinguished between loading and maintenance doses, with patients receiving a loading dose for the initial administration, followed by maintenance doses for subsequent administrations (see Supplementary Appendix Table 2 17 2.3 Resource valuation The analysis included two cost categories: I) healthcare costs, comprising drug costs, disposable costs, patient chair time costs, and active HCP time costs; and II) societal costs, covering travel expenses, informal care costs, and productivity losses due to absences from paid and unpaid work. Unit prices are summarized in Supplementary Table 3 Costs were estimated following the Dutch Costing Manual (2024) [ 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 18 Total costs were derived by multiplying resource use or time spent by their corresponding unit price. To standardize costs from multiple sources, averages were calculated for unit prices ( Supplementary Table 3 25 2.4 Analysis Total time and costs were calculated for PT-SC and PT-IV, distinguishing between mono- and combination therapy (including chemotherapy). For patients receiving PT in combination with chemotherapy, all procedures attributable to chemotherapy, such as infusion and preparation of chemotherapy, administration of premedication, post-infusion scalp cooling, and IV access line installation (applicable only to PT-SC), were systematically excluded from our time measurements (see Supplementary Fig. 1 26 Supplementary Appendix 2.5 Nationwide impact analysis To estimate the nationwide impact of PT-SC on oncology daycare unit capacity and productivity, we assumed a hypothetical scenario where all PT-IV patients in the Netherlands switched to PT-SC. It was assumed that 80% of the 2,250 Dutch pertuzumab/trastuzumab users were treated with PT-IV receiving maintenance doses over an average of 12 cycles per year. [ 27 28 The analysis focused on two outcomes: I) annual chair hour savings at oncology daycare units, and II) annual productivity savings for HCPs, measured in full-time equivalents (FTEs). Annual capacity savings were estimated by dividing the total patient chair time saved per year by the average length of stay for a single therapy at the daycare unit, obtained from Erasmus MC. Annual HCP productivity savings were estimated by dividing the total active HCP time saved per year by the average workable hours per year for healthcare personnel, set at 1,543 h. [ 18 3 Results 3.1 Study observations The study included 28 patients receiving either intravenous (PT-IV, n = 16) or subcutaneous (PT-SC, n = 12) pertuzumab and trastuzumab. We documented 29 observations during drug preparation (19 PT-IV, 10 PT-SC) and 43 during drug administration (24 PT-IV, 19 PT-SC). Treatments included both monotherapy (pertuzumab and trastuzumab only) and combination therapy with chemotherapy. One PT-SC patient was unable to complete the questionnaire due to a language barrier, and one PT-IV observation was excluded due to an adverse event. Detailed observations are presented in Supplementary Fig. 2 3.2 Patient chair time PT-SC reduced patient chair time compared to PT-IV ( Fig. 1 Supplementary Table 4 Fig. 1 Average patient chair time per treatment cycle observed during drug administration of intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) pertuzumab/trastuzumab and standard deviation. Fig. 1 3.3 Healthcare professional time Active HCP time was lower with PT-SC due to shorter preparation and administration durations ( Fig. 2 Supplementary Table 5 Fig. 2 Average active healthcare professional time (HCP) per treatment cycle observed during the drug preparation and administration of intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) pertuzumab/trastuzumab and standard deviation. Fig. 2 3.4 Healthcare and societal costs The administration costs of PT-SC (excluding drug costs) were lower than PT-IV ( Table 1 Table 1 Mean costs and standard deviation (SD) associated with drug preparation and administration of intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) pertuzumab/trastuzumab.

Administration costs also favored PT-SC, with disposable costs reduced by €11.93 (97.8%). PT-SC resulted in lower societal costs, primarily due to decreased informal care expenses and reduced productivity losses from less time spent at the daycare, with costs €32.49 (58.4%) lower for maintenance doses and €75.62 (77.7%) lower for the loading dose. Traveling expenses were equal for both groups. In contrast, drug costs were higher for PT-SC by €164.22 for maintenance doses (4.3% increase) and loading doses (2.6% increase). 3.5 Nationwide impact analysis The nationwide impact analysis estimates that transitioning all PT-IV patients in the Netherlands to PT-SC could save 38,230 patient chair hours annually, increasing the capacity for an additional 22,059 oncology treatments in daycare units. Additionally, this shift would save 6,157 h of HCP time each year, 4,821 h in drug preparation and 1,336 h in drug administration, which is equivalent to a productivity increase of 4.0 FTEs nationwide. 4 Discussion Our study compared the resource use and costs associated with PT-IV and PT-SC from a societal perspective. The findings demonstrate that transitioning from PT-IV to PT-SC could seriously reduce daycare unit time and nursing workload, alleviate staffing pressures, increase patient throughput, and lower treatment costs. 4.1 Comparison with existing literature While previous studies have indicated that SC administration of mAbs may reduce costs and capacity needs [ 13 16 Previously, Jackisch et al. (2022) estimated substantial time savings and non-drug cost reductions when switching to PT-SC, based on extrapolations from SC trastuzumab studies and Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) information. [ 12 Similarly, Munzone et al. (2023) found that switching from PT-IV to PT-SC reduced patient chair time by 87%, active HCP time by 25%, and non-drug costs by €125.95. [ 29 4.2 Interpretation of findings The urgency for more efficient administration methods is underscored by capacity constraints, global nursing shortages, and escalating costs of oncologic drugs and care delivery. [ 8 30 31 32 Our analysis showed that administering PT-SC reduces patient chair time and active HCP time, primarily due to significant reductions in drug preparation time. PT-IV administration involves processes that increase active nurse time, such as installing the IV access line, which can be time-consuming if peripheral venous access is difficult and managing issues like gas bubbles that clog infusion pumps, necessitating nurse intervention. In contrast, PT-SC administration avoids these issues, allowing nurses to focus on the patient's treatment more efficiently. Some patients reported discomfort during PT-SC injections, prompting nurses to slow the injection. Nonetheless, administration remained significantly shorter than with PT-IV. Our findings also indicate that PT-SC could lead to cost savings compared to PT-IV, primarily due to reductions in overhead and labor costs from decreased patient chair time and active HCP time. While these savings may not directly reduce hospital expenditure, they represent opportunity costs, as freed resources can be reallocated to other treatments. [ 33 14 29 34 35 The potential cost savings are highly dependent on drug costs, as shown in the sensitivity analysis. While drug price differences were relatively small, even minor variations can lead to significant absolute cost differences due to the high prices. Our analysis used list prices, but actual purchase prices, negotiated between Dutch hospitals and pharmaceutical companies, are confidential and could hypothetically affect the results. [ 28 4.3 Strengths and limitations Our study has several strengths. We used a bottom-up microcosting approach, considered the gold standard for costing studies, as it involves collecting data at the most detailed level. [ 19 36 37 However, there are limitations to consider. The sample size was modest, particularly for loading doses, with only one observation for PT-SC and four for PT-IV, and four observations in the PT-SC monotherapy group. Therefore, findings regarding loading doses and monotherapy may be influenced by outliers and should be interpreted with caution. Despite this, the variability in observed chair and active nurse times, as reflected by the standard deviations, was small, supporting the robustness of our estimates (maintenance chair time: 18.1 min [SD 6.6] SC vs 124·3 min [SD 18.7] IV; active nurse time: 12.2 min [SD 3.6] SC vs 15.9 min [SD 5.1] IV; Supplementary Tables 4 and 5 15 16 29 Variations in hospital settings are not expected to substantially impact the incremental total costs (excluding drug costs) to the extent that no cost savings are achieved, as the sensitivity analysis consistently demonstrated negative incremental total costs when varying time and resource use. 4.4 Implications for practice and future research The continual rise in healthcare needs and expenditures poses significant challenges to healthcare systems. [ 38 39 Our findings indicate that transitioning from PT-IV to PT-SC can save time and potentially reduce costs. However, these savings are highly dependent on drug prices. Hospitals need to assess their individual savings based on their negotiated discounts and reimbursements from payers, as these amounts may not always align with drug list prices. Furthermore, the upcoming expiration of pertuzumab's patent could lead to the introduction of biosimilars into the market. Several biosimilars are currently in development and could substantially reduce PT-IV costs once they enter the market, while PT-SC costs will remain high for the coming years. [ 40 41 While cost savings are important, it is essential to consider other benefits that PT-SC offers, including increased capacity in healthcare settings, improved productivity of HCPs, patient preferences, and reduced material consumption. Moreover, PT-SC holds potential for home-based (self-)administration, which is already standard practice at the Erasmus Medical Center for selected patients. Enabling self-administration could further alleviate capacity constraints, reduce non-drug costs, and potentially increase patient satisfaction by offering greater flexibility and autonomy. [ 14 42 [42] [43] [44] 10 5 Conclusions In conclusion, this study demonstrated that switching from PT-IV to PT-SC can lead to significant reductions in healthcare resource utilization and potential cost savings without compromising patient care. These findings support the adoption of PT-SC as a more efficient administration method for pertuzumab/trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Future research should focus on exploring the feasibility of home-based self-administration to maximize the benefits of PT-SC.
