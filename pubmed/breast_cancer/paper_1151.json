These multifactorial alterations hinder tissue repair and contribute to poor clinical outcomes, with limited efficacy from current therapeutic options. Despite recent advances in surgical and endoscopic techniques, current treatment options remain limited and are frequently accompanied by high morbidity and costs. In this context, regenerative medicine offers a promising avenue to support tissue repair and improve patient care Regenerative medicine offers a promising avenue to restore intestinal homeostasis using advanced biomaterials and cell-based therapies. In this study, we developed a 3D-bioprinted model based on patient-derived stromal vascular fraction (SVF) embedded in a GelMA hydrogel, designed to promote intestinal tissue regeneration. To identify the most suitable hydrogel for bioprinting, we initially evaluated the mechanical properties and biocompatibility of four distinct matrices using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs). Among the tested formulations, GelMA demonstrated optimal support for cell viability, low oxidative stress, and structural stability in physiologically relevant conditions. Based on these results, GelMA was selected for subsequent bioprinting of freshly isolated SVF. The resulting bioprinted constructs enhanced key regenerative processes across multiple compartments. The SVF-laden constructs significantly enhanced intestinal epithelial cell viability and tight junction formation, as shown by increased trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Co-culture with fibroblasts accelerated wound closure, while endothelial cells exhibited increased tube formation in the presence of SVF. Together with VEGF secretion, indicating strong paracrine and angiogenic effects. By supporting epithelial, stromal, and vascular regeneration, this approach provides a versatile and translational platform for treating a broad spectrum of intestinal pathologies. 3D-bioprinting stromal vascular fraction regenerative medicine intestinal regeneration GelMA Italian Ministry of Health PNRR-POC-2023-12377340 CUP C53C23001280007 This work was supported by the Italian Ministry of Health under the Ricerca Finalizzata POC 2023 program: Finanziato dall’Unione europea—Next Generation EU—PNRR M6C2—Investimento 2.1 Valorizzazione e potenziamento della ricerca biomedica del SSN, Project Code PNRR-POC-2023-12377340, CUP C53C23001280007. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Disorders of the intestinal tract, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, malabsorption syndromes, and gastrointestinal fistulae (GIFs), represent a significant clinical burden and are frequently associated with chronic inflammation, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and impaired tissue repair [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 8 9 12 13 14 15 16 Regenerative medicine aims to restore the structure and function of damaged tissues using biologically active materials, including cells, scaffolds, and signaling molecules [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 In this study, we investigated the regenerative potential of a 3D-bioprinted model of patient-derived SVF on the intestinal epithelium. Recognizing that the bioink formulation plays a critical role in cell viability and function, we first conducted a comparative analysis of different hydrogel matrices to identify the most biocompatible environment for supporting the heterogeneous cell populations present in the SVF [ 29 30 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Mechanical Characterization of Hydrogels Nanoindentation experiments were performed to evaluate the mechanical properties of four hydrogel formulations: alginate, Cellink-RGD, GelMA, and GelMA A. Representative force–indentation curves ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 31 32 33 From a biomedical perspective, the mechanical properties of GelMA are particularly relevant. Its stiffness falls within the lower range of native soft tissues such as the brain, liver, and tumor microenvironments, which typically exhibit moduli in the 1–30 kPa range [ 34 Figure 1 2.2. Biocompatibility of Hydrogels After Bioprinting Following mechanical characterization of the four hydrogel formulations, we conducted biocompatibility assessment using a 3D-bioprinted model comprising commercially available mesenchymal stromal cells. BM-MSCs were selected as a representative model for early-stage hydrogel screening prior to employing SVF, due to their shared mesenchymal phenotype and comparable behavior in terms of adhesion, viability, and matrix interaction. Their relative homogeneity and widespread availability make them well-suited for evaluating the general cytocompatibility of biomaterials in a reproducible and controlled manner. BM-MSCs were bioprinted at a density of 2 × 10 6 Figure 2 To further characterize cellular response within the various hydrogel matrices, we evaluated oxidative stress and membrane integrity by measuring intracellular ROS levels and LDH release, respectively ( Figure 2 2.3. Growth and Stability of Bioprinted SVF Following the identification of GelMA as the hydrogel exhibiting the highest degree of biocompatibility among the materials tested, we proceeded with the bioprinting of the SVF. A bioink was formulated by combining GelMA with freshly isolated SVF, and the resulting mixture was bioprinted and crosslinked using the same protocol previously optimized for BM-MSCs. To evaluate the biological performance of the bioprinted constructs, we longitudinally assessed the state of the cellular component in terms of biocompatibility and cytotoxicity. The corresponding results are presented in Figure 3 Figure 3 35 36 Figure 3 Another key element that should be taken into account for clinical translation is the long-term stability of bioprinted scaffolds. We, therefore, were interested in evaluating the rate of degradation of GelMA bioprinted with SVF at physiological pH. Results are shown in Figure 3 Figure 3 This behavior can be attributed to hydrolytic degradation, which is amplified in acidic environments, leading to more efficient cleavage of the peptide bonds within the protein chains present in the crosslinked network [ 37 Simultaneously, a faster reduction in scaffold area was observed at lower pH values ( Figure 3 38 39 2.4. SVF-Enhanced Intestinal Epithelial Regeneration Maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier is of critical importance for preserving tissue homeostasis and preventing the translocation of luminal contents, including bacteria and pro-inflammatory mediators, into the underlying mucosa and systemic circulation [ 11 12 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 40 41 2.5. Wound Healing Wound healing represents a critical component of intestinal tissue regeneration, where epithelial and stromal discontinuities impair barrier function and promote chronic inflammation [ 42 43 42 Figure 5 Figure 5 2.6. Tube Formation Assay The formation of new blood vessels is a critical component of any regenerative process, particularly within the gastrointestinal tract, where efficient tissue repair depends on the timely restoration of microvascular networks [ 44 45 46 47 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure 6 3. Conclusions In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility and therapeutic relevance of a bioprinted SVF model for the regeneration of intestinal epithelial tissue. By systematically evaluating multiple hydrogel formulations, we identified GelMA as the most suitable matrix to support the viability, proliferation, and functional stability of SVF-derived cellular constructs. The GelMA-based bioink not only provided a biocompatible environment for SVF, but also ensured scaffold durability under physiologically relevant pH conditions, including those mimicking the microenvironments often found in the gastrointestinal tract. Our in vitro co-culture models revealed that bioprinted SVF promotes key regenerative responses across multiple cellular compartments. Specifically, bioprinted SVF enhanced epithelial cell viability, reduced oxidative stress, and accelerated the re-establishment of barrier integrity, as evidenced by increased trans-epithelial electrical resistance. Moreover, SVF stimulated fibroblast migration in a wound healing assay and significantly increased angiogenic activity in endothelial cells, with upregulation of VEGF expression and the formation of complex vascular networks. Taken together, these findings highlight the multifactorial regenerative potential of SVF when delivered in a bioprinted format, supporting not only epithelial regeneration, but also stromal and vascular remodeling. This approach offers a promising platform for translational applications in gastrointestinal tissue repair and opens new perspectives for the development of advanced, patient-derived therapies for conditions such as intestinal fistulae. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Hydrogel Preparation GelMA, GelMA A, Cellink-RGD, and alginate were obtained from Cellink (CELLINK). For each condition, 20 µL of hydrogel was dispensed onto a Petri dish. Alginate and Cellink-RGD (alginate covalently conjugated with the RGD peptide for cell adhesion and reinforced with nanofibrillated cellulose) were crosslinked using a 3% ( w v 2 4.2. Atomic Force Microscopy Atomic force microscopy (AFM) indentation experiments were conducted using a standard setup where a cantilever with a specifically shaped tip approaches the sample surface at a controlled speed. The cantilever indents the sample until a predefined maximum force is reached, then retracts. Throughout the process, cantilever deflection and displacement are recorded and used to assess the mechanical properties of the sample. The Young’s modulus is typically extracted from the resulting force–indentation curves [ 31 4.3. Cell Culture Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells, BJ human fibroblasts, and EA.hy926 human endothelial cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). BM-MSCs were cultured in Mesencult (STEMCELL, Vancouver, Canada) supplemented with 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Caco-2 cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 20% FBS (EuroClone, Milan, Italy) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. BJ fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM and M199 (Euroclone) at a ratio of 4:1, respectively, supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.02% igromicine (Sigma-Aldrich). EA.hy926 were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. Cells were kept in T75 flasks (Corning, NY, USA) at 37 °C under 5% CO 2 4.4. Isolation of SVF The harvested fat, taken from the medial region of the thighs through a suction microcannula, necessitates the use of a Digital Vortex Mixer (Elea Surgere S.R.L., Verona, Italy). After placing the syringes with the lipoaspirate contents in the disposable cup on the Vortex Mixer, an orbital force of 2000 rpm is applied for 8 min. This process activates the atMSCs and separates the lipidic part and the serum. The liquid and the oil are discharged; instead, the remaining fat is emulsified, passing through a 2 mm filter and then loaded in a 19-gauge endoscopic needle for the endoscopic injection in the submucosal layer around the fistula. 4.5. Bioprinting of BM-MSCs and SVF To create the bioink for bioprinting BM-MSCs, cells at a density of 2 × 10 6 The bioinks were then loaded on a 3 mL bioprinting cartridge (CELLINK, Boston, MA, USA). The cartridge was then transferred to a Bio X6 bioprinter (CELLINK). A droplet print of the formed bioink was used as a printing strategy. A temperature controlled printhead (CELLINK) was mounted on the BIO X6, using a nozzle diameter of 18 G (840 µm). The printbed temperature was set at RT, while the printhead was set at 30 °C. Bioprinting was performed by extruding at 10 kPa, with an extrusion time of 2 s on a 24-well plate (Corning). After droplet extrusion, photocrosslinking was performed with a photocuring printhead (CELLINK) at a distance of 3 cm from the samples, for 30 s. Fresh culture medium was added to each bioprinted model, and the plate was incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO 2 4.6. Degradation of Bioprinted SVF Bioprinted models were subjected to degradation testing by immersion in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Corning) solutions with different pH values, selected to simulate the main anatomical regions where intestinal discontinuities commonly form. The following pH values were used: pH 2.5 to mimic the gastric environment, pH 5.5 for the proximal colon, pH 6.8 for the distal colon/rectum, and pH 7.4 for the small intestine. Models were incubated in PBS solutions at 37 °C for 14 days. During this period, both the optical density (OD) of the solution and the dimensional changes of the samples were monitored at specific time points: 0 h, 1 h, 12 h, 1 day, 2, 4, 7, 11, and 14 days. For OD measurements, the reference parameter was the ratio between the OD at time zero and that measured at each time point. For sample dimensions, the reference parameter was the ratio between the initial area and the area at the corresponding time point. 4.7. Cell Viability To test cell viability on bioprinted BM-MSCs over time on the four different hydrogels, we used Real Time-Glo ® ® 2 ® 4 ® 4.8. Trans-Epithelial Electrical Resistance Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was monitored on Caco-2 cells to observe intestinal epithelial layer formation. For this purpose, we seeded Caco-2 cells on the top chamber of a transwell system having pores of 0.4 μm. Bioprinted SVF was then put in the bottom chamber of the transwell. TEER was measured by using a Millicel ® 4.9. Reactive Oxygen Species Production Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured on BM-MSCs bioprinted with the four different hydrogels and on SVF bioprinted with GelMA by using a fluorinated derivative of 2′,7′-di-chlorofluorescein (H 2 2 2 2 4 2 4.10. Lactate Dehydrogenase Release To measure cytotoxicity on BM-MSCs, we used a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) assay. Briefly, the LDH was evaluated on the supernatants of bioprinted models. Each supernatant was diluted before incubation with the substrate. Thirty minutes later, absorbance at 450 nm was measured with a Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader. Results were normalized by the number of viable cells and reported with respect to day 0. 4.11. Wound Healing Assay BJ cells were seeded at a concentration of 1.8 × 10 5 2 2 4.12. Tube Formation Assay Prior to endothelial cell seeding, the bottom of a transwell 24-well plate was coated with 0.3 mL Matrigel ® 5 2 4.13. ELISA Assay Supernatants were collected, and the concentration of vascular-endothelial growth factor (VEGF) released by SVF was determined by Human VEGF-A ELISA kit (Sigma-Aldrich). The assay was performed on undiluted conditioned media, and each sample was tested in triplicate. According to the manufacturer’s instructions, 100 µL of sample and standard working solution were loaded in a 96-well plate and incubated for 2.5 h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The solution in each well was removed, and the biotinylated detection Ab working solution was added. Following a 1-h incubation, HRP-conjugated streptavidin was added and incubated for an additional 45 min. Between each incubation step, the wells were washed four times with wash buffer. Subsequently, the TMB substrate solution was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, protected from light, until the color turned blue. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 µL of stop solution to each well, resulting in a color change to yellow. Absorbance was immediately measured at 450 nm using a Cytation 3 Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader. 4.14. Statistical Analysis All measurements were performed in triplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post-hoc test.
