This underscores need for innovative treatment strategies. Protein-based nanoparticles known for enhanced bioavailability, targeted drug delivery, and reduced systemic toxicity, have emerged as promising tools against oncology. Lactoferrin, a multifunctional non-heme glycoprotein, exhibits diverse biological applications, including antimicrobial, antiviral, antiparasitic, and anti-cancer abilities. Current work reports the synthesis of spherical lactoferrin-coated copper nanoparticles (Cu-LFNPs) and evaluated for their anti-melanoma and antibacterial potential. The synthesized Cu-LFNPs exhibit enhanced stability, water solubility, drug loading efficiency (86.14 ± 3.45%), and sustained release profile (86.99 ± 1.77% release in 36 h). The Cu-LFNPs exhibit significant toxicity against A375 melanoma cells, reducing cell viability to 23.24 ± 1.84% at 40 µg/mL which is further supported by scratch assay. These findings suggest that Cu-LFNPs exhibit colossal potential to serve as an effective therapeutic strategy against malignant melanoma.

Here, we synthesized lactoferrin-copper nanoparticles through a one-pot method to determine the synergy of lactoferrin and copper for the treatment of skin cancer when delivered as nano-size particles. Further, these nanoparticles present a novel approach by combining the biocompatibility, antimicrobial, and anti-cancer properties of lactoferrin with antibacterial features of copper nanoparticles. The use of lactoferrin as a natural capping and stabilising agent offers an eco-friendly and biologically safe option in comparison to the traditional copper nanoparticles which require chemical stabilizers and capping agents that may lead to toxicity. This hybrid will increase the solubility and dispersibility of nanoparticles and provide synergistic biological impact eventually enhancing its therapeutic efficacy. Also, the synthesis using biomolecule aligns well with green chemistry principles thus making this approach more sustainable compared to previous synthesis techniques. Thus, we hypothesized that the delivery of lactoferrin-conjugated copper nanoparticles would offer enhanced efficacy in skin cancer treatment based on their potential role as drug delivery, anti-cancer agents and antibacterial agents. Materials and methods Chemicals and cell line The Copper sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO 4 2 2 3 ˚ 2 Formulation of lactoferrin-based copper nanoparticles The lactoferrin-based copper nanoparticles were synthesized using the one-pot method. Initially, 7.98 mg of CuSO 4 2 ˚ ˚ 30 Analysis of particle size, morphology, and elemental analysis The morphology of lactoferrin-based copper nanoparticles was examined using High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) (Talos F200S G2, Thermo Scientific). Sample preparation involved centrifuging the formulations at 2400 RCF (Relative Centrifugal Force) for 10 min, followed by thorough washing of the pellet to remove any unbound copper sulfate or other impurities. To determine hydrodynamic size of Cu-LFNPs, the DLS (Dynamic Light Scattering) was conducted using a Malvern DLS-Zeta size analyzer. Furthermore, the elemental composition of the sample was assessed by analyzing the obtained pellet obtained with an Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrometer (EDS) (Bruker QUANTAX 200), allowing for the quantification of elements present in the sample 1 32 In silico studies To identify potential interaction sites on the desired protein chain for various transition metal ions, the online docking server, MIB (Metal Ion Binding) was employed. This platform provided a reliable and unified approach for determining the amino acids suitable for metal binding sites. The protein chains required for analysis were retrieved from the Protein Data Bank database (PDB). In this process, the first chain contained a metal-ion and served as the template protein (T) with a length of m, while the second chain represented the query protein (S) with a length of n. Using the fragment transformation method, both chains were aligned correctly to facilitate the conversion of metal ion binding template protein into the query protein structure. Several steps were undertaken to obtain the desired protein structures. Initially, the effective binding residues for different transition metal ions, including Ni 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ 2+ +, 3+ 54 In this study, the PDB database was used to obtain lactoferrin protein (PDB ID: 1LFI), a polypeptide with a chain denoted as A. The MIB tool was then used to dock the Cu 2+ 55 Study of absorption and fluorescence spectroscopic study To measure absorbance, a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer was utilized within the wavelength range of 200–800 nm. A quartz cuvette with a 1 cm path length and capacity of 4000 µl was employed. The OD (optical density) values were recorded for lactoferrin, salt solution (CuSO 4 Fluorescence data for Cu-LFNPs were obtained using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer from Agilent technologies. This instrument facilitated the determination of the fluorescence intensity for protein-linked metal nanoparticles (Cu-LFNPs), lactoferrin, and CuSO 4 To calculate the percentage change in intrinsic Fluorescence Intensity (FI) for lactoferrin and Cu-LFNPs, the equation (1) was used. These values were simply obtained from the fluorescence maxima obtained in the spectra performed as mentioned above. By putting these values for Cu-LFNPs and lactoferrin the percentage change in emission intensity is obtained as follows. 1 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\% {\\text{ Change in emission intensity}} = \\frac{{{\\text{F}}.{\\text{I}}.\\left( {{\\text{Cu}} - {\\text{LFNPs}}} \\right) - {\\text{F}}.{\\text{I}}.\\left( {{\\text{lactoferrin}}} \\right)}}{{{\\text{F}}.{\\text{I}}.\\left( {{\\text{lactoferrin}}} \\right)}} \\times 100\\%$$\\end{document} The quantum yield of lactoferrin and lactoferrin-based copper nanoparticles (Cu-LFNPs) was determined using standard tyrosine fluorescence quantum yield.

Study of copper-lactoferrin interaction using FTIR spectroscopy FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy) was performed to investigate metal-protein interactions in the Cu-LFNPs using an Agilent Cary 600 series Spectrophotometer. Sample preparation followed the potassium bromide (KBr) pellet and spectral scanning was conducted in the range of 400 cm −1 −1 Drug loading and release kinetics To assess the release kinetics, 1 mL of the Cu-LFNPs containing LF (Lactoferrin) at a concentration of 4 mg/mL was centrifuged for 15 min at 8000 RCF. The lactoferrin content in both the supernatant and the pellet was quantified using the Bradford reagent. The release profile of lactoferrin was monitored over a fixed period of 36 h. Absorbance measurements at 595 nm were recorded and plotted to analyse the release pattern of drug, utilizing Bradford standard curves for reference.

A CI value of less than 1 (CI < 1) is obtained when the distinct drugs, after being given together, work efficiently to increase each other’s effectiveness and is termed a synergistic effect. CI value equal to 1 (CI = 1) signifies an additive effect, meaning neither drug interferes with the other’s action. Conversely, a CI value greater than 1 (CI > 1) confirms the antagonistic effect, where one drug inhibits the efficacy of other. To calculate the combination index, the viability of A375 cells was assessed at varying concentrations of copper and lactoferrin, followed by calculation using following equation (e). 4 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{CI }} = \\left( {\\text{D}} \\right)1/\\left( {{\\text{Dx}}} \\right)1 +\\left( {\\text{D}} \\right)2/\\left( {{\\text{Dx}}} \\right)2$$\\end{document} 5 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{Where}},{\\text{Dx}} = {\\text{Dm}}{\\left[ {{\\text{fa}}/{\\text{fu}}} \\right]^{1/{\\text{m}}}}$$\\end{document} Here, (D)1 and (D)2 exhibit the concentrations of copper salt and lactoferrin, respectively, while (Dx)1 and (Dx)2 denote the single drug concentrations required to achieve the same effect.

UV-visible spectroscopy revealed a distinct peak at 272 nm for LF without any added metal salts with an absorbance value of 0.15. This peak was attributed to the presence of tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine in the lactoferrin chain which contribute to a π – π* transition. After incubating LF with metal salts for 48 h the nanoparticles exhibited an increased absorbance value of 0.24 at the same wavelength (272 nm), as illustrated in Fig. 3 S2 Fluorescence analysis was carried out by exciting Cu-LFNPs at 272 nm resulting in a broad emission peak spanning 280–440 nm, with maximum intensity of 304.89 a.u. at approximately 303 nm, as depicted in Fig. 3 S2 S2 Characterizing protein-metal ion interactions post nanoparticle synthesis using FTIR spectra To examine changes in the functional groups of lactoferrin upon interactions with the copper sulphate, the FTIR analysis was conducted for CuSO 4 4 3 −1 58 −1 −1 2 59 −1 4 −1 38 −1 −1 1 −1 4 60 −1 58 −1 59 −1 4 61 −1, −1 37 −1 38 −1 4 −1 54 −1 −1 62 1 −1 −1 −1 4 −1  Table 1 The comparative wavenumber values indicated by FTIR (in the range 400–4000 cm −1 4, 4 Functional group CuSO 4 Lactoferrin Cu-LFNPs References Amine NH stretch 3566.62 3450.70 3566.62 3450.70  62 OH stretch 3450.70 3230.09 3230.09  54 Amide-B -CH stretch – 2938.71 2938.71  38 Nitrile stretch – 2018.60 2018.60  37 Amide I stretch – 1630.19 1630.19  37 H-O-H bending vibration 1625.17 - -  61 Amide II stretch – 1535.71 1535.71  59 Amide III stretch – 1397.26 1397.26  58 Asymmetric vibration of sulphate ions 1396.14 – –  60 C-N stretch – 1083.72 1134.61  1 -Cu-OH stretch 1010.67 – 1004.45  38 C-S stretch – 609.30 609.30  59 NH 2 – 674.96 674.96  59 S-S stretch 470.58 470.58  58 Analysis of drug loading and release dynamics The drug loading capacity and release kinetics of Cu-LFNPs were evaluated revealing an encapsulation efficiency of 86.14 ± 3.45%, which confirmed successful incorporation of lactoferrin within nanoparticles.

This study is aimed to explore the potential of protein-based metallic nano-formulations by synthesizing lactoferrin-coated copper nanoparticles as a dual action anti-cancer and anti-bacterial agents based on the characteristic properties of individual components. The key findings of this study includes but not limited to the synthesis of uniform nanoscale sized particles with size 13 ± 2 nm and showed tremendous potential to be used as targeted drug delivery agents as lactoferrin interacts with sialic acid, proteoglycan, and glycosaminoglycan that are widely found on cancer cells surface. Further, these formulations demonstrate tremendous drug loading and release profiles essential for a potential delivery system. Additionally, the cytotoxicity analysis, migration assay, and combination index analysis emphasized the synergistic effect among copper and lactoferrin, eventually resulting in higher anti-cancer activity against malignant melanoma cells (A375) and that too at very low concentrations, indicating enhanced efficacy. Lactoferrin binds to lactoferrin binding receptors and enters the cytosol of cells. There it downregulates the Bcl-2, leading to ROS generation which further causes DNA damage, oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction which eventually leads to apoptosis through activating cytochrome c and caspases. On the other hand copper ions causes ROS generation and follow the same pathway as lactoferrin and causes apoptosis. Along with this, copper causes cuproptosis via decreasing iron-sulphur cluster proteins and leads to cellular dysfunction and eventually cell death. The mechanism of action of Cu-LFNPs is shown in Fig. 6  Fig. 6 The figure illustrates mechanistic insights into the anti-cancer effect of synthesized Cu-LFNPs. The lactoferrin interacts with cancerous cells through the receptors present on the cell membranes, and lactoferrin, along with copper ions, gets released into the cytosol. Both of them cause ROS generation, and lactoferrin leads to apoptosis, and, copper causes cuproptosis eventually resulting in cell death. The green color is indicative of mitochondrial signaling pathway, pink color indicates cytosolic signaling while the blue color indicates the end result of these pathways.
