Introduction Cancer is one of the most significant public health challenges countries face and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality that affects an increasing number of people worldwide [ 1 2 3 4 3 Cancer has physical and profound psychological impacts on individuals. One of the most prevalent psychological consequences cancer patients experience is fears of cancer recurrence (FCR), commonly observed across all cancer types [ 5 6 7 6 7 8 9 Research indicates that FCR is prevalent among cancer survivors, persisting from the time of diagnosis [ 5 6 10 11 5 12 13 14 15 8 FCR is associated with impaired quality of life and psychosocial adjustment, high emotional distress, and a range of physical symptoms [ 13 16 17 18 19 11 13 17 19 20 15 Hematological malignancies present distinct psychological challenges that influence FCR’s expression and assessment. Unlike solid tumors, these cancers often require prolonged, intensive treatments, including extended hospitalizations, multiple chemotherapy cycles, and continuous monitoring for complications [ 21 22 23 24 The use of validated assessment tools is recommended in both research and clinical settings to enhance FCR management [ 25 24 26 FCR-7 consists of four items assessing the level of concern about cancer recurrence, two items evaluating the extent to which FCR affects patient thoughts and activities, and one item assessing patient behavioral responses. The final item represents a scale reflecting patient experiences regarding FCR severity. FCR-4 includes the first four items of FCR-7 [ 26 12 13 12 13 17 18 19 27 28 These scales offer several key advantages for FCR assessment. First, their brief format (4–7 items) makes them highly practical for routine clinical screening and reduces patient burden. This is particularly important for cancer patients who may experience fatigue or distress during lengthy assessments. Second, these scales have demonstrated robust psychometric properties across diverse populations and cancer types. Previous validation studies have consistently reported strong internal consistency, adequate test–retest reliability, and clear single-factor structures across breast, lung, colorectal, and other cancer populations [ 12 13 17 18 19 27 Despite their established strengths and widespread use, the psychometric properties of FCR-4, FCR-6, and FCR-7 have not been established specifically in hematological cancer patients or validated for use in Turkish health-care contexts. Hematological cancers’ unique characteristics make it essential to ascertain whether these scales maintain their psychometric properties within this specific patient population. Türkiye’s annual burden of more than 15,000 new hematological cancer cases [ 3 29 This study focused specifically on adult patients (aged 18 years and older) with hematological malignancies because FCR manifestation and measurement may differ between adult and pediatric populations. This study aimed to adapt FCR-4, FCR-6, and FCR-7 to Turkish and examine their psychometric properties specifically in adult hematological cancer patients receiving treatment at state hospitals in four different provinces of Türkiye. The multi-center approach was chosen to enhance the generalizability of findings across diverse Turkish health-care settings and patient demographics. The specific objectives were to examine FCR scales’ construct validity and factor structure; determine measurement invariance across gender groups; assess convergent and discriminant validity; evaluate known-groups validity across gender; and establish reliability, including both internal consistency and test–retest reliability of the scales in this population. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Participants We conducted this study with two different samples. In the first sample, we performed construct, convergent, and discriminant validity analyses as well as item analyses of the scales. In the second sample, we conducted test–retest reliability analyses. We selected both samples using convenience sampling. A total of 239 patients participated across the studies. Eligible participants were adults aged 18 years or older with a confirmed diagnosis of hematological cancer. All participants were required to be in remission, receiving treatment at participating hematology clinics, and capable of providing informed consent. Patients were excluded if they had active disease, cognitive impairments that would prevent questionnaire completion, severe psychiatric disorders, or inability to communicate in Turkish. 2.2. Measures Personal Information Form: We developed this form to obtain information about participants’ gender, age, education level, cancer type, cancer duration, and employment status. FCR-7: We used FCR-7, which Humphris et al. [ 26 12 13 Turkish Adaptation of FCR-7: We followed the International Test Commission’s [ 30 Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21): We used DASS-21 [ 31 32 33 Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS): We used the SWLS developed by Diener et al. [ 34 35 Single-Item Happiness Scale (SIHS): We administered the SIHS developed by Topkaya et al. [ 36 Single-Item General Health Scale (SIGHS): We used SIGHS to determine general self-rated health levels among cancer patients. The scale asked participants to respond to the question, “How would you rate your overall health?” Responses were rated on a 10-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very poor) to 10 (very good). Scores ranged from 1 to 10, with higher scores indicating better subjective health evaluations. Previous research provided strong evidence of the construct validity of single-item health measures by demonstrating their associations with objective health assessments; various indicators of physical, psychological, and functional health; chronic conditions; and health-related behaviors [ 37 38 39 2.3. Procedure We collected data from patients in hematology clinics at four different hospitals between March and June 2025. Before initiating the study, we obtained ethical approval from the Çanakkale University Scientific Research and Publication Ethics Committee. This study was also conducted in accordance with the ethical standards for medical research involving human participants outlined in the World Medical Association’s Declaration of Helsinki. We collected data through face-to-face interviews conducted by researchers with hematology patients. We informed patients that their participation was voluntary, that their information would remain confidential, and that they could withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. All patients voluntarily participated. For the test–retest sample, patients completed the data collection form (Personal Information Form, FCR7) again after a one-month interval. The time required for participants to complete the data collection forms ranged from approximately 5 to 20 min, depending on the specific study. 2.4. Statistical Analysis We conducted all statistical analyses using SPSS 27, Stata 15 [ 40 41 13 17 19 26 27 26 M SD We examined the fit of data to models through goodness-of-fit indices. In this research, we used goodness-of-fit indices that model complexity and sample size did not affect. These indices are recommended for the maximum likelihood parameter estimates with standard errors and a mean- and variance-adjusted chi-square (χ 2 41 2 2 2 42 43 44 45 p 2 We used Pearson’s product–moment correlation analysis to examine the convergent and discriminant validity of FCR scale scores. We also used independent samples t t 46 47 We calculated item–total correlation values, Cronbach’s alpha internal consistency coefficients, and McDonald’s omega values based on classical test theory to examine the reliability of FCR-7, FCR-4, and FCR6. Additionally, we used the Graded Response Model to calculate item discrimination parameters of each item, based on item response theory. As a general rule, corrected item–total correlations of 0.30 and above are considered adequate [ 45 48 48 49 50 51 52 p 3. Results 3.1.

Discussion This study examined the validity and reliability of three FCR scales (FCR-7, FCR-4, and FCR-6) in hematological cancer patients. To assess construct validity, we tested alternative models and found that the single-factor structure, which allowed correlated error terms between the first and second items, demonstrated superior goodness-of-fit indices compared to other single-factor models and demonstrated excellent fit with the data for all three scales. The model parameter estimates, including item factor loadings, standard errors, and the proportion of variance explained, were adequate [ 43 44 53 26 12 13 17 18 19 27 28 27 13 Although researchers consistently support a single-factor structure for FCR scales, they frequently add correlated error terms between specific items [ 19 27 This study also found that FCR-7, FCR-4, and FCR-6 demonstrated configural, metric, scalar, and strict measurement invariance across gender. The configural invariance of FCR-7, FCR-4, and FCR-6 indicates that women and men conceptualize FCR in the same way or that the same item–factor structure exists across groups. Practically, these findings imply that researchers can use the same scale structure for both male and female patients when screening FCR. The metric invariance of FCR-7, FCR-4, and FCR-6 also suggests that the strength of the relationship between FCR-7, FCR-4, and FCR-6 items and the latent FCR factor is equivalent between women and men, or more simply, that the same latent factor is measured in each group. Practically, these findings denote that if a man and a woman have the same underlying level of FCR, they interpret and respond to each item in a comparable way. Therefore, researchers can confidently compare latent associations between FCR and other variables (e.g., depression, quality of life) across genders. The scalar invariance of FCR-7, FCR-4, and FCR-6 reveals that individuals with the same level of latent FCR will have equivalent observed scores, regardless of gender. This means that any observed differences in FCR scale scores between men and women reflect true differences in underlying FCR levels rather than measurement bias. For example, if women score higher than men on average, this difference reflects real higher FCR rather than gender-based measurement artifacts. Finally, the strict invariance of FCR-7, FCR-4, and FCR-6 indicates that the amount of item variance not accounted for by latent FCR is similar across groups and that there are no significant differences in error covariance between the first and second items across groups. This demonstrates that the scales measure FCR with equivalent precision across genders. Because the strict invariance of FCR-7, FCR-4, and FCR-6 indicates that group differences by gender are due only to true differences in means, researchers can validly compare observed and latent mean differences, variances, and covariances by gender [ 43 44 53 The findings of the convergent and discriminant validity analysis indicate that FCR7, FCR4, and FCR6 scale scores are negatively associated with variables measuring psychological well-being (happiness, general health evaluations, life satisfaction) at low to moderate magnitudes and moderately positively associated with variables measuring similar qualities (depression, anxiety, and stress). The present findings are consistent with previous research that has demonstrated FCR scales’ convergent and discriminant validity [ 12 13 17 18 19 17 19 13 18 Known-groups validity refers to a type of construct validity that evaluates an instrument’s ability to detect significant differences between groups that are theoretically or empirically expected to differ. In this study, results revealed that women scored significantly higher than men on all versions of the FCR scales (FCR-7, FCR-4, and FCR-6). These findings support those of previous research. For example, a meta-analysis conducted by Pang and Humphris [ 14 12 13 The results of the test–retest reliability, item analysis, internal consistency, and floor and ceiling effect analyses support the reliability of the FCR scales. The test–retest reliability analyses demonstrated that the FCR scales had good temporal stability over a one-month interval and produced similar and relatively stable scores over time [ 46 47 54 26 Similarly, McDonald’s omega and Cronbach’s alpha reliability values indicate high internal consistency among items across all FCR scales. These findings demonstrate that FCR scales can be used for screening, clinical assessment and decision-making, and research purposes. These findings support prior studies that also reported high reliability for the FCR scales [ 12 13 17 18 19 26 27 52 4.1. Practical Implications The findings of this study demonstrate that the FCR scales (FCR-7, FCR-6, and FCR-4) are reliable and valid instruments for assessing FCR in patients with hematological cancers. Clinicians and researchers can confidently use different versions of these scales to evaluate FCR levels among hematologic cancer patients, depending on their specific needs or research purposes. The measurement invariance of the FCR scales across gender indicates that these scales can be appropriately used to compare FCR levels between male and female patients. This enables gender-based comparisons and intervention planning. The known-groups validity of the scales suggests that they are capable of distinguishing between individuals at varying levels of risk, thereby supporting their use in identifying high-risk patients for targeted support, early screening, and risk stratification in oncology clinics. The high test–retest reliability of the scales also indicates that these scales are suitable for use in longitudinal studies and evaluations of treatment or intervention outcomes. Finally, the absence of floor and ceiling effects in the FCR scales denotes that these instruments can assess the full spectrum of FCR, from mild to severe symptoms. This characteristic makes them suitable for diverse patient populations across all disease stages. Overall, the strong psychometric characteristics of FCR scales make them valuable tools for routine psycho-oncological assessments. These scales can guide personalized intervention strategies and support longitudinal research to improve patient quality of life. For example, health-care providers can identify patients requiring mental health specialist referrals or evaluate survivorship program effectiveness. 4.2. Limitations This study has several limitations. First, its scope is limited to data collected from only four hospitals (Çorum, İzmir, Manisa, and Çanakkale). Therefore, the generalizability of its findings to all hematological cancer patients in Türkiye is restricted. The external validity of our findings is also limited because the hematological cancer patients we examined represent only a small minority of the global cancer patient population. It is possible that the interpretation and expression of FCR symptoms could differ significantly in various cancer patient groups. Second, because this study used self-report data collection tools, the results are subject to limitations, such as social desirability bias or recall bias. Additionally, participants’ current emotional state, response styles (e.g., acquiescence or extreme responding), or lack of insight into their own psychological processes may have influenced self-report measures. These factors can lead to inaccuracies or distortions in the reported data and may limit the validity of the findings. Third, this study did not account for other external factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, comorbid physical illnesses, level of social support, or recent stressful life events) that could influence the symptom intensity of FCR and lead to systematic changes in item responses that are not attributable to the latent construct of FCR. Fourth, although subgroup analyses confirmed the validity and reliability of FCR-7, FCR-4, and FCR-6 scales for employed and unemployed participants, as well as for participants with multiple myeloma and lymphoma, the small sample sizes in these subgroups may limit these findings’ generalizability. Unemployed patients and those with specific cancer types may experience unique psychosocial stressors (e.g., financial instability or disease-specific challenges) that could influence FCR manifestation. Finally, although this research examined the structural, convergent, discriminant validity, and reliability of the FCR scales, it did not investigate their predictive validity. Therefore, future studies could conduct predictive validity analyses to determine the extent to which the FCR scales can predict future health behaviors, quality of life, psychosocial adjustment, and treatment adherence. Consequently, future studies should test the predictive validity of these scales, employ larger and more diverse samples, conduct comparative analyses across different cancer types, and use longitudinal research designs to examine changes in FCR over time. 5. Conclusions This study examined FCR scales’ validity and reliability. The findings indicated that the scales possess a unidimensional structure. Convergent and discriminant validity analyses demonstrated that the scales correlate with subjective well-being indicators (happiness, life satisfaction, subjective health evaluations) and psychological distress indicators (depression, anxiety, stress) in expected directions. Further, the known-groups validity analysis revealed that the scales effectively distinguished between groups and replicated the finding consistently established in previous research that women report significantly higher levels of FCR compared to men. The reliability analyses further demonstrated that all FCR scales are reliable instruments for use among patients with hematological cancers. Overall, the results provide strong psychometric support for the use of FCR-7, FCR-4, and FCR-6 as valid and reliable tools for assessing FCR in Turkish patients with hematological cancers. These scales can help clinicians assess FCR levels in patients and design appropriate treatment strategies.
