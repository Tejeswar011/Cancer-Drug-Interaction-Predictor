However, limited data are available regarding the incidence and impact of EPI on quality of life (QoL) following gastric surgery. AIM To evaluate incidence and severity of EPI after gastrectomy and its effect on QoL at least one year after surgery. METHODS EPI was assessed using fecal elastase measurement and classified into: (1) No-EPI (fecal elastase > 200 μg/g); (2) Moderate EPI (fecal elastase 100–200 μg/g); and (3) severe EPI (fecal elastase < 100 μg/g). QoL was measured using the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) questionnaire. RESULTS Sixteen out of 44 (36.4%) patients developed EPI post-operatively: 9 (56.2%) patients had moderate EPI while 7 (43.8%) patients had severe EPI. Severe EPI was more frequently observed in younger patients (5/7: 71.4%; P P P P P P P CONCLUSION Gastrectomy is a cause of EPI. Younger patients, aggressive disease and advanced stages are significant risk factors for more severe EPI. Severe EPI worsens QoL, being associated with a higher rate of gastrointestinal symptoms.

This condition inevitably affects QoL, with clinical manifestations ranging from nutritional deficiencies to acid and biliary refluxes, altered gastric emptying and dumping syndrome[ 3 4 5 6 7 . Although the connection between gastric resection and the development of EPI has been widely demonstrated, only few studies[ 8 11 Based on these premises, the aim of this prospective study is to assess the incidence of EPI following gastrectomy for GC at a tertiary referral center for the surgical treatment of gastric tumors and to evaluate the impact of EPI on QoL of affected patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS After Institutional Review Board and Ethical Committee approvals, all patients aged 18 years or older who underwent surgery for GC between March 2016 and January 2023 at the Digestive Surgery Unit of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario “Agostino Gemelli” IRCCS of Rome were retrospectively enrolled from a prospectively maintained database. Exclusion criteria included a previous history of major abdominal surgery, preoperative malnutrition or malabsorption, and/or the development of postoperative pancreatitis. Perioperative data collected encompassed demographic characteristics, patients’ comorbidities (diabetes, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases), the American Society of Anesthesiologists score, tumor location categorized as proximal (cardia and gastric fundus), middle (gastric body) or distal (gastric antrum), neoadjuvant therapy (NAT), type of surgical procedure performed [TG, STG and superior polar gastrectomy (SPG)] and reconstruction technique after STG (Billroth II or Roux-en-Y reconstructions), histological type according to Lauren classification, and tumor staging according to the 8 th 12 A prospective evaluation of the incidence rate of EPI through the measurement of fecal elastase levels and QoL using the Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) questionnaire was conducted in patients with a follow up of at least one year. EPI definition and grading EPI was defined as fecal elastase levels ≤ 200 μg/g and graded as severe for levels < 100 μg/g and moderate for levels between 100 μg/g and 199 μg/g[ 13 ® in vitro QoL evaluation For QoL evaluation, the GIQLI questionnaire was administered either personally or electronically via The GIQLI questionnaire[ 14 Surgical technique The details of the surgical procedures were previously reported[ 15 16 Study outcomes The primary endpoint of the study was to objectively determine the incidence rate and severity of EPI following gastrectomy, with a particular focus on the potential influence of clinico-demographic and surgery-related factors on its development. The secondary endpoint was to evaluate changes in QoL after surgery, with a sub-analysis assessing QoL variations according to EPI severity. Statistical analysis All continuous data were reported as median and quartile rank while numbers and percentages were used for all categorical data. Univariate analysis included Mann-Whitney U χ 2 P RESULTS From March 2016 to January 2023, 255 patients underwent gastric resection for GC at the Digestive Surgery Unit of Fondazione Policlinico Universitario “Agostino Gemelli” IRCCS of Rome. Of them, 131 (51.4%) patients underwent STG, 89 (34.9%) patients underwent TG, 25 (9.8%) patients underwent SPG, and 9 (3.5%) patients underwent a degastro-gastrectomy. Two hundred and eleven (82.7%) patients were excluded from the study for the following reasons: (1) 6 (2.3%) patients developed postoperative pancreatitis; (2) 16 (7.6%) patients died within one year after surgery; (3) 53 (25.1%) patients had a history of major surgical procedures; and (4) 136 (64.4%) patients either declined participation in the prospective evaluation of EPI and QoL or were lost to follow-up. Thus, the final study cohort consisted of 44 (17.3%) patients.

To assess the impact of gastrectomy on EPI development, fecal elastase levels were compared between the study cohort and a control group of healthy subjects. Patients who underwent gastrectomy had significantly lower median fecal elastase levels (343.5 μg/g, range: 157–513.75 μg/g) compared to healthy controls (800 μg/g, range: 610–800 μg/g, P QoL evaluation At the QoL evaluation, no difference was noted in terms of GIQLI score between the EPI and no-EPI cohort and no significant difference was documented based on the clinico-demographic characteristics of patients, surgical procedures and histopathological features. However, patients with severe EPI had a significantly lower median GIQLI score [65 (59-92)] compared to those with no-EPI and moderate EPI [89 (84-100) ( P 3 4 P Table 3 Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index score according to the clinico-demographic characteristics and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency severity of the study population, n  Variables  Study population ( n  Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index, median (QR)   P Sex Male 26 (59.1) 85 (76-96) 0.68 Female 18 (40.9) 90 (72-94) Age ≥ 65 26 (59.1) 83 (66-90) 0.25 < 65 18 (40.9) 90 (76-96) ASA score ASA 1 0 0 0.3 ASA 2 36 (81.8) 86 (76-90) ASA 3 8 (18.2) 93 (66-110) Neoadjuvant therapy Yes 25 (56.8) 90 (89-100) 0.23 No 19 (43.2) 85 (72-95) Type of surgical procedure STG 26 (59.1) 90 (76-96) 0.53 Total gastrectomy 14 (31.8) 81 (66-95) Superior polar gastrectomy 4 (9.1) 83 (65-95) Reconstruction after STG Roux-en-Y 19 (73.1) 90 (89-96) 0.61 Billroth II 7 (26.9) 79 (76-106) Clavien-Dindo ≥ 3 4 (9.1) 86 (76-94) 0.82 < 3 40 (90.9) 90 (90-113) Histotype Intestinal 23 (52.3) 80 (76-96) 0.6 Diffuse 11 (25) 95 (66-126) Mixed 10 (22.7) 86 (62-107) T stage T1-T2 18 (40.9) 87 (76-95) 0.47 T3-T4 26 (59.1) 88 (71-94) N stage N0 19 (43.2) 85 (76-95) 0.41 N+ 25 (56.8) 90 (85-105) EPI Yes 16 (36.4) 78 (75-106) 0.52 No 28 (63.6) 85 (73-96) EPI severity No/moderate 37 (84.1) 89 (84-100) 0.002 Severe 7 (15.9) 65 (59-92) ASA: American Society of Anesthesiologists; EPI: Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; QR: Quartile rank; STG: Subtotal gastrectomy.

DISCUSSION The recent implementation of multimodal treatments and targeted therapies for GC has significantly improved long-term outcomes, particularly in terms of overall and disease-free survival, especially for patients undergoing gastric resection with curative intent[ 2 on par 17 18 19 This is particularly true for patients undergoing gastric resection, who frequently experience a range of functional and nutritional deficiencies that significantly impact their daily lives[ 5 7 20 21 7 8 22 5 6 23 24 25 26 8 11 27 Given these premises, we conducted a prospective evaluation of the incidence rate of EPI and changes in QoL on a retrospective cohort of study after at least 1 year from gastric resection for GC, with particular focus on the variation of EPI rate and severity according to the clinico-demographic characteristics and surgery-related features. Furthermore, an additional analysis was performed to assess the potential impact of EPI on QoL within the same study population. The choice of fecal elastase-1 as the primary marker for diagnosing EPI in our study is supported by recent evidence highlighting its clinical relevance[ 28 30 28 29 30 31 According to our results, gastric surgery is confirmed as a predisposing procedure to EPI development with more severe manifestations in younger patients and advanced disease stage. More importantly, the development of a severe EPI has been shown to negatively impact patients’ QoL with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms compared to patients with no-EPI or moderate EPI. In our study cohort, the incidence of EPI after gastric resection was observed in 16 out of 44 (36.4%) patients, with a median value of fecal elastase of 120.5 (52.75-194.5) μg/g. This finding aligns with most current reports in the literature. Heptner et al 26 et al 27 P P et al 27 et al 5 6 Regarding EPI severity in relation to the clinico-demographic characteristics of the study population, younger age, more advanced disease stages and a more aggressive histotypes were identified as potential risk features for a more severe EPI grade. These findings may be explained by the need for more extensive surgical procedures in younger patients and in cases of advanced or aggressive disease. It is plausible that highly demolitive procedures contribute to more extensive pancreatic denervation, disrupting normal neural signaling pathways and consequently reducing the hormonal stimuli necessary for adequate exocrine secretion[ 22 As an additional finding, the postoperative onset of EPI was associated with a negative impact on QoL in our cohort. For this analysis, the GIQLI questionnaire was administered to all patients. Although it was not specifically conceived to evaluate QoL after gastric surgery, several authors demonstrated its validity and reliability in QoL evaluation of patients with GC undergoing gastrectomy[ 32 33 34 35 36 37 According to our findings, the onset of severe EPI was associated with a significantly lower overall GIQLI score as compared to patients with no-EPI or moderate EPI. Furthermore, significantly lower values were specifically documented for the gastrointestinal symptoms domains in case of severe EPI onset. To contextualize our findings within the existing literature, we systematically compared the results of this study with those of previous investigations on EPI following gastric resection. While some earlier studies, such as those by Heptner et al 26 et al 27 et al 26 vs Regarding outcome measures, we integrated both objective assessment of pancreatic function via 8 11 The innovative aspects of our study include the combination of objective biochemical markers and validated QoL tools, the stratification of EPI severity, and the prospective application of these parameters on a retrospectively identified cohort with extended follow-up. These elements distinguish our work from earlier reports and contribute to a more nuanced understanding of post-gastrectomy functional outcomes. By emphasizing the clinical relevance of EPI assessment beyond the immediate postoperative period, our study underscores the need for systematic follow-up protocols that integrate both nutritional and QoL dimensions. These data path the way to the potentially contributing role of enzyme supplementation after gastrectomy. However, no unanimous consensus is currently present in the literature on this topic. Hillman[ 38 39 21 et al 8 While the present study focuses on functional and nutritional outcomes, it is important to consider broader clinical indicators of surgical quality in oncological gastric surgery, including curative resection rates, postoperative complication profiles, and long-term survival outcomes, which represent key components of comprehensive patient care[ 40 41 42 43 Our study presents several limitations. Firstly, although our findings align with previous reports, the sample size of the study population is too small to draw solid conclusions and generalize the results. Secondly, the absence of a comparative group of patients undergoing enzyme supplementation after gastrectomy prevents us from clearly assessing the potential benefits of such treatment in this context. Thirdly, the complexity of gastric surgery and the multitude of functional consequences beyond EPI make it challenging to isolate and evaluate the specific impact of EPI on gastrectomy outcomes and QoL. On the other hand, we objectively demonstrated (by the fecal elastase measurement) the incidence rate of EPI after gastrectomy, reporting the correlation between EPI onset and QoL deterioration, with statistically significant data even in a small sample size of patients. CONCLUSION In conclusion, our study confirms gastric surgery as a procedure potentially leading to EPI onset, with a subset of patients, namely younger individuals and those with advanced disease stages, more prone to the development of pancreatic insufficiency. In addition, the onset of a more severe grade of EPI was demonstrated to negatively impact the QoL of patients at least one year after surgery with significant consequences in terms of gastrointestinal symptoms.
