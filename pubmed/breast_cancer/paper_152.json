Recent studies have shown that the development of Candida albicans infections involves both weakened host immunity and enhanced invasiveness of Candida albicans, with intestinal microecology serving as a critical mediator of these processes. It has been demonstrated that disturbances in the gut microbiome can potentiate the invasive capacity of Candida albicans. Moreover, a compromised immune system, along with the use of antibiotics and immunosuppressive drugs, can lead to gut microbiome imbalances. Consequently, modulators of the intestinal microecology represent promising therapeutic interventions for managing Candida albicans infections. In this review, we examine the mechanisms underlying the increased invasiveness of Candida albicans following significant disruption of intestinal bacteria and highlighting the interplay among immune dysfunction, antibiotic use, and their effects on gut microbiome imbalance and Candida albicans infection. Additionally, we summarize the roles of microbiome-based therapies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, dietary interventions, and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), in addressing Candida albicans infections. This review provides a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for the development of more effective microecological therapeutic strategies in the future.

Collectively, these organisms constitute the human gut microbiota, and their presence has been linked to numerous crucial physiological processes, including immunity, metabolism, digestion, and nutrient absorption [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 11 12 Candida albicans 13  Candida albicans 14 1 Candida albicans 15 16 Candida albicans 16 Candida albicans 17 Candida albicans Candida albicans 18 Candida albicans 14 Candida albicans 19  Fig. 1 Changes in the gut microbiome under stress. This figure shows the changes that occur in the gut microbiome under prolonged treatment with antibiotics or immunosuppressants or in individuals with a compromised immune system, including a decrease in the abundance of some probiotic bacteria, an increase in the abundance of some opportunistic pathogens/pathogenic bacteria, and the proliferation and morphological transformation of fungi, specifically Candida albicans (created at https://BioRender.com This review focuses on the mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiota affects the invasiveness of Candida albicans Candida albicans Candida albicans Interaction between gut bacteria and Candida albicans Bacteroides and clostridium Among the gut bacteria, Bacteroides and Clostridium are genera of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria that play key roles in maintaining intestinal mucosal barrier integrity and immune function. Their role in regulating intestinal barrier function and providing immune protection is mainly based on the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) they produce, such as acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid. SCFAs are mainly metabolites produced during the bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber in the intestinal tract, and are also the most important components for maintaining the integrity of the intestinal barrier [ 20 21 22 23 24 Assuming that certain methods are used to disrupt the Bacteroides and Clostridium communities, this may result in a reduction in intestinal SCFAs production, leading to colonization and infection by pathogenic bacteria. Jack Guinan et al [ 25 Candida albicans Candida albicans Candida albicans in vitro Candida albicans Candida albicans Bacteroides Bacteroides is a member of a group of opportunistic pathogens that, when normally distributed in the intestine, has the potential to exert beneficial effects, such as by antagonizing the virulence and growth of Candida albicans 26 27 Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron Candida albicans Candida albicans Clostridium difficile  C. difficile C. difficile C. difficile Candida albicans 28 Candida albicans C. difficile Candida albicans 29 Candida albicans C. difficile 30 C. difficile Candida albicans Candida albicans Lactobacillus family The Lactobacillus family of intestinal bacteria primarily comprises the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. These genera play an important role in the maintenance of intestinal health and human health; maintaining a balanced gut microbiome, consuming foods rich in lactobacilli or supplementation with lactobacillus preparations can improve intestinal function and enhance immunity. Lactobacillus Multiple studies have shown that Lactobacillus species can inhibit the invasive effects of Candida albicans 31 35 Candida albicans Candida albicans 36 Candida albicans Candida albicans 31 Candida albicans Candida albicans 34 Candida albicans Candida albicans Candida albicans 35 Candida albicans 37 Lactobacillus brevis Candida albicans Candida albicans 38 Candida albicans 31 Candida albicans Bifidobacterium  Bifidobacterium bifidum Candida albicans 39 Candida albicans Candida albicans Candida albicans Candida albicans Enterococcus faecalis  Enterococcus faecalis Candida albicans Candida albicans Enterococcus faecalis Candida albicans Candida albicans Enterococcus faecalis 40 Enterococcus faecalis 41 Enterococcus faecalis Candida albicans 42 43 44 45 Enterococcus faecalis Candida albicans Enterococcus faecalis Candida albicans Candida albicans Enterococcus faecalis 2  Fig. 2 Interaction between gut bacteria and Candida albicans. Red arrows indicate promotion, and green arrows indicate inhibition. Bacteroides species enhance the immune defense of the intestinal mucosa by promoting the colonic expression of HIF-1α and IL37-CRAMP, which in turn inhibit the growth of Candida albicans. Lactobacillus catabolicus breaks down tryptophan to produce indole aldehydes to increase immune defenses and thus inhibit the growth of Candida albicans. Bifidobacterium species inhibit the growth of Candida albicans by producing fermentation acids. Enterococcus faecalis inhibits Candida albicans growth by producing Entv, which inhibits Candida albicans hypha and biofilm formation. Clostridium difficile inhibits the yeast‒hypha morphological transition and biofilm formation of Candida albicans through the production of p-Cresol, which in turn inhibits Candida albicans growth (created at https://BioRender.com Effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiota The discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1928 provided a powerful weapon for human beings to fight infectious diseases. In recent years, the abuse of antibiotics has led to increasing drug resistance. In addition, the use of antibiotics could lead to fungal overgrowth [ 46 47 Candida albicans 48 49 Candida albicans 50 Candida albicans Candida albicans 51 SCFAs produced by gut microbial fermentation have protective effects against Candida infection by promoting the production of Foxp3 + regulatory cells (Tregs) and Th17 cells [ 52 Candida albicans Cyr1p, the adenylate cyclase of Candida albicans Candida albicans 53 54 Candida albicans 55 Candida albicans Candida albicans Candida albicans 56 At the clinical level, the use of antibiotics is inevitable, so the necessary considerations must be taken to reduce their harm. The use of probiotics with potential antifungal activity or their metabolites prior to the application of antibiotics may play a role in preventing antibiotic-induced fungal infections. Relationship between the immune system and gut microbiota disorders Impact of the immune response on the gut microbiota The immune response affects the gut microbiota in several ways, most notably through the inflammatory response and the production of cytokines and antibodies. The inflammatory response is a normal defense mechanism of the body and helps the body defend itself against pathogens and other stress factors; however, when the inflammatory response is too intense, it can trigger an inflammatory storm in the body and cause severe damage to the body. In inflammatory bowel disease, the inflammatory response in the gut weakens the intestinal barrier and increases intestinal permeability, triggering translocation of the gut microbiome and causing intestinal dysbiosis [ 57 58 Relationship between immunological diseases and disorders of the gut microbiota Immunity and the gut microbiota are complementary and dynamically balanced, and when one is out of balance, scales can tip, and immune-related diseases can occur. Current immune disorders that are clearly linked to the gut microbiota include inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome and colorectal cancer [ 57 59 60 62 Link between immunity and Candida albicans susceptibility The immune system plays a central role in defending against Candida albicans infections, maintaining the body’s defence capabilities through both direct and indirect actions. Macrophages play a key role in the direct immune response. Not only can they directly phagocytose Candida albicans, but they can also activate the adaptive immune system through antigen presentation and further regulate the immune response by secreting cytokines, promoting T cell activation and proliferation [ 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 70 72 In recent years, the role of the gut microbiota and its metabolites in regulating the body’s defence against Candida albicans has received increasing attention. For example, tryptophan metabolites can directly regulate group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) in the colonic lamina propria, or indirectly regulate ILC3 secretion of IL-22 by affecting the intestinal microbiota, thereby enhancing the intestine’s resistance to Candida albicans invasion and barrier protection capacity [ 73 74 75 76 In addition, other factors and pathways also profoundly influence host susceptibility. The innate immune receptor MDA5 has been shown to enhance host susceptibility to invasive Candida albicans infection by promoting macrophage and renal cell apoptosis (regulating Noxa, Bcl2, and Bax expression) and inhibiting macrophage killing capacity (reducing iNOS expression), making it a potential therapeutic target [ 77 78 Microbiome-based therapies Probiotics Probiotics are a group of microorganisms that are beneficial to the human body. They are commonly used to regulate the balance of the gut microbiome and exert a positive influence on human intestinal health via effects on the host immune system [ 79 80 81 Candida albicans 82 86 87 Saccharomyces cerevisiae 88 Candida albicans 89 Prebiotics Prebiotics are defined as substrates that confer health benefits when utilized by host microorganisms in a selective manner [ 90 91 93 Candida albicans 94 Candida albicans Lactobacillus plantarum 95 Candida albicans Candida albicans 96 97 Candida albicans Dietary interventions The human intestinal microbiome is not fixed, and its composition is influenced by a variety of factors, including age, environment, diet, and the immune response. Dietary interventions are a relatively gentle means of altering the microbiota, with some dietary components maintaining a healthy disease-fighting microbiota and others leading to microbiota imbalances that compromise gut barrier function and immunity [ 98 Candida albicans Candida albicans 99 100 101 102 103 104 Candida albicans Candida albicans Fecal microbiota transplantation FMT is a procedure whereby the feces of a healthy individual are transplanted into the intestines of a patient with a disease affecting the gut microbiome, with the aim of restoring the structure of the microbiome and thereby treating the disease. The initial application of FMT in the clinical management of intractable Clostridium difficile Candida albicans 76 105 Candida albicans Precision fecal microbiota transplantation Advancements in technology and the uncontrollable factors inherent to FMT have prompted a heightened focus on precision FMT, encompassing the transplantation of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other active constituents in isolation [ 106 108 106 C. difficile 109 110 Clostridium difficile RCT of microecological therapies for fungal infections Currently, fungal infections, especially Candida albicans In 2014, in a double-blind randomized trial, researchers randomized patients wearing oral prostheses into two groups; the probiotic group was treated with a daily blend of probiotic capsules (comprising Lactobacillus rhamnosus Lactobacillus acidophilus Bifidobacterium bifidum 111 Lactobacillus plantarum P17630 Lactobacillus plantarum P17630 112 113 115 116 Candida albicans 1 Candida albicans  Table 1 RCT of probiotics to treat Gastrointestinal fungal infections Subjects Sample size Experimental/control groups Conclusion Preterm babies born at 32 weeks with a birthweight of 1500 g 150 for both experimental and control group Lactobacillus Royale/Mycobacteria Both groups had comparable efficacy in preventing fungal colonization and invasive candidiasis, and the probiotic group showed significantly lower values than the antifungal group for the septicemia infection rate, feeding intolerance and length of hospital stay [ 117 Children aged 3 months to 12 years admitted to the PICU for up to 18 months and treated with antibiotics for more than 48 h 344 in the experimental group and 376 in the control group Probiotic blend (EUGI) - Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces boulardii, Streptococcus thermophilus; 7 consecutive days/no treatment Children treated with probiotic blends were less likely to develop Candida infections [ 118 Children aged 3 months to 12 years who have been in the PICU and taken antibiotics for at least 48 h 75 for both the experimental and control groups Probiotic blend (EUGI) - Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium, Saccharomyces boulardii, Streptococcus thermophilus; 7 consecutive days/placebo lactose There was no significant difference in the incidence of candidemia between the two groups, while the probiotic group had a reduced rate of Candida colonization [ 119 Very low birthweight (< 1500 g) preterm babies 40 for both the experimental and control groups Breast milk with added probiotics (Lactobacillus rhamnosus) for 6 weeks/only breast milk The probiotic group exhibited significantly reduced incidence and intensity of intestinal Candida colonization in very-low-birth-weight neonates [ 120 Preterm babies with birthweight < 2500 g and gestational age < 37 weeks Three groups of 83 Lactobacillus Royale/Lactobacillus rhamnosus/no treatment Candida gastrointestinal colonization was significantly lower in the probiotic group than in the control group [ 121 Preterm babies with a gestational age of ≤ 32 weeks and birthweight ≤ 1500 g 91 in the experimental group and 90 in the control group Saccharomyces boulardii/mycotoxin Gastrointestinal fungal colonization did not differ between the two groups, and feeding intolerance, clinical sepsis and septic episodes were significantly lower in the probiotic group than in the mycobacterial group [ 122 Preterm babies < 37 weeks gestation; birthweight < 2,500 g 56 for both the experimental and control groups Probiotics/placebo Probiotics reduced intestinal fungal colonization and invasive fungal sepsis [ 123 Conclusions Since 2007, when the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) was initiated at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the United States of America, it has greatly contributed to research on the molecular mechanisms of bacterial and fungal interactions. Complex interactions between bacteria and fungi occur in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, but the exact mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Although the mechanisms of probiotic‒fungal interactions are not yet fully understood, antifungal effects associated with these interactions have been observed in vivo, in vitro and in clinical studies. FMT is a procedure in which the fecal microbiota of a healthy individual is transferred into a patient with the aim of enhancing the gut microbiome and thereby ameliorating the symptoms of a disease. The core mechanism of FMT, an emerging antifungal strategy, involves the inhibition of the overproliferation of opportunistic fungi (e.g., Candida spp.) by reestablishing the intestinal microecological balance. However, there remain multiple risks associated with the clinical application of this technique: first, there is a possibility of FMT leading to the transmission of drug resistance genes or unscreened pathogens, leading to secondary infections; second, there is a risk of invasive fungal infections or bacteremia being induced in immunosuppressed patients owing to dysbiosis. At present, clinical evidence is largely confined to small-sample studies, and there is a need for validation of standardized donor screening, optimization of mycobacterial preparations and long-term safety. Overall, FMT has theoretical advantages and preliminary practical value in antifungal therapy, but the benefits and potential harms need to be balanced by strict risk management and individualized protocol design. Upon further consideration, the gut microbiota has been determined to encompass a variety of microorganisms, including but not limited to bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archaea. Consequently, the question arises as to which specific microbial taxa are responsible for the observed effects. In recent years, there has been an increased focus on the potential applicability of precision transplantation in the treatment of disease. For example, the use of washed microbiota transplantation, bacterial spore treatment, and FVT has been demonstrated to have considerable potential in the treatment of certain diseases. Furthermore, these transplantation procedures have the capacity to reduce the risk of infection by diminishing the incidence of unscreened pathogens. However, the fungal community has received minimal attention, and indeed, the development of numerous diseases is associated with alterations in the intestinal fungal microbiome. Moreover, fungi play pivotal roles in the efficacy of FMT. In the future, more attention should be given to the role of precision fungal transplantation in repairing the intestinal fungal community and adjusting the balance of the gut microbiome to reduce the impact of fungal disorders on the development of diseases and to provide new strategies for treating antifungal infections.
