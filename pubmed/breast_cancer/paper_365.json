This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a multicomponent training intervention on breast cancer survivors’ physical fitness and body composition. This experimental and controlled study included 19 breast cancer survivors with 64.0 ± 8.6 years, to evaluate long-term effects (32 weeks) of multicomponent training on body composition [body weight (kg), body mass index, body fat (%), lean mass (kg), body water (%), basal metabolism (Kcal) and visceral fat (index)] and physical fitness [Upper limb strength (repetitions), lower limb strength (repetitions), upper limb flexibility (cm), lower limb flexibility (cm), dynamic balance (seconds), and aerobic fitness (repetitions)]. Bayesian statistical tests were employed to analyze the reduced dataset size, considering a Bayes factor ≥ 10 as the cutoff for significant differences. Hierarchical clustering identified participant improvements using Manhattan distance, and clusters were ranked by responsiveness. After 32 weeks, the experimental group showed significant reductions in body weight (Δ = − 1.67 kg; BF = 15.15; Cohen’s d = 0.19) and body fat percentage (Δ = − 3.99%; BF = 34.87; Cohen’s d = 0.73), while no relevant changes were observed in the control group. Improvements were also observed in upper limb strength (Δ =  + 14.14 reps; BF = 1022.02; Cohen’s d = 3.45), strength in the surgically affected arm (Δ =  + 13.57 reps; BF = 121.39; Cohen’s d = 2.37), lower limb strength (Δ =  + 7.86 reps; BF = 206.55; Cohen’s d = 2.24), and aerobic fitness (Δ =  + 97.57 reps; BF = 157.28; Cohen’s d = 0.10). Flexibility and dynamic balance also improved, with moderate to large effect sizes. The multicomponent physical exercise program effectively improved all physical fitness variables but was limited in body composition, exposing improvements only in body weight and % body fat. The intervention did not cause any side effects or injury to the participants Supplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1038/s41598-025-01702-y.

Thus, this study aims to evaluate the long-term effects of multicomponent training on body composition and functional fitness among breast cancer survivors. We propose the following hypotheses: (1) multicomponent training will improve body composition in breast cancer survivors; and (2) it will enhance functional fitness. Materials and methods Study design This is an experimental and controlled study, enrolling the long-term effects of a multicomponent training program in the breast cancer survivors’ body composition and physical fitness. The training sessions had a duration of 60 min, with evaluations conducted over the course of 48 h. Participants were also encouraged to continue their daily activities throughout the study. Following the exercise guidelines for cancer survivors by Campbell et al. 51 52 53 54 1  Fig. 1 Timeline of evaluation and multicomponent training in the breast cancer survivors. Sample and sampling A total of 19 breast cancer survivors were included in this study, 7 in the EG, and 12 in the CG. The participants were conveniently included because the EG were breast cancer survivors who voluntarily enrolled in a physical exercise program from the Polytechnic Institute of Bragança. The CG comprised participants without time to participate in the physical exercise intervention. Nevertheless, the statistical power was calculated a priori in R, computing language, and following Cohe’s guidelines where the minimal power of 0.80, a moderate effect size for paired samples (Cohen’s d = 0.5), and alpha of 95% to accept the alternative hypothesis 55 56 57 The following inclusion criteria were considered for participation in the multicomponent training sessions: (i) previous diagnosis of breast cancer; (ii) having undergone definitive surgery, regardless of the type; (iii) having undergone post-surgical treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, endocrine therapy, or a combination of these; (iv) having finished treatment before starting the multicomponent training program; and v) have not participated in any type of intervention one year before the start of the study The established exclusion criteria were: (i) the presence of serious clinical conditions related to other chronic diseases that would hinder participation in the multicomponent training sessions; (ii) the use of medications that could compromise participation in the sessions; and (iii) the presence of severe cardiovascular, muscular, metabolic, or articular complications that would impair the ability to participate in the program; and (iv) have participated in any regular intervention one year before the study. At the end of the intervention, seven women completed the program, with one dropout due to the need for a new surgical procedure. The control group was composed of breast cancer survivors who did not participate in any intervention during the experimental period. Unlike the group that underwent the multicomponent training, these participants were not subjected to any exercise or specific protocol during the study. Unfortunately, due to the reduced personnel of researchers and exercise coaches and the lack of time available by the subjects of CG, there was no possibility of engaging these patients in an alternative physical exercise intervention in parallel to the EG subjects. However, they were regularly (every 4 weeks) instructed to maintain their daily life routines, especially physical activity levels. The absence of intervention allowed the results to be compared directly with the intervention group, highlighting the possible effects of physical training on survivors’ recovery and quality of life. The study design is illustrated in the flowchart (Fig. 2 Fig. 2 Flowchart of the study. Trial registration This trial was retrospectively registered at OSF ( https://osf.io/8apsm/ Data collection For the data collection, a team of interns was systematically trained to ensure the standardized application of research instruments and obtain reliable information on body composition, functional fitness, and quality of life in breast cancer survivors. The training process included theoretical instruction on measurement protocols, practical demonstrations, and supervised application to ensure consistency and minimize inter-rater variability. The assessments were conducted in two stages: the baseline and at the end of the intervention after eight months. To standardize the procedures, all measurements were performed within a 48-h window for all participants, always at the same time of the day, between 7:00 and 11:00 PM, in the same laboratory setting, ensuring controlled environmental conditions. The same evaluators performed the assessments at both pre- and post-intervention time points to reduce measurement inconsistencies. Body composition was assessed through the calculation of Body Mass Index (BMI) and bioelectrical impedance analysis. BMI was determined using the standard formula, weight in kilograms divided by height squared in meters (kg/m 2 58 2 2 2 2 59 Functional fitness assessments followed the validated Senior Fitness Test (SFT) battery developed by Rikli and Jones 60 Dynamic balance and mobility were assessed using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, which required participants to stand up from a chair, walk 2.45 m, turn around, and return to a seated position as quickly as possible. The total time taken to complete the task was recorded in seconds. Aerobic endurance was evaluated using the 2-min step test, in which participants were instructed to march in place for two minutes while ensuring that their knees reached a predefined height corresponding to the midpoint between their patella and iliac crest. The total number of times the right knee reached the target height was recorded as the final score. To minimize the effects of fatigue, rest intervals of one to two minutes were provided between each test. Standardized verbal instructions and demonstrations were given before each test to ensure consistency in execution. All measurements were taken under controlled conditions, using the same evaluators at both pre- and post-intervention time points to ensure reliability. Multicomponent training The program was held at the Gymnasium of the School of Education at the Polytechnic Institute of Bragança, with three sessions per week, on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays, lasting one hour per training session. The multicomponent training sessions were divided into three stages: the first one, a general warm-up, aimed at preparing the participants’ cardiorespiratory, joint, and muscular systems; the second stage, the main core of the session, where exercises focused on resistance, aerobic activities, flexibility, and static and dynamic balance were performed; and finally, the third stage, focused on relaxation, aiming to provide rest and recovery for the body after training. The weight progression was individually adjusted based on baseline strength levels and gradual overload principles.

Statistical analysis The normality of the data was checked with the Shapiro–Wilk test. The statistical power was calculated a priori in R, statistical computing language (34), to define the minimal sample size for this study. Due the reduced statistical power, calculated a priori, the paired and two-sample Bayesian T-tests were employed 56 57 57 61 62 57 62 A hierarchical clustering method was employed considering the absolute pre-post differences to characterize the participants with higher or smaller improvements based on a between/within-subjects comparison (personalized clustering) 63 62 64 65 66 Results Baseline comparison results Table 1 Table 1 Baseline results of the comparison between body composition and physical fitness between the control and experimental groups.

After outputting the clustering results, we developed a mind map (Fig. 5  Fig. 5 Mind map about the possible decision making based on individual response to Intervention. Discussions Overview of the main findings Regarding the objective of this study, based on the statistical results, weight and fat percentage reduction was observed in the experimental group after the 36-week intervention. Additionally, improvements were noted across all physical fitness variables. The intervention was made based on the multicomponent training exercise program. Research indicates that such training can lead to enhanced neuromuscular adaptations, including improved motor unit recruitment and coordination, which contribute to increased strength independent of muscle mass changes 67 68 69 68 Body composition As previously mentioned, both body weight and body fat percentage were reduced. Regarding body weight, cluster analysis reveals that multicomponent training resulted in predominantly lower responses among the patients in the study. In contrast, when analyzing the reduction in fat percentage, the clusters indicate that the intervention had varying effects on individuals: 4 participants were classified as higher responders, while 3 were lower responders, suggesting that the intervention had a moderate impact on the participants’ weight status. Reductions in body weight are crucial for preventing cancer 6 70 6 71 45 45 In contrast, BMI, lean mass, body water percentage, basal metabolism, and visceral fat did not present significant changes after the follow-up. BMI is an overall indicator of nutritional status and is conventionally used in healthcare settings due to its simplicity and low-cost application 58 72 In this study, the non-changes in the participants’ BMI were accompanied by manutention of lean mass, body water percentage, basal metabolism, visceral fat index, and significant reductions in body fat percentage. This finding is a positive factor for breast cancer patients in different phases of the treatment since body fat reduction contributes to attenuating the body inflammation profile, a risk factor for cancer progression and relapse 73 74 75 Although weight and body fat percentage significantly decreased following the intervention, no significant changes were observed in BMI, lean mass, body water percentage, basal metabolism, or visceral fat index. A possible explanation is that while multicomponent training effectively reduced adiposity, the overall muscle mass was preserved rather than significantly increased. As lean mass remained stable, there was no substantial impact on body water content or basal metabolic rate, which are closely linked to muscle mass levels 76 77 The findings of the present study align with prior evidence demonstrating the beneficial effects of multicomponent exercise programs on body composition and physical fitness among overweight populations. A previous study reported significant improvements in body composition and strength parameters in obese women following a 40-weeks multicomponent training intervention 78 79 80 Physical fitness Regarding the change in strength in the upper limbs of the study participants, there was a similar increase in strength in the upper limb that underwent surgical intervention and in the one that was not submitted. The cluster analysis for this variable was subdivided into three groups for increased strength in the upper limbs, in which 3 patients were considered high responders, 3 patients were mild responders and only 1 patient was low responder. This allows us to understand that multicomponent training tends to be efficient in improving the strength of patients’ upper limbs after the intervention since 6 of the 7 participants analyzed were responsive, whether high or light. In contrast, only one patient was slightly responsive, showing increased upper limb strength. When analyzing the improvement in strength in the upper limb submitted to surgical intervention, cluster 1 was observed with five patients as the greatest responders, and cluster 2, with two patients as the lowest responders. This makes it clear that multicomponent training effectively improves the strength of the upper limbs of patients undergoing the surgical process, given the characteristics of patients’ responsiveness to this issue. This shows the relevance of this type of activity for improving the quality of life of patients recovering from breast cancer, as it contributes to the return to routine instrumental activities of daily living which require good control of the upper limbs such as managing finances or medications, food preparation, housekeeping, and laundry, thus contributing to the recovery of their independence 81 Research indicates that resistance training can lead to improvements in muscle function and strength, even in the presence of muscle atrophy 54 82 83 54 74 Two clusters were observed when analyzing the variability in the participants’ lower limb strength. The first cluster was linked to higher responders, with three patients as group members. The second cluster covered the lowest responders (four patients) submitted to the present study. This distribution allows us to understand that multicomponent training presented a divergent impact on the individuals’ lower limb strength, showing that the training did not evoke the same level of changes in the subjects. However, even at different levels, the intervention proposed by the present study proved to improve the strength of the lower limbs, which is a positive result, considering that this contributes to helping patients in their daily lives, facilitating their ambulation and independence of performance during daily tasks such as climbing stairs, walking at the street and moving carrying objects 81 84 33 85 Regarding changes in aerobic fitness, the clustering results revealed the presence of two clusters. The first cluster is composed of higher responders, consisting of two individuals, while the second cluster comprises lower responders, consisting of five individuals. These results indicate that the intervention primarily led to low-grade improvements among participants. Despite this predominance of lower responders, the intervention still resulted in increases in aerobic fitness for all participants, which is a positive outcome of the training. Our results align with the prior meta-analysis of Ficarra et al. 3 45 In addition, it is important to highlight the cluster analysis performed in this study as an efficient and personalized way to understand the biological individuality for adapt to the training stimulus. It was crucial to adjust the intervention when necessary. For example, if a patient is not responding well to the initial treatment, cluster analysis can help identify what is happening and suggest changes, either in the approach or type of exercise. This process is similar to medical practice, where doctors adjust a patient’s medication doses according to the subject’s prognostic, always seeking a more effective and personalized treatment 86 In the present study, we had some relevant limitations that should be considered in future studies on this field, given more realistic and concrete results. Among these points, we can mention our small experimental sample, making it challenging to have a broader view of the population reality, which could be considerably different and complex. Furthermore, another limiting factor was the shorter analysis period of the control group (20 weeks) compared to the group undergoing the proposed intervention (32 weeks). Analysis for both groups for at least the same period is necessary to acquire more equivalent comparisons. Additionally, the absence of interim evaluations during the intervention period should be considered a limitation. Although the intervention lasted several months (32 weeks), body composition and physical fitness were assessed only at baseline and after the intervention. It is possible that significant changes in the measured variables could have occurred earlier during the program. Without periodic assessments, it was not possible to track the timing, rate, or trajectory of individual responses throughout the intervention, which could have provided more detailed insights into the effectiveness and dynamics of the multicomponent training over time. The nutritional status, including frequency of tobacco and/or alcohol use, was also not collected, and it can be a significant factor influencing variability in the patients’ responsiveness levels 87 For subsequent studies with larger samples from different ages, ethnicities, and income levels, followed by the collection of data about lifestyle (fitness and nutritional habits), biochemical and molecular tests are relevant to understand even more in-depth, the results of multicomponent training in the target groups of breast cancer patients in different stages of the pathology. Moreover, the outputs provided by the clustering method also highlighted that the multicomponent training did not provide equalized stimulus across the different physical fitness components. Improving technical aspects of this intervention in future studies considering outputs from clustering or other related methods will be essential to evaluate the effect of the maximized stimulus on breast cancer patients’ physical fitness and body composition adaptations. Future research should explore longer intervention durations, greater sample sizes, and more diverse exercise protocols, including dose–response relationships, to optimize exercise prescription for breast cancer survivors. Investigating potential mediators such as hormonal status, body composition trajectories, and quality of life measures would also contribute to a more comprehensive understanding. From a practical perspective, multicomponent exercise programs should be considered as a first-line non-pharmacological strategy to promote functional recovery, improve physical fitness, and manage body weight in breast cancer survivors, particularly those with overweight. Implementing these programs in community and clinical settings could significantly improve survivorship outcomes and public health. However, it is important to highlight some strengths of the present study: (i) This is a novelty approach with 32 weeks of duration using multicomponent training exercise-based therapy; (ii) this is a controlled trial with a high level of evidence; (iii) the study incorporated a cluster of reactions to the physical exercise treatment, helping identify individual variability in response to training, allowing for personalized exercise prescriptions; (iv) it is possible to define strategies for treatment in agreement with the responders. The study suggests that each participant reacts differently to the exercise-based therapy and should be reevaluated periodically to adjust the treatment. The combination of these strengths makes this study unique when compared to the existing literature about other types of exercise 3 54 82 83 88 91 Conclusions In conclusion, this study demonstrated that a 32-week multicomponent training program significantly improved physical fitness parameters, including strength, flexibility, dynamic balance, and aerobic capacity, among breast cancer survivors. Moderate improvements in body composition were also observed, particularly in reducing body weight and body fat percentage. These findings reinforce the vital role of long-term multicomponent exercise interventions as effective, safe, and sustainable strategies to support physical rehabilitation and body composition management in aging and overweight breast cancer survivors. Finally, the intervention did not cause any side effects or injury for the participants. Electronic supplementary material Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
