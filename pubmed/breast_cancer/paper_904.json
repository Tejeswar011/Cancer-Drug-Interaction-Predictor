Methods We employed a bidirectional Mendelian randomization to explore the potential impact of gut microbiota on the susceptibility to developing pituitary neuroendocrine tumors. Our analysis included weighted median estimator, simple model, weighted model, inverse variance-weighted, and the MR-Egger regression method for estimating causal effects and conducting sensitivity analyses. Additionally, reverse Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted on bacteria identified as causally linked to pituitary neuroendocrine tumors. Results Causal relationships were identified between genetic predisposition in the gut microbiota and pituitary neuroendocrine tumors, involving 11 distinct bacterial families and genera. Notably, no significant causal effect was detected from pituitary neuroendocrine tumors on the gut microbiota, and there were no significant heterogeneities observed in instrumental variables or horizontal pleiotropy. Conclusion Through two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis, we pinpointed particular gut microbiota with a causal link to both the occurrence and prognosis of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors at the genetic prognostic level. These findings hold promise for serving as valuable biomarkers for early disease detection and as potential therapeutic targets for the management of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors.

Furthermore, due to the rare occurrence of intracranial neoplasms, conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to examine the association between PitNETs and gut microbiota is challenging. To fill these gaps and to clarify the causality between PitNETs and gut microbiota, we performed a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Using genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) in a RCT, MR reduces biases and inaccuracies and improves causal inferences between exposure and outcome [ 19 Materials and methods Study design In conducting the MR studies and drafting the article, we adhered to the STROBE-MR checklist [ 20 1  Fig. 1 Flowchart of Mendelian randomization study Data sources Our gut microbiota genome-wide association study (GWAS) data was derived from MiBioGen, which covered 196 taxa in total (sorted by taxonomy): 119 genera, 32 families, 20 orders, 16 classes, and 9 phyla [ 21 https://mibiogen.gcc.rug.nl/ 22 https://r9.finngen.fi/ Selection of genetic instruments Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were then filtered by the following criteria: (1) We set a genome-wide significance threshold of p 23 24 25 Statistical analysis This study used inverse variance weighted (IVW) as the main analysis to preliminarily assess the potentially causative effect of each phenotype on PitNETs’ risk. To ensure the reliability of the results, the Weighted Mode, MR-Egger, weighted median estimator (WME), and Simple Mode analyses are used to complement the IVW estimation [ 26 27 Cochran’s Q statistic was performed to quantify and assess for possible heterogeneity, and the MR intercept test was used to estimate horizontal pleiotropies. A leave-one-out analysis was conducted to detect and eliminate any outliers that might have an independent effect on the observable causality. The MR-PRESSO test was also performed for outlier detection and heterogeneity adjustment in the case of notable MR estimates. If heterogeneity was detected between IVs, outliers were excluded and the MR analysis was replicated. To eliminate the influence of confounders, we further investigated whether the chosen SNPs with meaningful MR estimates in this research were associated with other PitNETs’ risk factors ( http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk https://sb452.shinyapps.io/overlap/ 28 The selection of MR methods is guided by three key principles [ 29 FDR P FDR P FDR 24 30 To explore whether PitNETs exert a causal influence on specific bacterial strains, we undertook a reverse MR analysis. Here, PitNETs served as the exposure, while identified causal bacterial strains were treated as outcomes. To achieve this, we utilized SNPs associated with PitNETs as IVs, following the settings and procedures consistent with forward MR methodologies [ 31 p 5 32 Results An overview of IVs in taxa Each 196 bacterial taxa received multiple SNPs as proxies through genome-wide significance threshold screening ( p − 5 p Associations of genetically gut bacterial with PitNETs Figure 2 1  Fig. 2 The results from the preliminary analyses for associations between genetically linked gut microbiota taxa and PitNETs risk  Table 1 MR results of causal effects between gut microbiota and PitNETs Exposure Methods OR 95% CI pval P_ FDR class.Mollicutes IVW 0.65 (0.47–0.92) 0.014* 0.112 WM 0.68 (0.43–1.07) 0.093 MR-Egger 0.90 (0.29–2.86) 0.868 class.Negativicutes IVW 1.85 (1.20–2.85) 0.005* 0.087 WM 1.81 (1.01–3.24) 0.045* MR-Egger 1.42 (0.30–6.71) 0.669 family.Acidaminococcaceae IVW 0.50 (0.32–0.80) 0.004* 0.095 WM 0.45 (0.25–0.80) 0.006* MR-Egger 0.50 (0.11–2.36) 0.421 genus.Eisenbergiella IVW 1.42 (1.10–1.84) 0.006* 0.762 WM 1.56 (1.12–2.17) 0.009* MR-Egger 3.86 (0.59–25.40 0.193 genus.Fusicatenibacter IVW 0.65 (0.43–0.99) 0.046* 0.994 WM 0.68 (0.41–1.14) 0.144 MR-Egger 0.93 (0.19–4.61) 0.933 genus.Ruminiclostridium5 IVW 1.58 (1.01–2.45) 0.043* 0.994 WM 1.35 (0.77–2.37) 0.291 MR-Egger 0.74 (0.12–4.69) 0.758 genus.RuminococcaceaeUCG004 IVW 0.72 (0.52–1.00) 0.047* 0.994 WM 0.80 (0.51–1.24) 0.313 MR-Egger 0.60 (0.10–3.73) 0.598 genus.Streptococcus IVW 0.65 (0.44–0.96) 0.029* 0.994 WM 0.34 (0.08–1.40) 0.160 MR-Egger 0.74 (0.43–1.27) 0.272 order.Selenomonadales IVW 1.85 (1.20–2.85) 0.005* 0.109 WM 1.81 (0.99–3.32) 0.054 MR-Egger 1.42 (0.30–6.71) 0.669 phylum.Euryarchaeota IVW 1.28 (1.04–1.57) 0.022* 0.099 WM 1.20 (0.91–1.58) 0.194 MR-Egger 0.78 (0.31–1.96) 0.614 phylum.Tenericutes IVW 0.65 (0.47–0.92) 0.014* 0.099 WM 0.68 (0.43–1.06) 0.089 MR-Egger 0.90 (0.29–2.86) 0.868 OR CI IVW WM As shown in Fig. 3 P FDR P FDR P FDR P FDR P FDR P FDR P FDR P FDR P FDR P FDR P FDR 33 27  Fig. 3 Associations of genetically proxied gut bacterial taxa with PitNETs Detection of potential pleiotropy and sensitivity analyses For the sake of objectivity, several steps were taken for testing the sensitivity of the MR analysis and for detecting possible pleiotropy of the IVs per phenotype. We then removed these outliers using the MR-PRESSO method. Notably, the IVs of the above 11 taxa did not detect any pleiotropic outliers that could have a causal relationship to PitNETs. In addition, the 11 taxa did not show any evidence of heterogeneity, as indicated by Cochran’s Q test.

Employing five widely recognized MR methods, we determined that PitNETs did not exhibit significant causal associations with the identified gut microbiota. Discussion To date, this is the first MR study to use large-scale gut microbial genomic data that explores whether gut microbes causally influence risk of PitNETs. Based on the largest GWAS dataset, the Two-sample MR analysis identified 11 bacterial taxa with potential causative effects on PitNETs, highlighting the gut microbiome’s important role in developing PitNETs. Given that the incidence of pituitary adenoma is approximately 77–94 cases per 100,000 individuals, whereas the overall annual incidence of craniopharyngioma in both adults and children is only about 0.5–2.0 cases per 1,000,000 individuals, and considering that the FinnGen dataset predominantly comprises adults while craniopharyngioma primarily affects children, we excluded craniopharyngioma from our analysis after thorough consideration. This exclusion is unlikely to have a significant impact on our overall findings. The association between genetic susceptibility of the gut microbiota and tumors has been extensively investigated, primarily focusing on gastrointestinal tumors due to their shared ecosystem [ 34 35 36 38 39 40 41 A growing body of research is finding possible links between the gut microbiota selected for our study and other oncological and endocrine diseases. We investigated whether there is a link between gut microbiota and PitNETs through MR analysis. The findings indicate a strong relationship and potential interaction between gut microbiota and PitNETs. Research indicates that the intestinal flora plays a role in the onset and progression of PitNETs, yet the precise mechanism remains unclear. Studies have revealed an enrichment of Clostridium innocuum and a decrease in abundance of Oscillibacter sp. 57_20 and Fusobacterium mortiferum in patients with pituitary adenomas [ 42 43 44 Similar to prior observational studies, our MR investigation also identified 11 taxa, encompassing 5 genera, 1 family, 1 order, 2 classes, and 2 phyla, that were causally linked to PitNETs. Class.Mollicutes are a group of bacteria that lack a cell wall, the representative member of which is Mycoplasma. Research has indicated associations between Mycoplasma and tumor development in the brain, breast, lymphatic system, as well as various organs of the genitourinary, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts [ 45 46 47 48 49 Class.Negativicutes are a type of Gram-negative bacteria. Previous research has indicated a correlation between class.Negativicutes in oral flora and the occurrence and progression of esophageal cancer [ 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 Genus.Fusicatenibacter, a member of the genus.Ruminococcaceae, is typically an anaerobic bacterium associated with neurodegeneration [ 57 58 59 60 61 15 62 63 Consistent with these findings, our MR study revealed a negative correlation between this bacterium and the occurrence of PitNETs. We hypothesize that it may influence the occurrence of PitNETs by modulating body metabolism, impacting the immune system, eliciting immune responses, and affecting the tumor microenvironment. Likewise, genus.Rumiclostridium 5, a prevalent intestinal parasite bacterium, is closely associated with gastrointestinal tumors such as esophageal cancer [ 64 62 65 66 The pituitary tumor microenvironment encompasses various non-tumor cells, including immune cells, stromal cells, and endothelial cells, along with enzymes and signaling molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. These components surround tumor cells and have the potential to impact the occurrence and biological behavior of pituitary tumors [ 67 68 44 The gut microbiota-brain axis encompasses various components such as the gut microbiota and its metabolites, the enteric nervous system, the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches within the autonomic nervous system, the neuroimmune system, the neuroendocrine system, and the central nervous system. Moreover, there are five communication pathways facilitating interaction between gut flora and the brain, including the gut-brain neural network, the neuroendocrine-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the gut immune system, neurotransmitters synthesized by gut bacteria, and neurotransmitters synthesized by gut bacteria. The genesis of PitNETs is primarily triggered by neural, endocrine, and immune signaling pathways [ 69 70 71 72 Indeed, our study has several limitations that warrant consideration. First, because of the aggregated nature of the GWAS data obtained for PitNETs, it is impossible to analyze the data separately for PitNETs. Second, our results are subject to some error due to the rarity of intracranial tumors, and analysis of data from larger samples is needed to confirm our findings further. The study demonstrates the robust association between gut microbiota and the risk of PitNETs, as a series of sensitivity analyses confirmed the strength of the study’s causal estimates. Third, all genomic analysis data utilized in this research were obtained from European populations, raising uncertainty regarding the generalizability of our findings to populations beyond Europe. Although the craniopharyngioma component has been excluded and the diagnostic code is only identified as PitNETs, which has minimal impact on the results, we should still be aware that the results may still be subject to some selection bias. Conclusion In summary, this study has shown by MR analysis that multiple gut microbiota may play a role in the development of PitNETs, providing a theoretical basis to guide clinical practice and suggesting future research directions. It is hoped that this will draw greater attention from clinicians and researchers to the monitoring of the gut microbiome in preventing PitNETs, helping to identify additional risk predictors and potential pathogenic mechanisms, and providing new insights into the diagnosis and risk intervention of PitNETs.
