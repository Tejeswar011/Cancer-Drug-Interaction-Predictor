In response, PSP organizations have developed and implemented peer support programs, as well as peer support apps, to promote health awareness among workers. This study was designed to evaluate the usability, usefulness, efficacy (i.e. self-reported mental health), and thoughts moving forward on whether to continue providing the PeerConnect app. A sample of PSPs ( N t Peer support apps mobile health technology public safety personnel first responders Ontario Government (Ontario Ministry of the Solicitor General) pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes typesetter ts19 cover-date January-December 2025 Police officers, correctional workers, firefighters, paramedics, and other public safety professionals (PSPs) witness a series of events that make them vulnerable to occupational and posttraumatic stress injuries.  1 2 3  4  5 App developers, private or public, market health apps as occupationally targeted, cost-effective, and accessible intervention platforms. More practically, these apps are developed and implemented to respond to the limited availability of in-person treatment.  6 Health apps Health apps have become a popular tool for tracking one's health and wellness. Smartphones often come with preinstalled health apps, encouraging users to track their health information, such as sleep patterns, physical activities, and the intake of nutritious food. With the increased focus on mental health, health app designers broadened their understanding of health and started developing offers that promoted mental health practices and resources.  6  7  8 9 12 9 13 14 15 17 18 20 21 22 23 25 There are currently no standards for mental health app quality control, 26 27 8 28 30  31 32 35 35 37 38 39 Despite issues involving health apps’ regulation, effectiveness, and responsibility over well-being, the app market has become specialized, catering to specific population groups, like youth 40 42 12 43 44 46 47 49 50 51  52  53 38 39 54 59  60  53  61 Peer support programs In general, the research on the effectiveness of peer support programs is conflicting. On the one hand, the literature says peer support programs are not effective in treating trauma and psychological issues. On the other hand, the literature says peer support programs help combat stigma. For instance, a study examining a Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) peer support program found that when adhering to the proper guidelines, peer support programs are seen as helpful for providing tools and coping strategies for PSPs.  62  63 64 66 A potential reason for the lack of evidence of psychological improvements among those enrolled in peer support programs is the inconsistency in methodologies and implementation.  67  68  68 Peer support apps Peer support apps have been created for people living with cancer  69 70 74 75 76  60  77  78  79  39 PeerConnect PeerConnect, the app under consideration in our present study, includes five features: four custom features created by the app developer and one feature developed by the Canadian Institute for Public Safety Research and Treatment (CIPSRT). The custom features are Connect, Newsfeed, Resources, and Events. Connect is the app's main feature, allowing PSPs to access peer support by “pushing a button.” Newsfeed and Resources offer employers (i.e. the services) the opportunity to distribute relevant news and information to app users. The Events feature allows employers to advertise relevant events to app users. Finally, the Self-Assessment feature, developed by CIPSRT, links app users to publicly available online screening tools that help identify mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or PTSD symptoms. Present study This study was commissioned by the Ministry of the Solicitor General of Ontario's Mental Health Secretariat to determine whether PeerConnect was effective and warranted continued budget allocation. Thus, we designed a mixed-method research project to survey ( N N Methods Data collection The survey for the present study targeted PSPs within services that were piloting PeerConnect. A total of 18,800 app licenses or potential app users came from 44 services, including 23 police services, 20 emergency services, and the provincial correctional service in Ontario, Canada. The research team contacted all organizations, inviting them to participate in the app evaluation, and 28 organizations (14 police services, 13 emergency services, and the provincial correctional service) participated. These organizations held 16,300 app licenses, accounting for about 87% of the population eligible to use the app. The survey instrument comprised 56 questions organized into 13 thematic blocks. These blocks addressed: participation consent; employer information; general questions about PeerConnect; individual sections on each app feature (Newsfeed, Resources, Events, Self-Assessment, and Connect); participants’ overall evaluation of the app; questions for those identified as non-users; demographic information; and follow-up interview participation. The research team developed the survey questions in partnership with the Ministry of the Solicitor General, which was designed with the intent of capturing user perspectives on the app and focuses on gathering practical insights regarding usability and utility of PeerConnect. Thus, we did not have the option of using validated scales because none such exist on such a nuanced and specific application. To ensure that survey participants had the time to try the app and to increase the quality of research data, the services had to have used the app for at least three months at the beginning of data collection. The survey was delivered using the online platform, Qualtrics. The participating services assisted with survey distribution by internally emailing their service employees with the survey link, as well as sending out reminder emails. The survey link was active between 14 February and 18 April 2022, and took participants ∼8 minutes on average to complete the survey. The research's ethics protocols received approval from the Memorial University of Newfoundland's research ethics board (no. 20220020). Participants A total of 485 individuals participated in the survey. However, after cleaning the data to remove participants who declined to participate after reading the consent form and eliminating participants with incomplete surveys (i.e. those who stopped partway or submitted the survey with unanswered questions), the final sample included 455 participants. Of the 455 participants, almost half (49.5%) worked in emergency services, 27.3% worked in correctional services, and 21.8% worked in police services. Seven participants (1.5%) did not disclose their service type. Of the 455 participants, 226 (49.7%) answered “yes” to the question “Do you use the app PeerConnect?” and were thus categorized as “app users,” while 229 (50.3%) answered “no” and were categorized as “non-users.” In terms of gender, 233 (51.2%) self-identified as women, 208 (45.7%) self-identified as men, 1 (0.2%) self-identified as other, and 13 (2.9%) did not disclose their gender. On average, participants were 41.8 years of age ( SD SD Survey The survey instrument consisted of 56 multiple-choice questions. We examined the demographic information to compare app users versus non-users. For the purposes of the present study, we included data related to app usability, usefulness, efficacy (i.e. self-reported health), and thoughts moving forward on whether to continue providing the app. To assess the app's usability for app users, the survey inquired into the following topics: (1) frequency users engaged with the app and its features; (2) users’ role when using the Connect feature (i.e. peer support provider or receiver); and (3) obstacles when using the app. Both users and non-users were asked about the obstacles hindering app usability, such as knowledge of online technology and internet access and availability of technology. Non-users were also asked whether they had been invited to use the app to enable an examination of the association between non-use and the app's promotional activities. Notably, the Ministry that commissioned the project expressed concerns about whether all employees in the agencies where the app was piloted had, in fact, received an invitation from their employers to try it. To assess the app's usefulness for app users, the survey inquired into the following topics: (1) whether app users were satisfied with the app and its features; and (2) whether app users found the app useful in serving their well-being. To provide insights into the reasons underpinning non-users’ choice for not using PeerConnect, the survey inquired into the following topics: (1) if non-users had used the app before and if they would use it again; and (2) if non-users used any health app beyond PeerConnect. To assess whether using the app impacts mental health, the survey included a question examining participants’ self-reported mental health status in the last three months. Responses included “excellent,” “good,” “average,” “poor,” and “very poor.” If participants were unsure of their mental health status, they were given the option to select “I don’t know.” Additionally, participants were given the option to select “prefer not to say.” To support policymaking involving health apps, the survey queried participants about their opinion on the following topics: (1) health apps in general (i.e. if apps can facilitate well-being and contribute to health awareness); (2) peer support with and without an app; (3) peer support outcomes (i.e. feelings associated with peer support); (4) feelings towards employers’ wellness initiatives; (5) ability to engage in self-care at work; and (6) factors that can encourage and discourage the use of health apps (i.e. lack of time, internet fatigue, and privacy concerns). All participants were asked whether they believed an app could support their well-being. Finally, PeerConnect users were asked whether their organization should continue providing access to the app. Statistical analysis We analyzed data using IBM SPSS Statistics (Version 29.0.1.1) and Jamovi (Version 2.6.26). Descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations) were computed to summarize demographic variables and survey responses. To compare app users and non-users on continuous variables (e.g. age and self-reported mental health scores), we used Welch's t V t d p Results App users versus non-users Users and non-users had similar demographic profiles; however, there were statistically significant differences. A Welch's t M SD M SD t p d 2 N p V p Usability To assess the app's usability, we first examined the frequency users engaged with it and its features. When assessing the frequency of overall app usage, 2.7% of participants reported using the app daily, 15.9% two to four times a week, 15.9% once a week, 9.7% once every 2 weeks, and 16.8% once a month. However, almost a third (32.7%) of participants rarely use the app, an additional 2.7% did not know how often they use the app, and 3.5% preferred not to say how often they use the app. Connect, the app's most important feature, was the most used feature (47.3%), followed by Newsfeed (20.8%), Resources (15.0%), Self-Assessment (3.1%), and Events (0.4%). Based on information from health liaisons at the organizations, the Events feature was not “much” promoted due to the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic on in-person gatherings. Thus, the pandemic may have affected Events’ usability. Among app users, 52.7% used Connect, the app's primary feature. Nevertheless, a large group (45.6%) had never used it. Four app users (1.8%) preferred not to say if they used the Connect feature. For a more detailed breakdown of the frequency of individual feature usage for Newsfeed, Resources, and Events, see Table 1 Table 1. Frequency of usage for Newsfeed, Resources, and Events among PeerConnect users. Newsfeed (%) Resources (%) Events (%) At least once a week 22.1 10.2 6.7 Once every 2 weeks 11.5 7.1 4.9 Once a month 18.1 17.7 7.5 Rarely 28.8 35.4 30.1 Never 17.7 24.3 47.3 This feature is not available on my app 0.0 0.9 1.8 Don’t know 0.9 2.7 0.9 Prefer not to say 0.9 1.8 0.9 N Next, we examined users’ roles when using the Connect feature (i.e. peer support provider or receiver), as well as how often they sought peer support through the Connect feature. Most Connect users (74.8%) used the feature primarily to provide peer support, while 21.8% used the feature primarily to receive peer support. Four Connect users (3.4%) preferred not to say their primary role. Approximately half of Connect users (48.7%) sought peer support just once, 10.9% sought peer support twice, 0.8% sought peer support three times, 5.0% sought peer support four times, 3.4% sought peer support five times, 0.8% sought peer support eight times, 0.8% sought peer support 10 times, and 10.1% sought peer support more than 10 times. About 9.2% did not know how many times they sought peer support, while 10.1% preferred not to say how many times they sought peer support. Participants were asked a variety of questions about potential obstacles to app usage. Some of the obstacles explored were external to the app, including knowledge of online technologies, internet access, and internet access when working in remote areas, while others were related to the app, such as technical difficulties (i.e. “bugs”) to download, use the app, and privacy concerns. When looking at participants’ knowledge of online technology, there were no differences found between users and non-users in terms of knowledge of online technology, χ 2 N p V Table 2 2 N p V Table 2 2 N p V Table 2.

The majority (90.3%) of participants found the app easy to download, 7.5% found the app somewhat easy to download, 1.8% did not find the app easy to download, and 0.4% preferred not to say. App users were also asked whether they found PeerConnect easy to use. Nearly two-thirds (61.5%) of app users found the app easy to use, 31.9% found the app somewhat easy to use, 4.4% did not find the app easy to use, 1.3% did not know if they found the app easy to use, and 0.9% preferred not to say. App users were asked whether they had any privacy concerns when using PeerConnect. Most participants (85.8%) had no privacy concerns, 8.0% had privacy concerns sometimes, 3.1% had privacy concerns, 2.2% were unsure if they had privacy concerns, and 0.9% preferred not to say. Non-users were asked if they were invited to use the app. Based on the survey results, only 21.4% of non-users were not invited to use the app, suggesting they may not have opted out of using it voluntarily. The remaining non-users were either asked (59.7%) or could not remember if they were asked (17.0%), and 1.9% preferred not to say if they were invited to use the app. Usefulness To assess the app's usefulness for app users, we first examined whether app users were satisfied with the app and its features. The results, shown in Table 3 Table 3 Table 3. Satisfaction with the app and its features among PeerConnect users.

Most non-users (88.2%) had not used the app, while 10.0% had used the app, and 1.7% preferred not to say. A further breakdown of the 10% of those who had used the app, 1.7% would use it again, 3.9% would maybe use it again, 3.5% would not use it again, and 0.9% did not know if they would use it again. Additionally, non-users were asked whether they have ever used other health apps to help their mental health. Most non-users (82.5%) did not use any health app, while only 16.6% used a health app but not PeerConnect. Two participants (0.9%) preferred not to say whether they used any health apps. Both users and non-users were asked whether they believed an app could support their well-being. Nearly half of all participants (44.8%; 63.3% of users and 26.6% of non-users) said they believed an app could support their well-being, 35.6% (28.3% of users and 42.8% of non-users) believed that an app may be able to support their well-being, 14.5% (6.2% of users and 22.7% of non-users) did not believe that an app could support their well-being, 4.8% (1.8% of users and 7.9% of non-users) were unsure if an app could support their well-being, and one user (0.4%) preferred not to say. A chi-square test revealed significant differences between users and non-users, χ 2 N p V Efficacy To examine whether there is a relationship between PeerConnect use and mental health, we compared app users and non-users on their self-reported mental health status in the last 3 months.

Discussion Principal findings We surveyed 455 PSPs, 226 of whom were users and 229 of whom were non-users of the PeerConnect app. Overall, app users were satisfied with the app and its features, finding them useful in serving their well-being, and therefore believing that their organizations should continue providing access to the app. Conversely, non-users do not believe that PeerConnect or any health app can help support their well-being, indicating their disinterest in any health app. Connect was the most used feature offered by PeerConnect, with 47.3% of app users reporting using the app the most of the five features, and 52.7% of app users reporting having ever used the app. The next most popular feature was Newsfeed, followed by Resources. Such findings align with our follow-up qualitative interview.  60  60  68 In terms of usefulness, most users were satisfied with the app (70.8%), although only 40.3% found it “extremely” or “very” useful in serving their well-being. When looking at user satisfaction with and usefulness in supporting well-being in terms of the app's features, app users were most satisfied with Connect, followed by Self-Assessment, Resources, Newsfeed, and Events for both. As the study occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unsurprising that the Events feature was the feature users were the least satisfied with, as was found in Foley and Ricciardelli.  60 less One of the main goals of PeerConnect is to support PSPs’ mental health and well-being by reducing barriers to support seeking. Therefore, we anticipated and found users self-reported a higher average mental health score over the last three months compared to non-users. Although we cannot say that PeerConnect itself is the cause of any improvement in mental health (i.e. the app is a vehicle for support, not an intervention or treatment), we do consider likely that those using PeerConnect are more aware of their mental health and have sought additional means of supporting their mental health. Another potential explanation is that users feel more supported by their employers. For instance, when asked about general views on health apps and peer support, app users reported agreeing more with the statements “I feel supported when someone at work shows they care about my well-being” and “I believe my organization genuinely cares about my mental health.” When examining demographic differences between users and non-users, most non-users were older and worked in correctional services, while users were younger, with most working in emergency services. In terms of age, younger PSPs may be more willing to use technology such as health apps to support their mental health compared to older PSPs, like those in the general population.  80 81 82  83 The findings of our study highlight the advantages and drawbacks of PeerConnect. The findings complement those of Foley and Ricciardelli,  60 Limitations There are limitations to the current study. First, this research offers a somewhat positive view of PeerConnect due to participant bias. About 75% of Connect users used the feature as peer support providers, meaning they were members of peer support programs at their services. Thus, the users’ views captured in the survey represent primarily the view of peer supporters who tend to be favorable to initiatives that promote mental health and wellness, rather than the opinions of employees using the app to access peer support services, the population for which the app was created and adopted. Second, several factors limited research participation and sample size. In particular, the lack of support for the app at the service level, uncertainty about funding to support the app in the future, workload (i.e., data collection overlapped to some extent with social movements in Ontario), and delays in the app deployment prevented all services piloting the app from participating in the survey. Although the sample was smaller than intended, the sample was large enough to yield statistical significance. Additionally, there was limited information provided on specific features. For example, the use of the Events feature was compromised by the COVID-19 pandemic, which limited public gatherings and thus the use of Events. Finally, our study did not use a validated measure of mental health to capture participants’ well-being, as the goal of our study was not to measure mental health; instead, we were measuring how well the PeerConnect app worked as a vehicle to connect people to others for support. However, future research should focus on a study of peer support as a mental health intervention that uses validated mental health measures. Conclusion Our study explored PeerConnect through a quantitative survey. Overall, app users found PeerConnect to be useful in supporting their mental health and well-being, finding the Connect feature especially useful. However, many participants did not use the app for various reasons, including not believing that health apps can support well-being and preferring to seek peer support without the help of an app. PSP organizations must continue to make efforts in supporting employee well-being, including continuing to develop and offer peer support apps. Future research must continue to evaluate mental health and peer support apps for both PSPs, especially with a focus on occupational subgroups and gender, as well as the general population. By providing one of the first cross-sector evaluations of a peer support app for PSPs, our study offers critical insights that can guide evidence-informed program development, inform policy decisions, and ultimately enhance the mental health and resilience of those who serve our communities.
