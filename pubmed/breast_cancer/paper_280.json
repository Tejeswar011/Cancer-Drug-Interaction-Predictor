PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have emerged as critical regulators of gene expression and genomic stability, with increasing evidence linking their dysregulation to oncogenesis. piRNAs can modulate DNA methylation through interactions with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), contributing to tumor suppressor gene silencing and broader epigenetic reprogramming. However, the functional implications of piRNA-mediated methylation changes in cancer are not fully elucidated. This study investigates the circulating levels of piR-823 and piR-651, their associations with DNMT3B expression and global DNA methylation, and their correlations with clinical and molecular markers in colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers. Materials and methods A total of 300 participants, including 150 patients with histologically confirmed cancers and 150 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, were enrolled. Plasma piRNA levels were measured via qRT-PCR, while global 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and DNMT3B concentrations were quantified using ELISA. Immunohistochemistry was performed on resected tumor tissues to assess DNMT3B, Ki-67, p53, E-cadherin, vimentin, HER2, and androgen receptor (AR). Correlations were analyzed using Pearson’s test and multivariate regression models. Diagnostic performance was evaluated via Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Results piR-823 was significantly upregulated in colorectal and breast cancers ( p p p r p p Conclusion The observed associations between piRNA dysregulation, epigenetic markers, and tumor aggressiveness indicators support the potential of circulating piRNAs—particularly piR-823 and piR-651—as novel biomarkers for cancer detection and progression monitoring. These findings warrant further mechanistic studies to validate their functional roles in tumor epigenetics.

Traditional cancer biomarkers, including protein-coding genes and epigenetic modifications, have been widely studied, yet emerging evidence highlights the significance of small non-coding RNAs, such as PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), in cancer pathophysiology [ 1 4 piRNAs are a distinct class of small regulatory RNAs that primarily function in transposable element suppression and genomic stability maintenance [ 5 6 7 8 9 10 9 DNA methylation, one of the most well-characterized epigenetic modifications, is orchestrated by DNMTs, which catalyze the addition of methyl groups to cytosine residues in CpG dinucleotides [ 11 12 13 Recent studies have highlighted the potential of piRNAs as cancer biomarkers due to their stable presence in biofluids such as plasma and their distinct expression profiles in different malignancies [ 14 15 15 16 Despite these advances, the precise role of piRNAs in cancer epigenetics remains poorly understood. There is a need for further investigation into the interplay between piRNAs, DNMTs, and DNA methylation in solid tumors. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically analyzing the expression of key piRNAs and their correlation with DNA methylation markers in colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers. By integrating molecular profiling techniques with immunohistochemical validation, we seek to elucidate the epigenetic mechanisms underlying piRNA regulation and assess their potential as clinically relevant biomarkers for cancer detection and prognosis.

More recently, their aberrant expression has been observed in various cancers, suggesting emerging roles in somatic tumorigenesis. Among these, piR-823 and piR-651 have attracted attention due to their consistent dysregulation across multiple malignancies. piR-823 has been shown to influence DNA methylation by regulating DNMT3B, promote cancer cell proliferation, and suppress mitophagy, especially in colorectal, gastric, and breast cancer tissues. In contrast, piR-651 is generally considered an oncogenic piRNA, with reported overexpression in lung, gastric, and breast cancers and mechanistic links to the suppression of tumor suppressor genes such as PTEN via DNMT1-mediated promoter hypermethylation. These functional associations, supported by both in vitro and patient-derived data, provided the rationale for selecting piR-823 and piR-651 for this study. Our inclusion of three biologically and clinically distinct tumor types- colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers -was intended to evaluate whether circulating levels of these piRNAs reflect shared oncogenic mechanisms across epithelial malignancies or exhibit cancer-type specificity. While this broad approach limits organ-specific mechanistic interpretation, it enhances the potential translational relevance of our findings by identifying pan-cancer biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic utility. The observed correlations between circulating piRNAs and established tumor proliferation and EMT markers across cancer types suggest that these piRNAs may participate in common epigenetic programs driving tumor progression. By integrating piRNA expression data with global methylation (5mC), DNMT3B levels, and phenotypic markers (e.g., Ki-67, p53, E-cadherin, vimentin), this study contributes to the expanding understanding of circulating piRNAs as regulators and biomarkers of oncogenic transformation. Although causality cannot be inferred due to the observational design, our results provide a foundation for future mechanistic and longitudinal studies aimed at dissecting piRNA-mediated epigenetic reprogramming in cancer. Importantly, this study underscores the feasibility of non-invasive plasma-based detection of piRNA signatures, which may complement existing biomarker platforms and contribute to earlier diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment monitoring in solid tumors. The findings of this study highlight the significant role of piRNAs and DNA methylation markers in cancer progression. The upregulation of piR-823 and downregulation of piR-651 observed in cancer patients support previous studies linking piRNA expression with tumorigenesis [ 9 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 The strong positive correlations between piR-823, DNMT3B, and tumor proliferation markers such as Ki-67 and p53 suggest that these epigenetic regulators contribute to tumor aggressiveness [ 21 27 28 29 While our study focuses on circulating levels of piR-823 and piR-651 in plasma, the observed associations with tumor proliferation markers (e.g., Ki-67, p53) and EMT indicators (e.g., E-cadherin, vimentin) support their relevance to tumor biology. Although tumor tissue expression of these piRNAs was not directly assessed in our cohort, previous studies have demonstrated their dysregulation within cancerous tissues. For instance, piR-823 has been reported to be overexpressed in colorectal and breast tumor specimens, where it promotes tumorigenesis through DNMT3B-mediated epigenetic modulation and transcriptional activation of HSF1 [ 21 22 24 The elevated cfDNA levels in cancer patients validates this biomarkers importance and significance for detecting tumor-derived DNA alterations [ 30 31 r r r 31 32 While our findings reveal strong correlations between plasma piRNA levels, DNA methylation markers, and tumor aggressiveness indicators, we acknowledge the limitations of our study design in establishing causality. This study was observational and did not involve functional or mechanistic experiments. Therefore, although the data support the potential role of piR-823 and piR-651 in cancer-related epigenetic regulation, we cannot conclusively determine the mechanistic pathways underlying these associations. Further in vitro or in vivo studies—such as piRNA knockdown or overexpression experiments in cancer cell lines—are needed to clarify whether these molecules directly regulate DNA methylation machinery or contribute to tumor progression. Accordingly, we have refined the scope of our conclusions to emphasize correlative relationships rather than mechanistic causation. Conclusion This study provides compelling evidence of the interplay between piRNAs, DNA methylation, and tumor progression. The findings suggest that piRNA dysregulation and aberrant methylation patterns could serve as novel biomarkers for cancer detection and prognosis. Limitations This study has several limitations. Its cross-sectional design prevents establishing causal links between piRNA dysregulation, DNA methylation, and oncogenesis. Longitudinal studies are needed to track dynamic changes over time. The sample size ( n Plasma-based piRNA analysis does not account for tissue-specific expression patterns. Integrating tumor tissue profiling and functional validation studies (in vitro/in vivo) would strengthen mechanistic insights. ELISA and qRT-PCR methods, while sensitive, may not fully capture piRNA-methylation interactions at the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels. High-throughput sequencing and multi-omics approaches could provide deeper insights. Residual confounding from factors like age and comorbidities cannot be ruled out despite statistical adjustments. Case-control studies with functional genomics integration will help refine causal inferences.
