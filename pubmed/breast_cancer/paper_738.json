As the technology advances, researchers are increasingly generating data from multiple tissue sections, creating a growing demand for multi-slice integration methods. These methods aim to generate spatially aware embeddings that jointly capture spatial and transcriptomic information, preserving biological signals while mitigating technical artifacts such as batch effects. However, the reliability of these methods varies, and the growing diversity of technologies makes integration even more challenging. This underscores the need for a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate their performance, which is still lacking. Results To systematically evaluate the performance of multi-slice integration methods, we propose a comprehensive benchmarking framework covering four key tasks that form an upstream-to-downstream pipeline: multi-slice integration, spatial clustering, spatial alignment, slice representation. For each task, we perform detailed analyses of the methods and provide actionable recommendations. Our results reveal substantial data-dependent variation in performance across tasks. We further investigate the relationships between upstream and downstream tasks, showing that downstream performance often depends on upstream quality. Conclusions Our study provides a comprehensive benchmark of 12 multi-slice integration methods across four key tasks using 19 diverse datasets. Our results reveal that method performance is highly dependent on application context, dataset size, and technology. We also identified strong interdependencies between upstream and downstream tasks, highlighting the importance of robust early-stage analysis.

First, they integrate spatial and expression data to generate spatially aware embeddings for each cell or spot. Second, they aim to correct batch effects across slices, facilitating comprehensive analysis of multi-slice data. Based on their underlying strategies, existing integration methods can be broadly classified into three categories. (1) Deep learning-based methods: These methods primarily use variational autoencoders (VAEs) or graph neural networks (GNNs) to integrate spatial and expression data. They incorporate batch information as a covariate during model training to remove batch effects [ 9 11 12 7 10 13 16 17 19 In spatial transcriptomics analysis, a sequential workflow of interconnected tasks is essential for comprehensive tissue characterization. Multi-slice integration methods serve as the foundational first step, producing spatial embeddings that capture the combined information across tissue sections [ 20 21 17 15 22 23 In addition, spatial alignment, which aligns multiple tissue slices to a common coordinate system for three-dimensional reconstruction, is another critical analysis step in spatial transcriptomics. Existing spatial alignment methods can be broadly categorized into two types: integration-based and non-integration-based methods. Integration-based alignment methods rely on spatial domains or embeddings derived from the integration process to correct spatial coordinates between adjacent slices [ 19 24 25 19 24 26 29 26 28 Therefore, this hierarchical workflow, from integration (generating spatial embeddings) to clustering (identifying spatial domains) to alignment and representation (utilizing these domains), highlights the inherent complex of spatial analysis, which contributes to the significant uncertainty in multi-slice integration methods. This challenge is further compounded by the expanding diversity of spatial transcriptomics technologies, each with distinct technical and biological biases that complicate integration [ 30 31 32 33 To this end, we present a comprehensive benchmarking framework that systematically evaluates 12 state-of-the-art multi-slice integration methods across 19 datasets from seven sources representing various spatial technologies. Our evaluation framework includes both the core multi-slice integration performance and three critical downstream applications, including spatial clustering, spatial alignment, and slice representation. Then, by analyzing the relationships between upstream and downstream tasks, we uncover a certain correlation between them. Results Overview of the overall framework Traditional benchmarking frameworks for single-cell genomics primarily focus on embedding quality and clustering [ 34 32 35 1 1 Fig. 1 Pipeline and data. a b We evaluated 12 advanced methods in this study (see Methods 9 11 12 10 7 13 14 15 17 18 19 Given the variability in resolution and data distribution across different technologies, the performance of a given method can vary depending on the dataset. To account for this, 19 spatial transcriptomics datasets were collected from seven sources, representing multiple technologies like 10X Visium, BaristaSeq, MERFISH, and STARMap (Fig. 1 Methods 3 36 40 Finally, our benchmarking revealed that no single method consistently outperforms others across all datasets and tasks. Meanwhile, we found that the performance of spatial clustering is strongly influenced by the quality of upstream integration, and that integration-based spatial alignment is closely correlated with spatial clustering. The complete benchmarking workflow is available on GitHub ( https://github.com/bm2-lab/iSTBench) 41 Benchmarking multi-slice integration Multi-slice integration is the essential first step in spatial transcriptomics analysis [ 20 Methods 6 34 Methods Our initial focus was on the performance of the various methods applied to 10X Visium dataset obtained via 10X Visium technology [ 36 2 2 Fig. 2 Benchmarking results for multi-slice integration across multiple slices. a b a b c d A similar analysis was performed on the MERFISH Brain dataset generated through MERFISH technique [ 3 In conclusion, our analysis of the performance of all methods across 18 datasets revealed that CellCharter consistently produces robust results without showing a preference for any specific sequencing technology in terms of batch effect removal or biological variance conservation (Fig. 2 2 Benchmarking spatial clustering Spatial clustering is evaluated next, as it is the immediate analytical step following multi-slice integration and forms the basis for a series of downstream applications [ 17 42 42 Methods To illustrate the results, we visualized the domain labels identified by each method on the DLPFC S3 dataset. As shown in Fig. 3 3 3 3 Fig. 3 Benchmarking results for spatial clustering across multiple slices. a b c Subsequently, we analyzed results using the MERFISH Brain dataset. Visualization of domain identification showed that most methods were able to capture distinct domain structures (Additional file 2: Figs. S12–S17). Based on ARI scores, the top-performing methods for spatial clustering were Banksy (mean ARI 0.601), NicheCompass (mean ARI 0.568), and MENDER (mean ARI 0.565). Meanwhile, NMI results suggested that STAligner (mean NMI 0.610) also have a performance edge for this dataset (Additional file 2: Fig. S12). For spatial continuity, as assessed by CHAOS and PAS, GraphST (mean CHAOS 0.0188, mean PAS 0.0326); SpaDo (mean CHAOS 0.0193, mean PAS 0.0577); and GraphST-PASTE (mean CHAOS 0.0195, mean PAS 0.0637) produced the most spatially coherent domains (Additional file 2: Fig. S12). Similar patterns were observed in the MERFISH Preoptic and the Large-scale datasets, which were also generated using the MERFISH platform (Additional file 2: Figs. S11, S17). Compared to the 10X Visium results, Banksy and STAligner maintained strong performance in domain clustering, while SPIRAL performed poorly on the MERFISH data. To further explore potential method preferences for specific sequencing technologies in spatial clustering tasks, we analyzed the performance of all 12 methods across 18 datasets, which excluding the TNBC dataset (Fig. 3 3 For domain continuity, SpaDo and MENDER exhibited consistent performance across most data, while Banksy, CellCharter, and STAligner, despite their accuracy in domain identification, showed lower continuity (Fig. 3 Benchmarking spatial alignment Alignment between adjacent slices is essential for accurately reconstructing the 3D structure of tissues and analyzing the spatial distribution of different domains or cells [ 43 Methods Methods Using the MERFISH Preoptic dataset as an example, we observed that both PASTE and SPACEL-based methods achieved strong alignment performance. Notably, SPACEL-based methods showed consistently stable performance, regardless of which integration method was used as input (Fig. 4 4 4 Fig. 4 Benchmarking results for spatial alignment. a b c In summary, PASTE is recommended for spatial alignment when the data has not undergone integration or lacks reliable domain information. SPACEL is a better choice when multi-slice integration has been performed or when domain annotations are available. While PASTE and SPACEL-based methods perform comparably in many scenarios, SPACEL-based approaches consistently outperform PASTE as the number of slices increases, for instance, in the MERFISH Preoptic dataset (Additional file 2: Fig. S22). Benchmarking slice representation Slice representation, another key application of spatial data integration, utilizes the abundance of identified spatial domains in each slice as representation. This approach, grounded in biology and clinically relevant, is a standard method for slice representation, widely used to stratify patient groups and visualize data in a low-dimensional space [ 7 22 23 Methods 6 5 5 Methods Fig. 5 Benchmarking results for slice representation. a b c d c d e f e f p t p p p p g h The results indicated that clustering accuracy varied substantially with the number of domains, showing a non-linear relationship between domain count and performance, regardless of whether hclust or K-means was used (Fig. 5 Methods 5 5 Given prior findings that domain count strongly affects slice representation accuracy, we further investigated whether this effect stems from the biological relevance of the domains themselves. Focusing on the case where five domains were identified by MENDER and K-means yielded the best clustering results, we observed distinct differences in domain abundance across sample types. For example, domain 1, composed primarily of immune cells, was nearly absent in Cold samples and only modestly represented in Mixed samples. In contrast, it was abundant in Compartmentalized samples. Conversely, domain 2, composed mainly of tumor cells, dominated Cold samples but was less prevalent in Compartmentalized ones (Fig. 5 Similarly, when five domains were identified by PRECAST, the domain compositions showed no significant differences between sample types, particularly between Mixed and Compartmentalized samples. Specifically, domain 2 occupied a high proportion in all samples and was composed of a mix of immune and tumor cells, suggesting a lack of meaningful biological separation (Fig. 5 Overall, our analysis indicates that slice representation based on domains identified by CN or MENDER offers distinct advantages. K-means clustering outperforms hierarchical clustering in most scenarios, particularly when paired with biologically meaningful domain structures. The biological interpretability of identified domains, such as their cell type composition, plays a crucial role in determining the utility of domain-based slice representation. Therefore, assessing domain biological relevance is a critical prerequisite for reliable slice level analyses. Overall performance analysis of each method across all datasets Through our comprehensive evaluation pipeline, we extensively benchmarked state-of-the-art spatial integration methods across various data types generated by different technologies. For each task, we identified the dominant methods that users could consider. Notably, while we found robust and consistent methods in spatial alignment and slice representation, performance in multi-slice integration and spatial clustering varied more significantly. Only a few methods maintained stable performance across all datasets, with most showing sensitivity to the underlying technology. To better understand these patterns, we conducted a detailed analysis of method performance across tasks and datasets. We first analyzed the performance of each method across different datasets for multi-slice integration and spatial clustering. To quantify this, we calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient across all datasets, using rank-based overall scores of all methods to represent each dataset (see Methods 6 Fig. 6 Overall performance analysis of each method across all datasets. a b d b c d e f Next, we explored the relationship between upstream and downstream task performance by calculating the Spearman correlation coefficient of the rank-based overall scores for these tasks across all datasets. The results revealed a certain correlation between multi-slice integration and spatial clustering, though methods like Banksy and MENDER showed weaker associations (Fig. 6 6 Finally, we analyzed the correlation between spatial clustering and slice representation. In the slice representation evaluation, we used the TNBC dataset and assessed spatial clustering performance under various domain settings using ARI and NMI. We then computed the Spearman correlation coefficient between spatial clustering and slice representation using these indicators. The results revealed a significant correlation between spatial clustering and slice representation, reinforcing the notion that high quality upstream results are essential for reliable downstream applications (Fig. 6 6 In summary, our analysis revealed that the performance of current methods in multi-slice integration and spatial clustering is often dependent on the sequencing technology used. Furthermore, the quality of upstream results substantially impacts downstream outcomes, although this dependency may vary across methods. Discussion In this study, we benchmarked 12 methods for spatial transcriptomics integration using 19 datasets from various spatial transcriptomics sequencing technologies. We proposed a comprehensive benchmarking framework that evaluates key aspects, including multi-slice integration, spatial clustering, spatial alignment, slice representation, and scalability of methods. This framework is designed to guide researchers in selecting the most suitable method based on their specific objectives, data types, and dataset sizes. Additionally, we systematically analyzed performance variability across different data types and examined the relationships between upstream and downstream tasks. Our benchmarking results indicate that no single method performs optimally across all scenarios and data types. The choice of method should depend on the specific application, data types, and dataset size. For multi-slice integration, CellCharter, MENDER, and STAIG demonstrate strong performance in handling batch effects and preserving biological information, with CellCharter consistently outperforming other methods across datasets. However, MENDER and STAIG are particularly suited for specific types of data. In spatial clustering, Banksy, CellCharter, and STAligner perform well, though they sometimes produce scattered spots across domains, affecting continuity. MENDER, NicheCompass, SpaDo, and STAIG also achieve strong performance on specific datasets. For spatial alignment, PASTE, representing non-integration-based methods, and SPCEL, representing integration-based methods, are recommended, as both demonstrate stable and robust alignment performance. For slice representation, domains identified by CN and MENDER are recommended for represent slices, with K-means generally outperforming hierarchical clustering for sample clustering based on domain abundance. Additionally, performance in terms of running time and memory usage varied significantly between methods. GraphST, SpaDo, and STAIG, for example, are sensitive to the number of cells, limiting their application to large datasets. Conversely, Banksy, CN, CellCharter, PRECAST, and MENDER have shorter running times and lower memory requirements, making them more efficient for large-scale dataset. By analyzing the overall performance of all methods across different tasks, we found that the effectiveness of multi-slice integration and spatial clustering is influenced by the type of data. Correlation analysis between upstream and downstream tasks revealed strong associations between multi-slice integration and spatial clustering, spatial clustering and integration-based spatial alignment, as well as spatial clustering and slice representation. These findings highlight the complexity of multi-slice analysis and emphasize the need for rigor and accuracy at each step to ensure reliable results in subsequent downstream applications. In addition to the results presented above, our evaluation of spatial alignment and slice representation revealed a key limitation shared by most current methods: the widespread neglect of domain–domain relationships, including both physical proximity and semantic similarity. For example, in spatial alignment using SPACEL, coordinate correction assumes that mutually nearest neighbors (MNNs) across adjacent slices should belong to the same domain. However, in biological tissues, adjacent slices often differ in domain composition, meaning that even MNNs may belong to different domains. Incorporating domain–domain relationships into the alignment process, such as introducing weighted penalties for MNN pairs based on specific domain associations, could improve alignment accuracy substantially. Similarly, existing slice representation typically rely only on domain abundance. Yet analysis of the TNBC dataset revealed that certain Mixed and Compartmentalized samples had similar domain compositions but markedly different spatial distributions. This underscores the potential value of incorporating physical relationships between domains into the slice representation framework, which could enhance its ability to distinguish biologically meaningful sample subtypes. Together, these findings highlight the importance of domain–domain relationships as an untapped source of information that could strengthen downstream analyses. In future work, we aim to develop dedicated modules that leverage this information to improve the overall performance and interpretability of spatial transcriptomics analysis pipelines. Despite these contributions, our study has some limitations. First, due to the rapid development of spatial transcriptomics, several new integration methods and sequencing technologies have emerged, but some of these were not included in our benchmark cohort due to time constraints. Second, this study primarily evaluates methods for integrating slices from similar tissues with comparable spatial domain structures. The ability of methods to integrate slices from different tissue types or species, which is crucial for studying tissue specificity, development, and inter-species differences, was not assessed. Third, our focus was on vertical integration of multiple slices, and we did not evaluate horizontal integration methods for slices from the same tissue. Future studies will address these limitations by including more diverse datasets, from different sequencing technologies, tissue types, species, and integration methods. This will enable a more detailed evaluation of methods across various contexts. Conclusions To summarize, we provided a systematic evaluation of 12 spatial multi-slice integration methods across a range of multi-slice analysis tasks, including multi-slice integration, spatial clustering, spatial alignment, and slice representation. Using 19 datasets generated from various spatial transcriptomics platforms, we comprehensively assessed each method’s performance through multiple quantitative metrics, revealing their relative strengths and limitations. Our analysis highlights that method performance is highly dependent on specific applications, dataset size, and sequencing technology. Additionally, we identified strong interdependencies between upstream and downstream tasks, underscoring the importance of robust integration and clustering for reliable downstream analysis. Methods Datasets and preprocessing In this benchmark study, we utilized 19 datasets from various spatial transcriptomics sequencing technologies to assess the performance of multiple slice integration methods. These datasets are categorized by sequencing technology as follows: 10X Visium dataset (including 3 datasets) [ 36 38 3 39 40 37 6 Benchmarking methods This study evaluates 12 distinct methods for multi-slice integration. Based on their underlying principles, these methods are categorized into three groups: deep learning-based methods (GraphST, GraphST-PASTE, SPIRAL, and STAIG); statistical methods (Banksy, CN, MENDER, PRECAST, and SpaDo); and hybrid methods (CellCharter, NicheCompass, and STAligner). The majority of these methods were published after 2023, reflecting the latest advancements in the field. The parameters used for executing these methods follow the settings recommended by the original authors. In cases where no specific hyperparameter settings were provided, we explored the recommended hyperparameter space for each method and selected the optimal configuration for the model (Additional file 1: Note S3). Since not all methods were evaluated across all four tasks, we summarized the benchmark tasks participated in by each method in Additional File 1: Table S1. Additionally, the parameters affecting the number of domains identified by the model were set based on the true number of domains in the test data. These parameters fall into two categories: one explicitly defines the number of domains, where the specified number should match the actual number of domains in the data. The other category influences the number of domains by adjusting the resolution setting. In this case, we included a resolution search module to find the optimal resolution, ensuring the detected domains closely match the true data (Additional file 1: Note S4). Benchmarking metrics In this study, we employed several metrics to assess the effectiveness of different methods across various tasks. These include bASW, dASW, iLISI, dLISI, ILL, GC, ARI, NMI, CHAOS, PAS, Accuracy, Ratio, and a rank-based overall score. bASW and dASW The average silhouette width (ASW) measures the degree of separation between classes by evaluating both the proximity of an object to its own class and its distance from other classes. The ASW value ranges from −1 to 1, with 1 indicates optimal class separation and −1 represents class overlap. In this study, we used slices and domains within the same data as category labels. The integration embeddings of cells or spots, obtained from different methods, were used as input to calculate the corresponding ASWs: bASW (employing slices as a category label for batch effect removal) and dASW (employing domain as a category label for biological variance retention). The bASW value ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect mixing of cells from different slices, and 0 indicates complete separation. The dASW value also ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates distinct separation of domains and 0 indicates complete overlap. Both metrics were calculated using the Python package scib-metrics (version 0.5.5). iLISI and dLISI The local inverse Simpson’s index (LISI) quantifies the local diversity of categorical labels within the neighborhood of each cell, offering insights into both batch mixing and biological separation. LISI is computed from integrated k-nearest neighbor (kNN) graphs, using the inverse Simpson’s index to assess how many neighboring cells can be drawn before encountering a repeated label. In this study, we used two label types, slices and domains, resulting in two LISI variants: iLISI (using slice labels to assess batch mixing) and dLISI (using domain labels to assess biological variance). The iLISI value ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect mixing of cells from different slices, and 0 indicates complete separation. The dASW value also ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates distinct separation of domains and 0 indicates complete overlap. Both metrics were calculated using the Python package scib-metrics (version 0.5.5). ILL The isolated label (ILL) score assesses how well integration methods preserve rare or underrepresented domain identities, referred to as isolated labels, that appear in only a few slices within a dataset. These isolated labels pose a particular challenge for integration, as they are prone to being mixed with more common labels. In our study, ILL was computed using an ASW-based approach. Specifically, we calculated the average silhouette width (ASW) between isolated and non-isolated domain labels using the integrated embedding. A higher ILL score reflects better preservation of rare domain identities. This metric was implemented using the scib-metrics package (version 0.5.5). GC The graph connectivity (GC) score evaluates how well cells belonging to the same domain remain connected in the integrated k-nearest neighbor (kNN) graph. The GC score quantifies the proportion of cells within each subgraph that are part of the largest connected component. The final GC score is the average across all domain labels. Values range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect connectivity, and values closer to 0 indicate fragmented or poorly integrated domain structure. This metric was calculated using the scib-metrics package (version 0.5.5). ARI The adjusted rand index (ARI) evaluates clustering consistency by comparing cluster labels to true labels while adjusting for random clustering. The ARI ranges from −1 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect agreement with the true labels, 0 indicating random clustering, and negative values indicating less accuracy than random clustering. We used ARI to assess spatial clustering by comparing the domain labels identified by the methods with the ground truth. ARI was also used to evaluate the quality of slice representation. This metric was calculated using the R package aricode (version 1.0.3). NMI The normalized mutual information (NMI) measures the shared information between clustering results and true labels. NMI ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating that the clustering labels share more information with the true labels and thus a better clustering result. In this study, NMI was used to assess the method’s ability to cluster spatial by comparing the domain labels identified by different methods with the ground truth domain labels. It was also used to evaluate slice clustering quality. The NMI was also calculated using the R package aricode (version 1.0.3). CHAOS CHAOS is a metric for evaluating spatial continuity. It uses a 1-nearest neighbor graph of cells or spots based on their spatial coordinates, calculating the sum of intra-class distances to assess spatial continuity. Lower values indicate greater continuity. In this study, CHAOS was calculated for each slice by setting the domain labels identified by each method as category labels. This metric was computed for each slice, and overall performance was evaluated by considering the CHAOS values across all slices in a data. The formula for calculating CHAOS of a slice is: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$CHAOS=\\frac1N\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^K\\sum_{i\\in Domain_k}dist(i,1NN(i))$$\\end{document} C H A O S = 1 N ∑ k = 1 K ∑ i ∈ D o m a i n k d i s t ( i , 1 N N ( i ) ) \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$N$$\\end{document} N \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$K$$\\end{document} K \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$dist(i, 1NN(i))$$\\end{document} d i s t ( i , 1 N N ( i ) ) \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${cell}_{i}$$\\end{document} cell i PAS PAS measures spatial homogeneity by assessing whether neighboring cells belong to the same domain. For each cell or spot, the k-nearest neighbors are identified based on spatial coordinates, and whether half of the points in the k-nearest neighbors belong to different classes is further determined. PAS values range from 0 to 1, with lower values indicating greater spatial homogeneity. In this study, PAS was calculated for each slice by setting the domain labels identified by each method as category labels with a k value of 10, and the method’s performance was evaluated by considering PAS values across all slices in a data. The formula for calculating PAS of a slice is: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$PAS= \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}PAS(i)$$\\end{document} P A S = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N P A S ( i ) \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$N$$\\end{document} N \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$PAS\\left(i\\right)$$\\end{document} P A S i \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${cell}_{i}$$\\end{document} cell i Accuracy Accuracy measures the alignment consistency of paired cells or spots between adjacent slices, assuming that paired cells or spots between adjacent slices are likely to belong to the same domain.

This score is derived by ranking the methods according to each metric and averaging the rank values. For example, in the evaluation of multi-slice integration, dASW, dLISI, ILL, bASW, iLISI, and GC were used to assess each method. First, for each data, we converted the metrics into rank values (from worst to best) by ranking the methods based on their performance. The rank-based overall score for each method on a given data was then defined as the mean of the rank values across the four metrics. A similar approach was used to calculate the rank-based overall score for other tasks. For spatial clustering, given that accurate domain identification is a prerequisite for a meaningful hierarchical domain structure, we assigned different weights when calculating the rank-based overall score: ARI and NMI were weighted more heavily than CHAOS and PAS, with a ratio of 4:4:1:1. In the overall performance analysis, we used the rank-based overall scores of each method to calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient across all data. Specifically, each data was embedded with the rank-based overall scores of the methods, and their correlations were then calculated. Additionally, during the benchmarking process, we computed the mean overall score for all data within the same technology, which served as the technology-level overall score, providing a clear summary of each method’s performance on each task. CV In the slice representation task, to evaluate the stability of each method with respect to the number of identified domains, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) for ARI and NMI. For a given method, the CV of ARI is calculated as follows: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${ARI}_{\\text{mean}}= \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{ARI}_{i}$$\\end{document} ARI mean = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ARI i \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$CV= \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{{({ARI}_{\\text{mean}}- ARI}_{i})}^{2}}}{{ARI}_{\\text{mean}}}$$\\end{document} C V = 1 N ∑ i = 1 N ( ARI mean - A R I i ) 2 ARI mean \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$N$$\\end{document} N \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${ARI}_{i}$$\\end{document} ARI i \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ARI$$\\end{document} ARI \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$i-th$$\\end{document} i - t h Spatial alignment methods In this study, we selected PASTE and STalign as representatives of non-integration-based spatial alignment methods. Both were run following their original tutorials. Specifically, PASTE performs pairwise alignment between slices, whereas STalign requires one slice to be designated as a reference. In our analyses, we used the last slice in each series as the reference. It is worth noting that the original STalign workflow involves a user-provided pre-rotation step to ensure approximate overlap between slices. However, this step introduces subjectivity, especially in multi-slice alignment where it is difficult to accurately estimate angular differences between slices and the reference. Moreover, other software tools do not require such pre-adjustments. To ensure fairness across methods, we deliberately omitted this step when applying STalign in our benchmarking. To evaluate the performance of different methods in integration-based spatial alignment, we used the STAligner and SPACEL framework to correct coordinates between slices based on the integration embeddings and domains identification from each method. For STAligner, the integration embeddings and identified domains generated by each method were provided to STAligner. The mutual nearest neighbors (MNNs) were then calculated based on these embeddings, and spatial coordinate correction was performed between multiple slices using the specified domain. While the landmark domain identified by each method may differ, all domains correspond to the same ground truth, allowing for a fair comparison of the methods’ ability to perform coordinate correction (Additional file 1: Note S5). Similarly, for SPACEL, the identified domains and original spatial coordinates generated by each method were provided as input. Since SPACEL identifies MNNs based on spatial coordinates and leverages domain information to perform spatial coordinate correction. Slice representation To evaluate the performance of domains identified by different methods for slice representation, each slice is characterized by its domain composition, with the assumption that similar slices should have similar compositions of spatial domains. Then, slices are clustered based on these characteristics. The effectiveness of each method for multiple slice clustering is measured by the degree of agreement between the resulting clusters and the true labels. Initially, we apply each method to perform multi-slice integration and identify domains. For each slice, its domain composition is defined as follows: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${C}_{s}= \\left[\\frac{{D}_{si}}{{N}_{{\\text{slice}}_{s}}}\\right],i=\\text{1,2},\\dots {N}_{{D}_{s}}$$\\end{document} C s = D si N slice s , i = 1,2 , ⋯ N D s \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${N}_{{\\text{slice}}_{s}}$$\\end{document} N slice s \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{slice}}_{s}$$\\end{document} slice s \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${N}_{{D}_{s}}$$\\end{document} N D s \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{slice}}_{s}$$\\end{document} slice s \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${D}_{si}$$\\end{document} D si \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{domain}}_{i}$$\\end{document} domain i \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$${\\text{slice}}_{s}$$\\end{document} slice s Subsequently, we apply two clustering methods, hierarchical clustering (hclust) and K-means, to group slices based on domain-abundance based slice representation. For hclust, the Euclidean distance between slices based on their domain composition is then calculated using the R function dist(). Clustering is performed using the hclust() function, and the cutree() function is used to output the appropriate number of clusters based on the number of slices. For K-means, clustering is conducted using the R function kmeans() with the specified number of clusters. Supplementary Information  Additional file 1: Supplementary Notes (Notes S1–S5 and Table S1).
