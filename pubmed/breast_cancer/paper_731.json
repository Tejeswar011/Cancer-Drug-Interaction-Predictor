The rash had been present for 7 years, primarily affecting the lower abdomen, bilateral arms, genitals, and breasts. Initial treatment with clobetasol 0.05% ointment twice daily yielded minimal improvement. Two years later, the patient presented with worsening pruritus. Despite continuing clobetasol 0.05% ointment, the patient experienced persistent symptoms. A punch biopsy of the vulva and left upper arm both confirmed the diagnosis of lichen sclerosus. After minimal improvement, tacrolimus 0.1% ointment was initiated, and the patient was started on ultraviolet A1 for extragenital involvement. Despite 11 months of topical therapy and 30 ultraviolet A1 treatments, the patient reported only mild improvement in pruritus but no improvement in the symptomatic flares or overall appearance of lesions ( Fig 1 Fig 1 Presentation of left upper arm with scattered hypo- and hyperpigmented atrophic plaques prior to topical metformin 10%/triamcinolone 0.1%/gabapentin 6% compound treatment. The patient was then initiated on a topical compounded formulation of metformin 10%/triamcinolone 0.1%/gabapentin 6% with a petrolatum excipient twice daily to extragenital regions and continued on tacrolimus and clobetasol ointment to the vulva. This compounded ointment was trialed on the extragenital region first to ensure tolerability before use on the vulva. After 3 months of treatment with the compound cream the patient reported improvement in pruritus and significant improvement in the appearance of EGLS. The patient reported no change in the genital region with tacrolimus and clobetasol. On physical examination, the plaques showed marked improvement in texture and pigmentation, particularly on the left arm ( Fig 2 Fig 2 Marked improvement in pigmentation of left upper arm with topical metformin 10%/triamcinolone 0.1%/gabapentin 6% compound after 3 months. Discussion Interest in the use of metformin for inflammatory and fibrotic conditions has increased in recent years, following a preclinical trial by Rangarajan et al that demonstrated metformin’s ability to block transforming growth factor-beta and activate adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase pathways, leading to the reversal of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. 5 , 7 8 9 10 Topical metformin has recently emerged in the literature as a treatment for CCCA. Araoye et al reported the use of topical metformin to stimulate hair regrowth in 2 patients with advanced-stage CCCA who were refractory to treatment with topical minoxidil and intralesional triamcinolone acetonide. 4 6 New clinical studies have reported benefits from using topical metformin for fibrotic skin conditions such as keloids and hypertrophic scars. A blinded clinical trial involving 53 participants examined the effects of topical metformin ointment on these conditions. The study found that, over 3 months, topical metformin significantly reduced scar height, vascularity, pigmentation, and pliability compared to placebo. 3 This compound contains medium potency triamcinolone 0.1% which could aid in EGLS symptomatology; however, the patient was previously minimally responsive to super-high potency clobetasol 0.05%. Gabapentin 6% could have played a role in decreased sensation of pruritus. The metformin 10% was utilized for its anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties which we hypothesize may have led to an additive response in combination with triamcinolone 0.1% and gabapentin 6%. In the case presented, the patient was refractory to standard first- and second-line therapy for EGLS. However, after 3 months of treatment with topical compounded metformin 10% ointment, the patient showed notable improvement in the texture, appearance, and pigmentation of plaques, with no adverse effects. These clinical findings suggest that topical compounded metformin may be a novel and effective treatment option for patients with EGLS and other fibrotic sclerosing skin conditions. Further research is essential to fully determine its efficacy as a treatment for EGLS and other fibrotic sclerosing skin conditions. Conflicts of interest None disclosed. References 1 Arif T.
