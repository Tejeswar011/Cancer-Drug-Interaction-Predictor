This study aims to investigate the system’s ability to differentiate between benign and malignant breast masses among Japanese patients. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 171 breast mass ultrasound images (92 benign, 79 malignant). The AI system, BU-CAD™, provided Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categorization, which was compared with the performance of three radiologists. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were analyzed. Radiologists’ diagnostic performance with and without AI assistance was also compared, and their reading time was measured using a stopwatch. Results The AI system demonstrated a sensitivity of 91.1%, specificity of 92.4%, and an AUC of 0.948. It showed comparable diagnostic performance to Radiologist 1, with 10 years of experience in breast imaging (0.948 vs. 0.950; p p p p p Conclusion The AI system significantly improved diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, particularly for junior radiologists, highlighting its potential clinical utility in breast ultrasound diagnostics.

In the domain of breast imaging, the utility of AI has been demonstrated across multiple modalities, including mammography, ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography [ 2 9 14 Most studies evaluating the applicability of AI in breast imaging diagnostics have focused on Western populations, with limited research on Asians, including Japanese [ 15 17 18 20 Materials and methods Patients Our medical ethics committee approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement for written informed consent from patients (approval number: M2019-232; approval date: 2019.12.13). All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations (Declaration of Helsinki). The subjects were patients who underwent breast ultrasound examinations at Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital from July 2021 to May 2022. The inclusion criteria were female patients whose masses were diagnosed as benign or malignant by pathological analysis or by > 1 year follow-up examinations at our hospital. The exclusion criteria were (a) patients who were treated with hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy to avoid potential confounding effects on tumor characteristics, (b) patients who were < 20 years old, (c) patients diagnosed with recurrent breast cancer, and (d) patients who were unable to express their consent due to illness or advanced age. A breast radiologist and a medical student reviewed the database of radiology reports and clinical records at our institute. The patients underwent the examination in a supine position with their arms up. The ultrasound examinations, image acquisition, and biopsies were performed by breast radiologists. The radiologists acquired static images in the vertical and horizontal planes and measured the maximum diameter of the masses. The US systems we used were an Aplio 500 scanner with an 8.0 MHz linear PLT-805 AT (Canon Medical Systems Corporation, Tochigi, Japan), or a LOGIC E10 s scanner with a linear matrix ML6-15-D (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA).

Image evaluation and statistical analysis The assessed BI-RADS categories were reported as 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 4c, or 5 by the readers [ 21 In this research, BI-RADS categories 4 A or higher were regarded as malignant to calculate the sensitivities and specificities. The BI-RADS lexicon recommends a biopsy when a malignancy probability is 2% or higher (BI-RADS category 4 and above), so the cut-off value for AI and radiologists was set at 2% of likelihood of malignancy. The diagnostic performances (sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC)) of the radiologist and the AI system were calculated and compared in terms of accuracy. using SPSS for Windows version 29.0 (IBM Corp., New York, USA). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve comparisons were conducted using DeLong’s test, and paired t-tests were used to compare diagnostic times.

The AI system supported radiologists’ diagnosis in terms of both accuracy and time, which is also particularly beneficial to younger radiologists. By reducing the time required for each diagnosis, radiologists can increase the number of cases they diagnose per day and allocate more time to cases that require advanced interpretation skills. With the support of the AI system, the readers were able to effectively improve their diagnostic performance, and the AUC for individual readers also improved; however, the improvement for Radiologist 1 did not reach statistical significance. Radiologist 1 has extensive experience in breast ultrasound diagnosis and had the highest AUC among all readers even without the AI system’s support. This suggests that AI assistance may offer less improvement for experienced readers, which aligns with findings mentioned in previous studies on BU-CAD™ [ 22 AI applications in breast ultrasound diagnosis have demonstrated various achievements. In the study by Shen et al., an AI system was developed and evaluated using 288,767 breast ultrasound examinations collected at NYU Langone Health in New York, USA [ 23 Furthermore, AI applications in breast ultrasound extend beyond the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer to include broader fields such as predicting molecular subtypes, assessing chemotherapy response, and predicting lymph node metastasis. AI models designed to identify molecular subtypes, such as triple-negative breast cancer, have demonstrated higher accuracy than conventional ultrasound and, in some cases, surpass the diagnostic capabilities of preoperative core biopsies. Additionally, AI technologies for predicting the efficacy of chemotherapy can evaluate treatment responses in real time and accurately identify non-responders, thereby aiding in the selection of appropriate therapeutic strategies. AI is also being utilized to predict axillary lymph node metastasis, and when combined with ultrasound, it can enhance diagnostic accuracy and potentially reduce unnecessary surgical procedures. The advancement of ultrasound-based AI brings us closer to more accurate and personalized breast cancer care [ 24 Several studies have focused on Asian women as their target population. Qiu et al. developed an AI classification model for breast lesions, termed Auto BI-RADS, based on ACR BI-RADS characteristics, and prospectively evaluated its performance [ 25 In Japan, two AI-based diagnostic support systems for breast imaging have been approved by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) [ 26 27 26 p 27 p 27 A key point of this study is that the AI support used includes not only CADe (lesion detection) but also CADx (lesion malignancy classification). This system classifies the malignancy of lesion candidates using BI-RADS and provides information on diagnostic characteristics such as lesion margins (e.g., angular, spiculated) and echo patterns (e.g., hyperechoic, hypoechoic, complex cystic and solid). Previous studies on CADx targeting Japanese patients have focused on evaluating and comparing the diagnostic performance of AI and radiologists. However, this study goes further by investigating whether the use of AI improves diagnostic accuracy and reduces reading time, making it a novel and significant contribution. This approach clarifies the potential benefits of AI-assisted diagnosis in Japanese patients and expands current knowledge in the field. The findings of this study suggest that AI can enhance the efficiency of radiologists in interpreting ultrasound images, contributing to improved workflow and patient care in breast ultrasound departments. Specifically, AI support is expected to shorten reading time, reduce the need for double reading, and assist in the training of junior radiologists. There are various predictions about the future of breast cancer care, including the expectation that mammographic screening, which uses radiation, will only be used for a small number of women with low risk and involuted breasts, and that artificial intelligence will play a role not only in predicting individual women’s risk and phenotyping cancer, but also in the acquisition and interpretation of all screening studies [ 28 22 29 30 26 27 Our study had several limitations. First, it was a single-facility study with a retrospective design and a relatively small sample size. Additionally, the study was validated using only ultrasound devices from two specific vendors. A larger prospective study involving multiple devices would be more valuable. Furthermore, since the study was conducted in a population with a high proportion of malignant cases, further evaluation is needed to determine whether this AI system is useful in screening populations. The cases in this study were collected from a university hospital (Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital), which serves as a specialized diagnostic center. This setting likely contributed to the high proportion of malignant cases observed in the study. Therefore, caution is required when applying these findings to general clinical practice, as the patient population and diagnostic settings may differ significantly. Moreover, the fifth edition of BI-RADS recommends follow-up instead of biopsy for BI-RADS Category 3 lesions with a malignancy probability of less than 2%, to reduce the number of false-positive biopsies. In this study, out of the 92 lesions identified as benign, 77 were diagnosed by follow-up without pathological confirmation, suggesting a slight possibility of false negatives. Lastly, in clinical practice, breast cancer diagnoses are made by considering patient age, medical history, and family history. However, this study focused solely on evaluating the AI system’s support in interpreting breast ultrasound images, without taking such clinical information into account. Conclusion The AI system employed in this study significantly supported radiologists’ diagnoses in terms of both accuracy and diagnosis time, proving particularly beneficial to less experienced radiologists. AI systems have the remarkable potential to revolutionize breast ultrasound diagnostics. With thoughtful attention to ethical, legal, and technical considerations, we can fully realize and maximize their benefits in clinical settings, paving the way for a new era of enhanced diagnostic accuracy and patient care.
