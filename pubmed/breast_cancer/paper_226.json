We investigated 92 putative cancer‐related plasma proteins including chromogranin A (CgA) and clinical parameters at the time of diagnosis to identify early factors associated with progressive (PD) or stable disease (SD). Patients with NET grade 1 and 2 of the small intestine (siNET) and pancreas (pNET) were included in this prospective study. Blood samples were obtained at the time of diagnosis before tumor‐related therapy was initiated. During 3 years of follow‐up, SD or PD was determined according to current clinical practice by each investigator. Association rule mining (ARM) was used to identify combinations of biomarkers and clinical parameters associated with SD or PD. Altogether, 115 patients with siNET and 30 with pNET with complete clinical and biomarker data were included in the analysis representing 3 years of follow‐up. Several novel plasma proteins and clinical factors were associated with either PD or SD. In siNET, CgA (>4 upper limits of normal [ULN]) was the most frequent biomarker associated with PD. Females, in contrast to males, with CgA >4 ULN showed a high risk of progression (PPV 100%, NPV 63%). In the siNET cohort, Carboxypeptidase E (CPE) was a discriminating factor between SD and PD. CPE <3.03 was associated with SD, whereas CPE >3.14 was associated with PD ( p association rules disease progression neuroendocrine tumor plasma chromogranin A proteins Ipsen 10.13039/501100014382 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  Knigge UP Kjellman M Grønbæk H Association rule mining of clinical and biomarker data in neuroendocrine tumors: A prospective study on disease progression J Neuroendocrinol 2025 37 10 e70069 10.1111/jne.70069 PMC12488364 40812788 1 INTRODUCTION Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP‐NET) are rare tumors with an incidence varying between 2.5 and 5 per 100,000 inhabitants.  1  2  3  4  5  6 CgA is the single plasma biomarker most used to diagnose GEP‐NET. However, several studies report conflicting results regarding the relationship between CgA levels and treatment response, and its value as a predictor of disease progression has been questioned.  7  8  9  10  11  12 Novel biomarkers associated with siNET have been investigated. Edfeldt et al. reported novel proteins that correlated with disease detection as well as survival in 23 patients with siNET, using a proximity ligation assay (PLA) and a proximity extension assay (PEA).  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  18 The aim of the present study was to use ARM to explore and discover combinations of cancer‐related human plasma proteins, CgA, and clinical factors at the time of diagnosis in patients with siNET or pNET and progressive disease or stable disease within 3 years of follow‐up. In addition, the study aimed to identify and characterize subgroups of patients that have characteristics associated with the risk of disease progression. We hypothesized that the combination of novel proteins and CgA with clinical factors such as Ki‐67%, number of metastases, and symptomatology could provide a better characterization of patients at risk of disease progression, to have a better understanding of the disease and improve disease management. 2 METHODS The present study is the primary endpoint analysis of the EXPLAIN study, including both siNET and pNET patient cohorts for the analysis of disease progression (exploratory, non‐interventional study for evaluating the diagnostic, prognostic and response‐predictive value of a multi biomarker approach in metastatic GEP NET [ ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02630654 2.1 Patients Inclusion criteria: informed consent, suspected metastatic siNET or pNET grade 1 or 2,  23  24 Exclusion criteria: NET not confirmed, previous anti‐proliferative treatments, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) or other radiation therapy, other malignant diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, or severe renal and/or liver disease impairment. Clinical data were collected at each visit, which occurred at 6‐ to 12‐month intervals and was part of the regular follow‐up. Data was registered in an electronic case report form (VieDoc, Pharma Consulting Group, Uppsala Sweden). Patients using proton pump inhibitors (PPI) were not excluded, nor was the PPI treatment stopped before blood sample collection at patients' normal follow‐up visits. Radiologic evaluation of metastatic disease at the different centers included contrast‐enhanced computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and somatostatin receptor positron emission tomography (PET)/CT imaging. Evaluation of disease progression, that is, progressive disease (PD) or stable disease (SD) after 3 years of follow‐up, was evaluated according to clinical practice and investigator judgment using three different criteria (radiological, biochemical and/or clinical) at a multidisciplinary team meeting. A control group of 155 individuals was selected from the Karolinska University Hospital Clinical Pharmacology Trial Unit for biomarker blood sampling. Control individuals matched by similar age (±5 years) and gender were included in the study (i.e., inclusion criteria). Exclusion criteria included: malignant disease, chronic inflammatory disease, and severe renal or hepatic failure. From this group, a total of 143 individuals were selected after applying the mentioned criteria and with complete biomarker data. Data from the 92 cancer‐related human proteins were used to calculate mean 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to define cut‐off values for biomarker categorization in siNET and pNET for association rules mining. 2.2 Sample collection and biomarker analysis Blood sample (4 mL) was collected starting at the first visit before NET specific treatment was initiated for siNET and pNET as well in the control group. Thereafter, blood samples were collected at patients' regular follow‐up visits. Details on sample collection and laboratory biomarker analysis are provided in the Supporting Information 2.3 Statistical analysis 2.3.1 Association rule mining Association rule mining was performed by means of the a priori algorithm  25 arules  26 S1 ARM was used to detect patterns of frequent items or events in the data set, including the association between items or events that occur at the same time. An association rule was defined as an implication of the form X Y X , Y ⊆ I X ∩ Y = 0 X Y X Y ARM generated association rules (LHS → RHS) that were evaluated and selected using the following metrics:  Support  Confidence  Lift X Y X Y Supporting Information 2.3.2 Variable categorization ARM requires numerical variables (e.g., biomarkers, age) to be transformed into categories. Variable categorization can be based on data distribution (e.g., mean or median values) or by using relevant clinical cut‐off values (e.g., biomarker level, specific age associated with disease onset). It is a step commonly applied by logical approaches to detect non‐linear relations between variables.  27 Supporting Information S1 2.3.3 Association rules ARM was used to generate association rules for disease progression (SD and PD) independently in siNET and pNET. Up to three variables (i.e., attributes) could be combined in the LHS of the rule (i.e., CgA, 92 biomarkers and clinical variables). After rules generation, only rules containing disease progression information (i.e., SD or PD) in the right‐hand side of the rule were selected and analyzed. To select the most relevant rules associated with disease progression, minimum cut‐off values were defined for lift, support, and confidence. For support, a minimum value was set allowing a rule to occur in at least 30% of patients. For confidence and lift, minimum values were set at 70% and 1.2, respectively, for both cohorts. Redundant rules, that is, rules that have the same attributes but in a different order (e.g., female ∩ biomarker Z → PD or biomarker Z ∩ female → PD), were removed, given that they do not provide additional information. ARM analyses were carried out using R 4.1.0.  28 2.3.4 Statistical test Statistical tests were performed to evaluate the effect of treatment interventions on disease progression (i.e., nominal logistic regression). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to test the effect of disease progression on carboxypeptidase E (CPE). The ANOVA model included treatment effect. Statistical tests were performed using JMP PRO, version 17.0.  29 3 RESULTS 3.1 Clinical characteristics evaluated at time of diagnosis Patients who did not fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria or had incomplete data regarding disease progression or missing biomarker data were excluded from the ARM analysis, leaving 145 patients, of which 115 were diagnosed with siNET and 30 had pNET. After 3 years of follow‐up, 65 (57%) patients with siNET and 22 (73%) with pNET had progressed. Eighty‐two percent (53/65) of siNET and 100% (22/22) of pNET patients with progressive disease had radiological confirmation of one or more additional metastases or clinically significant growth of one or more metastases. In the remaining siNET patients, progression was determined according to clinical or biochemical progression. Eight (6.9%) siNET and 2 (6.7%) pNET patients died during follow‐up and were included in the PD groups.

The main finding in this exploratory study was that ARM identified both novel biomarkers and combinations with clinical characteristics associated with stable or progressive disease. The most important parameters at the time of diagnosis associated with disease progression were CgA, Ki 67%, gender, and the novel biomarker CPE. In patients with siNET, high levels of CgA and higher Ki 67% in combination with CPE or ABL1 at the time of diagnosis were strongly associated with PD. Since CPE is involved in peptide processing in neuroendocrine cells, the level of this biomarker could reflect the number and/or activity of these cells. Previous studies have linked expression of CPE to growth and metastatic behavior in several cancers.  30  31  32 Differences in cancer outcomes between genders is a known factor  33  34  35 Novel biomarkers associated with SD in siNET were low CPE and high CD160 (Tables 3 S2 S1  36  10  37  38  39  40 Elevated VIM levels are frequently associated with PD in pNET (as well in siNET).  41  41  42  43  44  45 Regarding novel biomarkers, low levels of TNF‐related apoptosis‐inducing ligand (TRAIL) and high levels of delta‐like protein 1 (DLL1) were the most frequent biomarkers associated with PD (Table 4  46  47 In contrast to siNET, CgA was not among the most frequent biomarkers in the selected rules associated with PD in pNET. In the RADIANT‐3 study, CgA levels >2 ULN only showed a weak association with shorter progression‐free survival (HR 1.33 [95% CI 0.98–1.82, p  48  49 The current exploratory study has several strengths which contribute to its value: prospective design, real‐world clinical setting, large siNET patient cohort, centralized biomarker analysis, and the use of data‐driven statistical methods. A key strength of the study is its prospective design, focusing on disease progression within 3 years of diagnosis. However, its non‐interventional nature, intended to mimic routine clinical practice, limited the ability to collect additional blood samples, which is an important limitation. In contrast, this mirrors the real‐life situation which is of value to underscore its applicability. Disease progression was not assessed using RECIST criteria.  50 ARM is a known data mining technique used in many fields, and it is part of the “interpretable” machine learning methods, which can be useful in the context of analyzing and interpreting medical data. However, ARM requires categorization of data, which might result in a loss of information, and cut‐off values defined for categorization could be considered arbitrary. Plasma protein levels are the results of both disease status as well as combinations of other unknown factors at the time of diagnosis, and it provides an opportunity to evaluate complex disease situations. Increasing the number of plasma proteins analyzed (e.g., a larger protein panel) could help to identify protein pathways associated with the disease and to improve the accuracy of the predictions. Further studies are needed to evaluate the place of these novel biomarkers in disease development and management. It would be of great interest to further analyze and validate novel biomarkers using immuno‐assay techniques. In conclusion, at diagnosis ARM identified novel biomarkers, alone or in combination with clinical characteristics, associated with SD and PD over the next 3 years. The application of data‐driven approaches, such as ARM, may bring value to identify relevant risk factors and novel biomarkers or combinations at time of diagnosis that could be associated with the disease course, and thus enable physicians to adjust treatment strategy and frequency of follow‐up accordingly.
