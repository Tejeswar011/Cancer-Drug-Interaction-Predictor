Oncogenic microRNAs miR-526b and miR-655 promote aggressive cancer traits—such as proliferation, migration, invasion, hypoxia response, cancer stem cell properties, and metastasis—via COX-2/EP4/PI3K pathways. These miRNAs and oxidative stress appear to engage in a self-amplifying loop, where miRNA overexpression increases ROS levels, and moderate oxidative stress, in turn, enhances miRNA expression—although the mechanisms are not yet fully understood.

Introduction Breast cancer continues to be the most frequently diagnosed cancer and a primary cause of cancer-related deaths among women globally [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be key regulators of oxidative stress in cancer [ 7 8 9 2 2 10 11 This study aims to investigate how the overexpression of miR-526b, miR-655, and COX-2 in breast cancer alters cellular responses to oxidative stress by assessing cell fate, DNA damage, and global transcriptional alteration via RNA-sequencing. Understanding how cancer cells adapt and respond to oxidative stress may have clinical relevance, helping to uncover crucial mechanisms of both chemoresistance and tumor progression. 2. Results 2.1.

Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) Network Construction and Hub Gene Analysis For each set of DEGs, protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks were built using STRING, and these networks were then imported into Cytoscape (v3.10.3) for hub gene analysis ( Figure 6 In the MCF7-miR526b upregulated DEGs ( Figure 6 MAOB SLC6A3 SLC18A2 H2BC11 CACNA1C Figure 6 Figure 6 TNF IL18 ITGAM STAT4 FCGR2B Figure 6 In the MCF7-miR655 upregulated network ( Figure 6 DHX58 MX1 OAS2 CACNA1C TRDN Figure 6 Figure 6 TNF CALML5 GJA1 DSG2 A2M Figure 6 The MCF7-COX2 upregulated gene network ( Figure 6 CYP2E1 GSTM2 FGFR1 OAS2 IFIT3 Figure 6 Figure 6 EGFR CD44 SOX2 CALML5 EGF Figure 6 Together, these hub genes represent central regulators of the distinct transcriptional responses induced by overexpression of miR-526b, miR-655, or COX-2 under oxidative stress and may serve as key nodes for further mechanistic or therapeutic investigation.

Discussion This study aimed to understand how the overexpression of miR-526b, miR-655, and COX-2 influences the cellular response to oxidative stress in breast cancer. Previous research shows that overexpression of miR-526b and miR-655 in breast cancer increases intracellular ROS and SO levels [ 9 2 2 MCF7-COX2 cells displayed the most pronounced resilience to H 2 2 MCF7-COX2 also showed an enrichment of metabolic and migration-related processes and suppression of estrogen signaling, angiogenesis, and epithelial maintenance, indicating a metabolically adaptive and survival-oriented response relative to MCF7. Upregulated hub genes such as CYP2E1 FGFR1 GSTM2 12 13 14 OAS2 15 16 EGFR EGF CD44 SOX2 17 CD44 18 19 20 21 22 23 MCF7-miR526b cells also showed enhanced viability and reduced apoptotic signaling, albeit to a lesser degree than MCF7-COX2. PARP cleavage was significantly reduced, and p21 protein levels were attenuated following H 2 2 24 Transcriptional analysis of MCF7-miR526b cells revealed suppression of classical stress-related pathways, including MAPK, cytokine signaling, and epithelial development, while upregulated genes were enriched in neuronal and ion signaling, possibly contributing to altered redox regulation via mitochondrial membrane potential and calcium homeostasis. In MCF7-miR526b, MAOB SLC6A3 CACNA1C 25 26 27 28 29 MCF7-miR655 cells, in contrast, displayed a more intermediate phenotype. Neither apoptosis nor p53 signaling were significantly enriched, and PARP cleavage remained comparable to MCF7, indicating that the protective effect of miR-655 is ultimately limited or context-dependent. The modest increase in p21 protein expression post-recovery, despite reduced gene expression, may reflect post-transcriptional regulation or delayed stress responses. Although cell viability and apoptotic markers were not significantly different from MCF7 cells, transcriptomic analysis revealed some distinct patterns of gene expression. Notably, the upregulation of innate immune gene sets, interferon alpha response genes, for example, and the simultaneous downregulation of hypoxia-associated genes suggest that miR-655 may reshape inflammatory and redox-sensitive transcriptional networks. The negative enrichment of hypoxia-related genes conflicts with past findings of MCF7-miR655 cells displaying an enhanced hypoxic response relative to MCF7, where cells were treated with CoCl 2 30 2 2 OAS2 DHX58 DSG2 CALML5 Additionally, the MCF7 cell line expressed genes linked to neuronal functions, reflecting cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity—properties similar to embryonic stem cells [ 31 10 11 17 31 The paradoxical observation that some hub genes upregulated in our experimental cell lines are associated with a favorable prognosis in breast cancer patients highlights the complexity of cellular stress response and genetic implications that affect disease prognosis. Short-term adaptations that protect cells against acute oxidative stress in vitro may operate within broader signaling networks that suppress tumor progression in vivo. Moreover, the expression of certain genes may be a byproduct of the conditions that necessitate tumorigenesis and thus may display dichotomous roles in cancer. Our findings suggest therapeutic opportunities, particularly in sensitizing tumors to ROS-inducing treatments by exploiting pathways downstream of miR-526b, miR-655, and COX-2 that either mitigate ROS-induced damage or promote cell survival [ 2 32 We also acknowledge the limitations of the model used in our study. The use of MCF7 alone restricts the generalizability of our findings. The MCF7 cell line represents the ER+ tumor subtype, the most diagnosed breast cancer subtype; further work in HER2+ and triple-negative cell lines will be essential. Moreover, DNA damage assays suggest subtle protective effects; they should be interpreted cautiously. Together, our findings support a mode in which miR-526b, miR-655, and COX-2 enhance resilience to oxidative stress in breast cancer through suppression of apoptosis, modulation of DNA damage response, and transcriptional reprogramming. These adaptations may involve altered metabolism, immune signaling, and epithelial phenotype. The context-dependent expression and survival associations of the identified hub genes highlight potential biomarkers and targets for future investigation into oxidative stress resistance and therapy response in breast cancer. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture Human breast cancer cell line MCF7 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD, USA). miR-526b-, miR-655-, and COX-2-overexpressing cell lines were established by plasmid transfection, as previously described [ 10 11 17 2 4.2. Hydrogen Peroxide Treatment MCF7 cells were plated into 6-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells per well and given time to attach overnight. Cells were treated with H 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 4.3. Cell Viability Cells were seeded into 6-well cell culture plates at 100,000 cells per well, and treatment started 12 h later. Following treatment, cells were trypsinized and counted on an automated Countess 3 cell counter. The average of duplicate counts was taken for each of four biological replicates. Viability was assessed as cell number relative to the day of treatment. 4.4. RNA Extraction, cDNA Synthesis, and Real-Time qPCR RNA was extracted using Qiazol and RNeasy Mini Kits (Cat. No: 79306 and 74104, Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), and quality was assessed by spectrophotometry. A total of 1 µg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with a High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Cat. No: 4368813, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). For quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Luna Universal PCR Master Mix (Cat. No: M3004, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and gene-specific probes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) were used. Probes included those for CDKN1A PUMA CAT GPX2 GSR CALML5 RPL5 −ΔΔCT 33 4.5. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting Cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Cat. No: 9803 and 5872, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Protein concentrations were assessed with bicinchoninic acid (BCA) (Cat. No: SK3021, BioBasic, Markham, ON, Canada). A total of 20–30 µg of protein was loaded for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis using 10% (p53, Chk2/p-Chk2, PARP, AKT/p-AKT), 12% (p21), and 4–15% gradient (ATM) SDS–polyacrylamide gels. Transfers were carried out onto a nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 µm pore size) (Cat. No: 10600007, Cytiva, Uppsala, Sweden). Primary antibodies for proteins of interest included p21 (Cat.

Blots were washed and then incubated with Azurespectra 700 and Azurespectra 800 (Cat. No: AC2129 and AC2134, Azure Biosystems, Dublin, CA, USA) NIR-fluorescent secondary antibodies at a 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. The dry membranes were imaged using an Azure Sapphire Biomolecular Imager (Azure Biosystems) and analyzed with the AzureSpot software (v2.2.167), applying rolling-ball background noise removal and housekeeping gene normalization. Graphs illustrate fold changes in normalized fluorescent band volume (normalized volume) relative to untreated samples. AKT phosphorylation was analyzed as the ratio of phosphorylated AKT to total AKT. The cleavage of PARP was analyzed as the ratio of cleaved PARP (~89 kDa fragment) to total PARP. 4.6. Single-Cell Gel Electrophoresis (Comet Assay) Comet assays were performed with an Abcam Comet Assay Kit (Cat. No: ab238544, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Electrophoresis was performed in an alkaline running buffer at 26 V (1 V/cm) and 300 mA for 25 min. Fluorescent images were taken on a Nikon Eclipse Ti-2 microscope at 4× and 10× magnification.

Conclusions Overexpression of COX-2 provided the greatest protection against oxidative damage, significantly reducing apoptosis and enhancing the expression of genes critical for cell cycle progression. Cells overexpressing miR-526b and miR-655 exhibited distinct yet overlapping stress responses, such as decreased DNA damage responses and altered p53 signaling pathways. High-throughput transcriptome analysis revealed key hub genes involved in redox homeostasis, immune response, and metabolism—many of which are linked to breast cancer patient survival. These findings highlight the potential of miR-526b, miR-655, and COX-2 as pivotal factors in enhancing resistance to oxidative stress through transcriptional reprogramming, emphasizing their potential roles as promising biomarkers or therapeutic targets that warrant further validation, as additional research is needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms involved.
