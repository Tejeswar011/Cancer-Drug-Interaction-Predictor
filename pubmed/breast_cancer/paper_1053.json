However, the role of DNA methylation in mediating the relationship between cadmium and telomere dynamics is still unclear. Additionally, it is unknow how telomere dynamics and DNA methylation alterations may affect the association between cadmium exposure and mortality outcomes. We utilized data from 8716 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants aged 18 and above, collected between 1999 and 2002, and linked these to mortality outcomes from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) through 2019.

Introduction Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal commonly encountered in the environment through cigarette smoke, contaminated food, and industrial emissions [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Telomeres are protective structures at the ends of chromosomes that maintain genomic integrity. They shorten with each cell division, and when they become critically short they trigger cellular senescence or apoptosis [ 8 9 10 11 12 Epigenetic changes regulate gene activity without altering the DNA sequence [ 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Although previous studies have shown that cadmium exposure is associated with chronic diseases, shorter leukocyte telomere length, and reduced Horvath DNAmTL, no study has yet investigated these relationships concurrently in a nationally representative cohort. In particular, it remains unclear whether DNA methylation telomere predictors, such as Horvath DNAmTL, mediate the impact of cadmium on telomere shortening and whether these biomarkers jointly predict long-term mortality outcomes. Leveraging NHANES 1999–2002 with mortality follow-up through 2019, our study is the first to comprehensively evaluate cadmium exposure in relation to both measured telomere length and Horvath DNAmTL, to explore mediation pathways, and to assess their combined relevance for mortality risk in the U.S. adult population. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Population NHANES is a biannual survey designed to provide nationally representative health and nutrition data on the non-institutionalized U.S. population through a complex, multistage probability sampling design. Methodological details and consent procedures are available on the NHANES website [ 26 Figure 1 2.2. Measurement of Blood Cadmium In the 1999–2002 NHANES cycles, blood cadmium was measured in participants aged 1 year and older; this analysis focused on adults aged 18 and above. Cadmium levels were determined by the National Center for Environmental Health (Atlanta, GA, USA) using a PerkinElmer SIMAA 6000 atomic absorption spectrometer (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) with Zeeman background correction. The method detects cadmium absorption at 228.8 nm, with specimens diluted in a solution of nitric acid, Triton X-100, and ammonium phosphate. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.3 µg/L, and values below the LOD were imputed as LOD divided by √2. Full methodological details are available on the NHANES website [ 27 2.3. Measurement of Telomere Length In NHANES 1999–2002, participants aged 20 and older who provided blood for DNA analysis had genomic DNA extracted from whole blood using the Puregene (D-50K) kit (D-50K; Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA) and stored at −80 °C. Telomere length was assessed via quantitative PCR, which calculates the T/S ratio. Quality control was maintained by the CDC through the inclusion of five 96-well plates (5% of total samples), requiring at least 95% agreement between duplicates and an inter-assay coefficient of variation below 6.5%. Full methodological details are available on the NHANES website [ 28 2.4. Measurement of Horvath DNAmTL In NHANES, this study included adults aged 50 and older from the 1999–2002 cycles who had available DNA samples. The cohort consisted of all eligible participants from minority racial/ethnic groups and a random subset of non-Hispanic White individuals. DNA methylation profiling was performed on whole blood by CDC/NCHS laboratories using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), with standardized preprocessing, normalization, and batch correction procedures. As DNAmTL was only available for participants aged ≥ 50 years, all analyses involving this biomarker are inherently restricted to this age group. Detailed methodological information is available on the NHANES website [ 29 2.5. Covariates Sociodemographic data—including age, sex, and race/ethnicity—were obtained from the NHANES database. Smoking status was classified as current smoker, secondhand smoke exposure (ETS), or non-smoker, based on questionnaire responses and serum cotinine levels [ 30 2 2 31 32 2.6. Outcomes The NCHS linked NHANES 1999–2002 data to the National Death Index, providing mortality follow-up through 31 December 2019. Follow-up time was calculated from the baseline examination date until death or censoring at 31 December 2019, whichever came first. Outcomes were limited to mortality and classified as all-cause, cardiovascular-related, or cancer-related deaths. Cardiovascular mortality included deaths due to heart disease or cerebrovascular events. Additional methodological details are available on the NCHS website [ 33 2.7. Statistics The natural logarithm (ln) of blood cadmium, T/S ratio, and Horvath DNAmTL concentrations was applied to calculate the exponential mean, allowing for the determination of the geometric mean and standard error across different subgroups. Statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed Student’s t 34 35 36 In this study, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to explore the relationships between blood cadmium, with Horvath DNAmTL as a mediator and the T/S ratio as the outcome. It was hypothesized that blood cadmium could influence the T/S ratio either directly or indirectly through Horvath DNAmTL. The model adjusted for Model 3 covariates and was estimated using generalized least squares with the CALIS procedure. Model fit was assessed using the goodness of fit index (GFI), normed fit index (NFI), and root mean square residual (RMR). A GFI and NFI greater than 0.9 and an RMR below 0.05 were considered indicators of a good model fit. The estimates of the parameters and the overall model fit were reported. To understand the relationship between blood cadmium, telomere metrics, and mortality, we assessed hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer-related mortality associated with a one-unit increase in ln-blood cadmium, ln-T/S ratio, and ln-Horvath DNAmTL. This analysis was conducted using a weighted Cox regression model and adjusted for covariates in Model 3. To reinforce our findings, we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding individuals with a history of CVD and cancer, as well as excluding active smokers and those exposed to ETS. Additionally, we assessed HRs for mortality linked to a unit increase in ln-blood cadmium across different subgroups defined by T/S ratio and Horvath DNAmTL. Furthermore, we conducted analyses to test interactions between blood cadmium and DNA methylation biomarkers by incorporating cross-product terms into Cox regression models. Because blood cadmium, T/S ratio, and Horvath DNAmTL exhibited right-skewed distributions, ln transformation was applied to improve normality and model fit, consistent with prior NHANES-based studies of metals and telomere length [ 7 37 p 3. Results The studied participants had a mean age (SD) of 45.50 (19.77) years, ranging from 18 to 85 years old. Approximately 75.9% of individuals showed detectable levels of blood cadmium. Over a median follow-up of 219.0 months, data for 4 participants were missing. A total of 2153 deaths were recorded, including 670 cardiovascular-related and 462 cancer-related deaths. Group comparisons of baseline characteristics were assessed using t Table 1 In Supplemental Table S1 p p p p p p Table 2 p p p Figure 2 p Table 3 p Figure 3 p p p 38 Table 4 Supplemental Table S2 Supplemental Table S3 Table 5 4. Discussion In a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults, we identified a negative association between blood cadmium and telomere length, with this relationship partially mediated by a DNA methylation biomarker predictive of telomere length in cross-sectional analysis. Additionally, blood cadmium was significantly associated with all mortality outcomes, while both telomere length and Horvath DNAmTL showed predictive effects across several mortality outcomes. Although no significant interactions were found, individuals below the 50th percentile for T/S ratio and Horvath DNAmTL had higher HRs for cadmium-related mortality. These findings suggest that those with lower T/S ratios or DNAmTL may be more vulnerable to mortality associated with cadmium exposure. This study is the first to investigate the interconnections between blood cadmium levels, a DNA methylation-based predictor of telomere length, measured telomere length, and their associations with mortality risk. Our findings point to a possible mechanistic pathway through which cadmium exposure may drive DNA methylation alterations, disrupt telomere maintenance, and contribute to increased mortality. These results enhance our understanding of how environmental contaminants like cadmium may accelerate biological aging and impact long-term health outcomes. In the current study, we observed that men exhibited shorter telomere lengths and lower DNA methylation levels. These findings may reflect gender differences in DNA methylation modifications and telomere attrition and are consistent with previous studies [ 39 40 40 41 4.1. Cadmium and Telomere Length Cadmium triggers oxidative stress and promotes the production of ROS, leading to cellular damage, notably DNA. This process accelerates telomere shortening, as telomeres are particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage [ 3 37 11 42 43 12 44 4.2. Cadmium and Horvath DNAmTL We also observed that blood cadmium level was negatively associated with Horvath DNAmTL. Horvath DNAmTL is a DNA methylation biomarker that assesses DNA methylation patterns across CpG sites linked to biological aging, including telomere dynamics, rather than focusing solely on telomere-specific regions [ 24 15 16 17 45 18 46 4.3. The Association Between Blood Cadmium, Horvath DNAmTL, and T/S Ratio Previous studies have shown that DNA methylation influences telomere length by regulating the expression of telomere maintenance genes, such as telomerase and shelterin [ 21 22 23 24 4.4. Blood Cadmium, Telomere Length, DNA Methylation, and Mortality Outcomes We observed significant associations between elevated blood cadmium levels and an increased risk of all three mortality outcomes. These findings are consistent with prior studies utilizing the 1999–2004 and 1999–2014 NHANES databases [ 6 7 5 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 4.5. Modification Effects of T/S Ratio and Horvath DNAmTL on Cadmium Related Mortality Since both DNA methylation modifications and telomere length are recognized as biomarkers of biological aging and health, it is plausible that they mediate the effects of cadmium on health outcomes. Several studies support this: cadmium-related methylation changes have been linked to lower birth weight in Bangladesh [ 54 19 55 56 The public health implications of these findings are significant, as they suggest that cadmium exposure may contribute to adverse health outcomes by accelerating biological aging processes, as evidenced by shortened telomeres and DNA methylation alterations. Since telomere shortening and disrupted DNA methylation are linked to increased risks of mortality, reducing cadmium exposure in the population could potentially mitigate these health risks. Public health interventions aimed at minimizing cadmium exposure, particularly in high-risk populations, could play a crucial role in preventing premature aging, reducing disease burden, and lowering mortality rates. It’s important to recognize both the strengths and limitations of this study. This study has several strengths, including the use of a large, nationally representative sample from NHANES, which enhances the generalizability of the findings. The integration of comprehensive mortality data linked to the NCHS allowed for an in-depth analysis of all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer-related mortality over a long follow-up period. Additionally, the inclusion of both telomere length and a DNA methylation biomarker (Horvath DNAmTL) provided a more holistic view of the biological pathways involved. Advanced statistical methods, such as SEM, was employed to assess both direct and indirect effects, further strengthening the analysis. A key limitation is that both the T/S ratio and Horvath DNAmTL were measured only once at baseline, precluding assessment of longitudinal telomere dynamics. Future studies are needed to confirm whether Horvath DNAmTL mediates cadmium’s effect on telomere length. Another limitation is that multiple subgroup comparisons were conducted without adjustment for multiple testing, which increases the likelihood of type I error; thus, subgroup findings should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, residual confounding from unmeasured variables may have influenced the observed associations. Lastly, the attenuation of associations in the composite analysis suggests that the interplay between cadmium exposure, telomere dynamics, and DNA methylation modifications is complex and requires further research. Future longitudinal and mechanistic studies are warranted to clarify the causal pathways linking cadmium exposure, DNA methylation aging processes such as Horvath DNAmTL, and telomere biology, thereby enhancing the translational relevance of these findings for public health interventions. 5. Conclusions Utilizing a nationally representative U.S. sample, our findings indicate that higher blood cadmium levels are significantly linked to shorter telomeres and lower Horvath DNAmTL, with the latter partially mediating the impact of cadmium on telomere length. Furthermore, our results suggest that individuals with lower T/S ratios or DNAmTL may be more susceptible to mortality related to cadmium exposure. These results highlight the complex interplay between cadmium exposure, telomere dynamics, DNA methylation modifications, and mortality, suggesting a need for further research to clarify the underlying mechanisms. Public health interventions to reduce cadmium exposure, especially among high-risk populations, could be pivotal in mitigating premature aging, decreasing disease burden, and lowering mortality rates.
