Introduction The plant immune system represents a sophisticated and tightly regulated defense network that provides protection against diverse pathogenic threats, encompassing bacterial, fungal, oomycete, and viral invaders. Contemporary understanding divides the plant immune system into two principal strata: pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) serving as the first line of defense, and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) providing more specific resistance [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 Triochoderma 7 8 12 13 Trichoderma 14 15 16 Trichoderma Trichoderma 17 18 Trichoderma 19 20 T. reesei T. longibrachiatum Cucumis melo 21 T. harzianum Trichoderma B. cinerea 5 22 Trichoderma 21 23 Trichoderma 24 The cellulase system is characterized by three principal enzymatic activities: endoglucanase (EG), exoglucanase (CBH) [ 25 26 27 Trichoderma 28 Southern corn leaf blight (SCLB) is a devastating foliar disease caused by B. maydis 29 T. harzianum T.harzianum Curvularia lunata Therefore, characterizing the role of T. harzianum This study elucidates novel defense mechanisms in maize mediated by T. harzianum B. maydis. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Plant Growth Conditions The variety of tobacco is Nicotiana benthamiana All N. benthamiana Maize seeds (B104 inbred line) were sterilized by shaking in 75% ethanol for 15 min, followed by treatment with 2% ( w v 2 2 2.2. Biological Materials and Culture Conditions T. harzianum S. sclerotiorum B. maydis Agrobacterium tumefaciens Pichia pastoris Escherichia coli 2.3. RNA-Seq Data Analysis and Transcript Quantification The signal peptide of Thph2 was predicted using SignalP v5.0. Homologous gene sequences were retrieved from NCBI ( https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-5.0/ https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/search/sequence/ Transcriptome sequencing was performed by Shanghai Personal Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. 2.4. Validation of Signal Peptide Function The pSUC2 vector, which contained the sucrose invertase gene (SUC2) but lacked both the ATG initiation codon and native signal peptide, served as the cloning platform for the signal peptide sequence. The resulting construct was then introduced into the YTK12 yeast strain through a transformation process. Transformants were selected on two distinct media: (i) CMD-W plates (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.1% glucose, 2% sucrose, 2% agar, 0.075% tryptophan-deficient supplement); (ii) YPRAA plates (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% raffinose, 2 μg/mL antimycin A, 2% agar). Control groups consisted of YTK12 strains transformed with either the empty pSUC2 vector (negative control) or pSUC2-Avr1bSP construct (positive control). The activity of sucrose invertase was measured by the enzymatic transformation of 2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) into its red formazan derivative, 1,3,5-triphenylformazan (TPF). The Yeast Signal Trap Assay Kit was commercially obtained from Coolaber Science & Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China. 2.5. Thph2 Function Analysis in N. benthamiana To evaluate cell death, A tumefaciens Δsp N. benthamiana Δsp A tumefaciens N benthamiana 2.6. Detection of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and Cell Death in Plant Systems Cell death was assessed by incubating plant tissues in 0.1% ( w v 2 2 To measure ROS burst, leaf discs (1 cm 2 N. benthamiana 2.7. Western Blotting Assay Protein extraction and quantification: Total protein was extracted from tobacco leaves using RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Shanghai, China) supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The lysates were centrifuged at 12,000× g SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting: Equal quantities of protein (20–30 μg per lane) were resolved using 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE and subsequently transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, Shanghai, China) via a semi-dry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The membranes were incubated with 5% non-fat milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h. Antibody incubation and detection: The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies specific to the target protein (anti-HA, anti-GFP, 1:1500 dilution; Abmart, Shanghai, China). Following three washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Shanghai, China). Protein bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) and imaged with a ChemiDoc™ imaging system (Tanon, Shanghai, China). 2.8. Expression and Purification of Proteins in Yeast Heterologous protein expression in P. pastoris v/v g The eluted protein fractions were concentrated via Amicon ® 2.9. Quantitative Gene Expression Profiling by Reverse Transcription qPCR Total RNA was extracted from liquid nitrogen-ground tissues (100 mg) using the FastPure Plant RNA Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China; RC401). RNA integrity was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (28S/18S ratio > 1.8) and quantified spectrophotometrically (NanoDrop One, Shanghai, China; A260/A280 = 1.9–2.1). Genomic DNA contamination was eliminated using a 4× g Supplementary Table S1 ® Reference genes (18S rRNA for maize; actin for Trichoderma https://seqyuan.shinyapps.io/seqyuan_prosper/ −ΔΔCt p 2.10. Statistical Analysis All data were collected from ≥3 independent biological replicates. Statistically significant differences were determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) combined with post hoc tests. For comparisons between two sample groups, the Student’s t p 3. Results 3.1. Thph2 Can Induce N. benthamiana Cell PCD Thph2 was identified as GH6 family CBHII (EC 3.2.1.91) based on conserved domain analysis ( Figure 1 N. benthamiana A. tumefaciens N. benthamiana N. benthamiana Figure 1 N. benthamiana Figure 1 Figure 1 N. benthamiana 3.2. Signal Peptide-Dependent Programmed Cell Death Induction by Thph2 Bioinformatic analysis using Signal P 5.0 predicted a 17-amino acid signal peptide in Thph2 ( https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-5.0/ 30 Figure 2 Figure 2 To validate Thph2 localization and signal peptide function, GFP-tagged full-length Thph2 and its signal peptide-deleted mutant ( ΔSP N. benthamiana Figure 2 ΔSP N. benthamiana ΔSP Figure 1 Figure 1 3.3. Thph2 Activates Immune Responses in N. Benthamiana To determine whether Thph2-triggered cell death involves defense responses, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was measured following transient expression of PVX constructs (GFP control, Thph2, and ΔSP N. benthamiana Δsp Figure 3 S. sclerotiorum Figure 3 Figure 3 3.4. Thph2 Enhances Disease Resistance in N. benthamiana Leaves We heterologously expressed and purified Thph2 in yeast to enable its application in diverse plants. The purified Thph2 protein was evaluated for its ability to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in N. benthamiana Figure 4 N. benthamiana Calonectria Figure 4 N. benthamiana Figure 4 3.5. Thph2 Can Induce ROS Accumulation in Maize Leaves, Enhance Resistance to SCLB We evaluated the effect of Thph2 pure protein on maize leaves using two methods: (1) direct injection (PBS control), and (2) surface application with 0.02% diatomaceous earth (PBS and diatomaceous earth controls). The injection experiments demonstrated that Thph2 induces necrosis in maize leaf tissues, concomitant with ROS accumulation ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Maize leaves pre-exposed to Thph2 protein were inoculated with a B. maydis 5 p Figure 5 p Figure 5 31 32 33 Figure 5 34 Figure 5 4. Discussion Trichoderma 31 35 36 Trichoderma T. harzianum 37 Trichoderma B. maydis 5 p Figure 5 T. harzianum Curvularia Fusarium 10 Trichoderma 38 Figure 4 Trichoderma N. tabacum Solanum lycopersicum 39 So far, limited studies have investigated the role of T. harzianum AOS LOX5 HPL OPR1 19 N. benthamiana S. sclerotiorum The scarcity of cellulose in pathogenic fungal cell walls suggests that CBHII’s primary role lies in triggering plant immune responses rather than exerting direct fungicidal effects. The infiltration of T. longibrachiatum 40 41 T. harzianum 42 The role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants is dose-dependent. At moderate levels, ROS act as antimicrobial agents and signaling molecules to activate immune responses. However, excessive ROS accumulation causes oxidative damage to cellular membranes, resulting in electrolyte leakage and cytotoxicity. Our study demonstrated that either transient expression of Thph2 in tobacco leaves or treatment with purified Thph2 protein induced a ROS burst, which played a primary role in activating plant immune responses and subsequently inhibiting S. sclerotiorum 43 T. harzianum 10 Trichoderma 19 44 45 46 T. harzianum Collectively, our results elucidate a previously uncharacterized mechanism by which Thph2 from T. harzianum T. harzianum B.maydis Acknowledgments We are grateful to Jie Chen (Shanghai Jiao Tong University) for his valuable technical assistance.
