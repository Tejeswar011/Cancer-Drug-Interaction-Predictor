Methods Eligible articles from relevant studies or databases were retrieved via systematical search. The association between c-met expression and survival results was evaluated by pooled effect in esophageal cancer patients. A fixed-effects or random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled risk ratios (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results 13 studies were up to the selection criteria. Our meta-analysis indicated that c-met positive expression correlated with lower overall survival (RR = 0.40; 95%CI: 0.25–0.63), disease-free-survival (RR = 0.30; 95%CI: 0.21–0.44), disease specific survival (RR = 0.53; 95%CI: 0.35–0.80) in esophageal cancer patients. Conclusion C-met positive expression indicates a poor prognosis in esophageal cancer patients. Further studies are required to confirm our result.

The terms used for the search were: “c-met” and “esophageal cancer”. A manual search for the references lists was conducted to identify additional appropriate studies. All relevant texts, tables, and figures were reviewed for data extraction, and any disagreement was resolved by consensus. Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval is not required for this meta-analysis study. Eligibility criteria The inclusion criteria of this meta-analysis were: [ 1 2 3 The studies or data were also excluded for: [ 1 2 3 4 5 Data abstraction and quality assessment Two reviewers independently extracted the following parameters from each study: [ 1 2 3 4 14 15 16 Statistical analysis Review Manager 5.2 (RevMan 5.2 ® I 2 P Results Description of trials The initial search identified 186 articles, of which 71 articles were excluded as not being relevant.

Meta-analysis indicated that patients with c-met positive expression did not suffer with a lower 1-year survival (RR = 0.68; 95%CI: 0.36–1.29), compared with the patients with c-met negative expression.

As the predominant EC in China, ESCC has been a great challenge and burden. C-met are dysregulated mainly via overexpression and gene amplification, participating in biological functions. According to study reports, 7.6–58% of advanced ESCC tumors overexpress c-met [ 30 31 The c-met is a tyrosine kinase receptor for HGF. Activation of met results in activation of multiple downstream signaling pathways, which intermediates signal paths such as I3 kinase/AKT, Ras/Raf/MAPK, mTOR pathway and STAT pathway [ 32 33 34 35 36 The HGF-cmet pathway has an important role in mammalian embryonic development [ 37 38 39 41 42 38 43 44 45 To the best of our knowledge, no meta-analysis evaluated the association of c-met expression with short-term and long-term survival in esophageal cancer patients simultaneously. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that c-met positive expression correlated with lower DSS, DFS and OS in esophageal cancer (EC) patients. There is no statistical significance between positive expression and negative expression of c-met expression in the short-term survival. Our survival analysis revealed that patients with positive c-met expression had significantly worse survival in the long-term survival analysis, including DSS, DFS and OS, during which the signaling and gene regulation related to tumor microenvironment and anti-tumor immunity was indicated to be involved in this process [ 46 The results should be interpreted with caution because of several limitations to this meta-analysis. First, reports not in English are excluded. The risk of language bias has to be considered, possible publication bias could emerge as the result of the strategy of selection and the exclusion of studies. Second, all the included studies are retrospective. Third, the cut-off values for judging positive expression of c-met were not completely consistent among the included studies for IHC method, which may influence stability and accuracy of the results. By means of diverse the cut-off values for judging positive expression adopted in studies inclued, we divided patients into one group with a c-met positive level expression or the other group with a c-met negative level expression. Fourth, the studies included 7 countries, it is uncertain whether the conclusion could be generalized to other regions of the world. Conclusion In conclusion, the results of a significant association between c-met positive expression and a poorer OS, DFS and DSS in esophageal cancer patients, indicated that c-met is a negative prognosis indicator. In addition, our investigation suggested that c-met might be a valuable potential therapy target for the treatment of esophageal cancer, and indicate the research direction for the relationship between c-met and TNM pathology, resulting in more clear correlation between c-met, TNM pathology, and long-term prognosis in esophageal cancer patients. Further studies are needed to confirm our results. Supplementary Information Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
