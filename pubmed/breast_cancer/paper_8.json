Physical activity (PA) can help manage cancer-related side effects and offer additional health benefits, yet up to 80% of survivors do not meet PA guidelines. Effective and translatable PA interventions are needed. Objective This randomized trial assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a 12-week automated Internet program for increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among cancer survivors. A secondary aim examined the effect of the intervention on physical and mental well-being. Methods Inactive (<60 min/wk of PA) cancer survivors who completed cancer-directed treatment in the past 3‐12 months or those on a stable maintenance treatment regimen were randomized to the Energize! Exercise Program or Newsletter control condition. The Energize! Program was fully automated and involved weekly behaviorally-based video lessons, homework assignments, exercise planning and reporting, and progressive MVPA goals (75 to 200 min/wk). Algorithm-generated personalized feedback was provided based on PA goal attainment and homework completion. The newsletter group received bimonthly PA education newsletters (a total of 6). Assessments occurred at baseline, 3 months (postintervention), and 6 months (following a 3-month no-contact follow-up). Feasibility was assessed via enrollment and retention rates, acceptability was assessed via intervention engagement metrics and program satisfaction questionnaire, and MVPA was assessed via both self-report and accelerometer (min/wk of total and “bouted” MVPA [accumulated in bouts ≥10 min]). Health-related outcomes (eg, quality of life, fatigue, psychological distress, psychological symptoms, and fear of cancer recurrence) were assessed via electronic questionnaires. Results Forty-six adults aged 55.2 (SD 8.3) years, with BMI mean 33.0 (SD 7.6) kg/m²; 42 (91.3%) female, and 37 (80.4%) non-Hispanic White enrolled in this trial. Feasibility metrics indicate that 69% (46/67) of those who screened eligible were randomized and 6-month retention among randomized participants was 94% (43/46). Acceptability was also high, as evidenced by the percentage of lessons viewed (mean 87.7%, SD 21.3%), exercise plans submitted (mean 82.6%, SD 25.8%), homework assignments completed (mean 77.2%, SD 25.2%), and weeks in which exercise minutes were logged (mean 85.9%, SD 22.1%). Program satisfaction ratings were higher in Energize (mean 5.8, SD 1.6; 1‐7 scale) versus Newsletter (mean 3.2, SD 1.6; P d d d d d d Conclusions The automated Energize! Program is feasible, acceptable, and associated with positive changes in MVPA, yet future studies are needed to improve MVPA long-term. Findings suggest that self-guided PA programs may be beneficial for increasing MVPA among cancer survivors.

Findings from the American College of Sports Medicine’s International Multidisciplinary Roundtable indicate that there is strong evidence that regular PA can improve common cancer-related side effects, which include anxiety, depression, fatigue, and reductions in health-related quality of life, physical functioning, and cardiorespiratory fitness [ 8 9 10-12 13-19 Automated, Internet-delivered PA programs, which are a type of eHealth intervention, allow for wide-scale dissemination at a relatively low cost. Pew Research data indicate that 95% of Americans use the Internet [ 20 Although eHealth interventions are widely used to promote PA and other lifestyle behaviors in “non-clinical” settings or within certain chronic disease populations (eg, cardiovascular disease and diabetes), application of these technologies to promote PA among cancer survivors has lagged behind [ 21 22-24 This randomized trial examines the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week, fully automated Internet program for increasing PA among cancer survivors and explores the effect of this program on PA relative to a newsletter control condition. Specifically, it uses rigorous methodology (eg, a randomized trial and PA assessment via accelerometers), incorporates essential behavior change techniques (eg, goal setting, action planning, self-monitoring, problem-solving, and affect regulation strategies), and examines whether intervention effects are sustained 3 months postintervention, thereby addressing important deficits in the current body of research. A secondary aim of this trial was to compare treatment groups on measures of physical and mental well-being over the entire study period. Methods Participants and Recruitment To be eligible, individuals needed to have a confirmed cancer diagnosis (excluding nonbasal or squamous cell carcinoma) and have either completed all cancer-directed treatment in the past 3‐12 months or be on a maintenance treatment regimen for which they have been stable for at least 3 months. Other eligibility criteria included being 18‐70 years of age, a BMI of 18.5 to <45 kg/m 2 Participants were recruited via advertisements at local oncology clinics in the greater Providence, Rhode Island area, and via national social media advertisements (eg, Facebook). Interested individuals could scan a QR code on physical flyers or click on a link within a social media advertisement to be directed to an electronic screener. This screener was designed to assess initial eligibility by confirming that age, BMI, ability to exercise, and PA criteria were met. Individuals deemed initially eligible based upon the electronic screener were then contacted by a member of the research team, and a more thorough eligibility screener was conducted via telephone. Those who continued to be eligible were invited to a one-on-one orientation session to learn more about the study, ask questions, and obtain informed consent. These sessions were conducted in-person or via videoconference (eg, Zoom). Study Procedures and Randomization Cancer survivors enrolled in this study and randomized to receive the 12-week Energize! Exercise Program or a Newsletter control condition. Randomization occurred at baseline using sealed, opaque envelopes containing pregenerated allocation assignments, stratified by maintenance therapy status (on vs off therapy) to ensure balance across conditions. Envelopes were prepared in advance, sequentially numbered, and opened in order of enrollment. Assessments, which consisted of electronic questionnaires and PA measurement, occurred at baseline, 3 months (immediately postintervention), and 6 months (following a 3-month, no-contact follow-up period). Descriptions of each assessment measure and treatment condition are provided in greater detail below. Primary and Secondary Aims The primary aims of this study were to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the Energize! Exercise Program for improving MVPA among cancer survivors, relative to a Newsletter control condition. Feasibility was evaluated via retention and enrollment rates. Of particular interest were the conversion rates of (1) those who completed the screening process who were deemed eligible, and (2) those who screened eligible but were eventually randomized. Acceptability was assessed via engagement with the intervention (eg, percentage of video lessons viewed, exercise plans submitted, homework assignments completed, and weeks in which exercise minutes were logged), and via the program satisfaction questionnaire. No predetermined thresholds for feasibility or acceptability were established before the study began. Changes in MVPA were assessed via both self-report and accelerometer (described in detail below). Secondary aims were to examine the effect of the intervention on health-related physical and mental well-being, which were assessed via a series of electronic questionnaires. This trial sought to enroll approximately 50 participants; however, no formal power calculations were conducted given the preliminary nature of this study. Energize! Exercise Program Participants randomized to the intervention group received the 12-week Energize! Exercise Program. This fully automated, behaviorally-based, Internet program was designed to increase moderate-intensity PA to a level consistent with national recommendations. The entire program was delivered via a study website, which could be accessed via any web browser on a computer, tablet, or smartphone. No human intervention contact was provided. Each week, participants were given a prescribed exercise goal and asked to submit an exercise plan, watch a multimedia lesson, complete a brief homework assignment, and report their exercise on the study website. Computer-generated, personalized feedback messages were also provided weekly. Each of the Energize! Program components is described in greater detail below. Exercise Goals Participants were given a weekly, moderate-intensity PA goal that started at 75 minutes/week and increased by 25 minutes/week every other week, until reaching 200 minutes by week 11. Given that this program was designed to increase “purposeful” moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (eg, brisk walking and cycling), participants were instructed not to count activities such as hatha yoga, strength training, household chores (eg, gardening or vacuuming), or occupational activities (eg, restaurant server and postal worker), toward their weekly aerobic PA minute goal. To promote a regular habit of PA, participants were encouraged to exercise 5 days/week. Exercise Planning Beginning at week 2, participants were encouraged to plan their exercise prior to the start of each week and submit that detailed exercise plan via the study website. Specifically, individuals were asked to consider their schedule for the upcoming week and record when they planned to exercise (ie, day of week and time of day), as well as the type and duration of exercise they planned to do. Multimedia Lessons Each week, participants were instructed to watch a 10‐ to 15-minute video lesson. These lessons were designed to teach behavioral principles for modifying PA behavior. During week 1, a general overview of the program was provided along with an exercise prescription. Other video lesson topics included exercise planning, managing negative thoughts, stimulus control, overcoming exercise barriers, affect and exercise enjoyment, a midpoint check-in, managing exercise slips, exercise motivation, turning sitting time into active time, future-oriented mindsets, and thinking like an exerciser. Homework Assignments Participants were asked to complete weekly homework assignments electronically to help apply the content from the video lessons to their personal lives. Each assignment was designed to correspond to the lesson of the week and take no longer than 10 minutes to complete. Example assignments included the creation of an exercise routine to promote habit formation, journaling about the value of exercise and positive feelings associated with exercise, problem-solving around exercise barriers, and personal self-reflection based upon one’s progress in the program. No specific feedback was provided to the participant based on their responses to the homework assignments. However, as noted below, automated feedback, based solely upon whether the participant did or did not complete the homework assignment, was included as part of the weekly feedback message. Self-Monitoring of Exercise Similar to the exercise planning component of this program, participants were also asked to report all exercise performed on the study website daily. This included the time of day that the exercise was performed, the type of exercise, and the number of exercise minutes. Automated Feedback Messages Automated, yet personalized feedback was provided weekly based on the data input by the participant from the previous week. Twelve weeks of human-developed, tailored messages were embedded into the study website and took into consideration the following factors: (1) number of exercise minutes performed, (2) whether the homework assignment was completed or not, and (3) whether any injury, illness, or vacation prevented the participant from achieving their weekly exercise goal. Table 1 Table 1. Response options used to generate weekly, algorithm-derived feedback messages and example messaging for a given week. Response category and response options Example feedback message Amount of exercise reported Response option a: It looks like you didn’t report any exercise this week. We hope everything is OK. Perhaps something unexpected happened or you had a particularly busy week. Whatever the case, we hope you can get back on track! Consider the reasons you joined this program. Try to problem-solve around your current exercise barriers. Remember that when it comes to exercise, some exercise is always better than no exercise. You got this! Response option b: You met the exercise goal for the week - great job! Hopefully, you’re starting to get into the swing of things and that exercise is automatically becoming part of your daily routine. The exercise goal will be increasing to 125 minutes this week. Start thinking about how you will get those additional 25 minutes of exercise in so that you can meet your goal again next week. Response option c: Meeting the exercise goal is an important part of this program. We are glad to see that you were able to get at least a little bit of exercise this week. Challenge yourself next week to make exercise a priority. To help you achieve your exercise goal, you could consider adding a positive social cue. Ask a friend, coworker or family member to join you on a walk, hike or bike ride. This is a great strategy for adding additional accountability and for making exercise fun and social. Keep pushing yourself this week to reach the goal. We know that you can do it! Response option d: Meeting the exercise goal is an important part of this program. We are thrilled to see that you’re putting in great effort to reach the goal. Although you fell a little short of the goal this week, keep pushing yourself this week. The goal will be increasing to 125 minutes. To help you achieve this goal, you could consider adding a positive social cue this week. Ask a friend, coworker or family member to join you on a walk, hike or bike ride. This is a great strategy for adding additional accountability and for making exercise fun and social. Homework assignment completion Response option a: It’s awesome to see that you have completed the homework this week! Hopefully, this homework will help you in the future to identify inactivity cues in your daily life and determine which ones you can replace with cues for activity. As you go about the week, keep thinking about ways that you can add more active cues to your home or work environment. Response option b: A big part of this program is the homework that we assign each week. We think that it’s important to complete the assignment so that you can spend more time reflecting on what you learned in the lesson. You can still go back and complete the homework from last week. Take some time to do that now. Also, what got in the way of you completing the homework last week? If you simply forgot about it, try setting a reminder on your phone that prompts you at a certain time each week to complete your homework. Atypical week Response option a: It looks like last week was a little atypical for you due to an injury. We hope that it isn’t anything serious and that you start to feel better soon! Please reach out to us if this injury persists. Response option b: It looks like last week was a little atypical for you due to an illness. We hope that you are feeling better! Once you feel back to normal, make it a priority to get back to your exercise routine. Please let us know if your illness continues for over 2 weeks. Response option c: It looks like last week was a little atypical for you due to vacation. We hope that you had a great time! While vacation can sometimes be challenging because we get out of our routines, many times we can still find ways to be active while away. If you are still going to be on vacation this week, try to think of creative ways to exercise so that you can reach your goal. If you are home from vacation, make it a priority to get back in an exercise routine this week. Newsletter Condition Participants randomized to the Newsletter condition, considered the usual care control condition, received newsletters twice per month for 3 months. Consistent with information available to individuals via the National Cancer Institute and traditional survivorship care plans, these newsletters focused on the general and cancer-specific health benefits of regular PA and reduced sedentary time and included recommended PA guidelines and general information for initiating aerobic PA, strength training, and flexibility programs. Other topics included were exercise safety, methods for gauging exercise intensity, an activity of the month (eg, Zumba, swimming, etc), and motivational, exercise-related stories from cancer survivors. Strategies for facilitating PA behavior change were not included in these newsletters. Assessment of PA Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was assessed at baseline, 3, and 6 months via both accelerometer and self-report. The Actigraph GT9X Link accelerometer [ 25-27 28 26 Self-reported PA was assessed via a modified version of the Paffenbarger Physical Activity Questionnaire [ 29 Questionnaire Measures To address the secondary aim of comparing treatment groups on measures of physical and mental well-being, participants completed a series of questionnaires at each assessment period via REDCap (an online platform; Vanderbilt University). Health-related quality of life was assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Survey Instrument (SF-36) [ 30 31 32 33 34 Statistical Analysis The statistical analyses for this study were conducted using mixed-effects models to evaluate the impact of the program on various PA and psychological outcomes. The primary outcomes analyzed included self-reported MVPA, total MVPA, and bouted MVPA over time. Since this was a pilot study with a relatively small number of participants, we focus on effect sizes rather than P For each outcome, mixed-effects models were used, incorporating random intercepts for participants to account for the repeated measures design of the study. These models included fixed effects for time points, treatment arms, and their interaction, as well as baseline values of each outcome to control for initial differences across groups. Additional covariates such as age, BMI, weight, sex, education, racial and ethnic minority status, maintenance therapy, days since treatment completion, and daily wear time (for accelerometer-based outcomes) were also included. All mixed-effects models were fitted using maximum likelihood estimation so that participants with incomplete data could be included with all available observations. This approach assumes that the data are missing at random, with missingness depending only on observed variables in the model (eg, baseline outcome, demographics, and clinical covariates). For accelerometer outcomes, analyses were restricted to assessments with ≥4 valid wear days, and daily wear time was included as a covariate. The primary interest was in the interaction between treatment arms and time points, which was used to evaluate whether changes in PA differed between the 2 groups (Energize! and Newsletter) at each time point (baseline, 3 months, and 6 months). Post hoc pairwise comparisons of estimated marginal means were conducted to assess changes from baseline to 3 months and baseline to 6 months within each randomization group. Bonferroni corrections were applied to adjust for multiple comparisons. To further interpret the results, effect sizes were calculated using standardized mean differences (Cohen d Ethical Considerations Study procedures were approved by the Lifespan Institutional Review Board (Lifespan IRB 3, project # 1850077). Written or electronic informed consent was obtained by all participants prior to initiating any study procedures. All study data collected were deidentified and stored on a secure server. Participants were compensated US $25 in the form of cash or a gift card upon completion of assessment procedures at 3 and 6 months (for a total compensation of US $50). No compensation was provided for baseline assessments. Results Principal Results Forty-six cancer survivors were randomized to the Energize!

Feasibility and Acceptability Metrics Study enrollment (n=46) was consistent with the targeted goal of approximately 50 participants. Feasibility metrics indicate that 48% of those who completed the screening process were deemed eligible (67/140), and of those who were deemed eligible, 69% were randomized (46/67). Further, retention at 3 and 6 months was 96% (44/46) and 94% (43/46), respectively. Acceptability was assessed via intervention engagement and program satisfaction. On average, Energize! participants watched 87.7% (SD 21.3%) video lessons (10.5/12), submitted an exercise plan on 82.6% (SD 25.8%) of weeks (9.9/12), completed 77.2% (SD 25.2%) of all homework assignments (9.3/12), logged their exercise minutes on 85.9% (SD 22.1%) of all weeks (10.3/12), and achieved their prescribed exercise goal on 56.5% of all weeks (6.8/12; weeks 1‐6: 70.3%, weeks 7‐12: 42.8%). When asked to rate the usefulness of each of the intervention elements (via Likert scales 1‐7), participants rated exercise planning (mean 5.0, SD 2.0) and exercise self-monitoring (mean 5.0, SD 2.0) as most useful, followed by video lessons (mean 4.7, SD 1.7), feedback messages (mean 4.3, SD 1.6), and homework assignments (mean 4.2, SD 1.8). Further, compared to the Newsletter condition, Energize! participants reported higher program satisfaction (mean 5.8, SD 1.6 vs mean 3.2, SD 1.6; P P P Physical Activity Outcomes On average, participants had 6.4 (SD 1.1) “valid” days of accelerometer wear time, and the device was worn for mean 13.3 (SD 1.7) hours/day across all time points.

Discussion Principal Findings Results of this preliminary investigation support the feasibility and short-term efficacy of a 3-month, fully automated, web-based intervention (Energize!) for improving MVPA among cancer survivors. Participant retention (>94%), weekly engagement with intervention elements (73%‐86%), and program satisfaction ratings (average of 5.8 out of 7) were high. Additionally, the Energize! program resulted in significant increases in both self-reported and accelerometer-derived MVPA from baseline to 3 months. Although there was no statistical difference between treatment groups, effect sizes for MVPA were in the small-to-medium range, favoring Energize! over the newsletter condition. At 6 months, there was little difference in MVPA between treatment groups. Comparison With Prior Work Although changes in PA between treatment groups were not statistically significant, within the Energize! group, participants significantly increased their MVPA from baseline to 3 months by 93 minutes/week for self-reported PA and 35 and 46 minutes/week for accelerometer-derived bouted and total MVPA, respectively. This magnitude of change is in line with prior reports of PA promotion interventions among cancer survivors [ 36-39 40 41 42 43 While effect size estimates indicate that changes in PA were larger with Energize! compared to the newsletter condition, the mean change in MVPA in the newsletter group ranged from 17 to 46 minutes/week (depending on the measurement method). This was somewhat surprising, as newsletter participants did not receive behaviorally-based PA promotion content. Further, we asked participants at 3 months whether they signed up for any formal exercise programs, and only 1 participant indicated joining a weight loss program. There may be several explanations for the higher-than-expected PA in the Newsletter condition. First, it is possible that being asked to wear a PA monitor and answer questions related to PA could have prompted greater PA, as participants may have gleaned the importance of this behavior for study outcomes [ 44 45 46 41 Another interesting, yet not surprising, finding was the discordance between self-reported and accelerometer-derived PA. The results from this study are consistent with prior research, in that accelerometer-derived bouted MVPA was lower than self-reported MVPA [ 47 48 41 49 41 49 Another aim of this study was to examine the effect of the Energize! Exercise program on common cancer-related mental and physical well-being outcomes. At 3 months, medium effect sizes, favoring Energize! over Newsletter, were observed for vitality (ie, energy and fatigue) and somatization (ie, the experience and expression of psychological distress through physical symptoms). At 6 months, mixed findings were observed, with some outcomes favoring Energize! (depression and anxiety) and others favoring Newsletter (bodily pain, general health, and fatigue). One potential explanation for these findings is that the magnitude of change in PA in Energize! (relative to Newsletter) was not sufficient to elicit changes in the majority of the health outcomes assessed. Another possibility is that baseline differences between treatment groups may have made it difficult for intervention effects to be observed (eg, the majority of health-related quality of life scores at baseline were significantly higher in Energize! than in Newsletter). Nonetheless, these mixed findings are similar to meta-analyses and systematic reviews of digital PA promotion interventions on health-related outcomes in cancer survivors, which have also reported mixed results [ 23 24 39 Limitations This study has notable strengths, which include the use of both self-report and accelerometer-derived PA measurements, a no-contact intervention follow-up period to assess the lasting effect of the intervention, and the inclusion of individuals with varying types of cancer, which enhances generalizability. However, it is not without limitations. First, this was a preliminary investigation examining the effect of the Energize! program on MVPA and cancer-related mental and physical well-being; thus, it was not powered to detect differences between treatment groups. While effect size estimates are initially favorable regarding the Energize! program, a fully powered trial is warranted. Further, the majority of the participants in this study were female and non-Hispanic White. This is common to both the broader eHealth literature and cancer-specific literature [ 43 50 Conclusions This study supports the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the Energize! Exercise Program, a 3-month remotely delivered PA promotion intervention for cancer survivors. Results of the investigation indicate participants were satisfied with the program, routinely engaged with all study elements, and the majority were retained for the entire study duration. PA significantly increased from baseline to 3 months among Energize! participants, and these increases were partially maintained at 6 months. Future studies should investigate whether additional components can be added to the Energize! program to enhance PA or health-related outcomes, and whether specific behavior change techniques could be used to promote the long-term maintenance of PA changes.
