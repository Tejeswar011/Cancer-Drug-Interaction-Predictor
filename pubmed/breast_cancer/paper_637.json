The use of race and ethnicity as a medical screening tool impacts medical outcomes by associating race with genetics without considering that race incorporates social, economic, and cultural variables that influence outcomes. Methods To evaluate underlying factors contributing to differences in hypertension prevalence, control, and treatment recommendations across race/ethnicities, a 2-week elective course was developed for third- and fourth-year medical students. In this elective course, students performed self-directed literature-based research on hypertension health disparities. We then developed three videos that addressed the racial/ethnic impact on hypertension prevalence and control and incorporated the students’ research findings. The videos were presented at a lunch-and-learn session, open to medical students and health professionals, that was focused on healthcare inequities in hypertension. Pre- and post-session survey data was collected to assess how the discussion changed participant knowledge and impressions of the role race plays in hypertension prevalence, control, and treatment. Results Survey results denoted that 100% of lunch-and-learn participants increased their understanding of the impact of health inequities on hypertension. Overall, there were significant differences in knowledge gained and understanding of health disparities that influence hypertension treatment across participants from all genders and racial or ethnic groups. Notably, pre-session survey results indicated that participants tended to agree that treatment guidelines incorporating race improve equity in the treatment of hypertension whereas post-session results showed that participants were less likely to agree with this assertion. Conclusions Developing educational opportunities to discuss health inequities can influence perceptions of patient care.
