The current for assessing V/Q in a clinical setting are inadequate for bedside monitoring purposes. They are characterised by invasiveness and an increased risk of infection. Accordingly, the present study was based on a high-performance electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system developed by our team, with the objective of exploring the feasibility of using it for non-invasive assessment of V/Q at the bedside. This was achieved by acquiring and imaging pulmonary blood flow pulsation signals and combining them with pulmonary ventilation impedance information. Continuous lung EIT imaging data were acquired at 40 fps through different body positions and breath-holding in anaesthetised domestic pigs (N = 8, 17.50 ± 1.51 kg). By analysing the blood flow pulsation impedance information, lung perfusion-related data were extracted and combined with lung ventilation impedance data to establish a pulsatility V/Q assessment method. Furthermore, the monitoring of pulmonary perfusion using hypertonic saline (5 ml of 10% NaCl) was employed as a control experiment. The results demonstrate that the V/Q results obtained through the utilisation of both methodologies exhibit a notable degree of variability in response to alterations in body position and the state of breath holding. The V/Q results obtained using the pulsatility method and the saline method were subjected to analysis using the Bland–Altman agreement test. During end-expiration breath-holding in the supine position, the results were as follows: 95% CI = 2.36% to 10.26%, bias = 6.309%. During end-inspiration breath-holding in the supine position, the results were as follows: 95% CI = 0.07% to 12.23%, bias = 6.150%. During end-expiration breath-holding in the prone position, the results were as follows: 95% CI = -0.40% to 14.43%, bias = 7.014%. During end-inspiration breath-holding in the prone position, the results were as follows: 95% CI = 1.92% to 11.17%, bias = 6.541%.

The mean weight and mean chest circumference of the subjects were 17.50 ± 1.51 kg and 56.00 ± 2.33 cm, respectively. The subjects ranged in age from 2.0 to 2.5 months.The study was approved by the Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee of the Air Force Military Medical University (Licence No. IACUC-20241299). All experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and regulations set forth by the Air Force Military Medical University. EIT imaging instrumentation In this study, we employed the EC-100 pro high-performance EIT system, which was developed by the research group in collaboration with UTRON Technology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China 7 15 Animal model experiments Animal preparation Prior to the commencement of the experiment, the animals were fasted and dehydrated for a period of 12 h. Their body temperature, respiration and heart rate were then confirmed to be within the normal range. The surgical protocol was as follows: anaesthesia was induced by intravenous injection of propofol (10 mg/kg) at the ear margin, followed by maintenance of anaesthesia with isoflurane gas. This was immediately followed by tracheal intubation and connection to a respiratory anaesthesia machine (Mindray WATO EX-65), with the respiratory rate set at 14 breaths/min, tidal volume of 310 ml, ventilation rate of 5.7 L/min, and an airway pressure of no more than 40 cm/H 2 1 Fig. 1 Experimental animals, instrument preparation and flowchart. ( A B C D E Experimental flow The animal’s chest and back were shaved and subsequently treated with a combination of alcohol and abrasive cream. Subsequently, electrode tapes containing 16 electrodes (Fig. 1 1 The EIT control monitoring experiment was divided into two principal phases, each comprising four subphases, as illustrated in Fig. 1 Supine position monitoring under pulsatility method vs. hypertonic saline The EIT data were acquired continuously for a period of 30 min, during which time all of the animal’s physiological parameters remained stable. This allowed for the recording of impedance and image changes during pulmonary ventilation. The end-expiratory breath-holding was achieved by administering a small dose of propofol (2 mg/kg) and regulating the ventilator to obtain 20 cycles of blood flow pulsatile perfusion data and imaging. Subsequently, a hypertonic saline contrast agent (5 ml of 10% NaCl) was injected via a central venous catheter to continuously acquire and observe the impedance and image changes associated with the pulmonary perfusion process for 5–6 s. The entire end-expiratory pause state was maintained for approximately 45 s, after which autonomous respiration was resumed. Once the animal’s various physiological indexes had stabilised, the lung ventilation EIT data were collected continuously for 30 min. This was followed by end-inspiratory breath-holding, which was completed only by controlling the ventilator. The monitoring methods and processes were identical to those employed during the end-expiratory pause. (2) Prone position monitoring under pulsatility method vs. hypertonic saline Following a change in the position of the animal and a period of observation to ensure stability of the animal’s physiological indexes, the EIT data were collected continuously for approximately 30 min to observe impedance and image changes associated with the pulmonary ventilation process. Subsequently, the impedance and image changes associated with the blood flow pulsatile perfusion and hypertonic saline perfusion process were monitored during the end-expiratory and end-inspiratory breath-holds, which were conducted in the same manner as in the supine position. Following the completion of all experiments, the animals were euthanised with an overdose of anaesthetic (propofol, 50 mg/kg, administered intravenously at the ear margin). A new method for extracting V/Q based on the pulsatility EIT technique Once the raw data had been obtained, the effect of the blood flow beat signal was first removed during mechanical ventilation by means of frequency filtering, thus facilitating late lung ventilation imaging. Subsequently, the blood flow beat signal was extracted from the pulmonary blood flow booster impedance information during breath-hold for late lung perfusion imaging. This extraction was performed prior to the injection of hypertonic saline during breath-hold. Finally, cardiac information was extracted using the PPG signal, and the cardiac region of interest was removed for V/Q extraction in conjunction with imaging of lung ventilation and lung perfusion. EIT data processing and image reconstruction The data processing stage of this study concerns the processing of the boundary voltage signal, which reflects the distribution of conductivity within the lung. Subsequently, the signal was filtered using a band-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 1Hz to 5Hz, resulting in the acquisition of the final measurement data, which reflected the lung information over time 15 1 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$GBV = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\limits_{chn = 1}^{N} {V_{chn} }$$\\end{document} N V chn nth The image reconstruction in this study is a dynamic differential reconstruction utilising a data-driven linear reconstruction algorithm that relies on a data-driven linear reconstruction algorithm, the Gratz consensus reconstruction algorithm for EIT, GREIT 16 16 17 17 Ultimately, from the acquired and processed measurement data are used to reconstruct and visualise an internal lung tomographic image is reconstructed and visualised on the EIT acquisition platform, thereby obtaining information on the characteristics of the lung conductivity distribution 18 Furthermore, a comparison was conducted between the GBV and PPG changes during the experimental breath-hold, with the objective of obtaining the corresponding global boundary voltage over time curve (GBV-Time curve) and photoelectric volumetric tracings over time curve (PPG-Time curve). This was done in order to confirm the correlation between them. As illustrated in Fig. 2 2 2 15 Fig. 2 EIT data acquisition in the supine position. ( A B C With regard to the delineation of regions of interest, given that EIT images are obtained from the chest, it is possible that they may also encompass heart and lung tissue. Consequently, in order to obtain the lung region of interest, it is first necessary to calculate the heart and lung region of interest, then to subtract the heart region of interest, and finally to obtain the lung region of interest. The heart–lung region of interest is typically indicative of the degree of correlation between the impedance change waveform of each pixel and the total impedance waveform, and it is obtained through the application of a linear regression method. The region of interest in the heart is obtained via PPG signals. Calculation of lung ventilation/lung perfusion matching images In order to identify the region of ventilation and perfusion, a threshold of 20% of the maximum pixel reconstruction value is applied to the ventilation and perfusion images, as illustrated in the blue box in Fig. 2 19 The ventilation region was constructed by first acquiring the lung EIT data of each respiratory cycle. The end-expiratory moment (corresponding to the trough moment) was selected as the reference frame for EIT imaging of one respiratory cycle, allowing for the generation of a representative image of the lung ventilation at a given point in time. Subsequently, the impedance changes of five consecutive respiratory cycles were averaged, and the result was used as the pixel reconstruction value of the lung ventilation image, designated as \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\Delta Z_{V}$$\\end{document} \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\Delta Z_{V}$$\\end{document} 2 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\Delta Z_{V} = \\frac{1}{{M_{V} }}\\sum\\limits_{{m_{V} = 1}}^{{M_{V} }} {(\\Delta Z_{in,i} - \\Delta Z_{ex,i} )}$$\\end{document} Of these, the \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\Delta Z_{in,i}$$\\end{document} \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\Delta Z_{ex,i}$$\\end{document} ith M V The perfusion region was constructed by first acquiring the lung EIT data during each breath-hold.

( A B C D E F Discussion In clinical practice, alterations in body position and respiration are frequently efficacious methods of intervention for influencing or enhancing V/Q and reducing the prevalence of mechanical lung injury 25 26 Selection and establishment of animal models In this study, healthy pigs were selected as experimental subjects, and the changes in lung EIT images and V/Q matching were observed based on the pulsatility method. This was done in order to control and verified the results using the hypertonic saline method. In selecting the body position, we controlled for both supine and prone positions. This was done for two reasons. First, prone ventilation is often used in clinical practice to improve V/Q matching in patients 27 27 27 28 28 Furthermore, a breath-holding model of approximately 45 s was established during the breath-holding process. This was done to ensure that the data acquisition of the pulsatility method and the hypertonic saline method were in the same breath-holding period, thus avoiding errors. At the same time, pulsatility data prior to the injection of hypertonic saline was chosen, which helped to minimise errors due to the potential change in cardiac output resulting from the injection of hypertonic saline. To minimise this error, a period of 30 min was allowed for recovery in different positions and different breath-holds. This allowed the pigs to return to a normal physiological state. In particular, a small quantity of propofol was administered during the end-expiratory pause, with the ventilator employed to regulate this phase. This is due to the fact that the end-expiratory carbon dioxide waveform (as displayed on the ventilator) does not fully dissipate when the end-expiratory pause is solely regulated by the ventilator. The administration of a small dose of propofol effectively suppresses respiration until the end-expiratory carbon dioxide waveform has fully dissipated, thereby ensuring that the acquired lung perfusion data are not confounded by respiration. This process is relatively unaffected by respiratory mechanics due to the rapid metabolism of propofol 29 Feasibility and applicability of dynamic EIT techniques for monitoring V/Q In 1999, Gazzolo and colleagues proposed the blood flow pulsation EIT technique, which is based on the acquisition of pulmonary blood flow signals derived from cardiac pulsation 30 30 31 32 7 15 33 Furthermore, the existing literature has indicated that EIT is a reliable method for monitoring alterations in perfusion resulting from changes in disease severity and PEEP 34 34 35 35 In this study, we explored the changes of V/Q in healthy pigs during different positions and different breath-holding periods by the pulsatility method. The findings revealed that the pulsatility method can initially monitored the effects of varying positions and breath-holding states on V/Q. The data yielded significant results when assessing the impact of different conditions on V/Q using the pulsatility method ( P 0.001 1 2 10 36 37 37 Finally, the V/Q match% Dead Space% Shunt% r p 0.0001 r p 0.0001 r p 0.0001 Limitations It should be noted that this study is not without limitations. (1) The model established in healthy pigs in this study, although the feasibility of the pulsatility method for monitoring V/Q was initially obtained, the practical application for clinical patients has yet to be explored; (2) The purpose of this study, which was controlled by hypertonic saline, was to initially explore the feasibility of the pulsatility method (non-invasive) as an alternative to the hypertonic saline method (invasive). The subsequent phase will entail the utilisation of computed tomography (CT) and other imaging modalities to substantiate and enhance the precision of the pulsatility method. This will facilitate the corroboration of the efficacy and reliability of the pulsatility technique through the analysis of a more substantial data set; (3) The sample size of this study is relatively limited, necessitating the acquisition of a considerably larger data set to ascertain the viability of the pulsatility approach as a clinical tool for real-time patient monitoring; (4) This study employed PPG to obtain heart signals, the subsequent phase will employ a more precise ECG to ascertain cardiac data, thereby enhancing the precision of lung ventilation. Conclusions In the present study, given the current absence of non-invasive, real-time technical means to assess V/Q in clinical settings, a high-performance EIT imaging system was employed to capture information on impedance changes resulting from pulmonary blood flow pulsatility and to extract V/Q in conjunction with pulmonary ventilation data. The results of the animal experiments demonstrated that the established EIT method was capable of monitoring the effects of different body positions and different breath-holding periods on V/Q. This entirely non-invasive image monitoring method offers a novel approach to bedside patient monitoring, enabling the real-time observation and assessment of V/Q at the bedside.
