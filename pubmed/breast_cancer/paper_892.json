Joints biomechanical abilities and their adaptability to loading variations depend on cartilaginous extracellular matrix integrity, and particularly on their proteoglycans concentration, provider of hydrostatic pressure and bio-mechanical functions [ 1 Diagnosis of cartilaginous extracellular matrix biochemical alterations could permit in vivo studies of articular functionality [ 2 3 4 5 8 9 10 11 For many years, INSERM unit UMR 1240 IMoST/UCA develops radiotracers targeting cartilage, as [ 99m 12 13 14 15 16 99m 17 99m 18 The main objective of this “first-in-human” trial was to determine the recommended dose (activity in MBq/kg) of [ 99m Impact of activity and acquisition time on [ 99m Materials and methods Full version of the Materials and Methods section is presented in the Additional File 1. Study design This phase I study is a multicentric dose-escalation trial of a radiotracer, with three activity steps: 5, 10 and 15 MBq/kg. An escalation of one-step was conditioned by the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and a lack of tracer accumulation on healthy joints on scintigraphies performed at a time ≤ 2 h post-injection (p.i.) [ 18 www.clinical.gov NCT04481230 Patients and baseline assessment In order to explore physiological cartilage uptake, we included patients without advanced joint damage but whose pathologies or treatment could lead to it. They were classified into two categories. First group presented painful unilateral knee osteoarthritis, with a Kellgren-Lawrence score of 0/1, average WOMAC ≥ 4 and MOCART 2.0 score > 70. Second group was composed of patients under 60, with non-metastatic breast cancer, HR+, HER2 negative, eligible for adjuvant therapy with aromatase inhibitor. All patients were clinically assessed with at least 31 healthy joints by a rheumatologist. Within 15 days before administration of [ 99m Radiotracer production and administration [ 99m 99m 4 ® 12 19 The experimental radiotracer was an injectable solution of [ 99m A single injection of [ 99m Imaging acquisition and assessment Whole-body planar scintigraphy were performed 30 min, 2 h, 4 h and 6 h p.i., each one followed by a SPECT acquisition from knee to lumbar spine 30 min later. A single whole-body Computed Tomography per patient was carried out, for attenuation correction and articular localization of [ 99m Tracer accumulation on healthy joints was assessed on whole body imaging, with a semi-quantitative visual scale: 1 = lower fixation than diaphyseal uptake; 2 = fixation equal to diaphyseal uptake; 3 = upper fixation than diaphyseal uptake. Visual analysis was performed by two nuclear physicians with reconciliation of the results. SPECT volumetric Regions of Interest (ROI) were performed by two nuclear physicians, using a 40% max threshold semi-automatic tool. ROI were centered on four cartilaginous zones, eight periarticular structures (bursa, ligaments and tendons), three muscles and three bones. Cartilage and periarticular [ 99m Safety Vital signs were followed up before injection of [ 99m 18 99m Biodistribution Blood samples for pharmacokinetic study were collected at 5 min, 10 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h and 6–8 h p.i. A 8-hour urine collection was realized for excretion evaluation. Evolution of tracer activity was measured on whole blood and plasma during the first 8 h. Dosimetry The dosimetric study was performed according to the scheme defined by the Committee on MIRD formalism in terms of mean absorbed dose by organ. First, activity versus time curves were obtained using planar scintigraphies. The time-activity curves (TAC) for all target organs were fitted by a sum of exponentials and then integrated to give time-integrated activity (TIA). Secondly, we used two sets of S-values, one obtained from the OpenDose3D website to calculate the absorbed dose to the classic organs at risk (liver, kidneys, etc.) and the other obtained from Monte Carlo simulations performed with GATE for the specific cartilage zones as described and applied in a previous study [ 20 The whole body effective dose (E) due to [ 99m \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:E=\\sum\\:_{T}{W}_{T}\\sum\\:_{R}{W}_{R}{D}_{T,R}$$\\end{document} T, R R T \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:\\sum\\:_{T}{W}_{T}=1.$$\\end{document} Statistical considerations A maximum of six patients could be included in the study, with a maximum of four patients per dose level. The stopping rule was that at least two patients have received the recommended dose level and with one patient from each group in the selected dose level. The number of subjects to be included makes it possible to validate the hypothesis that healthy cartilage presented a significantly higher fixation than diaphysis fixation. For each patient, a number of 31 observations (healthy joints) at four different times was available for the evaluation of the main objective. Optimal activity was chosen by the dose escalation algorithm [ 18 n The statistical significance threshold was set at 5%. Statistical analyses were performed using R software. The influence of acquisition time on fixation was analyzed by mixed models, to take into account the data non-independence (repeated data on the same patient, at several locations, at four acquisition times, by two readers), with uptake location and acquisition times as fixed effects, and subjects and reader as random effects. The rest of the analysis is essentially descriptive. Missing data were not replaced. Results Population characteristics Patient recruitment began in November 2020 and inclusions was closed in June 2022. Six patients were included: one in the lowest dose step, one in the middle dose step and four in the highest dose step. Half of patient was in osteoarthritis group and the other half in breast cancer group. The injected activity corresponded to the theoretical dose step for five patients, with a 99m 99m 99m 4 − 99m The five injected patients composed the studied population.
