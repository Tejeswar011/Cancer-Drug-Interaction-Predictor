The UV-visible spectrum (200–700 nm) of diluted AuNPs was recorded using a UV / S - Assessment of antibacterial activity Four bacterial strains, Staphylococcus aureus Bacillus cereus Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( 63 64 65 Antifungal assay Four Candida species, Candida albicans C. glabrata C. parapsilosis C. krusei 66 68 50 90 GM The initial concentration of the synthesized AuNPs was considered to be 200 µg/mL. After preparing a serial dilution for AuNPs, 100 µL of the solution was poured into the wells of a microplate, to which the fungal suspension was added at the same ratio. The plate was incubated at 35 °C for 24 h. Negative control wells contained no organism, and positive control wells held fungal suspensions without AuNPs. The MIC (i.e., the lowest concentration at which the fungi showed no significant growth after incubation for 24 h was determined optically. The antifungal effects of AuNPs were compared with those of Fluconazole 69 Scolicidal activity Sheep livers infected with hydatid cysts were obtained from the industrial slaughterhouse of Yasuj City, Iran, to prepare hydatid cysts. The samples were washed several times, poured into test tubes, and prepared for examination. One drop of a solution containing at least 500 protoscolices protoscolices % 70 Statistical analysis Data were analyzed by SPSS software using analysis of variance (ANOVA). In addition, Duncan’s test was used to compare the means. Normality was checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and Bartlett’s test for homogeneity of variances was used to test if variances were equal across groups.

This moderate stability could affect the uniformity of the nanoparticle suspension, so further surface modifications and optimization of synthesis methods are required to achieve AuNPs with higher absolute zeta potential values and better dispersion stability.
