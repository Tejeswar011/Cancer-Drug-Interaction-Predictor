Due to the potential for severe side effects associated with R837, the subcutaneous injection of a hydrogel scaffold may enhance its efficacy. Herein, we propose a biodegradable 3D injectable scaffold as an injectable delivery carrier for R837 (R837@Gel), to control the release rate of R837 and be friendly to subcutaneous tissue. Biodegradable 3D injectable amino acid hydrogels were constructed by catalase effect during Fmoc‐Phe and Phe 2 + + p The biodegradable 3D scaffold as an injectable delivery carrier for R837 (R837@Gel) enhanced its immunotherapeutic efficacy. We believe gel‐based sustained release of R837 is a promising approach to overcome this challenge and improve the therapeutic efficacy of R837. hydrogel immunotherapy injectable PD‐1 R837 Nantong Health Commission Project MSZ2023040 the Science and Technology R&D Foundation of Nantong City MS22022096 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:01.10.2025  Funding: Mengfei Yin, Ling Mao and Xunlei Zhang contributed equally to this work.

Appropriate drug delivery vehicles play a crucial role in enhancing the efficacy, stability, and targeted delivery of drugs administered via subcutaneous injection [ 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 In this study, we report a biodegradable 3D hydrogel (Gel) scaffold as an injectable delivery carrier for R837 (R837@Gel), allowed friendly to subcutaneous tissue and with a controlled release rate of R837 (Figure 1 1A 1B 1C FIGURE 1 Scheme illustration of R837@Gel for enhancing the antitumor immunotherapy effect. (A) R837@Gel (precursor) was subcutaneously injected into mice to form R837@Gel, and R837 was slowly released. (B) The released R837 acted on the TLR‐7 of APC, induced DC maturation and cytokine production, activated T lymphocytes, and infiltrated the tumor periphery. (C) R837@Gel combined with PD‐1 inhibitors enhanced the efficacy of immunotherapy. 2 Material and Methods 2.1 Materials and Animals R837, fluonemethoxy‐carbophenylalanine (Fmoc‐Phe), diphenylalanine (Phe 2 Pseudomonas fluorescens BLAB/c mice (6–8 weeks old) were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of Nantong University, China. All procedures were conducted in compliance with local regulations. Written informed consent was obtained from the animal owners for their participation in the study. Mice were housed under controlled conditions (20°C–22°C, 40%–70% relative humidity) with a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle. The animals were provided standard laboratory feed and water ad libitum. CT26.WT colon cancer cells, sourced from Wuhan Fine Biotech Co. Ltd., China, were cultured in DMEM media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/mL penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin sulfate. Cells were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO 2 2.2 Preparation of R837 R837@Gel (precursor) consisted of two segments: R837 and Fmoc‐Phe, Phe 2 2 2.3 Characterization of R837 Zeta potential and particle size of R837, the gel (precursor), and the R837@gel (precursor) were measured using a Nano ZS90 Zetasizer (Malvern, UK). The gel morphology was determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM‐6700F, JEOL Co., Japan). The prepared gel samples were dehydrated and dried in a vacuum desiccator, and the SEM images were obtained after spraying with gold. The morphology of the R837@Gel was evaluated using photographs taken within 80 min. The viscosity change of R837@Gel was recorded with a rotating viscometer (25°C, 12 RPM). The solution‐gel phase transition behavior of the hydrogels was also observed using the tilting method. The gel formation in vivo was recorded after 0.5 mL of R837@Gel (precursor) was injected subcutaneously into the backs of mice. After 8 days, the mice were dissected to observe subcutaneous formation. 2.4 Degradation In Vitro and In Vivo Following gel curing, the tube was removed and 3 mL of degradation medium (pH 7.4 PBS) was added, followed by incubation in a 37°C thermostatic water bath. At predetermined time points (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 day), the medium was carefully aspirated and the tubes were dried under vacuum at 40°C for 24 h to constant weight before measurement. The remaining mass percentage was calculated as: ( W t W 0 0 W t t For in vivo degradation assessment, three parallel gel samples (100 μL each) were subcutaneously implanted in BALB/c mice ( n 2 2.5 Drug Release In Vitro and In Vivo The in vitro release behavior of R837 from the gel was studied. A 100 μL aliquot of the prepared R837@Gel solution (with 100 μg/mL R837) was placed into a dialysis bag (10 kd), which was then positioned at the bottom of a 10 mL test tube. After incubating the tube in a 37°C water bath, 3 mL release medium (PH 7.4 PBS) was added. Samples were centrifuged at different time points, and fresh release medium was replaced with equal amounts of the old medium. The R837 concentration was determined using an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV‐2450, Japan), followed by the in vitro release curve. R837 was conjugated with Cy5.5 via a covalent linkage between the primary amine group (‐NH 2 33 2.6 Cell Experiments To verify the safety of the gel on hypodermal cells, a transwell co‐culture system was employed for live/dead cell staining. Hypodermal cells were inoculated in the lower chamber of a transwell chamber and incubated with 500 μL of 1640 medium for 24 h. Next, 50 μL of PBS, low concentration R837 solution (5 μg/mL), high concentration R837 solution (50 μg/mL), blank gel, low concentration R837@Gel (5 μg/mL), and high concentration R837@Gel (50 μg/mL) were added to the upper chamber (pore size 8.0 μm). After 24 h of co‐incubation, the cells were transferred to the upper chamber and washed twice with PBS. The cells were then stained with FDA for 20 min and PI for 5 min. Living and dead cells were photographed under a fluorescence microscope (IM4000B, Leica, German). 2.7 In Vitro Antitumor Efficacy CT26.WT cells (1 × 10 7 2 3 n 2.8 In Vivo Antitumor Efficacy After treatment, the mice were weighed daily, and the tumor volume was measured. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was performed to observe the tumor tissue. Tumors were excised, and sections of the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and skin were embedded in paraffin wax for further analysis. The paraffin‐embedded sections were subjected to H&E staining. Representative images were captured using a microscope (IX71, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Apoptosis was evaluated through the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase‐mediated dUTP nick‐end labeling (TUNEL) assay, and K + + Dendritic cell (DC) infiltration was quantified using BD LSRFortessa flow cytometry (BD, USA) 2.9 Statistical Analysis The SPSS 22 software package (IBM, Endicott, NY, USA) was used for the statistical analysis. All results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. Multiple group comparisons were evaluated using ANOVA, and significant differences between two groups were determined using the Student's t p 3 Results 3.1 Preparation and Characterization of R837 In this study, to enhance the subcutaneous efficacy of R837 and minimize systemic clearance, an injectable amino acid hydrogel was employed as a carrier for R837. The gel (Fmoc‐Phe 3 2A 2 3 2B S1 2 34 17 2C 2D S2 FIGURE 2 Physicochemical characterization of R837@Gel. (A) Diagram of Fmoc‐Phe 3 2 3 3 −1 Viscosity analysis of the hydrogel curing process was then performed (Figure 2E 2 3 2F 3 −1 2G Furthermore, the R837 drug loading was optimized at 5% (w/w) through systematic evaluation, as this represents the optimal balance between therapeutic payload and gelation kinetics. Although higher drug loading (> 5%) significantly prolonged gelation time (from 60 min to 4 h at 10% loading) due to interference with PFL‐catalyzed self‐assembly, this optimization ensures both sufficient drug delivery capacity and clinically practical gelation characteristics, as detailed in the new Figure S3 3.2 Degradation and Release Behavior of R837 R837@Gel was expected to sustainably release R837 after in situ gel formation. The hydrogel degradation was studied in vitro (Figure 3A 3B 3C FIGURE 3 Degradation and release behavior of R837@Gel. (A) Mass‐time variation and physical photos of gel degradation in vitro.

After 0.1 mL of R837@Gel (precursor) was injected subcutaneously, well‐defined white globular gel clumps with no fluidity were observed within 2 days, indicating that the gel could be formed in mice (Figure 3D 3E 3F 3G,H 3 3.3 Safety Analysis Results of R837 Subcutaneous administration is a frequently employed method of drug delivery. However, drugs administered via this route can exhibit toxic effects on healthy cells [ 35 36 4A 4B S4 4C p FIGURE 4 Safety outcomes from comparative studies evaluating R837@Gel for hypodermal cells.

To explore the improved therapeutic effectiveness of the R837@Gel in conjunction with PD‐1, a treatment regimen was formulated (Figure 6A 6B 6C 6D 6E 6F K i 6G FIGURE 6 Therapeutic effects of R837@Gel.

R837@Gel was administered subcutaneously, followed by intravenous PD‐1 injection after 12 h, with the treatment cycle repeated every 10 days for a total of three times.

(E) Micrographs of H&E, TUNEL, and K i K i p The results suggested that direct administration of R837 may have had a limited impact on immune cells, possibly owing to its short half‐life. By encapsulating R837 in a gel, we were able to address the issue of rapid subcutaneous metabolism, prolong the duration of action of R837, and markedly enhance the efficacy of PD‐1 therapy. 3.6 Effects of R837 R837, released from R837@Gel, was supposed to increase the proliferation of T cells through a series of immune regulatory mechanisms, thereby improving the immune environment around the tumor and enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy (Figure 7A 7B S7 + + p 38 + + 7C + + 7D,E p FIGURE 7 Combination of R837@Gel with PD‐1 promoted T cell proliferation.

(C) Fluorescent images of CD4 + + + + p 4 Discussion Currently, R837 has also been shown to promote the infiltration of T cells into tumors, which is essential for effective antitumor immunity [ 39 16 40 41 42 43 14 Subcutaneous administration offers several advantages, including improved patient compliance, reduced dosing frequency, and enhanced convenience. By incorporating R837 into a subcutaneous sustained‐release formulation, the drug can be gradually released into the body, providing prolonged exposure to the immune system. The sustained delivery of R837 served to prime the immune response over an extended period, thereby synergizing with PD‐1 therapy to enhance antitumor immunity. Recent reports showed that nanoparticles as carriers could effectively deliver immune adjuvants, thereby enhancing the efficacy of immunotherapy in colon cancer and other diseases [ 44 45 46 47 The development of three‐dimensional (3D) scaffolds for drug delivery has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of subcutaneous administration [ 48 49 50 + + In this study, an immune adjuvant delivery scaffold using the self‐assembly properties of amino acid hydrogels (R837@Gel) was developed successfully for enhancing immunotherapy in colon cancer. After subcutaneous injection, R837@Gel formed a hydrogel‐like component, provided adequate 3D support, and released R837 in order owing to the decomposition of amino acids. The amino acid hydrogel scaffold exhibited a favorable safety profile and could be degraded successfully. The combination of R837@Gel and PD‐1 therapy synergistically inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival in tumor‐bearing mice by enhancing CD4 + + Author Contributions  Mengfei Yin: Ling Mao: Xunlei Zhang: Jiali Ji: Li Song: Qingxia Ma: Donglin Xia: Lei Yang: Ethics Statement The experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Research Committee of Nantong University (approval number: 20220922‐329).
