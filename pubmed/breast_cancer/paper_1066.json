Drug repositioning leverages existing safety and pharmacokinetic data to expedite the identification of new indications with cost-effective benefits compared to de novo drug discovery. In this critical narrative review, we examine recent advances in computational repositioning strategies for breast cancer, focusing on network-based methods, computer-aided drug design, artificial intelligence and machine learning, transcriptomic signature matching, and multi-omics integration. We highlight key case studies that have progressed to preclinical validation or clinical evaluation. We assess comparative performance metrics, experimental validation outcomes, and real-world success rates. We also present critical methodological challenges, including data heterogeneity, bias in real-world data, and the need for study reproducibility. Our review emphasizes the importance of window-of-opportunity trials and the need for standardized data sharing and reproducible pipelines. These insights highlight the groundbreaking potential of in silico repositioning in addressing unmet needs in breast cancer therapy. drug repositioning breast cancer computational drug repositioning clinical validation “Victor Babeș” University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timișoara We would like to thank the “Victor Babeș” University of Medicine and Pharmacy Timișoara for the support provided in covering the article processing charge (APC) of this research paper. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Breast, ovarian, uterine, and prostate cancers are hormone-sensitive cancers that are responsible for a significant proportion of global cancer morbidity. Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent and life-threatening cancers worldwide, accounting for a significant portion of cancer-related deaths among women [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 The conventional drug discovery and development journey is a long, costly, and uncertain endeavor. It typically spans 10–17 years and has an average cost for 2024 of approximately USD 2.2 billion per new drug approved for clinical use [ 11 12 13 Figure 1 12 14 15 In this context, drug repositioning emerges as a powerful solution against the high failure rates of traditional drug discovery [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Drug repositioning—or drug repurposing—has evolved beyond its original focus on approved medicines [ 21 26 16 27 28 29 Section 3.2 In silico methods play a game-changer role in drug repositioning due to their great power to accelerate candidate identification by analyzing vast biological datasets. Computational drug-repositioning methods capitalize on artificial intelligence, machine learning, network pharmacology, and transcriptomics and have contributed significantly to identifying candidate drugs that entered clinical trials for testing the new indication. Computational methods can rapidly analyze large chemical, biological, and drug libraries, predict drug–target interactions, and identify molecular pathways associated with various pathologies [ 21 27 30 31 32 33 34 35 This review brings forward the latest advances in computational drug repositioning for breast cancer, emphasizing key methods such as molecular docking, network-based and machine-learning-driven approaches, and omics-based drug discover. Furthermore, we illustrate notable case studies where computational predictions led to in vitro, in vivo, or clinical validation. Our review emphasizes the strengths and limitations of computational approaches in drug repositioning for breast cancer in hastening therapeutic development. Computational approaches followed by experimental validation hold immense promise in overcoming therapy resistance and improving clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients. 2. Brief Overview of Pathophysiology and Current Treatments of Breast Cancer The heterogeneous nature of breast cancer biomarkers determines the four main groups of molecular subtypes—luminal A, luminal B, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Luminal A tumors, which are strongly estrogen (ER)- and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive, typically have a favorable prognosis and are responsive to hormone therapy. Luminal B cancers also express ERs and PRs but may co-express HER2, resulting in more aggressive behavior. HER2-enriched tumors, typically with an ER-negative status, respond well to HER2-targeted therapies. TNBC, which lacks expression of ERs, PRs, and HER2, represents the most aggressive subtype and is frequently associated with a poor prognosis [ 36 37 38 39 Adjuvant endocrine therapy is widely used in early-stage estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer to mitigate the risk of recurrence [ 40 39 40 41 Advanced or metastatic hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer is typically treated with endocrine therapy that includes selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like tamoxifen and toremifene, anti-estrogens or selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs) such as fulvestrant and elacestrant, and aromatase inhibitors like anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane, particularly in postmenopausal women [ 42 43 44 45 46 TNBC is associated with limited treatment options, frequent recurrence, and a poor prognosis. Given its lack of specific molecular targets, chemotherapy remains the primary treatment strategy, with higher rates of pathological complete response and improved outcomes compared to hormone-receptor-positive subtypes. Clinical guidelines recommend combination chemotherapic drugs, such as taxanes, anthracyclines, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and fluorouracil [ 8 3. Methods 3.1. Review Methodology We conducted a critical narrative review focused on computational drug repositioning for breast cancer. A literature search in PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science covered 2004, the year that Ashburn & Thor formalized drug repositioning [ 26 3.2. Terminology Note: Categories of Repositioning Based on a drug’s starting development/regulatory status, we distinguish three categories of drug repositioning: (i) approved drugs (conventional repositioning) [ 21 26 29 16 27 28 29 29 4. Computational Methods for Drug Repositioning Computational approaches to drug repositioning have undergone significant improvements with advances in bioinformatics, machine learning, and systems biology. The classification of these approaches can follow the primary data source or algorithmic framework used. This subsection explores key methodologies applied to hormone-dependent cancers, with a focus on breast cancer. 4.1. Network-Based Approaches Complex network science emerged as a powerful computational tool in drug repositioning, as it provides a systems-level perspective to uncover novel therapeutic applications for existing drugs [ 30 47 19 48 49 The study by Chen et al. presents a computational approach to identifying breast and prostate cancer drug candidates by analyzing a human functional linkage network. Their network-based method integrates gene mutation, gene expression, and functional connectivity to detect drug–disease target interactions. They successfully identified FDA-approved drugs for breast and prostate cancer and many drugs in clinical trials, with higher performance than comparable methods, measured by ROC/AUC. In vitro tests on five candidates revealed higher inhibitory effects than Doxorubicin in MCF7 and SUM149 breast cancer cell lines [ 50 F. Vitali et al. reported a network-based bioinformatics pipeline to identify multi-target drugs, particularly for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). They built a disease-specific protein–protein interaction network from multiple databases, employed graph-based algorithms to identify potential drug–target combinations, and applied a matrix tri-factorization data fusion technique. This pipeline rendered ranked lists of repositioning drug candidates (e.g., imatinib, L-aspartic acid, vemurafenib, hydroxyurea, azacitidine, flucytosine, and trametinib) and synergistic drug combinations (i.e., imatinib–vemurafenib, imatinib–flucytosine, and imatinib–vemurafenib–flucytosine), further confirmed by in vitro experiments [ 51 NMF-DR (non-negative matrix-factorization-based drug repurposing) is a network-based model that consists of two steps: first, it preliminary processes data by building a method of analyzing and normalizing similarity matrices and building a weighted drug–disease heterogeneous network. The second step predicts drug–disease links using an improved NMF method. The authors validated their framework on breast cancer: the first five ranked repositioning candidates—i.e., leuprolide, estramustine, flutamide, bicalutamide, and mitoxantrone—are confirmed by the literature and clinical trials [ 52 E. Jadamba and M. Shin [ 53 DRWBNCF is a neural collaborative filtering approach for drug repositioning. Using weighted bilinear graph convolution, it integrates drug–disease associations and drug–drug and disease–disease similarity networks. A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) optimized by α 54 Another network-based drug-repositioning framework identified shared treatment options for breast and prostate cancers with DNA repair deficiencies, specifically targeting the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. The method integrated multi-cancer data and applied deep cross-cancer learning to uncover key biomarkers that guided the repositioning process. Through this approach, mitoxantrone and genistein emerged as potential therapeutics capable of reversing the gene expression signature associated with HR deficiency via a novel chemotherapeutic mechanism [ 55 F. Firoozbakht et al. developed a network-based method associated with transcriptomic, genomic, and pathway data to find single or paired repositioning candidates for 10 breast cancer subtypes and TNBC. Their method recovers goserelin, an approved hormone therapy drug for breast cancer, in the top ten drugs for two distinct subtypes. This approach identifies ruxolitinib, which is already under investigation in several clinical trials, as a potential treatment for nine subtypes. In addition, the most promising drug pairs proposed for TNBC are bromocriptine combined with isradipine, emtricitabine, and etophylline clofibrate [ 56 Recent work in graph-based AI has leveraged networks of drug–drug and drug–target interactions augmented with transcriptomic signatures to predict novel indications. One notable example is GraphRepur, which applies a graph neural network to integrate LINCS gene expression profiles with STITCH interaction graphs for drug repositioning [ 57 Section 5 4.2. Computer-Aided Drug Design Methods Computer-aided drug design (CADD) employs pharmacophore modeling, virtual screening, and molecular docking for drug discovery and repositioning. While they share common principles, each technique has a distinct focus [ 58 59 60 61 61 Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is a key oncogenic transcription factor correlated with tumorigenesis and drug resistance in TNBC [ 62 A multi-step structure-based workflow was implemented to mine existing small-molecule libraries for FOXM1 binders. First, a pharmacophore model of FOXM1’s DNA-binding domain was built, and candidate compounds were docked into the predicted FOXM1 binding pocket. Top-ranked hits then underwent molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate binding stability and key interactions over time. From this pipeline, rabeprazole and pantoprazole emerged as top candidates, exhibiting predicted binding affinities in the low micromolar range. Subsequent in vitro assays in BT-20 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells confirmed, by in vitro tests, that rabeprazole and pantoprazole strongly inhibit FOXM1, reduce cell proliferation, and suppress downstream signaling in BT-20 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. These results identify pantoprazole and rabeprazole as novel FOXM1 inhibitors, highlighting their potential for repurposing in FOXM1-driven breast cancers [ 63 The structure-based drug-repositioning methodology developed by S. Majumder et al. [ 64 65 EGFR and HER2 are two key targets in cancer therapy, with lapatinib and gefitinib as the main inhibitors. In the study of [ 66 Wnt pathway antagonists remain an unmet need in oncology. Koval et al. conducted a docking-based virtual screen (AutoDock Tools) of 1100 FDA-approved compounds against the Frizzled (FZD) receptor’s ligand-binding site. The top fourteen hits were assayed in TopFlash luciferase reporter assays, identifying four that blocked Wnt3a-driven transcription. Follow-up GTP-binding and β-catenin stabilization assays revealed clofazimine as a downstream inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling. In vitro, clofazimine inhibited the Wnt pathway in HTB19 triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines [ 67 68 4.3. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Methods Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods are crucial for speeding up drug repositioning due to rapid advancements in bioinformatics and the large amount of medical data available [ 69 70 71 72 A. A. Jamali et al. [ 73 A leading example in this category is GraphRepur, which leverages a graph neural network (GNN) on drug–drug networks augmented with transcriptomic features to achieve state-of-the-art predictive performance [ 57 Section 5 Metformin has been highlighted by several EHR-mining and epidemiological ML studies as a candidate for breast cancer repositioning [ 74 Section 5 N.L. Tran et al.’s deep learning method [ 75 4.4. Transcriptomics and Gene-Signature-Based Methods Transcriptomics—the study of RNA expression profiles—plays a crucial role in drug repositioning by identifying disease-specific gene expression patterns. Gene signatures—distinct sets of differentially expressed genes associated with a disease—match existing drugs that can reverse or modulate these expression patterns. Disease gene signatures are compared with drug-induced transcriptomic profiles from public databases (e.g., CMAP) to predict new indications for approved drugs. This approach accelerates drug discovery and drug repositioning based on molecular mechanisms. Drug resistance in cancer treatment acutely requires the identification of effective therapies to improve patient outcomes. K. Yu et al. applied a rank-based pattern-matching algorithm to find compounds in CMAP that reverse drug resistance signatures. Their method predicted fulvestrant as a candidate for overcoming drug resistance; an in vitro test demonstrated that fulvestrant, combined with paclitaxel, enhanced the therapeutic response in a paclitaxel-resistant TNBC cell line (HCC-1937), overcoming resistance and surpassing the efficacy of paclitaxel alone [ 76 The study reported by F. Khanjani et al. [ 77 X. Zhou et al. [ 78 The study of [ 79 L. Li et al. [ 80 Cuproptosis is copper-induced programmed cell death [ 81 82 83 84 4.5. Multi-Omics Integration for Precision Drug Repositioning Within multi-omics integration for precision drug repositioning, stratifying patients into biologically distinct subgroups is crucial for tailoring therapies to specific molecular profiles. For example, the study of [ 85 Table 1 5. Real-World Computational Successes, Limitations, and Clinical Uptake Over the past decade, several repositioned drugs have progressed from computational prediction to preclinical or clinical evaluation in breast cancer, underscoring the translational power of in silico approaches. Table 2 Cui et al. [ 57 86 Xu et al. applied an NLP-driven ML framework to over 42165 electronic health records (EHRs) from the Mayo Clinic and Vanderbilt University; they identified a robust association between metformin use and reduced post-diagnosis mortality in breast cancer patients, even after adjusting for confounders such as smoking [ 74 87 Although metformin’s journey, from the EHR-based hypothesis to the largest prospective trial of its kind, eloquently illustrates the power of computational repositioning to generate high-quality hints, it also highlights critical translational lessons. Retrospective associations, however compelling, may not predict therapeutic efficacy without careful patient selection (e.g., metabolic phenotype, tumor subtype) or combination strategies (e.g., with immunotherapy). Ultimately, MA.32 emphasizes that thorough, prospective validation is the ultimate measure of successful repositioning. Additionally, neutral or mixed trial outcomes provide valuable insights, as informative as positive results, for enhancing future in silico pipelines. Danish health records showed a decrease in mortality among users of disulfiram for several types of cancer, including breast cancer. These real-world data findings, derived from retrospective EHR-style data, spurred interest in repositioning disulfiram [ 88 NCT03323346 89 Another example is the repositioning of propranolol for cancer, which was identified through large-scale observational studies. Perron et al. analyzed Canadian epidemiological records and reported a modest yet significant protective effect against prostate cancer in users of β-blockers [ 92 90 91 93 6. Data-Driven and Methodological Gaps Despite rapid advancements in computational drug repositioning for breast cancer, two major obstacle classes remain: shortcomings in the underlying data and limitations of the computational methods themselves. Although data-centric approaches power modern repositioning pipelines, they also introduce unique challenges, such as data heterogeneity and bias. Real-world data (RWD) repositories—whether transcriptomic archives, electronic health records (EHRs), or patient registries—differ widely in format, depth, and quality. Gene expression profiles stem from either microarray or RNA sequencing platforms, each of which has distinct dynamic ranges and annotation patterns [ 94 95 96 Deep learning and graph-based algorithms excel at uncovering non-obvious patterns but often operate as “black boxes,” without mechanistic insight, limiting clinician trust and regulatory acceptance [ 97 70 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 Standardized benchmarking suites, such as the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) datasets, open-source pipelines with containerized workflows, and increased sharing of prospective trial data will be essential to address these limitations. 7. Conclusions Drug repositioning for breast cancer has matured into a diverse landscape of computational strategies that span network analysis, structure-based modeling, machine learning, transcriptomics, and multi-omics approaches. Each method contributes unique strengths. Network centrality metrics can uncover hitherto unrecognized drug–disease connections, while molecular docking and pharmacophore modeling yield mechanistic hypotheses. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) frameworks demonstrate state-of-the-art predictive power. Real-world data analyses highlight both the promise and risks of retrospective findings. However, translational gaps remain significant. Heterogeneity in gene expression platforms and electronic health records (EHRs) coding can introduce bias, and black-box AI models challenge clinical trust and regulatory acceptance. Moreover, moving a repositioning hypothesis from in vitro or animal validation into a confirmatory clinical trial requires considerable financial, logistical, and regulatory resources; this bottleneck helps to explain the slow pace of clinical follow-through for many computational candidates. Prospective validation, particularly through adaptive or window-of-opportunity trials, will be crucial to bridge in silico predictions with patient benefits. Additionally, scientific rigor and stakeholder confidence can be increased by standardizing data pipelines, sharing reproducible code, and addressing ethical considerations. Integrating explainable AI and real-time clinical feedback loops can further refine the prioritization of candidates. By embedding computational pipelines within collaborative translational frameworks, this research area can accelerate the delivery of solid repositioning candidates to become safe, effective, and affordable breast cancer therapies.
