H3B-8800, an orally available small-molecule splicing modulator, combined with temsirolimus targeting the mTORC1 pathway, showed promising results in reducing the viability of DM CLL cells in vitro and in vivo. The observed additive effect from this combination treatment suggests a potential synergistic impact when these pathways are inhibited simultaneously. While H3B-8800 has demonstrated effectiveness in spliceosome-mutant cancers ( 41 42 Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the role of SF3B1 del Methods Sex as a biological variable. We studied both male and female animals and found similar results in both. Human samples from males and females also showed similar findings. Human samples. Peripheral blood cells were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Medium (GE Healthcare, now Cytiva). Normal B cells were isolated by immuno-magnetic negative selection with a pan–B cell isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec).

Freshly isolated spleens and bone marrow tissues were fixed in neutral formalin overnight and replaced with 70% ethanol the next day until the tissues were processed. Spleens were paraffin-embedded, and 10 μm sections were made for IHC staining. Ki67, CD5, B220, and cMYC levels were estimated by respective antibodies as reported ( 21 CLL transplant. The transplantation studies were performed on 8–12 weeks of immunodeficient recipient NSG mice using viably cryopreserved splenocytes from DM CLL or Mdr Drug treatment in vitro. Mouse CLL cells were collected from the spleen of NSG mice engrafted with CLL cells. Normal B cells are enriched by immunomagnetic beads using the method mentioned above. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 0.1% IL-4, and 0.1% 2-Mercaptoethanol and cultured in 96-well tissue culture plates (50,000 cells/100 μL).

Normal splenic B cells or CLL B cells were first enriched by a pan-B cell selection kit (Miltenyi Biotec), and total RNA was isolated from these cells using a Nucleospin RNA plus kit (MACHEREY-NAGEL). Libraries for RNA sequencing were constructed using the Stranded Total RNA Prep with Ribo-Zero Plus Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on the NovaSeq S4 platform (Illumina) using paired-end 150 bp mode. The FASTQ sequence files exported by the sequencer were checked using FastQC ( http://www.bioinformatics.bbsrc.ac.uk/projects/fastqc 43 20 44 45 2 RNA splicing analysis was performed using our previously established pipeline ( 24 46 47 48 49 Supplemental Tables 1–5 For the semiquantitative measurement of transcription, 2 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed using a high-capacity cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) with random hexamers following the manufacturer’s instructions. A total of 1 μL of cDNA was analyzed using Quant Studio qPCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and transcript levels were quantified using the 2 (–ΔΔCt) Supplemental Table 5 Tandem mass tag proteomics sample preparation, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, and data analysis. CLL and normal splenic B cells were lysed with triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and PMSF. A total of 300 μg lysates were precipitated and digested to obtain peptides. Tandem mass tag (TMT) 10-plex labeling was performed, and peptides were fractionated via basic pH reversed-phase HPLC. An 1100 pump (Agilent) equipped with a degasser and a photodiode array detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used. Peptides were subjected to a linear gradient from 3% to 25% acetonitrile in 0.125% formic acid using an Agilent 300 Extend-C18 column and were fractionated into 96 fractions. Mass spectrometry was performed using an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Proxeon EASY-nLC 1000 liquid chromatography pump (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peptides were detected (MS1) and quantified (MS3) in the Orbitrap. MS2 spectra were searched using the SEQUEST algorithm against a UniProt composite database derived from the mouse proteome containing its reversed complement and known contaminants. Peptide spectral matches were filtered to a 1% FDR using the target-decoy strategy combined with linear discriminant analysis. The detected proteins were filtered to a = 200 and an isolation specificity of 0.5. Statistical proteome analysis was performed based on the normalized intensities of the TMT-reporter ions.

Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with a protease-phosphatase cocktail (Pierce Protease and phosphatase inhibitor minitablets EDTA-free, Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 minutes at 4°C before sonication, and protein quantification was measured using BCA assay (Pierce, Thermo Fisher Scientific). A total of 20 μg protein was separated on SDS-PAGE (4%–15% Criterion Precast Gel, Bio-Rad Laboratories) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Trans-Blot Turbo nitrocellulose membranes, Bio-Rad Laboratories). Membrane strips were blocked in 5% BSA in TBS–0.1% Tween 20 and incubated overnight at 4°C with respective primary antibodies. Then, membranes were washed 3 times with TBS–0.1% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 hour with goat anti-mouse/rabbit secondary antibodies (Thermo Fisher Scientific 62-6520 and 65-6120). Subsequently, the membranes were developed for ECL detection (Clarity Western ECL substrate, Bio-Rad Laboratories) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
