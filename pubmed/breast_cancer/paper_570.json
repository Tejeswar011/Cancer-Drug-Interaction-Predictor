This study assessed whether the offer of direct letters to relatives at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) or Lynch syndrome increases GC uptake compared to family-mediated communication alone. Between 2020 and 2023, probands were randomly assigned to family-mediated disclosure (control) or family-mediated disclosure plus the offer of sending direct letters to at-risk relatives (intervention). The primary outcome was GC uptake within 12 months, measured as the proportion of eligible relatives at risk contacting a Swedish cancer genetics clinic.

This is particularly significant for PVs in BRCA1, BRCA2 PALB2 BRCA1/BRCA2 1 MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 2 3 In most European countries, no specific guidelines on risk disclosure to ARRs exist [ 4 5 7 8 9 12 13 5 14 8 15 A complementary strategy to family-mediated risk disclosure is direct contact with the ARRs by the genetic HCP, either by phone, letter, or email. Sending direct letters has been implemented as a general procedure in some countries. In Denmark, unsolicited letters have been used for decades as a method of risk disclosure to relatives at risk of Lynch syndrome [ 16 17 18 The first meta-analysis of healthcare-assisted risk disclosure to ARRs in HBOC and Lynch families reported that direct contact significantly increased uptake of GC, as compared to family-mediated risk disclosure (63% [95% CI: 49–75] vs. 35% [95% CI: 24–48]) [ 5 6 8 19 The overall aim of this prospective, multicentre, randomised study was to evaluate whether healthcare-assisted disclosure increases GC uptake in ARRs compared to family-mediated disclosure alone, focusing on high-risk cancer predisposition genes ( BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2) Subjects and methods Study context The management of genetic testing results and consequent risk information is not explicitly addressed in Swedish national legislation [ 4 Specialised healthcare investigating hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes is offered at cancer genetics clinics at Sweden’s university hospitals. All clinics were invited, and four met criteria for participation (see study protocol [ 20 Trial design and participants The DIRECT study was a pragmatic, open-label, multicentre, randomised controlled trial, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NTC04197856, with protocol previously published [ 20 BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 The inclusion criteria were (a) signed informed consent, (b) a PV in a gene associated with HBOC or Lynch syndrome, or a negative genetic screening but belonging to a family fulfilling clinical criteria for familial breast cancer or familial colorectal cancer and (c) having at least one eligible ARR, i.e. a family member with no previous contact with a cancer genetics clinic who was deemed to be recommended GC within a year. Inclusion and randomisation were done after the test results were known, but before post-test counselling. The included participants were both cancer patients who underwent genetic screening and individuals who underwent predictive testing, collectively referred to as ‘probands’ onwards. The probands were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by study site, gender, age group and family diagnosis. In this article, we report the outcomes in HBOC and Lynch syndrome families. The outcomes of the full cohort are available at our data repository. Standard care All probands received standard care according to current local clinical practice, which included post-test GC with an HCP who also encouraged family-mediated risk disclosure to ARRs. Standard care included written information produced by the different sites, and the content was largely similar across sites and over time. The printed information included details on hereditary cancer, cascade testing, risk management and contact information for cancer genetics clinics. Definition and identification of eligible ARRs At the post-test counselling session, the proband, together with the involved HCPs, identified eligible ARRs >18 years at the end of follow-up, with no previous contact with a Swedish cancer genetics clinic. The relatives who were eligible as ‘at-risk’ were adult male and female relatives who, according to the involved HCP, could be offered cascade GC and testing for the familial PV within 12 months. In general, the living ARRs with the closest (genetic) relationship to the proband were considered eligible and offered cascade GC and testing before subsequent relatives were eligible. However, more distant (non-first-degree) ARRs were considered eligible if the first-degree relative was deceased or, due to other reasons, was unavailable for cascade GC and testing. During our weekly study meetings, the involved HCP consulted the study team if they were unsure about how to define eligible ARRs, but the final decision on who to list as an eligible ARR and thus to be recommended GC within a year was up to the local HCP. Contact details of ARRs in both control and intervention groups were retrieved in collaboration between the proband and the HCP. At times, the HCP and the proband collaboratively employed official publicly available sources to identify ARRs’ contact details. Intervention Probands in the intervention group, as well as the control group, received standard care and both arms did the listing of eligible ARRs as outlined above. In addition, the intervention group was offered the service of the HCP sending a direct letter to their eligible ARRs. The proband approved or denied contact with each eligible ARR. The direct letter included information about the specific familial investigation and the possible implications for them and their family. Templates of direct letters are published in the protocol [ 20 The letters were sent ~1 month after the proband had received post-test GC. In some cases, the timing was adjusted according to the proband’s preference. If a listed ARR had already contacted the cancer genetics clinic before the distribution of letters, a letter was not sent to that specific ARR. Distribution of letters was paused before national holidays to reduce the possibility of delayed contact with an available HCP. The letters were sent via registered mail, requiring proof of identity for the recipients to retrieve the letters. The cancer genetics clinic received the letter in return, should the addressee fail to collect it within 2 weeks. Outcomes: uptake of genetic counselling in eligible at-risk relatives In this study, we used ARRs’ contact with a cancer genetics clinic as a proxy for the uptake of GC. The primary outcome was the proportion of eligible ARRs contacting a Swedish cancer genetics clinic within 12 months after the proband received post-test counselling. This follow-up period was chosen because we believe that, from a clinical perspective, the eligible ARRs should preferably have received GC within this period of time. The outcome ‘contact’ was defined as the ARR having an interaction with a Swedish cancer genetics clinic (by phone, video, electronic communication, or a physical meeting) that was documented in the ARR’s patient record or the family pedigree during the follow-up period. Outcome data were collected by the study coordinator at each site, by checking local patient data registries and/or asking the other national collaborating units if they had any registered contact with the ARR within 12 months after inclusion of the proband. Thus, all Swedish cancer genetics clinics were involved in providing data for the primary outcome. Only a few ARRs declined GC after contacting the clinics at the participating study sites (HE, AÖ, AR, personal communication). The following study-related information on ARRs was reported at the family level: total number of eligible ARRs who had a documented contact with any Swedish cancer genetics clinic within 12 months, and total number of eligible ARRs at the time of inclusion. ARRs’ gender (female and male) and degree of kinship (first-degree and more distant) were detailed. The total number of ARRs, including those who initially lacked contact details, was also reported. Difference in uptake was evaluated both for eligible ARRs (for which contact details were available, main analysis) and for all ARRs (eligible ARRs and ARRs to whom the proband lacked contact details). Psychosocial outcomes Questionnaires were administered to the probands at two time points, baseline at inclusion and ~6 months later. Questionnaires used validated instruments measuring generic health-related quality of life (RAND-36) [ 21 22 23 Statistical methods To detect a 12.5% difference in uptake of GC between groups, we estimated a need to recruit outcome data for 490 ARRs. Main outcome measures were evaluated using chi 2 P 24 Results Study population Between January 1st, 2020, and October 31st, 2023, 3325 patients were screened for eligibility at the time of offering genetic testing. When test results were available, 335 had HBOC or Lynch syndrome and at least one uninformed ARR, and 168 of those were included in the study (Fig. 1 P P 1 Fig. 1 CONSORT diagram.

Of the 295 ARRs who collected their direct letter, 192 (65%) contacted a clinic within the follow-up time. Of all ARRs who collected a letter, there was a significant difference in uptake of GC between first-degree ARRs as compared to distant ARRs (91/126 vs 101/169, P P Discussion In this randomised controlled trial, we could not demonstrate any significant difference in GC uptake in ARRs between a group offered healthcare-assisted disclosure (direct letters to ARRs) and a control group relying on standard care with family-mediated disclosure (crude uptake 71% vs. 67%, P P Observed lower GC uptake among male relatives, distant relatives, and those at risk for Lynch syndrome is consistent with previous research [ 5 6 25 Our findings align with two studies performed in a clinical genetics setting where sending direct letters had no effect on uptake of GC, including a randomised trial on inherited cardiac conditions [ 26 BRCA1/2 17 5 6 7 27 The relatively high GC uptake in both our intervention and control groups could also reflect an already effective cascade testing procedure in the Swedish healthcare system, characterised by universal access, subsidised care, and high public trust [ 28 29 10 8 4 In a qualitative study within the trial, 17 probands from both study groups were interviewed [ 30 31 In the current study, the probands in the intervention group accepted direct letters to be sent to the majority (>90%) of their ARRs (Fig. 4 26 32 33 31 34 9 35 41 Limitations and strengths Study limitations include potential selection bias, as those opposed to risk disclosure or direct letters may have declined participation. The detailed ARR listing or potential of an induced Hawthorne effect may have impacted the behaviour of the probands, and thereby the outcome in both groups. Sweden lacks baseline data on GC uptake, and future research on uptake in an unselected group of HBOC and Lynch families is warranted. The Swedish healthcare context, with tax-funded services and high-cost protection, may limit generalisability to other countries. A strength of this study is that the HCPs were involved in defining eligible ARRs. In previous studies evaluating cascade GC and testing, the definitions of eligible ARRs vary, and more coherent reporting is warranted. Often, first and second-degree relatives of the proband are considered at risk. Such a simplified definition—without a clinical assessment of the pedigree—could potentially lead to both under- and overestimation of the total number of eligible ARRs. We also think that the objective data source used for the main outcome (ARR’s health record) is a valid proxy for GC uptake as compared to the often-used subjective proband-reported data on ARRs’ uptake. One limitation is our lacking knowledge on the level of understanding and reasoning of those who did not reach out for further counselling. Evidence of the experiences of this under-studied group is limited, and future research on their reasoning is crucial. We acknowledge that the decision of only 12 months of observation time will underestimate the number of eligible ARRs, and we plan a future long-term follow-up study. Conclusions This study, the largest randomised controlled trial evaluating direct contact with ARRs to date, demonstrates that offering direct letters does not significantly increase GC uptake compared to standard family-mediated disclosure. Our findings emphasise the need for a nuanced approach to risk disclosure, recognising that a general healthcare-mediated direct contact approach is not a one-size-fits-all solution and that addressing broader healthcare barriers is crucial for improving overall GC uptake.
