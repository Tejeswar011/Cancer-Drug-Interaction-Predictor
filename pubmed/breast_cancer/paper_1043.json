This review aims to synthesise the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that connect ageing, IR, and atherosclerosis, with a particular focus on oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, and metabolic disturbances. We systematically summarise evidence demonstrating how age-related mitochondrial dysfunction promotes IR, which in turn accelerates atherosclerotic progression. Based on this integration, we conclude that the intertwined nature of these processes reveals promising therapeutic targets.

Introduction Ageing refers to the phenomenon in which the organism’s physiological and psychological adaptability to the environment decreases progressively and gradually leads to death. Ageing can be divided into two categories: physiological ageing and pathological ageing. The former refers to the process of physiological deterioration that occurs after maturity, while the latter is an age-related change caused by various external factors (including various diseases). Aging is accompanied by a gradual accumulation of cognitive and physical impairments, as well as an increased risk of developing several diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, kidney disease, hepatic steatosis, obesity-related metabolic syndrome, type I and type II diabetes, cancer, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and musculoskeletal and neurodegenerative diseases [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 In a study by López-Otín et al. [ 2 Insulin is a protein hormone secreted by pancreatic beta cells in the pancreas, stimulated by endogenous or exogenous substances such as glucose, lactose, ribose, arginine, and glucagon [ 7 8 9 10 Atherosclerosis is a chronic vascular inflammation mediated by traditional and non-traditional risk factors. It has traditionally been recognised as a cholesterol-accumulating disease caused by the retention of lipoproteins, including low-density lipoproteins (LDL), in the intima of the arteries [ 11 12 13 14 15 As we age, the process of aging contributes to IR through mechanisms such as oxidative stress, inflammation, and metabolic disorders [ 16 17 Furthermore, IR increases the synthesis of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and decreases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) due to hyperinsulinemic and lipotoxic effects, which leads to lipid metabolism disorders and vascular endothelial dysfunction. Aging-related cell cycle arrest and telomere shortening also accelerate vascular aging and increase plaque instability [ 18 This review attempts to explore the effects of ageing on IR as well as atherosclerosis, to discuss the association between IR and atherosclerosis, to summarise the results of the relevant research literature, and to draw reasonable and reliable conclusions. 2. Theories on the Mechanisms of Aging and Measures to Delay Aging 2.1. Mechanisms of Ageing Doctrine Ageing is the gradual deterioration of the body’s functions over time, affecting the whole organism, tissues, cells, and even molecules. Research has revealed that the mechanisms of ageing are so complex that no single theory can fully explain them. As a result, many ageing-related doctrines have been proposed to explore the mechanisms of ageing from various levels. These theories consider the interactions among different components to provide both theoretical and experimental foundations for efforts to slow the ageing process. 2.1.1. Somatic Cell Mutation Theory The somatic cell mutation theory was first proposed by Szilard in 1959 [ 19 20 How do somatic mutations influence the ageing process? Additionally, can the rate at which these mutations accumulate determine the lifespan of a species? Szilard proposed that the survival of somatic cells decreases at an accelerated rate as individuals age. He hypothesised that when the percentage of somatic cell survival reaches a specific threshold, the likelihood of that individual dying within a year approaches 100%. Based on this theory, he established a correlation between the percentage of somatic cell survival and the age at which an individual dies [ 20 21 22 Although the conventional wisdom is that somatic mutations arise mainly from DNA replication errors, their rate of accumulation is positively correlated with the number of cell divisions. However, Abascal’s study challenges this. Abascal et al. [ 23 24 25 Figure 1 26 2.1.2. Free Radical Theory The free radical theory of ageing was first proposed by Harman in 1965, which suggested that degenerative changes during ageing were due to the harmful effects of free radicals produced during normal cellular metabolism. Harman noted that free radicals produced during aerobic respiration lead to cumulative oxidative damage, resulting in cellular senescence and death, and pointed out the similarities between the effects of senescence and those of ionizing radiation, including mutagenesis, cancer, and severe cellular damage [ 27 28 The most common source of free radicals in biological systems is oxygen, and molecular oxygen (O 2 29 2 − 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 − 2 2 2 − 2 2 Free radicals can extract hydrogen ions (H + 2 Oxidative stress is a powerful candidate mechanism for ageing, and it is the free radical theory of ageing that emphasises the effects of oxidative stress generated during normal metabolic processes on ageing. It is hypothesised that ageing is due to an increased accumulation of damage produced by ROS that is not controlled by antioxidant defence and cellular repair mechanisms with age. In this study, Robert et al. [ 30 31 32 Figure 2 33 2.1.3. Immunological Theory As we age, the immune system gradually declines. This age-related loss of immune cell regulation alters the production of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. The accumulation of senescent immune cells contributes to various diseases commonly associated with ageing, such as neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune disorders [ 34 35 36 37 38 With increasing age, bone marrow and thymus degenerate, peripheral lymphoid organs are damaged, and immune cell subpopulations are altered, resulting in weakened resistance to disease and decreased immune function [ 39 39 40 41 42 43 2.1.4. Telomere Theory The telomere theory of senescence suggests that cellular senescence is due to the shortening of the length of telomeres at the ends of chromosomes with age. Telomeres are non-coding repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and also contain proteins that bind to DNA [ 44 45 Indeed, cells can compensate for missing portions of telomeres through the expression of telomerase. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that exhibits reverse transcriptase activity. It consists of two main components: the reverse transcriptase (TERT) and an RNA template (TERC). This enzyme plays a crucial role in adding repetitive sequences to the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, facilitating their replication. Additionally, telomerase is responsible for regulating and maintaining telomere length [ 46 Telomeres are complexes of proteins and nucleotides comprising TTAGGG repeat sequences at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, and this base sequence is universal and consistent across most species. However, telomere lengths are species-specific, ranging from 4000 to 15,000 nucleotides [ 47 48 49 Currently, the sequencing of telomere length can effectively reveal relevant mechanisms regarding cancer and ageing. The study conducted by Schmidt et al. [ 50 51 2.1.5. Neuroendocrine Theory The neuroendocrine doctrine holds that ageing is caused by hormone deficiency or defective target cell receptors. During the ageing process, the decline in the functioning of the neuroendocrine system parallels the ageing process, and the responsiveness of the body’s target cells to certain hormones or active substances is altered or markedly reduced with increasing age. Changes in the pancreas and thyroid are two of the more clinically significant changes in the ageing process. Approximately 40% of individuals between the ages of 65 and 74 years and 50% of individuals over the age of 80 years suffer from impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes, and between 5% and 10% of older women present with conditions such as decreased thyroxine and elevated thyrotropin [ 52 The senescence of endocrine glands is one of the more significant signs of the ageing process, and they age in a different chronological order. The decline of endocrine glands disrupts the endocrine hormone levels and affects each other [ 53 54 55 56 57 58 The effects of endocrine hormones such as growth hormone, thyroid hormone and sex hormones on the ageing process and related diseases and death are still being explored in depth. The downstream pathways and genetic determinants of these relevant hormones currently dominate ageing research, and genotyping the major functional factors of specific endocrine pathways may reveal the relationship between ageing and the emergence of specific outcomes [ 57 Table 1 Table 2 19 20 21 22 23 25 28 29 30 31 39 40 41 42 44 45 46 47 48 49 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 2.2. Measures to Mitigate Ageing As ageing is a complex biological process, it involves multiple mechanisms and pathways. Therefore, multiple therapeutic strategies need to be explored to slow down or even reverse the ageing process. 2.2.1. Targeting Senescent Cells Senescent cells are those that have ceased to divide but remain alive. They secrete pro-inflammatory factors known as SASPs, which contribute to a decline in tissue function. Therefore, removing these cells can slow down ageing to some extent. Currently, related studies develop transgenic INK-ATTAC mouse models that alleviate age-related phenotypes by selectively removing high p16-expressing cells from pregnant mice [ 59 60 Extracellular targets as well as immune-mediated clearance are also effective approaches to remove senescent cells. Characterisation of senescent cells reveals unique markers that act as senescence-associated autoantigens, and these can be used for immune system-mediated hemolytic activity and clearance. Senescent cells can also be removed by combining senescent antigens in a vaccinated manner. Senescent T-cell populations accumulate in obese adipose tissue and can lead to local and systemic inflammation [ 61 2.2.2. Delayed Telomere Shortening Telomeres are protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that gradually shorten with cell division, eventually leading to cellular senescence. Maintaining telomere length may effectively slow down ageing through genetic interventions or the modulation of telomerase activity, which has been shown to reduce cellular ageing and enhance health in various model organisms [ 62 63 Telomerase gene therapy is an emerging approach that attempts to address cellular ageing by directly regulating telomerase activity in cells. In related animal experiments, telomerase gene therapy using adeno-associated viral expression of TERT significantly improved health and reduced markers of ageing without increasing cancer incidence. However, telomerase gene therapy has not been tested in humans due to safety and ethical considerations. 2.2.3. Metabolic Intervention Ageing is closely related to many metabolic pathways, such as mTOR, AMPK, and insulin/IGF-1 signalling. The main function of mTOR is to enhance anabolism and inhibit catabolism, and it has emerged as a potential target for inhibition in anti-ageing therapy. mTOR forms two complexes: mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2). mTORC1 regulates cell growth and metabolism, whereas mTORC2 acts mainly as insulin/PI3K signaling [ 64 65 66 67 68 AMPK is a stress kinase that maintains cellular homeostasis by participating in energy-producing pathways while inhibiting energy-consuming pathways to balance energy in the cell. It inhibits various cellular phenomena such as autophagy, tissue stress resistance, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, inhibition of inflammatory responses and ageing [ 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a classical coenzyme that mediates many redox reactions. NAD+ also plays an important role in the regulation of NAD+-depleting enzymes, including sirtuins, poly ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), and CD38/157 exoenzymes. NAD+ biosynthesis, particularly by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and SIRT1-mediated, together regulate metabolism and circadian rhythms [ 79 80 81 82 83 2.2.4. Gut Microbiome Interventions The gut microbiota is a complex community of microorganisms that reside in the human digestive tract, including bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea. These microorganisms play a crucial role in the ageing process of the human body. As we age, the composition and function of the microbiome change, which can impact the immune system, metabolic health, neurological function, and even longevity. Inflammation is associated with a variety of diseases that develop with age, such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and chronic kidney disease. Inflammation associated with ageing may drive changes in the gut environment to some extent and changes in the microbiota. Key changes include the loss of microbial diversity, a reduction in beneficial symbiotic bacteria (such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli), and an amplification of pro-inflammatory pathogens (such as Enterobacteriaceae). Related studies indicate that compared to healthy young adults, the gut microbiota of frail elderly individuals typically exhibits significant dysbiosis. Its overall characteristics include decreased microbial diversity, weakened microbial community stability, and disrupted functional communities. At the phylum level, a common trend is the shift from an altered Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio (F/B ratio) [ 84 Ruminococcus Coprobacillus Eggerthella 85 86 Studies of older adults and hyperagenarians who have reached the extremes of ageing have shown that microbiome characteristics are associated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines [ 87 88 The association between gut microbiota and healthy ageing suggests that the microbiome may be a modifiable risk factor for health decline in older adults. Dietary interventions on the microbiome for related diseases are already available [ 89 90 91 92 93 2.2.5. Lifestyle Interventions Ageing is a complex biological process, but with scientific lifestyle interventions, it is possible to significantly slow down the progression of ageing and extend a healthy lifespan. Research has shown that a balanced diet, regular exercise, quality sleep, stress management and avoidance of risk factors such as smoking and alcohol abuse can work synergistically to reduce oxidative stress, inflammation and cellular damage and activate longevity-related pathways. Diet is one of the key factors affecting the ageing process. By adjusting dietary structure, controlling caloric intake, and optimising nutritional combinations, we can activate longevity-related pathways, reduce oxidative damage, and delay cellular ageing. Common dietary interventions include calorie restriction, alternate-day fasting, time-restricted feeding, and abstinence from imitation diets [ 94 Calorie restriction helps activate longevity-related pathways such as AMPK and SIRT1 to promote cellular repair. It also reduces free radical production and slows the decline of mitochondrial function. Related experimental animal studies have shown that calorie restriction delays brain ageing and subsequently increases insulin sensitivity. Calorie restriction is also effective in delaying sarcopenia, maintaining muscle mass, preventing age-related declines in physical activity, and reducing the metabolic costs of exercise that increase with age [ 95 Intermittent fasting, a dietary pattern of cyclically alternating eating and fasting, has been extensively studied in recent years for its relationship to ageing metabolism. Unlike calorie restriction, intermittent fasting triggers metabolic shifts and cellular stress resistance through patterns of time-restricted eating, alternate-day fasting, or cyclical fasting to slow ageing. Studies have shown that intermittent fasting can have a wide range of effects on metabolic markers and risk factors or diseases, including body fat and blood pressure. In overweight individuals, consuming a diet of about 500 kcal with relatively high protein two days per week for six months led to a reduction in abdominal fat, lower blood pressure, and increased insulin sensitivity [ 96 97 98 The Mediterranean diet is recognised as one of the healthiest eating patterns in the world. Numerous studies have confirmed its effectiveness in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cognitive decline and some cancers, and in significantly increasing healthy life expectancy. The Mediterranean diet is characterised by a predominantly plant-based diet with a high intake of fruits and vegetables, whole grains instead of refined carbohydrates, as well as legumes and nuts more than three times a week. It is also recommended to consume moderate amounts of dairy products and eggs, and reduce the intake of meat foods. Related studies have shown that unsaturated fatty acids and polyphenols, which characterise the Mediterranean diet, are the basis for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, especially in vegetable-rich diets that show lower levels of total cholesterol and lower levels of systolic blood pressure. In older adults, the Mediterranean diet reduces impaired glucose oxidation and inflammatory responses compared with dietary patterns based on saturated fatty acids [ 99 Sleep is one of the body’s most important repair mechanisms, and chronic sleep deprivation or poor quality can significantly accelerate the ageing process and affect longevity. Ageing is associated with a decrease in circadian rhythms of behaviour, including sleep. Older adults commonly exhibit decreased total sleep time, decreased sleep efficiency, increased sleep latency, increased nighttime awakenings, excessive daytime sleepiness, and increased daytime napping [ 100 101 102 Circadian rhythms deteriorate with age due to a number of factors. Compared to young SCN neurons, aged SCN neurons exhibited reduced inhibitory postsynaptic potentials [ 103 104 Natural light is essential for the development of circadian rhythms to coordinate the physiology, metabolism and behaviour of most organisms. However, with the rapid development of science and technology, human beings are exposed to more and more high-energy blue light spectrum from artificial lighting. Blue light exposure is now a potential risk factor for the accumulation of retinal cellular damage and disruption of circadian rhythms. Related studies have shown that daily exposure to blue light affects a variety of phenotypes in Drosophila, including lifespan, neurodegeneration, mitochondrial physiology, energy metabolism, and neurotransmitter levels. The main effects of blue light on Drosophila observed in transcriptomics and metabolomics studies are related to neuronal function, including ageing and circadian rhythms [ 105 106 There are significant differences in the effects of blue light on different individuals, and some populations may be more sensitive to blue light due to genetic variants, manifesting as more intense photodamage, circadian rhythm disruption, or metabolic abnormalities. MTNR1B is a key regulator of melatonin receptor and blue light sensitivity, mainly expressed in the retina, pancreatic β-cells, adipose tissue, and brain, and plays a key role in circadian regulation, glucose metabolism, and insulin secretion. Variants in this gene are strongly associated with blue light sensitivity, sleep disorders and metabolic diseases. Related studies have shown that the G risk allele in MTNR1B rs10830963 is associated with higher MTNR1B expression, leading to enhanced inhibition of insulin secretion by melatonin, impaired insulin secretion, and increased risk of type II diabetes. It also causes an increase in fasting blood sugar levels, and higher blood sugar levels can directly contribute to the development of breast cancer [ 107 108 Melatonin secretion is regulated by light, peaks at night, and directly affects the sleep–wake cycle, antioxidant defence, and immune regulation. Related studies have shown that melatonin production is reduced in patients with coronary artery disease. Melatonin administration (≤5 mg/day) was able to reduce hypertension [ 109 Table 3 59 60 62 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 3. Insulin Resistance IR is defined as a diminished response of body cells to insulin, resulting in reduced cellular utilisation of glucose, and it is a common pathological mechanism in the development of a variety of metabolism-related disorders. Insulin resistance is characterised by a diminished response to insulin stimulation in insulin-sensitive organs and tissues such as the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. It is also described as a reduction in insulin sensitivity resulting from impaired insulin signalling, stemming from a weakened response to insulin signals regulating blood glucose levels [ 110 3.1. Insulin Signaling Pathway The insulin signalling pathway is an intracellular signalling pathway responsible for the metabolism of the organism, especially in growth and survival [ 111 112 The central link between IRS proteins and the metabolic actions of insulin is through the PI3K/Akt signalling pathway. Recruitment and activation of PI3K is dependent on the binding of two SH2 structural domains in the regulatory subunit to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS proteins [ 113 114 115 The second important branch of the insulin signalling pathway is the Grb2/SOS/Ras/MAPK pathway, which functions independently of PI3K/Akt. The SH3 structural domain at the amino-terminal end of Grb2 binds to the proline-rich region of the protein (SOS). SOS is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Ras and catalyses the conversion of membrane-bound Ras from the inactive GDP-bound form (Ras-GDP) to the active GTP-bound form (Ras-GTP). Ras-GTP then interacts with and stimulates downstream effectors, which phosphorylate and activate MAPK to function [ 114 The insulin signalling pathway is directly or indirectly associated with a wide range of diseases and is expressed in a variety of tissues in vivo. In recent years, it has been found that the insulin signalling pathway is not only one of the key signalling pathways of glucose metabolism, but also its factors are involved in the regulation of bone metabolism, hepatic IR, diabetic nephropathy, and vascular ageing. The insulin signalling pathway needs more in-depth research to discover more potential connections in order to solve more health problems. Figure 3 113 114 115 3.2. Mechanisms of IR Insulin resistance is typically characterised by compensatory hyperinsulinemia. In this state, insulin target organs—such as the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle—exhibit significantly diminished insulin responsiveness, thereby preventing the hormone from exerting its physiological effects on glucose regulation. Specifically, this manifests as uninhibited hepatic gluconeogenesis, enhanced lipolysis, and impaired glucose uptake and utilisation in skeletal muscle [ 116 117 The insulin receptor is a tyrosine kinase that binds specifically to insulin and plays a key role in insulin-mediated glucose homeostasis and cell growth [ 118 119 120 Insulin acts by binding to the insulin receptor and activating downstream signalling pathways. Impaired regulation of any one of the links in each of the pathways will affect the activation of the entire pathway to varying degrees. Among the two signalling pathways of insulin, the PI3K/AKT pathway plays a role in the regulation of metabolism. In contrast, the Grb2/SOS/Ras/MAPK pathway is mainly responsible for the control of cell growth and differentiation [ 121 The development of IR is influenced by multiple interconnected pathophysiological mechanisms, in addition to the abnormal function of insulin receptors and their substrates. One significant factor in this process is chronic low-grade inflammation. Conditions such as obesity and overnutrition can lead to the excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α and IL-6, from adipose tissue. These inflammatory factors play a role in phosphorylating the IRS-1 protein at the Ser307 site by activating the JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and IKKβ (IκB kinase) signalling pathways. This activation disrupts the normal tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, ultimately impairing insulin signalling. Abnormal metabolism of free fatty acids (FFAs) plays a significant role in IR. Elevated levels of circulating FFAs activate PKCθ, which induces the phosphorylation of serine residues on IRS-1, inhibiting the activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway. Additionally, excessive FFAs enter the mitochondria, leading to an overload of β-oxidation. This process triggers the accumulation of ROS, resulting in oxidative stress and further impairing insulin signalling. Furthermore, FFAs are metabolised into ceramides, which can activate PP2A, leading to the dephosphorylation of AKT. The accumulation of FFAs can also directly interfere with insulin signalling, worsening IR. In addition, increased visceral fat is often closely associated with IR. In a state of IR, skeletal muscle and liver response to insulin is diminished, leading to decreased glucose uptake and increased gluconeogenesis in the liver, which in turn raises blood glucose levels. A number of genetic variants have also been associated with the risk of IR, and genetic factors may influence the distribution of fat, the ability to secrete insulin, and the sensitivity of cells to insulin. Abnormal secretion of hormones may also cause or aggravate IR to a certain extent, and lifestyle factors such as unhealthy diet, lack of exercise and sleep deprivation can also significantly affect insulin sensitivity. Overall, IR is the result of a multifactorial interaction involving endocrine, metabolic, genetic and environmental aspects. 3.3. IR Related Diseases IR may cause a variety of diseases, not only elevating blood glucose and lipids, but also affecting nutrient metabolism. IR is the main pathologic basis of type II diabetes, and most patients with impaired glucose tolerance and type II diabetes have IR [ 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 IR is also associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart disease and stroke. The occurrence of IR can lead to problems such as dyslipidemia and elevated blood pressure, which can aggravate the burden on the heart. In the cardiovascular system, insulin myocardial signalling, which controls metabolism and other biochemical aspects of cellular function, ensures cardiomyocyte function. Insulin binds to receptors on the membranes of cardiomyocytes, activating insulin signalling molecules, specifically the substrates of IRS-1/2 and PI3K/Akt. These molecules play a crucial role in stimulating the translocation of GLUT4 and promoting glucose metabolism. To generate sufficient ATP through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, insulin also stimulates the exocytosis of GLUT4 and CD36. GLUT4 mediates glucose transport in the myocardium, whereas an increase in glucose flux from GLUT1 contributes to a decrease in the increase in GLUT4 exocytosis and an increase in GLUT4 concentration in the myocardium [ 133 IR can lead to the accumulation of fat in the liver, which in turn causes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This may progress to hepatitis, liver fibrosis and even cirrhosis. In women, IR has been linked to polycystic ovary syndrome, which may lead to irregular periods, infertility, and other endocrine disorders. Other studies suggest that IR may be associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. It may also be associated with an increased risk of certain types of cancer, such as breast and pancreatic cancer [ 134 Overall, IR is a complex state of metabolic disorders that may lead to multiple health problems. Early recognition and intervention are therefore important. Improvement of lifestyle, such as a healthy diet, moderate exercise, and maintaining an ideal body weight, is often an effective way to manage IR. 3.4. The Relationship Between Aging and IR Age-related dysfunction in insulin secretion may play a role in changes in glucose metabolism with age and may contribute to high rates of poor glucose tolerance in older populations. As ageing progresses, age-related increases in visceral adiposity and accumulation of senescent cells with inflammatory phenotypes lead to elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines. This interferes with insulin signalling, dysfunctioning the IRS-PI3K/Akt pathway, leading to impaired glucose uptake in muscle and adipocytes, reduced glycogen synthesis/storage in the liver, as well as failure to inhibit hepatic glucose production. Impaired absorption and storage of circulating lipids lead to elevated lipid levels, increased plasma levels of very low-density lipoproteins, and accelerated IR [ 135 Mitochondria regulate many cellular processes and are key elements of cellular and organismal homeostasis. With ageing, mitochondrial function deteriorates due to a variety of intertwined mechanisms, including accumulation of mtDNA mutations, insufficient protein stabilisation leading to instability of the respiratory chain complex, reduced organelle turnover, and changes in mitochondrial dynamics. These conditions impair the contribution of mitochondria to cellular bioenergy, increase ROS production, and may trigger unintended permeabilisation of the mitochondrial membrane, leading to inflammation and cell death [ 2 136 In experimental studies of animal models of ageing, such as nematodes, Drosophila, or mice, it has been observed that reduced levels of insulin or insulin signalling promote longevity and that there is a strong genetic basis for the pro-ageing effects of the insulin signalling pathway. Similarly, in humans, both hyperinsulinemia and concomitant IR are associated with an elevated risk of age-related diseases [ 137 138 139 140 141 4. Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven, multifocal, negatively combustible immunoinflammatory disease that occurs in medium- and large-sized arteries. The underlying pathologic change is the formation of plaques on the intimal surface of the artery, with lipid streaks, fibrous plaques, and atheromatous plaques. Continued aggravation of the lesion may result in secondary lesions such as calcification, atheromatous ulcer formation, thrombosis, and intraplaque haemorrhage. The aetiology and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis are complex and have not yet been fully elucidated. However, the main risk factors are hyperlipidemia, hypertension and heavy smoking, as well as diabetes mellitus, obesity, immune damage and genetic factors. 4.1. Mechanisms of Atherosclerosis The thickening of the arterial wall associated with atherosclerosis and the consequences it produces make it a very complex disease entity with many mechanisms that contribute to its production [ 142 143 Russell Ross first suggested in 1999 that atherosclerosis may be an inflammatory disease. He suggested that intimal infiltration, modification of plasma-derived lipoproteins and their primary uptake by macrophages lead to the formation of lipid-filled foam cells, which are the beginning of atherosclerotic lesions. Inflammation begins with inflammatory vesicles, which are innate immune signalling complexes that are important regulators of IL-1 family cytokine production in atherosclerosis and contribute to the vascular inflammatory response that drives the development and progression of atherosclerosis [ 144 145 146 The endothelial response plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response. Research has demonstrated that, under normal physiological conditions, the vascular endothelium exhibits antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, and vasoactive properties. These properties regulate the permeability of the vessel wall, allowing it to manage the passage of bioactive molecules in the bloodstream and maintain vascular tone by balancing the release of vasodilators and vasoconstrictors. The development of endothelial dysfunction, characterised by pro-inflammatory and vasospastic responses, leads to an abnormal increase in vascular permeability and a reduction in the bioavailability of atheroprotective nitric oxide, resulting in atherogenic formations [ 147 148 149 150 151 One of the key events in the formation of atherosclerosis is the cumulative oxidation of LDL that accumulates within plaques [ 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 Figure 4 146 147 148 149 150 151 4.2. The Relationship Between Aging and Atherosclerosis Although long-term trends in age-standardised cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity indicate a substantial decline in the burden of cardiovascular disease, the impact of population growth and ageing has resulted in a continued increase in the absolute number of people with cardiovascular disease [ 159 160 161 Another important reason for the development of atherosclerosis is the development of chronic inflammation. With the ageing process, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines increase significantly in older people. The ageing vascular lining exhibits both oxidative stress and inflammatory activation. Reactive oxygen species activate inflammatory signalling pathways, including NF-ĸB, and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines by regulating the paracrine effects of endothelial cells, leading to atherosclerosis. Senescent endothelial cells secrete inflammatory mediators and ROS. Concomitantly, retention of Ox-LDL in the arterial intima, monocyte adhesion to the endothelium, activation of NF-κB signalling, and production of extracellular vesicles are potent promoters of SASP-mediated senescence, which may play a role in atherosclerotic plaque development [ 162 4.3. Relationship Between IR and Atherosclerosis IR is a major cause of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. IR leads to a chronic low-grade inflammatory state in adipose tissue and other metabolically active tissues, causing these tissues to release a variety of inflammatory mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. These mediators attract and activate inflammatory cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, to infiltrate the vessel wall and release additional inflammatory mediators and growth factors. This stimulates the proliferation, migration and phenotypic transformation of vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to the formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaques [ 163 164 165 In a study conducted by Yi et al. [ 166 167 168 169 170 In addition, IR leads to impairment of the insulin signalling pathway and compensatory secretion of more insulin by the pancreas. High insulin levels directly stimulate the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and promote arterial wall thickening. IR also increases the release of free fatty acids, leading to increased hepatic synthesis of very low-density lipoproteins while decreasing high-density lipoproteins. Smaller and denser LDL is more easily oxidised and phagocytosed by macrophages to form foam cells, which are deposited in the vessel wall and accelerate the process of atherosclerosis. 5. Discussion This review examines changes in various bodily systems during ageing and their underlying mechanisms, with a particular focus on the pathogenesis of two representative age-related diseases: IR and atherosclerosis. By synthesising key research across the fields of ageing, metabolism, and cardiovascular disease, it reveals how ageing exacerbates IR, thereby driving the progression of atherosclerosis. Discussions of several mechanistic theories of ageing reveal disagreements and controversies surrounding each. For instance, within the somatic mutation theory, it has been observed that the accumulation of mutations may not necessarily originate from cell division. This finding underscores that ageing is a complex process involving the synergistic action of multiple mechanisms. In examining two representative age-related diseases, this review elucidates the linkages between ageing and these conditions, as well as their shared molecular pathways—including inflammatory pathways, oxidative stress pathways, and mitochondrial dysfunction. It also systematically summarises the relationship between IR and atherosclerosis, analysing specific measures to effectively delay ageing, improve IR, and prevent the progression of atherosclerosis. This provides important theoretical support for the early prevention of chronic diseases in the elderly. However, the common pathways of ageing-related diseases may simultaneously participate in multiple physiological and pathological processes. Targeting these pathways for intervention may induce side effects, potentially disrupting normal signal transduction. Research indicates that chronic inflammation is significantly more prevalent and severe among older adults with visceral obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders [ 171 IR contributes to the development of multiple diseases, with compensatory hyperinsulinemia serving as the core pathophysiological link connecting metabolic disorders to cardiovascular disease. When the PI3K-Akt pathway is inhibited, it reduces the production of nitric oxide (NO) by vascular endothelial cells. NO is a potent vasodilator that lowers blood pressure and suppresses inflammation and oxidative stress. Concurrently, hyperinsulinemia increases secretion of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor. Disruption of the balance between vasodilation and vasoconstriction leads to sustained vascular constriction and elevated blood pressure, thereby accelerating the progression of atherosclerosis. Through investigation into the mechanisms linking ageing, IR, and atherosclerosis, it has been established that developing and implementing treatment strategies to predict IR and atherosclerosis in elderly patients is of paramount importance. Relevant studies indicate that the triglyceride–glucose index (TyG) can serve as a risk biomarker for major adverse cardiovascular events [ 172 173 We have found that most current research is based on animal models or in vitro cell experiments, lacking long-term, large-scale intervention studies conducted on human populations. Due to differences between the complex physiological environment of humans and animals, the conclusions drawn are inconsistent, leading to discrepancies and controversies. For instance, experiments using mice as subjects reveal significant differences in metabolic rates, lifespan, and immune responses compared to humans. This disparity makes it challenging to directly translate specific research findings into clinical applications, complicating the clinical translation of potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, variations in genetic backgrounds, lifestyles, and environmental factors among individuals lead to differences in ageing rates and disease risks, making universal therapies difficult to apply to all populations. Current research utilises organoids or organ-on-a-chip derived from human pluripotent stem cells to simulate human ageing, thereby mitigating the limitations of animal models to some extent. Concurrently, real-time monitoring technologies based on artificial intelligence and big data platforms enable the development of personalised anti-ageing strategies tailored to individual genomes, lifestyles, and clinical data, facilitating dynamic interventions. Furthermore, we can intensify the functional exploration of existing drugs, such as insulin sensitisers—metformin, thiazolidinediones, and SGLT2 inhibitors—to investigate whether cardiovascular protection can be achieved by modulating specific pathways (e.g., inflammation suppression). Targeted research should also focus on specific points within the ageing-IR-atherosclerosis axis. Future studies aim to deepen our understanding of ageing-related diseases and mechanisms, providing a robust theoretical foundation for drug development and therapeutic strategies. This will enable the delay, prevention, or mitigation of multiple age-related conditions, ultimately achieving ageing prevention, slowing down the ageing process, and potentially even reversing biological ageing. 6. Conclusions In summary, this review systematically constructs a unified theoretical framework that integrates fragmented knowledge from gerontology, metabolic medicine, and cardiovascular medicine. It explores the relationship among ageing, IR, and atherosclerosis, concluding that the core mechanism driving their synergistic progression may be a vicious cycle induced by chronic low-grade inflammation, oxidative stress, and epigenetic alterations. This review synthesises findings across disciplines, providing a foundational theoretical basis for future mechanistic investigations and clinical translation. We further propose that future studies employ genetic screening to identify high-risk elderly populations, prioritising clinical trials that combine senescent cell clearance agents with anti-inflammatory drugs for this cohort. Furthermore, multi-omics technologies should be employed to identify novel biomarkers within the ageing-IR-atherosclerosis axis, enabling targeted research on these emerging markers. Future efforts will uncover feasible strategies to break the vicious cycle among these three factors and effectively extend healthy lifespan.

This leads to cellular telomere shortening, mitochondrial DNA mutations, and transposon activation, resulting in the accumulation of mutations and abnormalities in the functioning of key genes such as TP53 and KRAS. Consequently, this accumulation manifests as epigenetic disorders, protein homeostasis imbalance, dysregulation of essential pathways, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Ultimately, these changes lead to cell-cycle arrest, abnormal gene expression, and mutations in normal cells. The upward and downward arrows indicate increase and decrease, respectively. Figure 2 Diagram of the mechanism of the free radical doctrine of ageing Free radicals are produced through environmental exposures, such as ultraviolet light and tobacco smoke, as well as internal processes, including mitochondrial electron leakage and the activation of NADPH oxidase. These free radicals trigger lipid peroxidation, leading to the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA), DNA damage via the formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO-), and oxidative modifications of proteins. These detrimental effects ultimately result in mitochondrial dysfunction and genomic instability, which contribute to cellular aging and related diseases. Figure 3 Diagram of insulin signaling pathway Upon insulin binding to the insulin receptor, the IRS-PI3K-Akt signaling cascade is activated through a series of phosphorylation events. This leads to downstream metabolic responses, including glycogen synthesis (via GSK3β inhibition) and GLUT4 translocation (mediated by AS160 and Rab). The pathway also regulates gene transcription through key transcription factors, including FOXO1 (phosphorylated and inactivated by Akt, resulting in the suppression of PEPCK expression) and CREB (activated to promote the expression of GLUT4 and other metabolic genes). Additionally, mTORC1 activation enhances the expression of genes involved in protein and lipid synthesis. The downward arrows indicate decrease. Figure 4 Diagram of atherosclerotic mechanisms This schematic illustrates the key mechanisms linking endothelial injury to plaque formation: (1) Risk factors (hypertension, hyperglycemia, smoking, and LDL oxidation) induce endothelial dysfunction, characterized by reduced NO bioavailability (leading to vasodilatory impairment, increased monocyte adhesion, and ox-LDL infiltration); (2) Oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) uptake by macrophages via scavenger receptors (SR-A1/CD36) drives foam cell formation; (3) Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) mediates smooth muscle cell migration, collagen secretion, and fibrous cap formation, while also promoting platelet activation and thrombosis risk. Upregulation of VCAM-1 further exacerbates endothelial permeability and leukocyte recruitment. The upward and downward arrows indicate increase and decrease, respectively. metabolites-15-00613-t001_Table 1 Table 1 Mechanisms of Ageing Doctrine.
