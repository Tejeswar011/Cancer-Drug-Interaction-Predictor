Tolododekin alfa is a first-in-class anchored Interleukin 12 (IL-12) linked to aluminum hydroxide. Safety and biological activity were evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with accessible advanced solid tumours in Part 1 of a 3-part trial. The primary objectives are safety and tolerability as well as determination of the recommended dose for expansion (RDE). Secondary objectives include pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, preliminary antitumour activity, and immunogenicity. Exploratory analyses include serum and tissue biomarkers. Fifteen patients were enrolled at escalating doses of tolododekin alfa given by injection every 3 weeks. There were no dose-limiting toxicities or treatment-related serious adverse events. PK/Pharmacodynamic measurements demonstrate retention of drug in the tumour. Biological activity demonstrates increased CD8 + NCT06171750 Tolododekin alfa is an anchored interleukin-12 conjugate enhancing tumour retention. Here, this group reports a Phase 1 trial evaluating the safety and biological activity of tolododekin alfa in patients with different advanced solid tumours.

Localized delivery or tumor-targeted approaches are thought to enhance therapeutic efficacy by maximizing immune activation at the tumor site, which can promote systemic anti-tumor immunity, while minimizing systemic exposure and associated toxicities 9 10 11 12 1 12 IL-12 is produced by myeloid cells, CD4 + 13 14 13 14 + 13 14 In a Phase 1 trial, recombinant IL-12 (3–1000 ng/kg/day) was administered via intravenous (IV) bolus for 5 days every 3 weeks 15 16 17 Preclinical studies of a murine surrogate of tolododekin alfa demonstrated prolonged retention within tumors for several weeks and showed single-agent therapeutic activity across various murine tumor models without evidence of toxicity 12 + 12 18 Based on these findings, we hypothesized that tolododekin alfa would have an acceptable safety profile in human cancer patients, and PK modeling predicted drug retention locally and biological activity that would result in local IFN-γ and PD-L1 upregulation. To test this hypothesis and gather preliminary data on efficacy and quality of life, a Phase 1 trial of tolododekin alfa was conducted in patients with advanced, superficially accessible solid tumors. The data herein represent the first-in-human report of an anchored drug conjugate in patients with advanced solid tumors.

There were no DLTs reported in any patients. There were no Grade 3 or greater treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs) in any patient. In addition, no procedure-related TEAEs were observed. There was one Grade 3 SAE of soft tissue infection in a patient treated with tolododekin alfa at the 20 µg/mL cohort, which resolved with systemic antibiotics and was considered unrelated to tolododekin alfa.

Similar to observations from Cycle 1, serum concentrations after Cycle 2 remained generally low with a median across all Cohorts of 59.5 pg/mL (range, 13.8-1010 pg/mL). Significant inter- and intra-cohort variability persisted, with a trend of higher IL-12-ABP levels at doses >60 µg/mL (Fig. 1A 5 last 1B Another secondary endpoint was the immunogenicity of tolododekin alfa. The presence of circulating antidrug antibodies (ADA) against the IL-12-ABP protein was assessed at baseline and after Cycles 1 and 3. Among the first 12 patients (Cohorts 1–5), only two patients tested positive for ADA, with the positivity apparent after Cycle 3 (Supplementary Table 6 Efficacy A secondary endpoint was the assessment of preliminary clinical activity.

The goal of this modification was to mediate anti-tumor immunity without on-target, off-tumor toxicity. In this first-in-human study, tolododekin alfa was well tolerated, and there were no DLTs or Grade 3 or greater treatment-related TEAEs or SAEs. The most common treatment-related adverse events were low-grade constitutional symptoms, including fatigue, influenza-like illness, and myalgias (Table 2 3 The conjugation of IL-12 to aluminum hydroxide occurs through an electrostatic interaction mediated by negatively charged phosphates on the alum-binding peptide and hydroxyl residues on aluminum hydroxide 9 15 15 12 Evidence that the IL-12 anchored drug conjugate was retained at the tumor site was provided in the PK analyses. Following direct injection of tolododekin alfa, systemic levels of IL-12-ABP were generally very low, particularly in the first four dosing cohorts. Systemic levels were higher in cohorts after dose escalation, with the highest C max C max C max 16 C max Durable drug retention was also seen in preclinical studies of murine tolododekin alfa utilizing 125 12 19 20 The favorable safety profile supports that patients can tolerate up to 250 μg/mL of tolododekin alfa. Previous PK modeling and drug release studies have suggested that further dose escalation is unlikely to yield further drug biodistribution or improve IL-12 signaling 19 In line with the PK modeling prediction, evaluation of systemic and local pharmacodynamic biomarkers confirmed the biological activity of tolododekin alfa. Indeed, we observed a dose-dependent increase in systemic IFN-γ levels (Fig. 1C 1D + + 12 19 21 + 21 3B We also demonstrated elevated PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment with CPS scores increasing more than 2- to 3-fold in some patients. Cell population analysis suggested that PD-L1 expression was often most profound on infiltrating myeloid cells rather than on tumor cells (Supplementary Table 9 Initial results suggest that patients who were heavily pre-treated experienced clinical benefit with a disease control rate of 60%, one PR by RECIST v1.1, and another best objective PR of target lesions. The reason for limited objective responses may relate to traditional computed tomography (CT) imaging underestimating true pathologic responses, as has been reported for other local immunotherapy agents 22 23 2D 8% in the patients who completed at least four cycles of treatment. These data are also consistent with the canine IL-12 anchored drug conjugate in dogs with advanced melanoma disease control was associated with a durable overall survival benefit 19 + In summary, this Phase 1 first-in-human study demonstrated that tolododekin alfa, an IL-12 anchored drug conjugate, is well tolerated at doses up to 250 µg/mL, exhibits durable local tumor retention, induces recruitment of CD8 + Methods Patients and eligibility criteria Patient eligibility included age 18 or greater and presence of a histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy located in a superficial anatomic site (e.g., cutaneous, soft tissue, or lymph nodes). Patients had metastatic lesions and needed to exhibit progression of disease upon standard of care treatments. All patients were required to have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 criteria. In addition, patients were required to meet established cardiac, hematologic, hepatic, and renal criteria. The clinical trial was conducted in accordance with the clinical protocol (included in supplementary information), the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH, and all applicable federal and local regulatory requirements. The clinical protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) of Mass General Brigham, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, WIRB-Copernicus Group, and University Health Network Research Ethics Board at all study sites prior to patient screening. All patients were required to provide written, informed consent prior to any study procedures. The clinical protocol was registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT06171750 1 Study design The study is an open-label Phase 1 multi-center trial with the primary objective of defining the safety and tolerability of tolododekin alfa. This report describes results from Part 1 of the study, which enrolled patients with superficially accessible solid tumors (Parts 2 and 3 are ongoing and focus on patients with visceral tumors and in PD-1 resistant cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, respectively). A standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design was utilized using six independent cohorts with tolododekin alfa concentration escalation across the following doses: 2 µg/mL, 6 µg/mL, 20 µg/mL, 60 µg/mL, 120 µg/mL, and 250 µg/mL (Supplementary Fig. 7 1 Dose escalation and safety assessment The incidence and description of DLTs and TEAEs were characterized according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0. The study required that the first patient at any given dose be monitored for 21 days prior to enrollment of additional patients to confirm no DLTs. An adverse event was considered dose-limiting if it was possibly, probably, or definitely related to tolododekin alfa, occurred in the first 21 days after drug administration, and met the criteria outlined in Supplementary Table 8 Manufacture and analytical characterization of tolododekin alfa Tolododekin alfa (IL-12-ABP bulk drug substance and drug product) is expressed in a clonal Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line utilizing the leap-in transposase Ò technology (ATUM). The molecule is co-expressed with the human kinase, FAM20C, an enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of serine amino acids embedded in the C-terminal peptide (ABP) of the molecule. The phosphorylated amino acids are responsible for the binding of the IL-12-ABP to aluminum hydroxide (Alhydrogel ® 2 Drug administration Tolododekin alfa (ANK-101) is composed of two components: an IL-12 with an alum-binding peptide (designated IL-12-ABP) and aluminum hydroxide (Alhydrogel ® 1 Response assessments Responses were monitored by modified RECIST v1.1 criteria. The criteria were modified in this study to allow patients with progression to remain on study, provided that there were no significant adverse events or evidence of clinical progression (to accommodate possible pseudo-progression). Patients were evaluable for best objective response assessment provided they had baseline measurements, received at least one dose of tolododekin alfa, and had at least one post-treatment measurement. All patients were required to have baseline CT scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and any specific sites of known disease, as well as a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Follow-up imaging with CT scans every 12 weeks was also performed. Pharmacokinetic assessment Peripheral blood and tumor biopsy samples were collected pre-dose and at specified time points after tolododekin alfa injection (Supplementary Table 7 y 2 Pharmacodynamic assessments Immunogenicity assessments included characterizing the development of ADA toward IL-12-ABP in serum using classical acid-dissociation combined with a bridging ECL-based validated immunoassay. Briefly, first, the acid-dissociated serum samples and PC (anti-IL-12p70, positive control) are incubated with neutralization buffer and master mix of biotinylated IL-12-ABP and ruthenylated IL-12-ABP. An immune complex is formed between the two IL-12-ABP conjugates and the anti-IL-12-ABP antibody present in human serum samples and PCs during the incubation step. This immune complex is then captured onto a streptavidin-coated MSD plate via the Biotin-Streptavidin bond. Excess unbound conjugate complex is removed by further washing of the wells, followed by the addition of MSD 2X read buffer. The assay plate is then read using an MSD ECL plate reader. The electrochemiluminescence signal (RLU) generated during the plate reading is relative to the amount of anti-IL-12-ABP antibodies present in the PCs and samples tested. All the samples were planned for analysis in a three-tier assay, which includes screening, confirmatory, and titer assays. The serum cytokine analysis was performed using a qualified electrochemiluminescence-based 10-Plex cytokine panel assay for the determination of IFN-γ, IL-1ß, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, and TNF-α in human serum. All pro-inflammatory biomarkers are captured on an MSD U-PLEX electrochemiluminescence (ECL) plate. After the addition of conjugate and read buffer, the reaction product is detected using an MSD ECL plate reader. The ECL signal produced is relative to the amount of analyte in human serum. The concentrations of all analytes were back-calculated from the non-linear regression of their respective standard curves. For tumor biopsies, while freshly obtained biopsies were preferred, archival tissue was used as the baseline sample if the tissue was collected within 12 months of C1D1. When possible, tumor biopsies were done on both injected tumors and non-injected tumors. Paired pre-study and on-study biopsies were subsequently formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE), followed by H&E staining, and analyzed for expression of CD8 (clone C8/144B) and PD-L1 (clone 22C3 pharmDX FDA For NanoString profiling, RNA was extracted from FFPE slides, and approximately 100 ng of total RNA were run on the PanCancer IO 360™ Panel (Bruker Spatial Biology) per the manufacturer’s recommendation. Data analysis was performed via the IO 360 Data Analysis Service. P Statistical considerations Statistical methods were primarily descriptive without formal hypothesis testing. For post hoc analyses, all P P n Total enrollment in the Part 1 dose escalation was expected to be 12–36 patients based on 3 single participant dose cohorts at the lowest dose levels and up to 3 additional cohorts of 3–6 DLT-evaluable participants, depending on DLT profile at each dose level. The overall objective response was defined by standard RECIST v1.1 criteria. The best overall response (BOR) was defined as the best objective response achieved at any time and was determined for each participant. Disease control was defined as subjects who achieved the best response of complete response, PR, or SD for at least 12 weeks. Duration of SD was calculated from the start of treatment until the date when PD was documented, or the last study visit, or the end of treatment if no PD had occurred.
