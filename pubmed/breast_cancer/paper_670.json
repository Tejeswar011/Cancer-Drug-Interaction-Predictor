Osteoradionecrosis following chest wall irradiation may present with pain, infection, or pathological rib fractures.  Higher cumulative doses of radiotherapy and repeat irradiation increase the risk of osteoradionecrosis.  Conservative nonsurgical treatment modalities, such as pharmacotherapy and hyperbaric oxygen therapy, may be effective for mild-to-moderate cases of osteoradionecrosis. A 62-year-old woman presented to the Adult Radiation Late Effects Clinic with a 3-year history of left-sided lower chest wall asymmetry, tightness, and pain. Twenty-seven years prior, at age 35 years, she had been diagnosed with an early-stage cancer (pT1 [6 mm grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma with surrounding ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)], pN0 [0/17], weakly estrogen receptor [ER]–positive). She had undergone a left lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection followed by adjuvant hypofractionated radiotherapy using a Cobalt-60 unit with wedged tangents. She had received focused radiotherapy to both the left breast (4000 cGy over 16 treatments) and her breast scar (an additional 1250 cGy over 5 boost treatments). Following completion of radiotherapy, she had taken adjuvant tamoxifen for 3 months. Seventeen years later, at age 52 years, the patient had been diagnosed with a breast cancer recurrence (pT2 [multifocal 2.8 cm, 0.3 cm, and 0.3 cm grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma and at least a 4.4 cm high-grade DCIS involving all 4 quadrants with an extensive intraductal component and extensive dermal lymphovascular invasion present < 1 mm from the superior margin], pNx, ER-negative, progesterone receptor [PR]–negative, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [HER2]–positive). A prominent lymph node had been noted in the left axilla on imaging, which was unsuccessfully sampled with fine-needle aspiration and sentinel lymph node biopsy. No overt metastases had been identified on staging investigations. The patient had received a left skin-sparing mastectomy with immediate deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) reconstruction, adjuvant chemotherapy (FEC-DH [5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, docetaxel, Herceptin (trastuzumab)]), and adjuvant locoregional radiotherapy (delivered with 6 MV photons using a 4-field technique), including 4500 cGy over 25 treatments to the left chest wall and 5000 cGy over 25 treatments to the regional lymph nodes. Seven years after the patient’s breast cancer recurrence, at age 59 years, she had started developing symptoms of left chest discomfort and was subsequently referred to her oncologic reconstructive surgeon after 3 years of progressive symptoms. The patient’s clinical examination and mammogram showed no evidence of recurrence. Bone scans showed benign fractures in the left ribs with no definite evidence of bony metastasis. Computed tomography (CT) showed multiple left-sided rib fractures (second to seventh ribs) with sclerosis, cortical irregularity, and callous formation ( Figure 1 Figure 1: Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest in a 62-year-old woman, showing healing of radiation-induced rib fractures from osteoradionecrosis after left-sided breast radiotherapy. Increased healing of left-sided (A) third, (B) fifth, and (C) seventh ribs. Baseline (left) and 11-month follow-up (right) CT scans of the chest are shown. The patient was referred to the Adult Radiation Late Effects Clinic, where we started her on pentoxifylline 400 mg twice daily, vitamin E 1000 IU daily, and pravastatin 40 mg daily. She also continued with calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Treatment was well tolerated, with no signs of toxicity on her complete blood count, liver and kidney function tests, and lipid panels. She experienced improvement in pain as early as 2 weeks after starting therapy. We arranged for the patient to complete 8 weeks of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). She developed myopia during HBOT, a known adverse effect, which did not require any specific treatment beyond contact lenses. After 7 weeks of HBOT, she returned to physical activities, such as playing tennis. Repeat chest CT performed 11 months after the baseline CT chest scan showed interval healing of the third to seventh ribs, with no new lucencies or fractures ( Figure 1 Discussion Osteoradionecrosis is a rare and late effect of radiotherapy in which irradiation causes soft-tissue fibrosis and obstruction of endosseous arteries in the osteogenic layer of bone, resulting in hypovascular, hypocellular, and hypoxic bones and soft tissue. 1 1 2 1 2 The incidence of osteoradionecrosis is positively correlated with radiotherapy dosage greater than 6000 cGy. Osteoradionecrosis is most commonly diagnosed in the mandible following radiotherapy for head and neck cancers, owing to the much higher cumulative doses of radiation than those used in breast cancer radiotherapy. 2 3 2 2 Given the rarity of osteoradionecrosis in the setting of breast cancer, no universally agreed-upon guidelines exist that mandate a level of radiation at which screening should occur. However, given the increased frequency of osteoradionecrosis observed in patients receiving more than 6000 cGy, it is reasonable that patients receiving doses beyond this threshold be considered for closer monitoring of this specific complication. Several osteoradionecrosis classification systems have been developed, most of which are defined based on clinical signs (e.g., exposed bone), radiographic findings (e.g., fracture), and required therapies and response to therapies. 4 2 3 5 5 5 5 5 Our patient’s osteoradionecrosis was successfully managed conservatively with medical therapy (pentoxifylline and tocopherol) followed by HBOT, both of which are available noninvasive treatments for osteoradionecrosis at our cancer care centre. Surgical intervention was considered but was not recommended by the consulting surgeon. Pharmacotherapy involves the concurrent usage of pentoxifylline and tocopherol. 3 6 5 6 6 7 7 Introduced as a treatment modality for wound healing in the 1970s, the theorized mechanism of HBOT is the promotion of angiogenesis in hypoxic tissues. 6 8 6 In more advanced cases of osteoradionecrosis, surgical intervention may be required, consisting of complete resection and débridement of nonviable bone down to healthy bone. 1 6 9 6 9 6 9 6 9 In general, whole-breast reirradiation is avoided when possible owing to an increased risk of toxicity. Modern approaches to repeat radiation for breast cancer recurrence optimize the radiation fractionation and volume. Innovative approaches such as delivering partial breast reirradiation only to the lumpectomy cavity after repeat breast-conserving surgery by using 3D-conformal radiotherapy is an example. 10 10 Our case highlights a rare and severe complication of breast radiotherapy that responded well to conservative, nonsurgical management. With greater longevity of breast cancer survivors and increasing use of reirradiation for cancer recurrence, it is necessary to recognize and intervene against osteoradionecrosis to optimize the long-term quality of life of survivors. The section Cases presents brief case reports that convey clear, practical lessons. Preference is given to common presentations of important rare conditions, and important unusual presentations of common problems. Articles start with a case presentation (500 words maximum), and a discussion of the underlying condition follows (1000 words maximum). Visual elements (e.g., tables of the differential diagnosis, clinical features or diagnostic approach) are encouraged. Consent from patients for publication of their story is a necessity.
