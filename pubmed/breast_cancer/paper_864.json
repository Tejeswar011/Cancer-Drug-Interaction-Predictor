Methods For this study, the Austrian Health Information Survey 2019 was used. Individuals with cancer ( n t Results Self‐reported cancer was positively related with being unemployed/retired versus employed (OR 2.06, p p p p p p Conclusion Our findings suggest that gender‐related variables, rather than biological sex, are associated with sel‐reported cancer. Psychosocial gender is related to rates of self‐reported cancer. Especially, conditions involving significant caregiving responsibilities and stress are correlated with higher rates of self‐reported cancer. biological differences cancer risk gender medicine gender‐related variables sex differences pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:27.09.2025  T.

Therefore, gender‐related variables were compared between males and females with cancer. Finally, associations of gender‐related variables with rates of self‐reported cancer were assessed separately among females and males. This integrated view on biological sex and psychosocial gender aims at better characterizing individuals at risk for cancer to allow personalized cancer screening and to improve efficiency and outcomes in healthcare systems. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Study Design Data from the Austrian Health Information Survey 2019 (AT‐HIS) was used. Participants had to be over 15 years old and had to live in Austria. A total of 15,461 study participants were chosen to represent the Austrian population. Beforehand, written consent from each participant was gained by Statistik Austria. The data was obtained from Statistik Austria after an application with a project proposal. Ethics approval was gained from the ethic board of the Medical University of Vienna (1859/2019). 2.2 Study Cohorts and Disease Variables Within this database, cancer and comorbidities were self‐reported. Whether individuals suffered from cancer was asked as a binary‐response question “Do you have any malignant disease in the last 12 months?” Based on this question, individuals were further stratified by presence ( n n n n 2.3 Outcome Measures The dataset was reviewed for gender‐related and well‐established cancer risk factors. Educational level, employment status, marital status, household size, and household income were defined as gender‐related variables. Educational level was dichotomized as low/middle and high level. Employment status was originally reported as employed, unemployed, retired, and in training. Due to low frequencies of the minority outcomes, employment status was dichotomized to active employment vs. no active employment (in training, unemployment, or retirement). Marital status was divided into being single, being married/common‐in‐law, being widowed, and being divorced. Lastly, household income was reported in quintiles. Cancer‐related risk variables were defined as the binary former smoking and daily smoking variable. Moreover, consuming alcohol more than twice and four times a week was considered as a cancer‐related risk variable. Presence or absence of self‐reported depression within the last 12 months was also included. Lastly, preventive care usage was evaluated with the questions of whether individuals aged 50 years or older underwent a fecal occult blood test or colonoscopy in the last 5 years. Females aged 50 years or older, were asked whether they had a mammography in the last 12 months. From all females regardless of age, the usage of a PAP smear in the last 12 months was inquired. 2.4 Statistical Analysis Descriptive results were reported as means and standard deviations for continuous variables. Categorical variables were reported as frequencies and percentages. Further, group differences according to sex and self‐reported cancer were compared by chi‐square tests for ordinal and unpaired t‐tests for numerical variables. Logistic regression models were computed with self‐reported cancer as the outcome variable and cancer‐ and gender‐related variables as predictors, and are age adjusted. The analyses were weighted to the general population. As fecal occult blood testing, colonoscopy, and mammography are recommended in older age, the frequency of these preventive care examinations was added to an additional logistic regression model done in individuals aged 50 years and older. 3 Results 3.1 Comparing Individuals With and Without Cancer In Table 1 p p p p p 2 2 2 p p p p p p p TABLE 1 Basic characteristics.

Both shared and sex‐specific associations were found. Differences in gender‐related variables seen in individuals with cancer compared to those without cancer included higher rates of unemployment/retirement and lower rates of living single, also when adjusting for the higher age in the cancer cohort. Comparing both sexes, being widowed or divorced was only associated with cancer among women. Education level is known to promote better preventive care access and can therefore reduce risk for cancer [ 11 10 13 14 15 16 In this cohort, being unemployed/retired was correlated with higher rates of self‐reported cancer. Previous studies investigated that lower income is associated with higher risk for cancer, which is also related to being unemployed [ 10 17 18 19 Moreover, looking at the household composition, a lower risk for cancer in larger families was reported [ 20 20 21 22 22 22 13 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 32 Regarding cancer‐related factors among the total cohort, females less frequently consumed alcohol and were less likely former smokers compared to males. Further, females were more likely to have a lower BMI compared to males. Former smoking was related to having cancer in our study in the general and male cohort, but not in the female cohort, which could be explained by cancer risk and mortality in females being more strongly associated with passive than with active smoking [ 35 36 37 Nevertheless, we see a higher female participation in the used survey. Females are often more likely to respond to health‐related surveys than males, a phenomenon well documented in survey research [ 38 39 It is already known that obesity is related to various cancer types [ 40 41 Among individuals with cancer, females were more likely to be employed and single, divorced, or widowed. Currently, only a little scientific work compares gender‐related variables sex‐specifically in individuals with cancer. Nevertheless, past literature reports that the association of household size with cancer risk is stronger in males compared to females [ 22 5 Limitations Concerning limitations, our data is self‐reported, which could result in over‐ or underreporting. Second, our database did not specify the types of cancer, staging, or cancer duration. Furthermore, we incorporate socioeconomic variables as proxies for gender‐related factors, as previously acknowledged in retrospective studies [ 9 42 6 Conclusion/Implications Despite these limitations, to our knowledge, the novel aspect of this study is considering both biological sex and gender‐related variables when analyzing rates of self‐reported cancer. Our findings suggest that conditions involving significant caregiving responsibilities and stress, including unemployment/retirement, are correlated with cancer. Consequently, our study highlights the need for improved support systems for this vulnerable population in current clinical practice.
