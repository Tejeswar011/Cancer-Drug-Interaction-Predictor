Previous studies on PTSD in stroke patients mainly focus on the risk factors and possible harms caused by PTSD and use the overall score to explain the severity of PTSD. The interconnections and effects of symptoms are ignored. Network analysis is a statistical method that can discover and visualize complex relationships between multiple variables. The purpose of this study was to identify the central and core symptoms in the symptom network of PTSD in stroke patients. Methods 315 patients diagnosed with cerebral apoplexy were selected as the study objects. Symptoms of PTSD were assessed using the Event Impact Scale (IES-R). The graph Gaussian model is used to estimate the network model. To clarify the network relationship and core symptoms of PTSD in stroke patients. The network’s stability and accuracy are tested using the discard example method and non-parametric bootstrap method. Result The network analysis found that A11 (I tried not to think about it) has the most substantial relationship with I3 (Other things kept making me think about it). I6 (I thought about it when I didn’t mean to) has the most substantial relationship with I9 (Pictures about it popped into my mind). “I was jumpy and easily startled”(H10) is the core symptom of PTSD in stroke patients. The network structure is suitable for stability and accuracy tests. Conclusion It is possible to reduce the severity of PTSD in stroke patients and promote their personal growth by taking timely intervention measures according to the identified central symptoms of PTSD.

Therefore, based on NA, this study attaches importance to the interaction of PTSD symptoms in stroke patients and constructs PTSD symptom networks through symptom network analysis. Driven by data, this study presents the connection between symptoms and symptom interactions through network maps, intuitively identifies network features and core symptoms, and proposes corresponding nursing countermeasures. It provides the basis for exploring the target of psychological rehabilitation intervention and accurate symptom management. Measurement Participants This is a cross-sectional study conducted from May 2024 to May 2025 in Shandong Province, China. Clinical staff recruited participants on site, and after obtaining informed consent from eligible individuals, they quickly distributed paper versions of the questionnaire. Participants were selected based on the following criteria: (1) they were at least 18 years of age; (2) they had been diagnosed as stroke by a clinician and confirmed as stroke by neuroimaging tests such as CT or MRI; (3) Clear consciousness, able to cooperate with research; (4) Express willingness to participate in this study. Exclusion criteria: (1) a history of significant anxiety, depression, mental retardation or other serious mental illness; (2) Patients with various serious physical diseases or malignant tumors; (3) recent use of antidepressants or sedatives; (4) Experienced heavy family changes or trauma in the past six months. Ultimately, 350 stroke patients participated in the study. A total of 315 people successfully completed the questionnaire, with an effective response rate of 90%. Sociodemographic characteristics Participants self-reported their information, providing details of age, educational background, marital status, whether they were co-diabetics, whether they were co-hypertensive, etc. PTSD symptoms Weiss and Marmar ( 23 24 25 26 27 Data analysis First, the data were analyzed in the SPSS 26.0 package program. We conducted a descriptive analysis to analyze the characteristics of the participants (continuous variables: means and standard deviations (SD); categorical variables: frequencies and percentages). We computed polychoric correlations between all nodes to examine the edges of the network. Polychoric, EBIC and glasso jointly calculated the edge weight. Then, we estimated the Graphical Gaussian Model (GGM) using the graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) in combination with the Extended Bayesian Information Criterion (EBIC) model ( 20 28 28 29 20 20 20 20 Results Characteristics of the participants A total of 315 stroke participants were investigated, of which 174 (55.2%) were male stroke participants and 141 (44.8%) were female. In terms of comorbidities, 86 (27.3%) stroke participants had diabetes, and 144 (45.7%) stroke participants had hypertension. Further demographic information on the participants is shown in  Table 1  Supplementary Table S1 Table 1 Demographic characteristics of the participants (n=315).

Circles represent symptoms, with lines indicating relationships and numerical values showing connection strengths. A legend on the right explains the categories. In terms of EI centrality, network node H10 (“I was jumpy and easily startled”) has the highest EI value (1.622). This is followed by I1 (“Any reminder brought back feelings about it”) (EI value 1.288) and A22 (“ I tried not to talk about it”) (EI value 1.151).

Discussion In our study, we found that the PTSD score of stroke patients was 32.05 (SD 15.472), which was at a moderate level. Stroke patients with sudden onset and severe disease, easy to cause the body’s nervous, endocrine and immune system dysfunction. The suddenness, unpredictability, uncontrollability and severity of stroke have caused severe blows to patients both physically and psychologically, which can easily lead to PTSD in patients. We suggest conducting PTSD assessment for stroke patients at an early stage, promptly formulating and implementing care plans. Additionally, through interdisciplinary collaboration, integrating professional knowledge from fields such as psychology, neuroscience, and rehabilitation medicine, we aim to further promote research and practice on PTSD in stroke patients, thereby facilitating their mental health and overall recovery. Symptom network analysis results of this study showed that symptoms “I tried not to think about it (A11)” and symptoms “Other things kept making me think about it (I3)”, The strongest association was found between symptoms such as “I thought about it when I didn’t mean to (I6)” and “Pictures about it popped into my mind” (I9). Avoidance is a common behavior in mental illness ( 30 31 32 33 34 35 35 Among the symptoms, “I was jumpy and easily startled”(H10) showed the highest EI value. This is an effective target for the prevention, treatment and intervention of PTSD in stroke patients. Individuals who experience trauma become more sensitive to similar stimuli or triggering events, and with a heightened panic response, the patient exhibits a heightened state of alertness ( 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 5 44 48 49 Limitations Current research on NA of PTSD symptoms has primarily focused on populations such as veterans ( 50 51 Conclusion In summary, this study found the symptom network characteristics and key symptoms of PTSD in stroke patients through symptom network analysis. In future studies, preventive identification of strongly linked and key symptoms should be considered, and scientific psychological intervention measures should be developed to promote the improvement of the mental health status of stroke patients.
