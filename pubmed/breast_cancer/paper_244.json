Mechanistic studies using HuR-targeting short-activating RNAs (saRNAs) and Ceacam1-3′UTR–targeted MOs protected hepatocytes from high-oxygen stress. In a clinical cohort of 164 patients with OLT, enhanced hepatic biopsy CEACAM1/ELAVL1 CEACAM1/ELAVL1 Results Hepatic HuR-null mutation augments cytotoxic stress, leading to the loss of Ceacam1-S. We aimed to determine how graft-specific HuR signaling may affect the severity of liver injury and the cellular adaptation of Ceacam1 during temperature-dependent oxidative stress.

To gain further insight into the regulatory mechanism of Ceacam1 expression, we performed HuR loss-of-function versus gain-of-function studies in a clinically relevant humanized CEACAM1 transgene Tg(CEACAM1) mouse model. Previous studies using Tg(CEACAM1) mice on a WT Ceacam1 background demonstrated that expression of Tg(CEACAM1) serves as an effective model to study how bone marrow granulocytes bind Neisseria 19 Figure 4A Figures 4A Next, we evaluated how RNA interference–mediated loss of HuR signaling in humanized CEACAM1 hepatocytes affects the expression of CEACAM1 isoforms ( Figure 4, B–E Elavl1 Figure 4B P siElavl1 Figure 4, C and D P Figure 4E P Figure 4E P As a proof of principle, we designed saRNAs to increase HuR expression levels ( Figure 4, F–I 20 Figure 4, F and H Figure 4, G and I P Supplemental Figure 1 https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.194227DS1 When humanized Tg(CEACAM1) hepatocytes were treated with saRNAs targeting either a control promoter (saGFP) or the HuR promoter under cold stress (CS), HuR expression increased by approximately 2.6-fold (calculated as the mean of saHuR 1.25/saGFP 0.49) in response to saHuR-v2 treatment ( Figure 4J P Figure 4J Figure 4L P Figure 4, C–E Acute liver injury compromises posttranscriptional HuR regulation of Ceacam1.

Because of HUR’s posttranscriptional influence on specific target mRNAs and the role that CEACAM1-S alternative splicing plays in driving transcriptional responses and cellular adaptation to cold storage stress, we next aimed to determine whether HUR control of CEACAM1-S expression is essential during cold preservation (4°C) in 8 discarded human liver grafts that were refused due to poor quality. Demographic donor data and organ information are shown in ref. 22 Figure 8, A and B Figure 8, C and D P Figure 8E Figure 8F P ELAVL1/CEACAM1 MCP1 r TLR2 r CD154 r Figure 8G Figure 8H Discussion The present study reports on the posttranscriptional regulatory axis where the RNA-binding protein HuR stabilizes Ceacam1 mRNA to orchestrate isoform-specific dynamics critical for hepatocellular stress adaptation. Although traditionally associated with regulating mRNA stability in cancer ( 23 14 Drosophila ELAV 24 25 26 28 Since our previous study showed the expression of Ceacam1-S 5 Figure 1D Ceacam1-S Ceacam1 Figure 2C Figure 2D 29 4 Figure 2J Ceacam1 Figure 2, E–G The contribution of HuR to inflammation and disease via alternative splicing regulation remains poorly defined. In a recent study, HuR was indirectly associated with exon skipping events as part of a complex that included Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein 1 (PTBP1) and an N6-Methyladenosine-modified long intergenic noncoding RNA (LINREP) ( 30 31 Figure 4C CEACAM1 CEACAM1 Ceacam1 Figure 4, J–M 4 32 http://brp.kfshrc.edu.sa/ARED 32 Many reports describe saRNAs as safe, cost-effective, and a well-tolerated means to target undruggable genes to influence disease-relevant gene networks for therapeutic benefit ( 33 34 + 35 36 Clinical studies show how ASOs, like AMONDYS 45 (Casimersen), restore reading frame mutations in Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( 37 Ceacam1 5 cis cis Figure 6 Figure 3, G and H Figure 6 Our clinical data reveal the benefits of ELAVL1 CEACAM1 Figure 7, F–H Supplemental Table 2 ELAVL1 CEACAM1 Figure 7I CEACAM1 4 Figure 8 Figure 8C We observed that the ELAVL1/CEACAM1 MCP1 TLR2 CD154 Our study has some limitations. First, the experimental arm relied solely on HuR genetic deletion, which may not fully replicate human physiology, underscoring the need for caution when extrapolating these findings to the human context. Second, using HuR/Ceacam1 boosting small ASOs may result in off-target effects that may confound the interpretation of our mouse and human Ceacam1/CEACAM1 data. Third, the clinical arm involved exploratory analyses, examining variables with both linear regression and mediation models to see which relationships the data supported. Thus, further study will be needed to confirm these relationships. Fourth, well-controlled multicenter clinical trials are needed to bridge this gap because our OLT cohort may not have captured the dynamic range of the HuR/Ceacam1 signaling axis in patients with acute liver injury. Lastly, we did not study the dynamic crosstalk in the liver microenvironment and the influence of other hepatic cells (e.g., Kupffer, endothelial, and stellate cells). To understand how hepatocytes overexpressing Ceacam1-S influence the course of liver injuries, future studies may benefit from investigating how hepatocyte (parenchymal) Ceacam1 can modulate host (nonparenchymal) immune responses. One possibility is that hepatic Ceacam1 can promote homophilic interactions that spread across the membrane during high oxygen tension conditions. This organized spatial distribution may promote the formation of immune-regulatory clusters, which influence immune checkpoint functions and support immune cell tolerance during liver stress/injury. Indeed, Park et al. ( 38 hi 38 In conclusion, we have identified the hepatic HuR/Ceacam1 signaling axis’s regulatory function, which controls Ceacam1’s response to sterile liver inflammation. Our results provide a foundation for understanding HuR as a potential determinant of donor tissue quality in OLT recipients, with significant implications for future disease modulation and treatment strategies. Methods Supplemental Methods Sex as a biological variable. Our study examined male mice because of well-established literature and our own preliminary data demonstrating that male mice exhibit more severe liver injury in ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) models. This increased sensitivity allows for a more robust assessment of therapeutic interventions. While only 1 sex was studied, the findings are expected to be relevant to both sexes, as the molecular mechanisms investigated are conserved across sexes, though further studies in females are warranted.

This study was designed to determine the functional role of hepatic RNA binding protein HuR (Human Antigen R) and integral membrane glycoprotein, CEACAM1 (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1; CD66a) in hepatic acute liver injury in mice and humans. A power analysis, typically between 80% and 90%, was conducted to determine the minimum sample size, given the expected variability and confidence level. Previous studies were used to determine the effect of sample size. Outliers were tested using Prism statistical tests. Mice were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups for in vivo tests to minimize confounding factors such as health or environmental influences. Experimenters were blinded while scoring histological and IHC data to avoid subjective interpretation. Data availability.
