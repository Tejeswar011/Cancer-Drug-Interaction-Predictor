Highlights • Surgical removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes is recommended for many hereditary cancer syndrome carriers before menopause. • Premature surgical menopause is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. • Clinicians caring for patients with premature surgical menopause should consider cardiovascular health implications. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes Patients with pathogenic germline variants (PGVs) in BRCA1 and BRCA2 have a substantially increased lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer, estimated at up to 40 % and 18 %, respectively ( Kuchenbaecker et al., 2017 Rebbeck et al., 2002 National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 2025 When risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy is performed at the guideline-recommended ages, patients may undergo abrupt onset of menopause 10–15 years earlier than the average age of natural menopause. This surgical menopause has significant implications for both quality of life and long-term health, including adverse effects on cardiovascular health ( Gordon et al., 1978 Gordon et al., 1978 Zhu et al., 2019 Ley et al., 2017 Muka et al., 2016 Wellons et al., 2012 Hu et al., 1999 Freaney et al., 2021 Honigberg et al., 2019 Zhu et al., 2020 Parker et al., 2009 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2024 A substantial body of literature has demonstrated that women who undergo premature menopause face a significantly elevated risk of developing CVD—with risk estimates as high as two to three times greater than those who experience menopause at the average age ( Gordon et al., 1978 Zhu et al., 2019 Ley et al., 2017 Muka et al., 2016 Wellons et al., 2012 Hu et al., 1999 Freaney et al., 2021 Honigberg et al., 2019 Zhu et al., 2020 Parker et al., 2009 Gordon et al., 1978 Supplementary Materials 1 Gordon et al., 1978 Zhu et al., 2019 Ley et al., 2017 Muka et al., 2016 Wellons et al., 2012 Hu et al., 1999 Freaney et al., 2021 Honigberg et al., 2019 Zhu et al., 2020 Parker et al., 2009 Zhu et al., 2019 Ley et al., 2017 Muka et al., 2016 Wellons et al., 2012 Hu et al., 1999 Freaney et al., 2021 There is some evidence that premature surgical menopause confers a higher risk of CVD compared to naturally occurring premature menopause ( Honigberg et al., 2019 Zhu et al., 2020 Parker et al., 2009 Honigberg et al., 2019 Honigberg et al., 2019 Zhu et al., 2020 Parker et al., 2009 Zhu et al., 2020 Despite growing evidence, current guidelines lack specific recommendations for CVD screening in patients who experience premature menopause. In 2011, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) introduced sex-specific guidelines for CVD risk reduction; however, menopause was notably absent as a recognized contributor to increased CVD risk in women ( Mosca et al., 2011 El Khoudary et al., 2020 El Khoudary et al., 2020 Arnett et al., 2019 Arnett et al., 2019 In the absence of effective screening or early detection methods for ovarian cancer, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy remains a cornerstone of care for those at significantly elevated genetic risk. However, it is essential that clinicians recognize and communicate the potential long-term health implications of premature surgical menopause—including the increased risk of CVD. This risk–benefit discussion is particularly critical for patients with moderate-penetrance ovarian cancer genes, such as ATM and PALB2, where the absolute risk of developing ovarian cancer is considerably lower than that associated with high-penetrance genes like BRCA1/2. This aligns with the NCCN Guidelines which recommend that “[providers should] address bone health, cardiovascular health, psychosocial health, neurologic health, sexual health, and generalized quality-of life aspects of undergoing RRSO (risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy) ( National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 2025 National Comprehensive Cancer Network, 2025 For the primary prevention of CVD, current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend clinicians assess the 10-year risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) using a pooled cohort equation routinely for women 40 to 75 years of age, to help classify as low (10 year risk <5 %), borderline (5 % to <7.5 %), intermediate (≥7.5 % to <20 %) and high (≥20 %) risk ( Arnett et al., 2019 Grundy et al., 2019 Arnett et al., 2019 El Khoudary et al., 2020 Arnett et al., 2019 Shifren and Gass, 2014 The ACC/AHA provides guidelines on the initiation of preventative statin therapy based on 10-year ASCVD score and patient risk factors ( Grundy et al., 2019 Grundy et al., 2019 Arnett et al., 2019 Grundy et al., 2019 Grundy et al., 2019 Grundy et al., 2019 While hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is not currently recommended for the primary prevention of CVD based largely on findings from the Women’s Health Initiative, substantial evidence supports its cardioprotective effects ( Rossouw et al., 2002 Stampfer et al., 1991 Hodis and Mack, 2022 Salpeter et al., 2006 Boardman et al., 2015 Hodis et al., 2016 Stampfer et al., 1991 Hodis and Mack, 2022 Salpeter et al., 2006 Boardman et al., 2015 Hodis et al., 2016 This evidence supports the potential cardioprotective benefits of initiating HRT after risk-reducing surgery in patients who experience premature surgical menopause, and such therapy should be offered when appropriate. However, decision-making is more complex in individuals with BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants who also have a history of breast cancer. Although studies have suggested that HRT may be safe in breast cancer survivors, the HABITS trial reported an increased risk of recurrence ( Fahlén et al., 2013 Coronado et al., 2024 Holmberg et al., 2008 Bluming, 2022 To further reduce CVD risk in this population, clinicians should counsel patients on evidence-based lifestyle modifications, including dietary and physical activity interventions. The ACC/AHA recommends reducing sodium intake, increasing consumption of plant-based proteins, and adopting a Mediterranean-style diet, all of which have demonstrated CVD risk reduction ( Arnett et al., 2019 Arnett et al., 2019 Given the established association between premature surgical menopause and increased CVD risk—coupled with the absence of clear management guidelines—early referral to cardiology should be considered for appropriate risk stratification and personalized prevention planning. Additional research is needed to determine the optimal timing for cardiovascular evaluation and to inform the development of standardized guidelines for both CVD prevention and risk mitigation in patients undergoing risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy. As cancer prevention and CVD prevention are both national public health priorities, there is a critical opportunity to address the long-term health implications of surgical menopause in individuals with hereditary cancer syndromes. Multidisciplinary collaboration between gynecologists, oncologists, surgeons, and cardiologists may enhance patient outcomes by ensuring comprehensive care. In summary, early detection and prevention of CVD in patients with premature surgical menopause is essential. Patients should receive counseling on evidence-based dietary and lifestyle modifications and, if there is no medical contraindication, be offered HRT following risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy. Calculation of the 10-year ASCVD risk is recommended, with referral to a cardiologist for patients who may benefit from further evaluation, including coronary artery calcium scoring, and consideration of statin therapy for primary prevention. A coordinated, multidisciplinary approach incorporating gynecologic oncology, cardiology, nutrition, and exercise medicine has the potential to substantially improve long-term cardiovascular and overall health outcomes in women experiencing premature surgical menopause after risk-reducing surgery.
