Ren et al. performed single-cell sequencing on 12 radical prostatectomy (RP) samples from patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer, revealing multiple transcriptional programs related to metastasis in primary prostate cancer 12 13 14 To identify the reasons for poor therapeutic efficacy in HRLPC patients and to analyze the dynamic changes in tumor cells and the TME following hormonal therapy, this study included nine HRLPC patients (two newly diagnosed and untreated, seven after hormonal therapy) for single-cell sequencing. We discovered and identified a group of luminal stem-like epithelial cells (Lum stem-like) that became the predominant component of epithelial cells after hormonal therapy. This subpopulation was insensitive to hormonal therapy and exhibited high transcriptional activity of stemness-related transcription factor SOX9. Furthermore, after treatment, there was a significant increase in the proportion of stroma, such as fibroblasts and endothelial cells (ECs) in the TME. The characteristic scoring of stromal cells like CXCL14 + + + Methods Ethics declarations—ethics approval and consent to participate All studies were conducted in compliance with relevant ethical guidelines. Research protocols involving human samples were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University (202212810). Informed consent was obtained from all patients in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Detailed clinicopathological information of the patients was provided in Supplementary Table S1 Sample collection and preparation Nine patients diagnosed with prostate cancer through prostate needle biopsy and meeting the HRLPC criteria were included in this study. Seven patients received hormonal therapy with ADT plus AR signaling inhibitors before surgery. All patients underwent RP in Xiangya Hospital, Central South University. Prostate cancer tissue samples were collected based on preoperative imaging examination, needle biopsy reports, and macroscopic gross view. After sampling, tissues were immediately placed in tissue preservation medium (DMEM supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Pen-Strep) (BioConcept, 4-01F00-H), 10 μM Y-27632 (Millipore, SCM075), and 100 µg/mL Primocin (InvivoGen, ant-pm-05)) and rapidly transported on ice to the laboratory. All tissue samples were divided into four portions on ice for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), organoid culture, formalin fixation and flash freezing in liquid nitrogen for storage. Isolation and culture of PDOs PDOs were established based on previously reported protocols for prostate cancer organoid culture 15 16 Table S3 Tissue dissociation and 10x single-cell sequencing For tissues designated for scRNA-seq, enzymatic digestion was performed as described above, followed by filtration through a 40 μm cell strainer and red blood cell lysis. The resulting single-cell suspension was washed and resuspended in 100 μL adDMEM/F12, and cell concentration and viability were assessed using a Luna cell counter. Dead cells were removed based on the proportion of non-viable cells using the MACS Dead Cell Removal Kit (130-090-101), and the remaining cells were recounted. For organoids intended for scRNA-seq, they were dissociated into single cells using TrypLE (Thermo Fisher, 12604013) and subsequently counted. Both types of sequencing samples were resuspended at a concentration of 700-1200 cells/μL after cell counting. The entire mixed cell population was further analyzed without sorting or enrichment for specific cell subtypes. Sequencing and library construction were performed using the 10× Genomics Chromium Next GEM Single Cell 3ʹ Reagent Kits v3.1 according to the manufacturer's protocol. The constructed libraries were subjected to high-throughput sequencing on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 PE150 platform. All steps were performed according to the manufacturer's standard procedures. scRNA-seq data processing, data integration and cluster annotation The raw data generated from high-throughput sequencing were processed using Cell Ranger (version 8.0.1, 10x Genomics) for quality control and alignment to the reference genome (human: GRCh38). Following the initial quality control by Cell Ranger, further quality filtering was conducted using the Seurat package (version 4.0.0) 17 10 18 19 Cell clustering was performed using the FindClusters function at a resolution of 0.8. Cell types were annotated using the SingleR package (version 1.4.1) 20 Table S4 InferCNV estimation Based on gene expression level from single-cell transcriptomic data, CNV values within each chromosomal region (cutoff 0.1) were estimated by the inferCNV package (version 1.0.4) 21 22 23 Gene signatures Gene list scores were calculated by AddModuleScore function in Seurat. TCGA and CPGEA prostate cancer gene lists were obtained from previous publication by Wang et.al 13 14 24 25 Table S5 Pathway analysis For Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) analysis, Hallmark, GO and KEGG term enrichment analyses were performed using GSEA 26 http://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb 27 SCENIC analysis The SCENIC analysis was performed using the motifs database for RcisTarget and GRNboost (SCENIC version 1.2.4, and AUCell version 1.12.0) with default parameters 28 29 https://github.com/FloWuenne/scFunctions/ Pseudotime analysis by Monocle Cell differentiation trajectory inference was performed using the Monocle2 package (version 2.9.0) 30 RNA velocity analysis The spliced and unspliced reads were computed using the Python script velocy.py 31 https://github.com/velocyto-team/velocy.py 31 Cell-cell interaction analysis Intercellular ligand-receptor interaction analysis was performed using the CellChat R package (version 1.1.3) 32 Cell cycle analysis Cell cycle was predicted by the expression of \"marker gene pairs\" using the Cyclone function of the Scran package (version 1.14.3) 33 Survival analysis Survival analysis was performed using the online tool GEPIA2.0. RNA-seq and clinical data from TCGA database for prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and other malignancies were used to evaluate the association between genes or gene sets derived from specific cell states and prognosis. To assess the effect of specifically differentially expressed marker genes on tumor progression, tumor samples were divided into two groups with average expression levels of target genes above 75% and below 25%, respectively. Survival curves were plotted using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method, and statistical significance between the two groups was evaluated using the log-rank test (p-value). Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) and Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining Prostate cancer tissues or matrigel dissolved PDOs were fixed overnight in 10% neutral formalin and embedded in paraffin for sectioning. The sections were stained with H&E (BSBA-4027, ZSGB-BIO) and subjected to IHC staining using antibodies such as PSMA (ab133579, Abcam) and CHGA (TA506095, ZSGB-BIO) following standard protocols (PV-9000, ZSGB-BIO). Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) and IF staining Double or triple IF staining was performed following the standard staining protocol provided by the TSA kit (AFIHC024, AiFang Biological). The antibodies used for staining included CD4 (#25229, CST), CD8 (#98941, CST), CD56 (#99746, CST), CD31 (ab281583, Abcam), α-SMA (BM0002, Boster), COL1A1 (#72026, CST), ITGA1 (BD-PT5908, Biodragon), TROP2 (ab214488, Abcam) and SOX9 (#82630, CST). The antibodies and corresponding concentrations were detailed in Supplementary Table S6 PDOs drug screening When organoids cultured in a 24-well plate reached a size of 100-150 μm, they were dissolved using TrypLE and digested into single cells. After terminating the digestion, cell density was calculated and adjusted to 400 cells/μL in adDMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 70% Matrigel. A pre-warmed black, clear-bottom 96-well plate (Corning, #3904) was tilted, and 5 μL the cell suspension was pipetted into each well. The plate was inverted and incubated in a 37°C cell incubator for 10 min to allow the matrigel to solidify. Subsequently, 100 μL organoid culture medium (without EGF) was added to each well, and 100 μL PBS was added to the outermost wells of the plate. The growth of organoids was monitored periodically under a light microscope, and the culture medium was replaced every 2-3 days. After 7 days of culture, drug screening was initiated. For each well, 100 μL medium containing drugs or vehicle was added, with 3-5 replicates per group. The organoids were incubated with the drugs for 6 days and the growth was observed regularly using the microscope. On the 7th day post-treatment, organoid viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo ® 3D Cell Viability Assay kit (Promega). Statistics All data analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10. The significance of differences between groups was determined using the unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. All values were presented as mean ± standard deviation, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05 (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, ****p < 0.0001). Results Significant increase in stromal proportion following hormonal therapy in HRLPC patients In our constructed HRLPC cohort, the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of primary tumors in patients receiving hormonal therapy combined with RP was only around 10% (Figure 1 1 1 + + 1 1 5 Figure S1 1 Figure S1 1 1 1 Figure S1 1 Lum stem-like cells become the dominant luminal epithelial subgroup in residual tumors after hormonal therapy We performed dimensionality reduction on 13,286 epithelial cells identified from the nine primary tumor samples, resulting in 10 subclusters ( Figure S2 + + + 2 Figure S2 Figure S2 2 Figure S2 Figure S3 Figure S3 + 2 + 2 + 2 2 2 2 34 2 + We subsequently analyzed all epithelial cells in representative samples from treatment-naïve (patient 01), post-treatment CSPC (patient 08), and post-treatment CRPC (patient 03) cases separately (Figure 2 + + + 2 2 2 2 2 Fibro_CXCL14 and Fibro_SFRP4 are associated with poor prognosis in HRLPC patients A total of 11,839 fibroblasts were reclassified into six subclusters: Fibro_CSMD3, Fibro_TUBB3, Fibro_CLU, Fibro_BRINP3, Fibro_CXCL14, and Fibro_SFRP4 (Figure 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 Cell-cell communication among Lum stem-like, fibroblasts and ECs is enhanced after hormonal therapy The proportion of stromal cells increased in post-hormonal therapy samples (Figure 1 4 Figure S4 4 Figure S4 4 4 Figure S4 4 4 Figure S4 4 4 4 Figure S4 4 4 Figure S4 Decreased immune infiltration and the formation of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment post-hormonal therapy Next, we characterized the transcriptional features of immune cell populations in HRLPC patients before and after hormonal therapy.

However, existing cell lines poorly model the remaining tumor epithelial cells diversity under hormonal therapy. To elucidate the intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneity following hormonal therapy in HRLPC patients and explore subsequent treatment strategies, we optimized an established protocol to culture patient-derived prostate cancer organoids from primary lesions obtained from three HRLPC patients (Patient 01, 03, 08) who underwent RP. ScRNA-seq was performed on three organoids (ORG 01, 03, 08) (Figure 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 Molecular characteristics at single-cell resolution suggest that platinum-based chemotherapy is the treatment direction for Lum stem-like dominated patients Our previous analysis of primary tumor epithelial cells indicated that the main components of residual tumors following hormonal therapy were Lum stem-like and Lum NE + 7 Figure S5 + + 7 7 + 7 7 + 7 Figure S5 7 Figure S5 + + Discussion HRLPC patients have a high prevalence and poor prognosis in China 35 36 37 39 ScRNA-seq results of transgenic mice prostate cancer offer certain reference effect on human prostate cancer.

Currently, co-culture with PDOs requires the addition of exogenous cells 51 75 76 Since biopsy samples were primarily used for pathological diagnosis, paired longitudinal scRNA-seq analysis of samples before and after hormonal therapy was not conducted. Additionally, given the interpatient heterogeneity in prostate cancer, the data from seven post-treatment non-pCR patients may not fully represent the entire non-pCR patient population. However, this remains the largest scRNA-seq dataset of non-pCR samples after hormonal therapy from HRLPC patients to date. Conclusions In summary, our study provides a unique single-cell transcriptomic dataset of primary tumor lesions and matched organoids from non-pCR HRLPC patients after hormonal therapy, which encompasses diverse cellular components within the TME and has been validated at the organoid level. This data facilitates a deeper understanding of recurrence mechanisms in non-pCR patients following hormonal therapy and offers valuable resources to guide subsequent precision treatment.
