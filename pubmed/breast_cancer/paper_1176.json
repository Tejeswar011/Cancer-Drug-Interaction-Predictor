However, reports regarding its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are infrequent. The abundance of eccDNAs from five HCC/adjacent tissue pairs was explored using Circle-Sequencing. eccDNA PAFAH1B3 was selected as one of the objects. The effect of eccDNA PAFAH1B3 on HCC progression was determined using EdU, Transwell, and apoptosis assays. Additionally, the expressions of eccDNA PAFAH1B3, mRNA PAFAH1B3, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers were determined using RT-PCR and WB. A xenograft tumor model was established to explore the function of PAFAH1B3 in vivo, and EMT-related markers were detected using RT-PCR and IHC analyses. The abundance of eccDNA PAFAH1B3 was significantly increased in HCC cell lines after transfection with eccDNA PAFAH1B3, and promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of liver cells while inhibiting apoptosis. The levels of mRNA PAFAH1B3 were also upregulated. Furthermore, intratumoral injection of PAFAH1B3 inhibitor suppressed tumor growth, and PAFAH1B3 knockdown increased and decreased the levels of the E-cadherin and N-cadherin, respectively. Our study findings reveal that eccDNA PAFAH1B3 may promote the occurrence and development of HCC by enhancing the expression of PAFAH1B3 and regulating EMT. eccDNAs PAFAH1B3 hepatocellular carcinoma epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition Peking Union Medical College Hospital Research Funding for Postdoc A1284200 The present study was funded by the Peking Union Medical College Hospital Research Funding for Postdoc (A1284200). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) are a class of circular DNA molecules that exist independently of chromosomes [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 7 8 EccDNAs are carriers of oncogene amplification that exhibit higher chromatin accessibility than chromosomal DNA. Transcriptional regulatory factors are likely to bind to these molecules, resulting in higher transcriptional activity [ 9 10 11 Recently, the emergence of high-throughput sequencing technologies and bioinformatic methods has greatly advanced research on eccDNAs in cancer [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase 1B3 (PAFAH1B3), a catalytic subunit of PAFAH, is important for apoptosis, metastasis, and angiogenesis in cancer. PAFAH1B3 is involved in diverse cancer-related signaling pathways, including PAF and WNT, and facilitates cancer progression [ 23 24 https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov http://gepia2.cancer-pku.cn/ 25 26 This study aims to investigate the role of eccPAFAH1B3 in the progression of HCC and to examine whether si-PAFAH1B3 acts as an inhibitor of HCC progression through the EMT process. The findings may offer a novel research avenue for targeted HCC therapy. 2. Results 2.1. Expression Profiles of eccDNAs in Liver Cancer and Adjacent Non-Cancerous Tissues In total, 91,971 eccDNAs (49,607 in liver cancer tissues and 42,364 in adjacent non-cancerous tissues) were identified using Circle-seq of five liver cancer tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The lengths of the eccDNAs ranged from 35 to 9,868,462 bp (35–9,868,462 bp in liver cancer tissues, and 56–3,920,856 bp in adjacent non-cancerous tissues), with a median value of 490 bp ( Figure 1 Figure 1 n n Based on gene annotation analysis, 45,564 eccDNAs (49.54%) were mapped to protein-coding gene regions, with 24,513 and 21,051 eccDNAs in liver cancer tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues, respectively, demonstrating that the two groups did not differ significantly ( Figure 1 p Figure 1 Figure 1 2.2. Differentially Expressed eccDNAs in Liver Cancer and Adjacent Non-Cancerous Tissues Differential eccDNA expression in liver cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissues was detected using Circle-seq. In total, 3428 upregulated and 8994 downregulated eccDNAs were identified (|log2FC| > 1, p Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure 2 Table S1 Figure 2 Table S2 p Figure S1 p 2.3. Expression Quantification and Circularity Verification of eccDNA PAFAH1B3 in Tissues and Cell Lines Total DNA was extracted from five liver cancer tissue samples, rolling-circle amplification was performed, and the linear DNA was removed. The expression levels of eccDNA PAFAH1B3 in tissues were detected using qPCR. The results showed that eccDNA PAFAH1B3 was enriched in liver cancer tissues, which is consistent with the sequencing results of this study. The upregulation of mRNA PAFAH1B3 in these tissues ( Figure 3 To validate the circularity of eccDNA PAFAH1B3, two sets of primers were designed for inward and outward PCR amplification, targeting the junction sequence of eccDNA PAFAH1B3 ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Transfection of artificially synthesized eccDNA PAFAH1B3 into the liver cancer-associated cell line Sk-Hep1 and liver cancer cell line Huh7 showed a dose-dependent effect on eccDNA PAFAH1B3 expression. Compared with the control group, the eccDNA PAFAH1B3 levels increased approximately 13-fold, 23-fold, and 25-fold in Sk-hep1 cells (1 × 10 6 p p Figure 3 6 p p Figure 3 6 2.4. The Impact of eccDNA PAFAH1B3 on Liver Cancer Cell Proliferation, Migration, Invasion, and Apoptosis To understand the impact of eccDNA PAFAH1B3 on the phenotype of liver cancer cells, synthetic eccDNA PAFAH1B3 was transfected into Sk-hep1 and Huh7 cells, followed by transcriptome sequencing. The results showed that in both cell lines, 20 and 60 genes were upregulated and downregulated, respectively (|Log2FC| > 1, p Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 In addition, we investigated the effects of eccDNA PAFAH1B3 on liver cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis using EdU, Transwell, and flow cytometry assays. SK-Hep1 and Huh7 cells were transfected with synthetic eccDNA PAFAH1B3. The qPCR results showed that compared with the control group, overexpression of eccDNA PAFAH1B3 promoted the proliferation of SH-Hep1 and Huh7 cells ( Figure 5 p Figure 5 p Figure 5 2.5.

Discussion Since the discovery of eccDNA in 1964, significant breakthroughs have been achieved in this field. Recent studies have confirmed that eccDNA is closely related to the occurrence and development of cancer [ 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Previous studies have shown that eccDNAs may affect gene expression by interfering with the transcription of specific exons [ 5 11 11 34 27 35 36 37 38 39 Tumor metastasis is a complex and multistage process that primarily encompasses the phases of invasion and dissemination [ 12 40 25 26 There has been significant progress regarding the understanding of eccDNAs; however, our understanding of eccDNAs remains insufficient, and many questions still require further investigation: What are the exact mechanisms of eccDNAs formation? Can eccDNA be transcribed and translated into regulatory factors that promote oncogenic expression? Can eccDNAs molecules serve as signaling molecules that mediate intercellular communication? These points are worthy of consideration and exploration. Hence, additional research is required to clarify the specific roles of eccDNAs carrying particular gene segments in either enhancing or repressing the expression of target genes, leading to a deeper understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of eccDNAs in cancer and thereby providing a scientific basis for disease treatment. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Clinical Specimens In this study, five pairs of HCC and para-cancerous tissues were collected in 2022 and subjected to Circle-Sequencing (Circle-seq). The clinical information of the five patients of HCC was recorded ( Table S5 4.2. Isolation, Purification, and Sequencing of eccDNAs from Liver Cancer Tissues 4.2.1. Isolation and Purification of eccDNAs This process includes cell lysis, column purification, and removal of linear DNA. Briefly, the tissue samples were homogenized, resuspended in L1 buffer (lysis buffer) containing proteinase K, and digested overnight at 50 °C. A control plasmid (pGEX-5X-2) was spiked into the sample as an internal control after complete cell lysis. The digested samples were treated with alkali and purified via a column. Subsequently, the column-purified DNA samples were digested with FastDigest MssI at 37 °C for 16 h to remove mitochondrial circular DNA. Plasmid-Safe ATP-dependent DNase was added to the samples and digested at 37 °C for 1 week, replenishing the enzyme and ATP every 24 h to completely remove residual linear DNA. The effectiveness of linear chromosomal DNA removal was determined based on the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results. Circle-seq 41: Prior to sequencing, rolling-circle amplification (RCA) and library construction were performed. The purified samples were used as templates for RCA using the RCA DNA Amplification Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). This was followed by purification using the MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). The amplified products were sonicated to fragment sizes of approximately 150 bp. Furthermore, library construction was performed using the GenSeq ® 4.2.2. Bioinformatics Analysis and Screening of Differentially Expressed eccDNAs in Liver Cancer Tissues Bioinformatics analysis: Sequencing was performed using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform to obtain raw data. Initial quality control of raw data was assessed using Q30 values. Adaptor trimming and removal of low-quality reads were performed using cutadapt (v.1.9.1) to obtain high-quality clean reads. The clean reads were then aligned to the reference genome using bwa (v0.7.12). Subsequently, circle-map (v1.1.4) was employed to identify eccDNAs across all samples. Samtools (v1.9) was used to count soft-clipped reads overlapping breakpoints as raw counts. Differential eccDNA expression analysis was performed using DESeq2 (v1.34.0) for normalization, calculation of fold-changes and p https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/ p p 4.2.3. Screening of Differentially Expressed eccDNAs We downloaded the transcriptome data for liver cancer (374 cases) and control tissues (50 cases) from the TCGA database. Differentially expressed mRNAs between liver cancer and control tissues were analyzed using the DESeq2 package in R (v4.0.3). The criteria for significant differential expression were set as |log2(fold change)| > 1 and adjusted p Figure S1 4.2.4. Quantification of eccDNA PAFAH1B3 Expression in Liver Cancer Tissues and Circularity Validation We used the outward-facing primer design strategy to target the specific junction site of eccDNA PAFAH1B3. Primers 1 and 2 are designed to be tail-to-tail for linear DNA, which prevents efficient amplification. However, if the linear DNA forms a closed circular DNA by joining the ends, primers 1 and 2 can amplify the product specific to the junction site ( Figure S3 4.2.5. Circularity Validation of eccDNA PAFAH1B3 Agarose gel electrophoresis: We performed inward and outward polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting of eccDNA PAFAH1B3 using genomic DNA, enriched eccDNAs, RCA-amplified eccDNAs, and a no-template negative control. The amplified products were subsequently analyzed using agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm the presence of eccDNA PAFAH1B3. Sanger sequencing: The amplified products covering the junction sites of eccDNA PAFAH1B3 were subjected to Sanger sequencing to accurately validate the presence of the junction sites. The circular junction sites of eccDNA PAFAH1B3 were confirmed through low-throughput Sanger sequencing, providing further evidence for the circularity of eccDNA PAFAH1B3 and validating the accuracy of high-throughput sequencing analysis in identifying eccDNA PAFAH1B3. 4.2.6. Artificial Circular DNA Synthesis We created artificial DNA circles of PAFAH1B3 by the procedure of ligase-assisted minicircle accumulation (LAMA)34. We identified the endogenous eccDNA sequence fragments of interest; then, PCR amplification primers were designed on the genome based on the start and end sites of eccDNA, and the type II restriction enzyme recognition site sequence was added. The oligonucleotide sequences sense strand (SS) and antisense strand (AS) of linker DNA were designed and synthesized; SS and AS were complementarity joined with double stranded DNA with sticky ends through high-temperature denaturation and low-temperature annealing; the amplified product was mixed with linker DNA from the same endogenous eccDNA binding site; enzyme digestion ligation cycle reaction was performed on the mixture to obtain sufficient eccDNA. Subsequently, the linear fragments were removed from the reaction system. After purification, seamless connected eccDNA in line with the endogenous sequence information can be obtained. 4.3. EdU Assays Cell proliferation was assessed using the EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Haimen, Jiangsu, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions. SK-Hep1 and Huh7 cells were seeded in 24-well plates using a density of 1 × 10^5 cells/well in a complete medium and transfected with NC, eccDNA PAFAH1B3. After incubating for 24 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and further permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min. The cells were incubated with the EdU labeling solution following instructions provided with the kit, washed with PBS to remove excess EdU, and counterstained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) to stain the DNA. The stained cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus or similar, Kita-ku, Tokyo 108-0072, Japan) using the FITC channel for EdU. 4.4. Transwell Cell Migration and Invasion Assays The migration and invasion assays were conducted utilizing Transwell plates, with or without Matrigel coating in the upper chambers. SK-Hep1 and Huh7 cells were transfected with negative control (NC) and eccDNA PAFAH1B3, and then incubated in Transwell plates for 24 h. The cells were digested with 0.25% trypsin, resuspended in a serum-free medium, and subsequently counted. A volume of 200 μL of the transfected cells was seeded into the upper chamber, while 600 μL of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added to the lower chamber. Following a 24 h incubation period, the upper chamber was washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells on the upper surface were removed using a cotton swab, and the remaining cells were fixed with anhydrous methanol and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min. Cells that migrated through the 8 μm pore membrane or invaded through the Matrigel-coated membrane were subsequently stained. 4.5. Apoptosis Assays In summary, cells were subjected to digestion using trypsin devoid of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and subsequently rinsed with ice-cold PBS. Apoptotic activity was assessed through dual staining with fluorescein allophycocyanin-conjugated Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI). Subsequently, the cell populations were quantified utilizing a flow cytometer (BD Accuri C6 Plus, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Data analysis and visualization were conducted using FlowJo software(v 10.8.1). 4.6. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription–Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction We extracted total RNA using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. A NanoDrop ND-2000 instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to evaluate the quality of the RNA samples. Total RNA was isolated, and 2 μg of it was used in reverse transcription with PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara, Dalian, China) based on the manufacturer’s protocol. Reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was conducted on the ABI Prism 7500 system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) with SYBR Green Premix Ex Taq (Takara, Dalian, China). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an internal control. The relative expression of genes was calculated using the 2-ΔΔCT method and the primers used in the experiments were purchased from S Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China) Co., Ltd. and are presented in Table S6 4.7. Western Blot Analysis Cells and tissues were treated with an appropriate volume of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Subsequently, total protein was extracted via centrifugation, and its concentration was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. Equal amounts of total protein (20 μg) were resolved by 8% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). To block nonspecific binding, the membranes were incubated with 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: PAFAH1B3 (Proteintech, Rosemont, Illinois, USA, 20564-1-AP), E-cadherin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, ab40772), N-cadherin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, ab76011), and Vimentin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK, ab92547), with the latter serving as the internal control. After washing five times with 1× TBST for 5 min each, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG) at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were washed again five times with 1× TBST for 5 min each. Protein bands were visualized using a chemiluminescence imaging system (SageCreation Science, Beijing, China) with SuperSignal™ West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). 4.8. Xenograft Tumorigenesis Fifteen specific pathogen-free (SPF)-grade male BALB/C nude mice, aged 6 to 8 weeks, were procured from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). The average weight of the animals was 15.5 g, with a range of 14.5 to 16.0 g. All nude mice were maintained under SPF conditions (TECNIPLAST S.p.A., Milan, Italy) and were randomly assigned to three experimental groups. A total of 5 × 10^6 SMMC-7721 cells were suspended in 100 μL of PBS and subcutaneously injected into the right flank of each mouse. Upon reaching a tumor volume of 100–200 mm 3 2 4.9. Immunohistochemistry Staining Paraffin-embedded sections of xenograft tumor tissues were sliced into 4 μm thick sections. These sections underwent a series of preparatory steps, including dewaxing, rehydration, antigen retrieval, and blocking. They were then incubated with antibodies targeting E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and Vimentin for 70 min at room temperature within a humidified chamber. This was followed by five washes with PBS. Subsequently, the sections were incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 20 min at room temperature and again washed five times with PBS. The sections were then stained with diaminobenzidine and counterstained with hematoxylin. Finally, the sections were dehydrated and mounted with coverslips for analysis. 4.10. Statistical Analysis The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to estimate the distribution of the data. Normally distributed continuous variables are presented as mean ± standard deviation values. Statistical significance was determined using a one-way analysis of variance test or Student’s t p p 5. Conclusions Our study provides comprehensive insights into the eccDNAs landscape of HCC and highlights the importance of these molecules in cancer biology. Identifying key eccDNAs and their association with critical oncogenes, such as PAFAH1B3, lays the groundwork for future research aimed at targeting EMT in HCC and other malignancies. As we continue to unravel the complexities of eccDNA functions, we anticipate that our findings will significantly contribute to the understanding of cancer pathogenesis and therapeutic development.
