As large amounts of Cd are emitted into the environment, it can be easily absorbed by plants and enter the food chain, thereby affecting food security ( Wang et al., 2015 Rasin et al., 2025 Butaciu et al., 2016 Guo and Chi, 2014 Haider et al., 2021 Shan et al., 2025 SYN25051 Nguyen et al., 2016 Zhao et al., 2018 Jing et al., 2023 Li et al., 2017 Tao and Lu, 2022 In previous studies, many researchers have thoroughly explored the genetic regulatory mechanisms of sorghum Zheng et al., 2024 sorghum Li et al., 2024b SbMYBHv33 sorghum Zheng et al., 2023 sorghum Feng et al., 2018 sorghum sorghum Jia et al., 2017 sorghum sorghum sorghum In this study, we first performed transcriptome sequencing and metabolome detection on glutinous sorghum sorghum sorghum 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Plant materials In this study, “HongYingZi”, a glutinous sorghum variety specifically used for liquor-making, was adopted as the experimental material. Its seeds were purchased from Guizhou Moutai Distillery (Group) Hongyingzi Agricultural Science and Technology Development Co., Ltd., and then cultivated through hydroponics in the climate chamber of the School of Food Engineering, Moutai University. After germination under hydroponic conditions, the seeds were further cultured for one week to obtain robust new shoots. To accurately simulate the nutrient environment required for the natural growth of plants, they were first cultured in Hoagland nutrient solution for another two weeks, after which control check (CK) samples were collected. It has been demonstrated in previous studies on sorghum roots that treatment with 150 μM Cd can induce abnormal growth of sorghum ( Jiao et al., 2023 2.2 RNA extraction and transcriptome sequencing Total RNA was extracted from sorghum An et al., 2024a 2.3 Transcriptome data analysis Before the transcriptome expression analysis, the raw reads are filtered by fastp software, and the filtering parameters are as follows: -length _ required = 25; -cut _ window _ size 4; -cut _ mean _ quality 15; -compression = 6 -w 50 ( Chen et al., 2018 sorghum http://sorghum.org.cn/#/downloads Bao et al., 2024 Pertea et al., 2016 sorghum Pertea et al., 2016 An et al., 2025a sorghum http://itak.feilab.net/cgi-bin/itak/index.cgi Zheng et al., 2016 2.4 Untargeted metabolomics detection All sorghum  Supplementary Table S1 All the methods alternated between full scan MS and data dependent MSn scans using dynamic exclusion. MS analyses were carried out using electrospray ionization in the positive ion mode and negative ion mode using full scan analysis over m/z 84–1250 at 35000 resolution. Additional MS settings are: ion spray voltage, 3.5 KV or 3.2 KV in positive or negative modes, respectively; Sheath gas (Arb), 30; Aux gas, 5; Ion transfer tube temperature, 320°C; Vaporizer temperature, 300°C; Collision energy, 30,40,50 V; Signal Intensity Threshold, 1*e6 cps; Top N vs Top speed, 10; Exclusion duration, 3s. The raw data acquired from mass spectrometry (MS) was converted into mzML format using ProteoWizard. Subsequently, the XCMS program was employed for peak extraction, alignment, and retention time correction. Finally, substances with an integrated identification score of over 0.5 and a coefficient of variation (CV) value less than 0.5 in quality control (QC) samples were extracted. Further, positive and negative ion modes were merged (retaining the substances with the highest qualitative grade and the smallest CV value), resulting in the final detection data. 2.5 Identification of differential metabolites and series test of cluster In order to identify the differential metabolites between different sample, Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was performed based on the OmicShare platform ( https://www.omicshare.com/ Mu et al., 2024 An et al., 2025b 2.6 Weighted gene co-expression network analysis Based on the differentially expressed genes and untargeted metabolite data mentioned above, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed using the WGCNA R package ( Langfelder and Horvath, 2008 Qiao et al., 2021 2.7 Quantitative real-time PCR Based on the results of differentially expressed genes and WGCNA, highly correlated genes were selected to evaluate their expression patterns in different sorghum eIF4α An et al., 2024b -△Ct Sudhakar Reddy et al., 2016  Supplementary Table S2 3 Results 3.1 Summary of transcriptome sequencing data To reveal the overall expression profile of sorghum genes following Cd treatment, transcriptome sequencing was first performed on samples collected at a total of eight time points: CK, 3 hours, 6 hours, 9 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours. The results of transcriptome sequencing data show that the amount of raw sequencing data for each biological replicate ranges from 5.94 Gb to 10.31 Gb. The clean reads obtained from the above data through strict filtering are between 5.93 and 10.29, and the average clean reads of each biological replicate reaches 7.32 Gb. Meanwhile, the average values of Q20, Q30, and GC_content reached 97.9%, 94.2%, and 51.6% respectively. Adequate sequencing data and good sequencing quality provide a solid foundation for the accurate analysis of gene expression levels (  Supplementary Table S3 3.2 Identification of differentially expressed genes and analysis of gene expression trends After aligning the filtered clean reads to the reference genome to obtain the expression levels of all genes, we compared the samples of TM3h, TM6h, TM12h, TM24h, TM48h, and TM72h with the CK sample respectively to identify differentially expressed genes. As shown in  Figure 1A  Supplementary Figure S1  Figure 1B  Supplementary Table S4 Figure 1 Expression patterns of sorghum (A) (B) Panel A shows six volcano plots comparing CK with various TM time points (3h, 6h, 9h, 12h, 24h, and 48h). Each plot displays gene expression changes, with log2 fold change on the x-axis and negative log10 p-value on the y-axis. Points are colored to indicate not significant, downregulated, and upregulated genes. Panel B displays a series of nine line graphs labeled 0 to 9, each in different colors, depicting trends across data points. Numbers below each graph indicate data counts. 3.3 Enrichment analysis of differential genes and identification of transcription factors Next, we analyzed the unique differentially expressed genes among different comparison groups using an upset plot. As can be seen from  Figure 2A sorghum  Figure 2B  Figure 2C Figure 2 Comparison and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes.

D) Seven line graphs illustrating different data patterns with numbers indicating specific values. 3.5 Content characteristics of different types of metabolites Metabolomic analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the total metabolite content among different samples, and the overall difference in the content proportion of 21 metabolite classes across all treatments was relatively small. (  Supplementary Figure S2  Figure 4A Zhu et al., 2018 Jiao et al., 2023 Zhang et al., 2024  Figure 4B Figure 4 Content characteristics of different types of metabolites. (A) (B) Panel A shows a stacked bar chart depicting various chemical components such as alcohols, alkaloids, amino acids, and others across different time points (CK, TM3h, TM6h, etc.). Each component is represented by a different color. Panel B is a heatmap displaying the abundance of specific chemical compounds over the same time points, with a color gradient from blue to red indicating low to high abundance. The x-axis lists compounds, while the y-axis lists time points. A legend is included for color reference. 3.6 WGCNA identifies genes related to amino acid metabolism To investigate the relationship between the content of amino acids and their derivatives and differential genes, we performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis using transcript expression levels and the content of 68 amino acids, which showed significant differences in different samples. The results showed that all differential genes were classified into 12 expression modules with different colors (  Figure 5  Supplementary Figure S3 sorghum Figure 5 Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of differentially expressed genes and differential amino acids and their derivatives. The color blocks on the left represent the clustering of related genes. Heatmap titled “Module–trait relationships” depicts correlations between various modules and traits. Rows represent modules in colors such as blue, turquoise, and black, with corresponding numbers. Columns show specific traits. Cells contain correlation coefficients and significance values, colored from blue (negative correlation) to red (positive correlation). To reveal the expression characteristics of these genes, based on the results of WGCNA and correlation coefficient analysis, we selected some genes with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.64 and displayed their Fragments Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped fragments (FPKM) through a heatmap (  Figure 6 SbiHYZv1_09G0000130.1 SbiHYZv1_02G0030190.1  Supplementary Table S4 Figure 6 The heatmap shows the expression characteristics (FPKM) of some genes that have a high degree of correlation with the content of amino acids and their derivatives. Heatmap showing gene expression with hierarchical clustering. Rows represent 21 genes labeled with SbiHYZv1 identifiers, and columns represent conditions labeled TM12h-1 to CK-3. Color gradient from blue to red indicates expression levels from 0.0 to 8.0. 3.7 Verification of gene expression levels by qRT-PCR To further verify the reliability of the transcriptome data and the actual expression levels of genes in the relevant modules, we randomly selected 9 representative genes for qRT-PCR validation. As shown in  Figure 7  Supplementary Table S7 SbiHYZv101G0008640.2 SbiHYZv101G0061280.1 SbiHYZv102G0012250.1 SbiHYZv1_01G0008640.2 SbiHYZv1_01G0060320.1 SbiHYZv1_01G0061280.1 SbiHYZv1_03G0006890.1 SbiHYZv1_03G0015800.1 SbiHYZv1_03G0045110.1 SbiHYZv1_03G0050820.1 SbiHYZv1_04G0038570.1 Figure 7 Quantitatively verify the expression levels of genes with a high correlation to amino acid content through qRT-PCR. Different letter combinations on the bars in the figure indicate significant differences. When the letters above any two columns are completely different, it indicates that there is a significant difference in the gene expression levels between these two groups (P<0.05). Bar charts displaying the relative expression levels of nine genes labeled with unique identifiers (e.g., SbiHYZv1_01G0008640.2) across various treatments (e.g., CK, TM3h, TM6h). Expression levels range from 0 to 1.0, with variations indicated by different letters above the bars, showing statistical differences. 4 Discussion Cd is the most serious major metal pollutant in farmland soil ( Wang et al., 2019 Liu et al., 2020 Xing et al., 2025 Zou et al., 2021 sorghum SbYS1 SbWRKY72) sorghum Jia et al., 2024 SbZIP9 SbFOMT-like Zhang et al., 2024 sorghum sorghum To reveal the genetic mechanisms and characteristics of metabolite changes in glutinous sorghum sorghum  Supplementary Table S3  Figure 1  Figure 2B  Figure 2C MYB49 bHLH101 REGULATED TRANSPORTER1 Zhang et al., 2019 Arabidopsis thaliana NAC102 WAKL11 Han et al., 2023 Both biotic and abiotic stresses can affect the metabolic characteristics of plants to varying degrees ( Wang et al., 2016 Zhao et al., 2020  Figure 3A  Figure 3B  Figure 4A  Figure 4B Zemanová et al., 2017 Zhu et al., 2018 Li et al., 2024a  Figure 5 Liao et al., 2023 Kamada et al., 2020 sorghum In addition, based on the transcriptome analysis, we also randomly selected genes with high correlation to verify their expression levels using qRT-PCR. The results showed that the expression levels of these genes were highly consistent with the transcriptome results (  Figure 7 sorghum 5 Conclusion In this study, based on transcriptome sequencing and metabolomics detection, the gene expression profile and metabolite changes of sorghum under cadmium treatment were analyzed. A total of 2299 differentially expressed genes were identified, and these genes were mainly enriched into metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and other pathways. Among the 449 differential metabolites, the most variable belonged to amino acids and their derivatives, and 12 gene modules were identified as related to their metabolism through WGCNA. These research findings reveal the regulatory basis and metabolic flux changes of sorghum in response to Cd stress, and provide a foundation and support for further research on functional genes related to metabolic synthesis or stress response.
