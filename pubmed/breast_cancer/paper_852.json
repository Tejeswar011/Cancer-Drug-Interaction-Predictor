Since their discovery, GEFs have been recognized as molecular switches that activate small GTPases by catalyzing GDP‐to‐GTP exchange, thereby playing pivotal roles in cellular signaling and homeostasis. Despite extensive research, key gaps remain in understanding the spatiotemporal regulation of GEF isoforms, their functional redundancy in disease, and the development of isoform‐specific drugs. This review examines the regulatory mechanisms and physiological roles of GEFs, highlighting their growing potential as therapeutic targets. We explore the phylogenetic classification of GEFs into major families (Ras, Rho, Rab, and ArfGEFs) and their regulatory networks, which encompass subcellular localization, posttranslational modifications, and scaffolding interactions. Special emphasis is placed on GEF–H1, a microtubule‐regulated RhoGEF, and its roles in cytoskeletal remodeling, cancer metastasis, and immune responses. We also examine GEF dysregulation in diseases like cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiovascular disorders, and assess current therapies, such as small‐molecule inhibitors and emerging PROTAC technology. This review connects GEF biology with clinical applications by combining basic research with translational insights, providing guidance for precision medicine and novel therapeutic strategies targeting GEF‐related diseases. This review comprehensively examines the regulatory mechanisms and physiological roles of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and their small GTPase substrates, highlighting their significance in cellular processes and disease pathogenesis. We discuss the classification, core regulatory mechanisms, and dysregulation of GEFs in cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and immune disorders. Additionally, we evaluate current therapeutic strategies targeting GEFs, including small‐molecule inhibitors and emerging technologies like PROTACs, providing insights for future drug development. cancer metastasis guanine nucleotide exchange factors GEF microtubule dynamics neurodegenerative diseases Rho signaling small GTPases National Natural Science Foundation of China 10.13039/501100001809 82272209 Jiangsu Provincial Medical Innovation Center Nanjing Medical University Science and Technology NMUB20230131 Nanjing Medical University 10.13039/501100007289 NMUB20230131 High Level Innovation and Entrepreneurial Research Team Program in Jiangsu 10.13039/100020761 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date October 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:27.09.2025  Z.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. This review is motivated by the need to consolidate the rapidly expanding knowledge on GEF biology, with a particular focus on GEF–H1, a microtubule‐regulated Rho GEF [ 24 25 26 To address these gaps, this review will first provide a comprehensive classification of GEF families and their coevolution with small GTPases, emphasizing structural and functional diversity. It will then delve into the core regulatory mechanisms of GEF–GTPase systems, including the structural basis of nucleotide exchange, spatiotemporal control via microtubules and membranes, and posttranslational modifications. Subsequent sections will explore the physiological functions of GEF networks in cell motility, membrane trafficking, and immune regulation, followed by an in‐depth analysis of their dysregulation in cancer, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular diseases, and immunological disorders. The review will conclude with an evaluation of current therapeutic strategies, such as small‐molecule inhibitors and emerging PROTAC technology, while outlining future research directions to overcome existing challenges. By integrating fundamental research with translational applications, this review aims to bridge the gap between GEF biology and clinical potential. The logical progression from molecular mechanisms to physiological roles and therapeutic targeting provides a cohesive framework for understanding GEFs as central regulators of cellular signaling and disease. This synthesis not only highlights the complexity of GEF–GTPase systems but also underscores their untapped potential for innovative treatments in precision medicine. 2 Classification and Evolution of GEFs and Small GTPases GEFs are a class of crucial regulatory proteins that play central roles in diverse cellular physiological processes by specifically activating small GTPases (including Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran superfamily members) [ 5 1 27 1 FIGURE 1 Small GTP protease activity cycle. GTPases function as molecular switches by cycling between an active GTP‐bound (“on”) state and an inactive GDP‐bound (“off”) state, a process regulated by GAPs (GTPase‐activating proteins) and GEFs. GAPs accelerate GTP hydrolysis, converting GTP to GDP and inorganic phosphate (Pi), thereby switching the GTPase off. In contrast, GEFs promote GDP release, enabling GTP rebinding and reactivation of the protein. These transitions involve conformational changes in the GTPase's switch regions, where GTP stabilizes an active conformation that engages downstream effectors, while GDP induces an inactive state. Figures created with BioRender.com. From the perspective of molecular classification and functional characteristics, the GEFs can be divided into multiple functional subclasses based on substrate specificity. RasGEFs (e.g., Sos1/2, RasGRF1/2, and RasGRP1‐4) primarily regulate the MAPK signaling pathway and cell proliferation/differentiation, with their mutations linked to Noonan syndrome and leukemia [ 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 1 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 1 2 FIGURE 2 Analysis of the composition and functional characteristics of key protein domains in the GEFs. This figure illustrates the domain composition of members from different GEF families, including the Rho, Ras, Rab, Ran, and Arf families. Members of the Rho family GEFs (e.g., VAV, TRIO, TIAM1) typically contain the DH–PH domain (labeled as RhoGEF) and additional regulatory domains (e.g., SH3, SH2). Ras family GEFs (e.g., SOS, RASGRP) possess REM and CDC25 domains (marked as RasGEF). GEFs of the Rab, Ran, and Arf families exert their functions through characteristic domains such as VPS9, β‐helical repeat, and Sec7, respectively. Domain abbreviations: CH (calponin homology domain), SH3/SH2 (Src homology domain 3/2), DEP (dishevelled/Egl‐10/pleckstrin domain), REM (Ras exchange motif), BRCT (BRCA1 C‐terminal domain). This figure elucidates the molecular mechanisms by which the GEFs regulates the activities of various G proteins via specific domain combinations. Figures created with BioRender.com. Beyond their functional diversity, the GEF family also exhibits remarkable evolutionary conservation. From an evolutionary standpoint, the GEFs demonstrates remarkable coevolution with small GTPase families. Small GTPases can be classified into five major families based on sequence and function: the highly conserved Ras family (regulating cell proliferation), the widely distributed Rho family (involved in cytoskeletal regulation), the Rab family (mediating membrane trafficking), the conserved Arf family (regulating vesicle formation), and the Ran family (controlling nucleocytoplasmic transport). Correspondingly, the GEFs has evolved matching subclasses, including the evolutionarily conserved Sos family (RasGEFs) from lower to higher organisms, the vertebrate‐specific RasGRF/GRP family, the Dbl family (RhoGEFs) with approximately 70 members in humans, the metazoan‐specific DENND family (RabGEFs), and the conserved Sec7 domain‐containing protein family (ArfGEFs). This coevolution primarily occurs through vertebrate whole‐genome duplication events leading to gene family expansion, functional divergence of duplicated genes (e.g., acquisition of immune regulatory functions by the mammalian Vav family), and domain evolution (with catalytic core domains being highly conserved while regulatory domains showing species‐specific variations) [ 14 1 In terms of pathophysiological significance, GEF dysfunction is closely associated with various human diseases. Currently, at least 23 GEFs have been identified as oncogenes (e.g., ECT2, PREX1), whose hyperactivation or aberrant expression can cause persistent activation of downstream signaling pathways [ 4 14 28 29 Within the Rho GEF subfamily, ARHGEF2‐encoded GEF–H1 represents one of the most extensively studied members. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that GEF–H1 shares significant structural homology with ARHGEF18, ARHGEF28, and AKAP13, all containing highly conserved protein kinase C (PKC) C1 domains [ 2 30 31 32 1 2 33 34 The molecular architecture of GEF–H1 exhibits multidomain cooperative regulation. The DH domain serves as the catalytic core, adopting an α‐helical conformation to bind Rho GTPase and promote its conformational change, showing higher affinity for nucleotide‐free RhoA and specifically facilitating GDP–GTP exchange [ 35 36 37 38 24 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 With continuous advancements in research technologies, investigators employing comparative genomics, phylogenetic analysis, cryo‐EM structure determination, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) real‐time monitoring, and CRISPR screening have gained deeper insights into the GEF–GTPase system. These studies have not only elucidated the evolutionary history and regulatory mechanisms of the GEFs, revealing fundamental principles of cellular signal transduction, but also provided novel target perspectives for precision medicine. Future innovations, particularly in single‐cell technologies and AI‐assisted drug design, coupled with accumulating genomic data, will undoubtedly deepen our understanding of this crucial regulatory system and potentially lead to breakthroughs in disease diagnosis and treatment. 3 Core Regulatory Mechanisms of GEF–GTPase Systems The activities of GEFs and their small GTPase substrates are tightly regulated through multiple mechanisms to ensure precise spatiotemporal control of cellular signaling. Structurally, GEFs catalyze the transition of GTPases from an inactive GDP‐bound state to an active GTP‐bound state by inducing conformational changes, with distinct families employing specialized domains such as DH–PH (RhoGEFs), REM–Cdc25 (RasGEFs), and Sec7 (ArfGEFs). Spatiotemporal regulation is achieved through subcellular localization, particularly via interactions with microtubules and membranes. For example, GEF–H1's activity is inhibited when bound to microtubules but activated upon their depolymerization, while membrane targeting domains like PH ensure proximity to GTPase substrates. Additionally, posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation dynamically modulate GEF function; phosphorylation of GEF–H1 at sites like Ser886 regulates its interaction with inhibitory 14‐3‐3 proteins, and ubiquitination regulates protein stability. These layered regulatory mechanisms enable rapid cellular responses to environmental cues, and their dysregulation is linked to pathologies such as cancer, neurodegeneration, and immune disorders. 3.1 Structural Basis of Nucleotide Exchange The structural mechanism by which GEFs catalyze the transition of small GTPases from GDP‐bound to GTP‐bound states involves specific molecular interactions between conserved catalytic domains of GEFs and their cognate small GTPases. This process is elucidated by multiple high‐resolution structural studies [ 47 For RhoGEFs (e.g., Dbl family members), the catalytic core consists of DH and PH domains. Crystallographic studies demonstrate that the DH domain binds to the Switch II region of Rho family GTPases (e.g., RhoA) through conserved hydrophobic residues (e.g., Leu697 and Phe698 in Dbl), inducing significant conformational changes [ 48 2 49 50 RasGEFs (e.g., Sos1) activate Ras through their catalytic module (comprising the REM and Cdc25 domains). The helical hairpin (αH–αI) of the Cdc25 domain inserts into the nucleotide‐binding pocket of Ras, destabilizing its conformation [ 51 2 50 The catalytic mechanism of ArfGEFs (e.g., Arno) involves the hydrophobic groove (containing Phe151, etc.) of the Sec7 domain binding to the Switch I/II regions of Arf1, inducing conformational changes that disrupt GDP binding [ 52 53 54 55 From the perspective of structural dynamics, crystallographic studies have revealed that GEF binding can induce significant conformational changes in the Switch regions of small GTPases. Taking the RhoA–LARG complex as an example, the α1 helix of the DH domain and its N‐terminal extension (αN1/αN2) directly interact with the Switch I region (e.g., Tyr34), while cooperatively engaging with the PH domain to mediate interactions with the Switch II region (e.g., Glu97 and Arg68), collectively destabilizing the GDP‐binding site [ 48 56 −5 −1 57 Among these GEFs, GEF–H1 (ARHGEF2) represents an important Rho GEF whose catalytic activity is closely tied to its structural features. Like typical RhoGEFs, GEF–H1 contains multiple functional domains including N‐terminal, C‐terminal, and PH domains that collectively mediate its interactions with microtubules and RhoA. Notably, the C‐terminal region of GEF–H1 functions as an autoinhibitory domain that suppresses GEF activity through intramolecular interactions with the catalytic core. Release from microtubules or phosphorylation‐induced relief of autoinhibition exposes the catalytic core, enabling GEF–H1 to promote GDP/GTP exchange on RhoA and activate downstream signaling pathways [ 58 59 3.2 Spatiotemporal Control via Microtubules and Membranes The catalytic activity of GEFs is tightly regulated through subcellular localization, a spatiotemporal control mechanism that has been demonstrated by multiple studies to ensure the specificity and accuracy of cellular signaling pathways [ 47 In microtubule‐dependent regulation, GEF–H1 represents a classical example whose activity is tightly regulated by microtubule dynamics. Krendel et al. [ 60 61 62 63 41 60 60 63 64 In the temporal dimension, the regulation of GEF–H1 exhibits complex kinetic characteristics. The most representative example is the LPS‐induced positive feedback loop: microtubule depolymerization → GEF–H1 release → Rho kinase activation → further microtubule depolymerization → additional GEF–H1 release, forming a “release storm” [ 65 66 67 68 65 69 70 Significant progress has also been made in the study of membrane localization mechanisms. Spatial positioning plays an equally critical role in membrane‐associated regulation. Multiple studies have demonstrated that PH domains mediate protein membrane localization by specifically recognizing phosphoinositides such as PtdIns (3,4,5)P 3 2 71 72 72 73 74 K d 75 76 77 78 Research on compartmentalized signaling mechanisms has made a series of important advances. The Horiuchi team first revealed through in vitro reconstruction experiments that Rabex‐5, a GEF for Rab5, forms a functionally coupled complex with the effector protein Rabaptin‐5: Rabex‐5 catalyzes the GDP/GTP exchange of Rab5, while Rabaptin‐5 stabilizes its active state, together regulating endosomal membrane fusion [ 79 80 The complex localization regulatory mechanisms work together to guarantee the precise spatiotemporal control of GEF activity. Microtubule‐targeting agents can modulate this process through different mechanisms. Microtubule‐depolymerizing agents like plinabulin induce microtubule depolymerization by binding to the site between the α‐ and β‐tubulin subunits [ 61 81 82 83 84 85 3.3 Posttranslational Modifications and Degradation The activity and stability of GEFs are precisely regulated by various posttranslational modifications. Together, these modifications form a dynamic regulatory network, ensuring the accuracy and plasticity of cell signaling. Regulatory mechanisms include phosphorylation, ubiquitination‐mediated degradation, allosteric regulation, SUMOylation, and so on. The molecular mechanisms of these modifications have been confirmed by multiple high‐quality studies. Phosphorylation has two distinct modes of action. Biochemical studies demonstrate that the Tyr174 site of the Vav1 protein can be specifically phosphorylated by Src family kinases. In vitro kinase reactions combined with mass spectrometry identified the exact phosphorylation site. Structural analysis by NMR revealed that phosphorylation at Tyr174 in the N‐terminal acidic domain (Ac, residues 132–176) of Vav1 induces a conformational change in the N‐terminal extension (residues 170–177), relieving the autoinhibition of the DH domain and activating Vav1's GEF activity to expose the GTPase binding site [ 86 K d K d 41 The ubiquitination‐dependent degradation of Cdc25A has been well‐characterized. Here, the SCFβ–TrCP ubiquitin ligase plays a key role [ 87 88 89 90 Recent structural studies have advanced our understanding of allosteric regulation and autoinhibition mechanisms in GEFs. X‐ray crystallography has been used to determine the autoinhibited conformation of Sos1 at a resolution of approximately 3.6 Å. It has been revealed that the REM domain (residues 198–225) of Sos1 interacts with the Cdc25 catalytic domain (residues 564–1049) and works together with the DH–PH unit to shield the catalytic site, thereby achieving autoinhibition, rather than simply blocking it through a steric hindrance effect alone [ 91 K d 92 SUMOylation plays a crucial role in regulating RanGEF RCC1. Research shows that RCC1's chromatin binding and dissociation are regulated by SUMOylation. In vitro studies indicate that SUMO E1 and E2 enzymes promote RCC1 and Ran dissociation from chromatin [ 93 94 95 There are complex interplays among these posttranslational modifications. Immunoprecipitation and protein stability assays show that GEF–H1 phosphorylation can enhance its binding to the E3 ligase FBXO45, accelerating ubiquitination and degradation [ 96 97 Among GEFs, the regulation of GEF–H1 activity is particularly complex, primarily through a posttranslational modification network, with phosphorylation playing a central role. To date, 36 phosphorylation sites have been identified on GEF–H1, mainly enriched in its C‐terminal autoinhibitory domain, forming a precise molecular switch system [ 42 98 Among the activating phosphorylation sites, Ser151, Ser645, and Thr678 are the most extensively studied. Phosphorylation at Ser151 is catalyzed by the LKB1–MARK3 kinase cascade, and the resulting phosphorylated site can specifically bind to 14‐3‐3 proteins, thereby releasing GEF–H1 from microtubules [ 45 99 100 101 Inhibitory phosphorylation sites primarily activate GEF–H1 function through dephosphorylation mechanisms. The Ser886 site (Ser885 in mice) can be phosphorylated by various kinases, including PKA and PAK, promoting 14‐3‐3 protein binding and maintaining GEF–H1 in an inactive state [ 63 68 66 67 102 103 41 42 104 The regulation of GEF–H1 phosphorylation is extremely complex. The same kinase can produce opposing effects via different sites: for example, ERK1/2 can both activate GEF–H1 through Thr678 and inhibit it through Ser959 [ 101 105 72 106 107 108 109 In addition to phosphorylation, GEF–H1 may also be regulated by other posttranslational modifications such as ubiquitination, but the exact functions and mechanisms of these modifications remain unclear. In terms of protein stability, preliminary evidence suggests that GEF–H1 may be degraded via the proteasomal or lysosomal pathway. However, the key information related to this process, including the E3 ligases, deubiquitinating enzymes, and degradation‐triggering signals, has yet to be discovered. It is worth noting that the activity of GEF–H1 can also be regulated by physical and chemical factors such as high osmotic pressure and mechanical stress [ 110 111 Overall, GEF–H1 integrates various posttranslational modifications to form a multidimensional regulatory system, enabling it to respond precisely to different cellular signals. Future research should explore the cross‐regulatory relationships between these modifications and unveil their dynamic changes under physiological and pathological conditions. This will lay a theoretical foundation for developing GEF–H1‐targeted therapeutic strategies. 4 Physiological Functions of GEF–GTPase Networks GEFs can be classified into multiple subfamilies—including RhoGEF, RasGEF, RabGEF, ArfGEF, and RanGEF—based on their substrate specificity. These proteins are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and regulate small GTPase activity, thereby maintaining essential physiological functions, including microbial defense and immune surveillance. Notably, abnormal expression or activity of GEFs is closely associated with numerous human diseases. Gain‐of‐function alterations in GEFs often promote pathological processes, including tumor progression, cardiovascular disorders, neurodegeneration, and autoimmune diseases, whereas loss‐of‐function mutations are associated with intellectual disability, epilepsy, and hematological malignancies. This subclassification underscores the pivotal role of GEFs in physiological homeostasis and disease pathogenesis, offering a molecular framework for developing therapies targeting specific GEF subfamilies (Figure 3 FIGURE 3 Expression patterns and pathological implications of GEF proteins in human tissues. This figure illustrates the expression patterns of RhoGEF, RasGEF, RabGEF, ArfGEF, and RanGEF in normal human tissues (A), their roles in various diseases caused by excessive or insufficient activity (C), and their critical functions in maintaining health, such as host defense against microbial infections, mucosal homeostasis, tumor immunity, and cytokine regulation (B). The affected tissues encompass multiple systems, including mucosal, circulatory, digestive, urinary, reproductive, neural, integumentary, immune, and respiratory tissues. Dysregulation of these GEFs has been implicated in a broad spectrum of diseases, including cancers (e.g., HCC, breast cancer), cardiovascular disorders (e.g., hypertension, atherosclerosis), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease [PD], Alzheimer's disease [AD]), and immune‐related conditions (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]). ( Note 1 112 4.1 Cell Motility and Cytoskeletal Dynamics Cell motility and cytoskeletal dynamics are central to various physiological and pathological processes, primarily regulated by a complex network composed of Rho family GTPases (RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42) and their regulators (GEFs/GAPs) [ 113 114 115 116 24 60 GEF–H1 activity is strictly regulated by microtubule dynamics, making it a molecular sensor for cellular perception of microenvironmental changes [ 24 60 41 60 117 118 119 120 During cell migration, GEF–H1 forms a sophisticated regulatory network with functional complementarity to other RhoGEFs. In mesenchymal migration, GEF–H1 exhibits significant synergy with p63RhoGEF (ARHGEF25) [ 114 119 121 122 123 124 Mechanical signal integration and transduction represent one of GEF–H1's most prominent functional characteristics. When cells experience mechanical stimuli such as substrate stiffness changes or fluid shear stress, GEF–H1 participates in force signal transmission via the integrin–microtubule coupling pathway [ 118 125 126 127 128 129 130 GEF–H1's functional implementation also relies on crosstalk with multiple signaling pathways. The calcium signaling system forms a precise negative feedback network with GEF–H1: TRPC channel‐mediated Ca 2 2 60 130 2 106 131 132 133 134 135 99 From a pathological perspective, dysregulated synergy between GEF–H1 and other GEFs drives multiple disease processes. During tumor metastasis, aberrant GEF–H1 release in breast cancer cells requires microtubule‐severing enzymes like FL2, with activation thresholds strictly regulated by scaffold proteins such as IQGAP1 [ 136 137 138 139 140 8 141 142 143 144 145 Current targeted therapeutic strategies primarily focus on multipathway synergistic interventions. Examples include combined use of ROCK inhibitors (blocking GEF–H1/LARG downstream signaling) with microtubule stabilizers (inhibiting GEF–H1 release), or multitarget inhibitors simultaneously targeting the ARHGEF7–STIL–Rac1 axis and GEF–H1–RhoA axis [ 64 99 134 146 147 60 148 4.2 Membrane Trafficking and Organelle Homeostasis The regulation of membrane trafficking and organelle homeostasis constitutes a complex and precise system involving the coordinated action of multiple GEF families. These proteins form the core regulatory network of intracellular trafficking pathways by spatiotemporally activating small GTPases (e.g., Rab, Arf, Rho) [ 15 149 The TRAPP complex, as an important multisubunit GEF, exhibits remarkable functional diversity in eukaryotic cells. Based on subunit composition and functional differences, TRAPP complexes can be divided into two main subtypes: TRAPPII and TRAPPIII [ 150 151 150 152 153 153 154 155 Although TMEM131 does not belong to the classical GEFs, it exhibits GEF‐like cooperative functions in membrane trafficking regulation. Studies have shown that TMEM131 plays a critical role in intracellular collagen assembly and secretion. Its N‐terminus contains a PapD‐like chaperone domain (PapD‐L) that specifically recognizes and recruits immature collagen monomers, promoting their proper folding and assembly, while its C‐terminus harbors a TRAPID domain that directly interacts with TRAPPC8, a key component of the TRAPPIII complex, driving directional collagen transport from the ER to the Golgi [ 156 157 158 The BLOC‐3 complex, composed of two subunits (HPS1 and HPS4), is a specialized GEF that specifically activates Rab32 and Rab38 GTPases, playing a central role in the biogenesis and functional maintenance of lysosome‐related organelles (LROs) [ 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 In the yeast secretory pathway, a sophisticated Rab GEF cascade exists: the upstream Rab GTPase Ypt32, in its GTP‐bound state, recruits Sec2 (the GEF for Sec4) to secretory vesicle surfaces, where Sec2 subsequently activates the downstream Rab GTPase Sec4, ultimately promoting targeted vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane [ 168 169 170 171 The ARF–GEF proteins regulate COPI/COPII vesicle formation and trafficking by activating ADP‐ribosylation factor (Arf) GTPases. Different ARF–GEF members exhibit distinct subcellular localization and functional specificity: Golgi‐localized GBF1 is a key factor in maintaining Golgi structure and function. Studies show that treatment with GBF1‐specific inhibitor Golgicide A causes COPI dissociation from Golgi membranes, leading to Golgi and trans‐Golgi network disassembly, while blocking the secretion of soluble and membrane‐anchored proteins, trapping them in the ER–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). In contrast, the broad‐spectrum ArfGEF inhibitor Brefeldin A (BFA) affects both COPI localization and membrane binding of vesicle coat proteins (e.g., AP‐1, GGA3), demonstrating broader inhibitory effects [ 172 173 174 175 176 Rho family GEFs play diverse roles in cell signaling transduction and organelle dynamics regulation. GEF–H1, as a critical regulator of the Rho family, activates multiple Rho GTPases (e.g., RhoA and RhoB) and regulates vesicle trafficking through various signaling pathways, playing an essential role in cellular vesicle transport [ 146 146 177 178 179 180 181 182 Recent studies have uncovered functional synergy between P4–ATPase lipid flippases (e.g., Drs2) and multisubunit tethering complexes (MTCs, including TRAPPIII, GARP, and COG) [ 183 184 185 185 In summary, GEF proteins maintain organelle homeostasis through complex regulatory networks, and their dysregulation contributes to the pathogenesis of various diseases. Future research should focus on the following directions: (1) elucidating the dynamic assembly and activation mechanisms of GEF complexes (2); investigating the precise regulation of GEF activity in different cellular contexts (3); developing small‐molecule tools specifically targeting GEFs; and (4) exploring GEF roles in novel membrane trafficking pathways. These advances will deepen our understanding of organelle homeostasis regulation and provide new strategies and targets for treating related diseases. 4.3 Immune Regulation and Barrier Integrity The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying immune regulation and barrier integrity constitute a highly complex process involving intricate regulatory networks of multiple GEF proteins. These proteins regulate immune cell function and barrier homeostasis through spatiotemporal control of expression and activity. In immune regulation, the KIR family of inhibitory receptors represents a crucial immune checkpoint system. KIR2DL5 and KIR3DL3 recognize the overexpressed immunoregulatory molecules PVR (CD155) and HHLA2 on tumor cell surfaces, forming immunosuppressive synaptic structures. Mechanistically, these receptors recruit SHP‐1 and SHP‐2 phosphatases via their intracellular ITIM motifs, exerting multilayered effects on downstream signaling: first, they directly inhibit Vav1 phosphorylation and activation; second, they block the ERK1/2/p90RSK signaling cascade; ultimately leading to downregulation of NF‐κB transcriptional activity [ 186 187 186 187 The VAV family proteins serve as central regulatory nodes in immune cell signal transduction. VAV1, as a crucial GEF molecule for Rho/Rac family, demonstrates multifaceted functions in T cell receptor signaling: structurally, it promotes Rac1 GDP/GTP exchange through its GEF‐dependent activity, driving cytoskeletal reorganization and immune synapse formation; in signal transduction, it acts as a scaffold protein participating in spatial organization of TCR signal complexes; functionally, it regulates T cell activation thresholds and effector differentiation [ 188 6 189 DOCK family proteins exhibit remarkable functional diversity in immune regulation and barrier maintenance. DOCK2 activates the Rac–PAK1 axis via its unique DHR‐2 domain, regulating mast cell degranulation. Molecularly, DOCK2 forms dynamic complexes with MRGPRX2/B2 receptor downstream molecules, promoting Rac conformational changes through spatial rearrangement, ultimately leading to secretory apparatus assembly and activation [ 190 191 192 193 194 In dynamic barrier maintenance, ARHGEF18 (p114RhoGEF) plays central regulatory roles. During epithelial collective migration, ARHGEF18 interacts with polarity complexes via its N‐terminal PDZ domain, spatially restricting RhoA activation to precisely regulate local actomyosin contractility‐providing migration force while maintaining E‐cadherin‐mediated junctions through mechanical tension feedback [ 195 196 196 The TIAM1–RAC1 axis exhibits surprising pleiotropy in neuroimmune regulation and vascular barrier maintenance. In neuropathic pain, TIAM1–PSD‐95 complexes spatially restrict RAC1 activation to dendritic spines, promoting cofilin‐mediated actin reorganization and PAK1‐dependent GluN2B phosphorylation, ultimately causing central sensitization [ 197 198 SOS family proteins play complex roles in immune microenvironment regulation. Beyond canonical RASGEF function in KRAS‐mutant tumors, SOS1 exhibits unique pathology in BCR–ABL+ leukemia: PH domain‐mediated interaction with BCR–ABL fusion protein confers constitutive kinase activity, enhancing both RASGEF function and RAC1 activation via C‐terminal proline‐rich regions, promoting leukemic cell proliferation [ 199 199 200 201 5 Dysregulation in Human Diseases Emerging evidence has shown that GEFs and their small GTPase substrates play key roles in various human diseases through complex regulatory mechanisms. In cancer, GEFs like the Vav family and GEF–H1 drive tumor initiation, progression, and drug resistance by abnormally activating Ras and Rho signaling. Specifically, Vav1 synergizes with KRAS mutations to promote pancreatic cancer, while GEF–H1 facilitates hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastasis by modulating RhoA‐dependent cytoskeletal changes. Neurodegenerative diseases are marked by disrupted synaptic vesicle proteins such as Rab3 and Synaptotagmin (Syt), along with abnormal activation of RhoGEFs such as Ephexin5 (E5) and LRRK2. These aberrant activations impair neuronal structure and mitochondrial homeostasis. In cardiovascular diseases, RhoGEFs such as ARHGEF1 and LARG contribute to hypertension and aneurysm formation through activation of the Ang II‐induced RhoA/ROCK pathway, leading to endothelial dysfunction. Immunological disorders also arise from GEF mutations that disrupt lymphocyte signaling, including Vav1 mutations in T‐cell lymphomas, DOCK8 deficiency in hyper‐IgE syndrome, and GEF–H1‐driven Th17 polarization in lupus. These findings highlight the importance of GEF networks in disease mechanisms and suggest potential therapeutic targets, such as SOS1 inhibitors and RhoA modulators, for restoring dysregulated signaling pathways. 5.1 Cancer: From Oncogenic GEFs to Metastatic Reprogramming GEF proteins orchestrate extraordinarily complex regulatory networks during cancer initiation and metastatic progression, involving intricate multilayered molecular interactions and extensive cross‐talk between signaling pathways (Figure 4 202 203 FIGURE 4 GEF‐mediated signaling networks in cellular processes and human diseases. This figure emphasizes the key role of GEFs in cellular signaling pathways and their links to human diseases. GEFs are involved in cancers (e.g., PDAC, leukemia), neurological disorders (e.g., AD, PD), autoimmune diseases (e.g., SLE, IBD), cardiovascular conditions, and immune‐related diseases. (A) In tumors, GEFs (e.g., GEF–H1, SOS1) activate Rho GTPases (e.g., RhoA, Rac1), regulating stress responses, proliferation, immune evasion, and cell migration. (B) In neurological diseases, GEF dysregulation (e.g., BIG1, Ephexin5) contributes to neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and impaired trafficking. (C) In cardiovascular diseases, GEFs (e.g., ARHGEF1, LARG) activate Rho GTPases (e.g., RhoA), controlling leukocyte adhesion, vascular inflammation, and smooth muscle contraction. (D) In immune diseases, GEFs (e.g., DOCK8, DOCK2) regulate immune functions, cytokine production (e.g., IL‐31, IFN‐β), and barrier dysfunction, contributing to conditions like atopic dermatitis and SLE. Abbreviations In hematologic malignancies, Vav1 demonstrates distinct oncogenic mechanisms. Approximately 15% of peripheral T‐cell lymphoma (PTCL) patients harbor Vav1 gene rearrangements, predominantly the Vav1–THAP4 fusion variant. This chimeric protein loses Vav1's N‐terminal autoinhibitory domain while acquiring THAP4's nuclear localization signal [ 6 204 205 6 206 2 TABLE 2 GEFs in human diseases: mutations, mechanisms, and therapeutic strategies.

John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. GEF–H1, a crucial member of the GEFs, plays indispensable roles in cancer progression through its conserved GEF activity [ 214 215 216 217 216 43 60 218 Emerging evidence indicates that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) can bypass C1‐mediated constraints to activate GEF–H1/RhoA signaling, coordinating stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly to drive metastatic dissemination [ 219 220 8 217 2 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 In colorectal cancer (CRC), the m6A reader YTHDF1 amplifies GEF–H1 translation to constitutively activate RhoA, while hypoxia‐induced exosomal circ‐133 sponges miR‐133a to relieve GEF–H1 inhibition [ 219 228 147 99 2 GEF–H1 orchestrates metastatic behavior through diverse molecular mechanisms. The oncogene hPTTG1 transactivates the GEF–H1 promoter [ 229 230 127 231 232 230 233 234 235 Metastatic progression involves dynamic GEF regulation in response to microenvironmental cues. In HCC hypoxic niches (<5 mmHg O 2 236 237 Spatiotemporal regulation is exemplified by Trio's phase separation behavior in uveal melanoma. Elevated collagen density (>5 mg/mL) triggers integrin β1‐FAK‐mediated Trio phosphorylation at S1332, promoting liquid–liquid phase separation of the SR7 domain to concentrate Rac1/WAVE components (15× enrichment) [ 212 238 Recent structural insights have advanced understanding of SOS family regulation. Cryo‐EM analyses demonstrate that KRASG12C inhibitors disrupt critical SOS1 salt bridges (increasing Y884–R73 distance from 2.8 to 4.5 Å), reducing GEF activity by 1000‐fold [ 239 K d 240 241 Emerging noncanonical GEF functions include Vav2's regulation of the mevalonate pathway: nuclear Vav2 binds SREBF1 ( K d 242 243 Phase separation fundamentally underpins metastatic signaling hubs. Trio SR7 droplets (forming at pH < 6.5) concentrate promigratory factors (WAVE2↑15×) while excluding RhoGDI, with dramatically reduced diffusivity (D↓100×) enabling sustained signal persistence. Clinically, droplet formation frequency strongly predicts metastatic potential (hazard ratio = 3.2) [ 212 In summary, GEF–H1 and related family members critically govern tumor migration, proliferation, mitotic progression, and therapeutic resistance, making their precise regulation a compelling therapeutic target. These mechanistic insights unveil multifaceted targeting opportunities—ranging from enzymatic inhibition to phase separation disruption—while simultaneously highlighting the challenge of integrating these complex mechanisms into robust precision oncology frameworks. Future research must address the contextual dependencies of GEF regulation across different tumor types and microenvironments to realize the full therapeutic potential of targeting these master regulators of cancer progression. 5.2 GTPase Dysregulation in Neurodegenerative Diseases Extensive research has established that Rab3 and Syt family proteins are critical regulators of synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter release. Rab3, a small GTPase, orchestrates vesicle trafficking, docking, and fusion through its GTP/GDP cycling (the “Rab cycle”), while Syt acts as a high‐affinity calcium sensor, directly mediating calcium‐dependent synchronous neurotransmitter release. These systems function synergistically to ensure neuronal signaling fidelity, and their dysregulation is implicated in multiple neurodegenerative disorders [ 244 In neuroinflammatory contexts, biochemical studies have identified BFA‐inhibited guanine nucleotide‐exchange protein 1 (BIG1) as a key modulator of microglial activation, regulating both inflammatory cytokine production and migratory capacity via the PI3K/Akt/NF‐κB cascade. Notably, BIG1 expression strongly correlates with proinflammatory mediator secretion (e.g., TNF‐α, IL‐1β, IL‐6), highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for neuroinflammation‐associated degeneration [ 245 At the molecular level, neurodegeneration is tightly regulated by Rho GTPase signaling networks, which govern neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity, and cytoskeletal dynamics. E5, a neuronal RhoGEF with selectivity for RhoA and Cdc42, exhibits activity‐dependent modulation via synaptic inputs and tyrosine phosphorylation [ 246 246 247 A recent breakthrough identified CalDAG–GEFI (CDGI) as the physiological GEF modulating LRRK2 GTPase activity in neurodegeneration. Although LRRK2 mutations (a major cause of familial Parkinson's disease (PD)) affect a multidomain protein with both GTPase and kinase functions, prior research disproportionately focused on kinase activity, leaving GTPase regulation poorly understood. Structural analyses reveal that CDGI binds LRRK2's ROC domain via a canonical GEF module, catalyzing GDP/GTP exchange in a manner dependent on LRRK2's nucleotide‐binding pocket integrity. Functionally, CDGI enhances LRRK2's GTP‐binding capacity, membrane association, and kinase activity (evidenced by increased Rab10 phosphorylation—effects amplified by calcium signaling, implicating calcium dyshomeostasis in LRRK2‐linked PD pathogenesis. Genetic evidence from Drosophila and murine models confirms CDGI's role in LRRK2‐dependent neurodegeneration: (1) progressive retinal degeneration in flies, and (2) striatal dopaminergic neuron loss with motor deficits in mice—phenotypes abolished in LRRK2‐null backgrounds, demonstrating strict LRRK2 dependence [ 248 Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive neuronal dysfunction and death, stemming from dysregulated cellular and molecular homeostasis. AD, the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, is pathologically defined by extracellular β‐amyloid plaques and intraneuronal hyperphosphorylated Tau accumulation. Emerging evidence implicates lysosomal dysfunction as another key pathogenic factor. Lysosomal positioning and function, regulated by small GTPases (e.g., Rab, Arl8b), require precise molecular control. Recent studies identified DENND6A, a Rab‐specific GEF that activates Rab34 to recruit the RILP–dynein complex, facilitating retrograde lysosomal transport [ 249 249 5.3 RhoGEFs in Vascular Inflammation and Remodeling Cardiovascular pathology encompasses the molecular mechanisms and structural alterations underlying various heart and vascular diseases. The GEF proteins play a central role in inflammation, vascular function regulation, and myocardial remodeling through modulation of the Rho/Rac signaling pathway. The VAV family exhibits pleiotropic functions in cardiovascular pathologies. Trans‐anethole mitigates myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury and enhances cardiac function by upregulating VAV3 mRNA and its epigenetic regulators miR‐1298 and lncRNA JRKL–AS1, thereby suppressing the proinflammatory cytokine TNF‐α [ 250 251 252 253 The ARHGEFs, including LARG and ARHGEF1, are critical in vasoconstriction and hypertension. Angiotensin II (Ang II) upregulates LARG via AT1 receptor activation, stimulating the RhoA/Rho kinase/MYPT1 axis to promote VSMC contraction and increased vascular tone [ 254 255 2 ARHGEF1 also contributes to vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis. Ang II enhances leukocyte–endothelial adhesion via ARHGEF1, and ARHGEF1‐deficient mice show reduced leukocyte recruitment and atherosclerosis, implicating ARHGEF1 in β2 integrin regulation [ 256 213 In myocardial pathology, PDZ–RhoGEF (ARHGEF11) is upregulated in hypertrophic hearts and promotes pathological cardiac hypertrophy via RhoA‐dependent signaling and Gα13 interaction [ 257 258 259 TIAM1, a Rac1‐specific GEF, strengthens endothelial barrier integrity via optogenetic activation (Opto‐RhoGEFs), even after VE‐cadherin blockade  [ 260 198 261 ROS contribute to cardiovascular pathology via NADPH oxidase and mitochondrial dysfunction, activating ARHGEF1 and Src kinases to induce RhoA‐mediated vasoconstriction—a key mechanism in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension [ 262 4 l 4 263 GEF proteins critically regulate inflammation, vascular tone, myocardial remodeling, and endothelial function via Rho/Rac signaling. These insights not only elucidate cardiovascular disease mechanisms but also highlight potential GEF‐targeted therapies (e.g., against VAV3, ARHGEF1, TIAM1, or PDZ‐RhoGEF) for hypertension, atherosclerosis, and myocardial regeneration. The mechanistic overlap between cardiovascular diseases and cancer (e.g., shared roles of ARHGEF12, CTNNB1, and PTEN) may inform dual therapeutic strategies [ 264 5.4 Immunological Disorders: Vav/Dock Family Dysfunction The GEF proteins play multifaceted regulatory roles in immune pathogenesis through their modulation of Rho GTPases, with individual members exhibiting both specialized and overlapping functions. Notably, among these, the Vav family (Vav1–3) serves as canonical GEFs with cell‐type‐specific actions: In macrophages, Vav1 deficiency selectively impairs migration speed without altering the enhanced membrane ruffling phenotype observed in Vav2‐deficient cells, though both reduce adhesion area through mechanistically distinct pathways [ 265 266 189 267 268 The DOCK family presents a paradigm of functional divergence despite structural conservation: While DOCK2 and DOCK8 both possess DHR‐2 domains, their deficiencies yield distinct immunological phenotypes. DOCK2 impairment predominantly disrupts Rac activation, manifesting as CID with neutrophil dysfunction [ 269 270 271 272 273 2 274 GEF–H1 exemplifies functional pleiotropy in immune dysregulation: In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), PPP2R2A‐mediated dephosphorylation of GEF–H1 activates the RhoA–ROCK axis, driving pathogenic IL‐17/IFN‐γ production in T cells [ 26 2 275 276 277 278 Therapeutic targeting strategies reflect this functional diversity: Molecular interventions include DOCK2‐specific inhibitors and emerging Vav1‐directed compounds for B‐ALL [ 279 280 281 282 This integrated analysis reveals a hierarchical regulatory network: The Vav family orchestrates adaptive immune signaling, DOCK proteins coordinate cellular motility and metabolic homeostasis, while GEF–H1 bridges innate and adaptive immunity. Such multilayered governance provides a conceptual framework for both mechanistic classification and precision therapeutics in immune disorders. 6 Therapeutic Targeting Strategies After an in‐depth investigation into the regulatory mechanisms of GEFs in diseases, directly inhibiting their catalytic activity has emerged as a central focus of therapeutic strategies. By targeting the catalytic domain of GEFs, researchers have developed a series of small‐molecule inhibitors designed to block the interaction between GEFs and GTPases, thereby precisely modulating downstream signaling pathways. These inhibitors not only provide novel therapeutic avenues for diseases such as cancer but also lay the groundwork for further exploration of alternative strategies, such as disrupting protein–protein interaction interfaces (Table 3 TABLE 3 Therapeutic targeting strategies for GEFs.

As crucial regulators of small GTPase activity, GEFs play pivotal roles in diverse cellular signaling pathways, and their aberrant activation is closely associated with various pathological processes including tumorigenesis, inflammatory responses, and metabolic disorders. Based on the classification characteristics of GEFs, researchers have developed multiple specific inhibition strategies, providing novel approaches for targeted therapy of related diseases. In the regulation of RAS signaling pathways, SOS family GEFs have attracted considerable attention due to their central role in RAS activation. Studies have demonstrated that SOS1 and SOS2 play critical roles in various malignancies by catalyzing GDP/GTP exchange of RAS proteins. Targeting this mechanism, researchers have developed several small‐molecule inhibitors, including BI‐3406, BAY‐293, and BI‐170192, which effectively block SOS1–KRAS interaction through specific binding to the CDC25 catalytic domain of SOS1 [ 207 208 3 209 210 292 293 294 In the regulation of Rho family GEFs, researchers have identified multiple therapeutically valuable inhibition mechanisms. The autoinhibitory property of AKAP–Lbc provides novel insights for drug design, as its N‐ and C‐terminal domains maintain an inactive state through intramolecular interactions, particularly when Ser1565 phosphorylation enhances 14‐3‐3 protein binding [ 295 296 283 285 297 3 298 211 Inhibition strategies for Arf family GEFs exhibit unique advantages in treating metabolic diseases. SecinH3, a specific inhibitor of cytohesin‐2 (ARNO), effectively suppresses Arf6 activation by targeting its Sec7 domain, showing potential applications in diabetes and prostate smooth muscle dysfunction [ 284 299 299 300 301 The critical roles of Vav family GEFs in various diseases have also drawn extensive research attention. In HIV‐associated nephropathy, VAV2 promotes podocyte injury through Rac1 signaling activation, with knockout experiments confirming that VAV2 inhibition significantly improves pathological alterations [ 302 303 304 291 241 In conclusion, classification‐based specific inhibition strategies targeting GEF families have opened new avenues for targeted therapy of various diseases. From inhibiting catalytic activity to modulating protein interactions, and from intervening in subcellular localization to inducing protein degradation, diverse intervention approaches provide abundant options for precision medicine. 6.2 Disruption of PPI Interfaces PPIs serve as fundamental mechanisms underlying cellular life activities, participating in the regulation of key biological processes including signal transduction, gene expression regulation, and cell cycle progression. In recent years, with advancements in structural biology and computational biology, targeting PPI interfaces has emerged as a novel therapeutic strategy for various diseases. Particularly in studies of GEF proteins, therapeutic approaches disrupting specific PPI interfaces have demonstrated significant clinical potential. GEF proteins regulate crucial physiological and pathological processes such as cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation through activation of small GTPases (e.g., Ras and Rho families), with their aberrant activation being closely associated with tumorigenesis and immune disorders. Research has revealed that although DOCK2 lacks the canonical c‐Crk‐II binding motif, it can specifically interact with the SH3 domain of CrkL through two independent regions [ 305 305 In studies of Vav family proteins, scientists have identified that the interaction between their SH2 domain and phosphorylated tyrosine residues of ZAP‐70, constitutes a critical step in signal transduction. Interestingly, synthetic phosphorylated peptide bZAP 1.1 can effectively block this interaction through competitive binding [ 286 306 307 308 Regarding regulatory mechanisms, SOCS1 promotes Vav ubiquitination and degradation through SH2 domain‐mediated binding to the Vav acidic region [ 309 310 In Tiam1 studies, researchers discovered that its PH domain recognizes specific lipid molecules through a noncanonical phosphoinositide‐binding pocket. Site‐directed mutagenesis of key residues (e.g., R459A/R460A) markedly impairs membrane localization [ 311 312 287 Significant progress has been made in understanding P‐Rex1 regulation. Its catalytic activity is finely modulated by DH‐DEP1 and PH‐4HB domain interactions, with specific mutations (e.g., L177E) substantially increasing GEF activity [ 313 298 314 3 In KRAS signaling research, the Sos1–KRAS interaction represents an important therapeutic target. Small molecules like BAY‐293 and BI‐3406 effectively disrupt this interaction [ 315 210 316 Among RhoGEF proteins, p115–RhoGEF exhibits unique regulation. Its RH‐DH linker region suppresses GEF activity, which can be relieved by Gα13 binding or specific mutations [ 317 288 318 PDZRhoGEF studies revealed autoinhibition through interaction between its negatively charged sequence (e.g., Asp706) and the DH domain, with charge‐reversal mutations (e.g., D706R) significantly enhancing catalytic activity [ 319 320 Despite the inherent challenges in targeting PPI interfaces, which are typically flat and dynamic, recent advances in computational approaches and fragment‐based drug discovery [ 321 6.3 Emerging Technologies: PROTACs and CRISPR Screens PROTAC technology and CRISPR screening, as cutting‐edge biomedical tools, exhibit powerful synergistic effects in studies related to the GEFs. PROTAC technology achieves remarkable results in targeting GEFs such as SOS1 through the design of bifunctional molecules to induce targeted protein degradation. Multiple studies have developed CRBN‐ or VHL‐based SOS1 PROTAC degraders, such as compound 11o (DC50: 1.85–7.53 nM), LHF418 (DC50: 209.4 nM), and BTX‐6654/BTX‐7312. These degraders effectively suppress the KRAS signaling pathway and overcome resistance to traditional inhibitors by inducing efficient SOS1 degradation [ 289 322 323 289 324 Meanwhile, in immune system‐related GEF research, CRISPR screening plays a pivotal role. Studies reveal that VAV1, a key regulator of T‐cell receptor signaling, significantly suppresses T‐cell activation and cytokine secretion upon knockout [ 188 325 Other GEFs, such as RABIF/MSS4 and SOS2, have gained new functional understanding through CRISPR technology. Genome‐wide CRISPR screening unexpectedly revealed that RABIF/MSS4 does not act as a conventional GEF but instead stabilizes Rab GTPases by preventing Rab10 proteasomal degradation, thereby regulating GLUT4 exocytosis [ 326 290 3 The integration of PROTAC and CRISPR technologies creates a closed‐loop research framework for GEFs studies: CRISPR screening systematically identifies disease‐associated GEF members and their regulatory networks (e.g., SHP2 [encoded by PTPN11 327 328 Looking ahead, advancements in PROTAC design (e.g., enhanced selectivity, improved pharmacokinetics) and CRISPR screening (e.g., reduced off‐target effects, higher throughput) will deepen the integration of these technologies, further advancing GEFs applications in disease treatment. This convergence holds promise for breakthroughs in cancer, immune disorders, and metabolic diseases [ 329 330 7 Challenges and Future Directions The study of GEFs and their small GTPase targets has revolutionized our understanding of cellular signaling networks and their dysregulation in human diseases. While tremendous progress has been made in elucidating the structural basis of GEF–GTPase interactions and their physiological functions, several fundamental and translational challenges must be addressed to fully realize their therapeutic potential. At the molecular level, the remarkable diversity of GEF isoforms presents both opportunities and challenges. For GEF–H1 in particular, the existence of multiple splice variants with potentially distinct functions remains largely unexplored territory. The development of isoform‐specific detection tools and functional assays will be crucial to dissect their individual contributions to cellular processes. Furthermore, the complex posttranslational regulation of GEFs, particularly the intricate crosstalk between phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and other modifications, represents a critical knowledge gap. Advanced proteomic approaches combined with genetically engineered models will be essential to map these regulatory networks and understand how they are rewired in disease states. The contextual regulation of GEF activity adds another layer of complexity. Emerging evidence suggests that GEFs like GEF–H1 can integrate diverse inputs‐from mechanical forces to cytokine signals‐but the molecular mechanisms underlying this signal integration remain poorly understood. Super‐resolution microscopy and biosensor technologies may help visualize how GEFs process these signals in real‐time within living cells. Similarly, the relative contributions of microtubule‐dependent versus independent activation pathways need clarification, particularly in pathological conditions where microtubule dynamics are altered, such as in metastatic cancers or neurodegenerative disorders. From a therapeutic perspective, the high structural conservation among GEFs poses significant challenges for drug development. Current inhibitors often lack sufficient specificity, leading to off‐target effects. Innovative approaches such as covalent inhibitors, PROTACs, or molecular glues may provide solutions to this selectivity problem. The development of such agents would be greatly facilitated by high‐resolution structural data from cryo‐EM and AI‐assisted protein modeling. Additionally, the identification of allosteric regulatory sites could offer new opportunities for targeted modulation of GEF activity. Technological advances are opening exciting new avenues for GEF research. Single‐cell multiomics approaches will be invaluable for mapping GEF expression patterns and activity states across different cell types in health and disease. CRISPR‐based screening platforms can systematically identify genetic interactors and synthetic lethal partners of specific GEFs, revealing new therapeutic vulnerabilities. Advanced imaging modalities, including expansion microscopy and lattice light‐sheet microscopy, could provide unprecedented views of GEF localization and dynamics in intact tissues. The tumor microenvironment presents complex challenges for GEF‐targeted therapies. The mechanical and biochemical heterogeneity of tumors likely creates distinct niches where GEF activity is differentially regulated. Understanding how factors like hypoxia, extracellular matrix stiffness, and immune cell interactions modulate GEF signaling will be critical for developing context‐specific interventions. Similarly, in neurological disorders, the cell‐type specific effects of GEF modulation in neurons versus glia need careful evaluation. Clinical translation will require innovative combination strategies. Given the compensatory mechanisms and signaling redundancy in many pathways regulated by GEFs, rational combinations with microtubule‐targeting agents, kinase inhibitors, or immunotherapies may be necessary for durable responses. The development of predictive biomarkers will be equally important to identify patients most likely to benefit from GEF‐targeted approaches. Early‐phase clinical trials should incorporate sophisticated pharmacodynamic assessments to verify target engagement and pathway modulation. Beyond their canonical roles as GTPase activators, GEFs may have underappreciated functions as scaffolds, adaptors, or even transcriptional regulators. Systematic investigation of these noncatalytic roles could uncover entirely new biological functions and therapeutic opportunities. Similarly, the potential crosstalk between GEFs and other signaling systems, such as metabolic pathways or the DNA damage response, remains largely unexplored. In conclusion, while the path forward presents significant challenges, the potential rewards are substantial. By leveraging cutting‐edge technologies and interdisciplinary approaches, we can overcome current limitations in our understanding of GEF biology and translate these insights into transformative therapies. Future research should prioritize the development of more specific pharmacological tools, comprehensive characterization of GEF regulatory networks, and innovative clinical trial designs. As we continue to unravel the complexities of GEF signaling, we move closer to realizing their full potential as therapeutic targets for cancer, immunological disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and other conditions where GEF dysregulation plays a central role. The coming decade promises to be an exciting period of discovery and translation in this dynamic field.
