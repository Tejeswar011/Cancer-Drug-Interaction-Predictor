Therefore, we retrospectively evaluated patients with stage I AGCT admitted to our center over the past two decades and systematically analyzed the impact of different surgical modalities on the survival of these patients. Methods All patients with stage I AGCT treated in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from May 1998 to April 2020 were enrolled and analyzed in this retrospective study. Results A total of 101 patients with stage I AGCT were identified, among whom 49 were stage Ia and 52 were stage Ic. The median follow up was 47.7 months. The 10-year cancer specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 90% and 53%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that only surgical extent (conservative vs. radical, HR: 2.738, p-value = 0.034) was an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival. Subgroup analysis suggested that both surgical extent and surgical approach had a significant impact on the disease-free survival of patients with stage Ic (conservative vs. radical, HR: 4.021, p-value = 0.007; laparoscopic vs. open, HR: 2.926, p-value = 0.035) and tumor larger than 5 cm (conservative vs. radical, HR: 4.437, p-value = 0.001; laparoscopic vs. open, HR: 3.367, p-value = 0.006). Conclusions Patients with stage I AGCT generally have a favorable prognosis. Surgical extent is an independent prognostic factor. For high risk patients with stage Ic disease or tumor larger than 5 cm, our study supports the selection of radical and open surgery as a potentially preferred option.

Adult-type ovarian granulosa cell tumor (AGCT) accounts for 95% of all ovarian granulosa cell tumors and belongs to low-grade malignancies [ 1 2 7 8 9 10 11 12 Methods Case selection All confirmed AGCT patients who had surgical treatment in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from May 1998 to April 2020 were initially screened in this retrospective study. The histologic diagnosis of patients was confirmed by two senior pathologists. Staging was determined according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system for epithelial ovarian cancers 2014. Patients with sufficient staging information diagnosed with AGCT Stage I were finally enrolled in this retrospective study. The clincopathological parameters of the cases were retrieved from medical charts. Patient records at our institution are securely archived and maintained by a dedicated department, ensuring full traceability. Additionally, our hospital has a specialized follow-up department that conducts systematic monitoring of all treated patients. To enhance data accuracy, a dual-entry verification system was employed, wherein two independent, experienced physicians performed parallel data entry followed by comprehensive cross-validation procedures. Definition of surgical modalities Complete surgical staging was described as surgery that included exploration of the whole peritoneal cavity, washing cytology, multiple peritoneal biopsies and omentectomy/omental biopsy. Pelvic and/or paraaortic lymph node dissection (PLND or PALND) were optional and performed in selected patients at the surgeon’s discretion. Conservative surgery was described as preservation of at least one adnexa and the uterus, while radical surgery was described as any surgery that included total hysterectomy (TH) and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO). Salvage surgery referred to a re-operation at our hospital after the patient underwent incomplete surgery at an outside hospital. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered only in stage Ic patients. No patients had hormonal therapy after surgery. Statistical analyses Survival data was calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves and examined by log rank test. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to detect prognostic parameters using a cox regression model. For the univariate analysis, all clinically relevant factors potentially influencing survival outcomes were included, based on the biological characteristics of the disease, the authors’ clinical experience, and existing high-quality literature [ 13 15 p Results Patient inclusion and characteristics A total of 133 patients with AGCT were identified by comprehensive search of medical records. Among them, 101 (75.9%) patients were diagnosed with stage I disease, including 49 (36.8%) stage Ia and 52 (39.1%) stage Ic patients. With a median follow up time of 47.7 months (range 4.0 to 246.5 months), a total of 23 (22.7%) patients relapsed including 6 (12.2%) stage Ia and 17 (32.7%) stage Ic patients., 5 (4.9%) patients died of AGCT, and 2 (1.9%) patients died of other causes. All patients were followed up more than one year except for those who died within one year. The managements and outcomes of stage I patients were shown in Fig. 1  Fig. 1 Flow chart of managements and outcomes of patients with stage I AGCT These 101 patients, according to the timing and basis of pathological diagnosis, were categorized into the following three groups: preoperative consultation of paraffin section examination (pre-cPSE) group, intraoperative frozen section examination (intra-FSE) group, and postoperative paraffin section examination (post-PSE) group. There were 18 cases in the pre-cPSE group, who underwent incomplete initial surgery at outside hospitals. Among the remaining 83 cases, intra-FSE findings were consistent with AGCT in 49 cases. The remaining 34 cases, which were reported as suspicious for or could not exclude AGCT intraoperatively, were ultimately diagnosed by post-PSE. The Chi-square test was performed to assess whether the surgical approach (Open vs. Laparoscopic) was influenced by a confirmed or presumed diagnosis (pre-cPSE group vs. intra-FSE group and post-PSE group), and the results revealed no association between the two factors (χ 2 p S1 For those diagnosed with stage I disease, the median age at diagnosis was 45 years old (range 22 to 71 years). All patients achieved optimal cytoreduction. Open and laparoscopic surgery was performed in 68 (67.3%) and 33 (32.7%) patients, respectively. Conservative and radical surgery was performed in 37 (36.6%) and 64 (63.4%) patients, respectively. Forty-two (41.6%) patients received lymphadenectomy, including 21 cases with PLND and 21 cases with both PLND and PALND, the average number of lymph nodes dissected was 28 (range 10–62). However, only one patient who had second cancer history occurred lymphatic metastasis, which was confirmed by pathologists as stage IIIc endometrial adenocarcinoma.

( A B C D The median time to relapse was 72.3 months for these relapsed patients, including 4 (17.4%) patients with recurrence at 0–3 years, 7 (30.4%) patients at 3–5 years, and 12 (52.2%) patients after 5 years. The latest recurrence was observed 14 years after primary treatment. At first relapse, the anatomic positions were mainly located in pelvic cavity (14/23, 60.9%), abdominal cavity (3/23, 13.0%), retroperitoneum (2/23, 8.7%), adnexa (1/23, 4.3%) and multiple positions (3/23, 13.0%). All patients with recurrent tumor received surgical excision and chemotherapy except for one patient who refused chemotherapy. Two patients with retroperitoneal recurrence received radiotherapy. The median follow-up time after recurrence was 54.3 months (range 3.6-196.3 months), and 5 deaths were observed. The prognosis of recurrent AGCT was generally favorable with a five year overall survival rate of 71.9%.

To further evaluate their impact on survival outcomes and address baseline imbalances, we applied IPTW to this retrospective dataset, which resulted in well-balanced covariates between the two surgical groups (shown in Table S3 P Survival impact of surgical modalities on patients with different FIGO substage or tumor size To identify optimal candidates for radical surgery among patients with stage I AGCT, we performed subgroup analyses based on FIGO substage and tumor size—two key clinical decision-making factors. We found that surgical extent had no significant impact on DFS of stage Ia patients (conservative vs. radical surgery HR: 1.747, P P P 3  Fig. 3 Subgroup analysis of surgical modalities. ( A B C D E F Taken that tumor size is an important factor for the decision-making of surgical modalities, a subgroup analysis was performed. For patients with tumor ≤ 5 cm, surgical extent and surgical approach had no impact on DFS (no recurrence in any subgroup). However, for patients with tumor > 5 cm, conservative surgery was significantly associated with decreased DFS compared to radical surgery (HR:4.437, P P 3 Discussion Granulosa cell tumor is a non-epithelial malignant ovarian tumor and the most common form of sex cord-stromal tumor, of which 95% are AGCT and the remaining 5% are juvenile granulosa cell tumor [ 16 17 In this retrospective study, we presented a large cohort of AGCT patients in East Asian population. We found that the majority of patients had onset under 50 years of age (62.4%), most were premenopausal (66.3%), the most common clinical manifestations were abdominal pain (27.7%) and palpable mass (28.7%). By reviewing the literatures published in different regions worldwide, we found that the baseline characteristics of the East Asian population were somewhat different from those of the western countries. East Asian patients had a younger age (median age 45 approximately) of onset and were mostly premenopausal, while a smaller proportion of patients experienced vaginal bleeding [ 2 4 5 7 18 21 In this study, we comprehensively analyzed the prognostic impact of various clinicopathologic factors. We found that intrinsic adverse factors such as advanced FIGO substage, tumor rupture and tumor > 5 cm, were associated with poor prognosis, however, none of them were independent prognostic factors for stage I patients. Interestingly, we discovered that the extent of surgery was an independent prognostic factor. Although the surgical approach did not reach statistical significance, its prognostic trend cannot be ignored. Similarly, multivariate cox analysis about tumor rupture showed downward trend in DFS, although no statistical significant difference was detected. These results may be caused by insufficient sample size. The modality of surgical treatment including surgical approach and surgical extent was a major extrinsic factor affecting the prognosis of patients with early stage AGCT. For young women at child-bearing age who wish to preserve their fertility, conservative surgery is conventionally the preferred surgical treatment [ 22 P 23 P 24 In recent years, the application of laparoscopic surgery in gynecological cancers has been controversial especially in cervical cancer [ 25 P 26 27 Since the incidence of lymph node metastasis in AGCT is as low as 3% approximately [ 28 29 30 32 Several limitations have to be addressed for this study. First, this is a retrospective study spanning over twenty years. During the early phase of the investigation, limited access to telecommunication devices such as mobile phones in China may compromise regular follow-up. Second, treatment decisions were susceptible to multiple confounding factors, including intraoperative assessment inaccuracies, family financial constraints, and patient preferences. Regrettably, due to the scarcity of AGCT [ 13 33 34 Conclusions Patients with stage I AGCT generally have a favorable prognosis. Surgical extent is an independent prognostic factor. For high risk patients with stage Ic disease or tumor larger than 5 cm, our study supports the selection of radical and open surgery as a potentially preferred option. In the future, multi-center randomized controlled trials comparing the survival of patients treated with different surgical modalities are warranted to verify the findings of this study.
