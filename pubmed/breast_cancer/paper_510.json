PANoptosis, a unified programmed cell death pathway driven by the PANoptosome complex, involves the combined activation of pyroptotic, apoptotic, and necroptotic signaling, significantly contributing to renal tissue damage. This review systematically explores PANoptosis’s composition, regulatory mechanisms, and its role in kidney pathologies such as AKI, CKD, DKD, and renal tumors. It also examines the interplay between PANoptosis and key cellular processes like mitochondrial dysfunction, ER stress, non - coding RNAs, ferroptosis, and autophagy. Preclinical studies suggest that targeting PANoptosis - related molecules (e.g., Z-DNA Binding Protein 1(ZBP1), caspase − 8, NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3(NLRP3)) shows therapeutic potential for kidney diseases. However, clinical application is currently limited due to insufficient human data. Future research should focus on validating PANoptosis biomarkers in renal diseases, developing cell - death - context - specific inhibitors and agonists, and clarifying its advantages over single - mode cell death modulation. This review highlights PANoptosis as a promising therapeutic strategy while addressing unresolved issues in nephrology research.

Classical apoptosis, autophagy-dependent death and necrosis have been studied in depth, while novel death modes such as mitochondrial apoptosis, cuproptosis and ferroptosis have been discovered in recent years, revealing the complexity of cell death networks [ 4 5 6 6 PANoptosis is emerging as a key regulator in renal disease pathogenesis. By coordinating pyroptotic, apoptotic, and necroptotic pathways, dysregulated PANoptosis may drive renal tissue damage and contribute to functional loss and chronic inflammation, potentially through damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) like high mobility group box 1 ( HMGB1 IL-1β 7 9 We first outline its molecular composition and activation mechanisms, then analyze its interaction with cellular processes such as autophagy, ER stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Next, we explore its pathogenic contributions across major renal diseases, including AKI, CKD, DKD, and renal tumors, with a focus on clinical correlations. Finally, we evaluate therapeutic strategies targeting PANoptosis regulators and highlight challenges in clinical translation. Components and mechanisms of PANoptosis Discovery of PANoptosis Malireddi et al. introduced PANoptosis, a new type of programmed cell death (PCD), in 2019. While it combines features of necroptosis, apoptosis, and pyroptosis, no single process can fully explain it [ 10 11 12 Assembly of the PANoptosis complex The assembly of the PANoptosome is a key step in PANoptosis. It involves three major protein classes: sensors (e.g., ZBP1 NLRP3 13 ASC FADD 14 RIPK1 RIPK3 caspase-8 caspase-1 15 AIM2 16 ZBP1 17 RIPK3 NLRP3 AIM2 ASC 18 19 20 21 TAK1 PSTPIP2 SHARPIN HOIP HOIL-1 A20 22 Mechanisms of PANoptosis Once PANoptosis complexes form and integrate, they trigger apoptosis, necroptosis, and downstream cellular pyroptosis. Apoptosis can be initiated through two pathways: the intrinsic pathway, mediated by Bcl-2 RIPK3 (MLKL) caspase-4/5/11 1 Figure 1  Fig. 1 Apoptosis: Extrinsic pathway: Initiated by death receptors (e.g., TNF receptors), leading to the activation of Caspase-8 and Caspase-3/7, and culminating in apoptosis. This pathway involves key players like TRADD, TRAF2, and cIAP1/2;Intrinsic pathway: Triggered by mitochondrial release of CytC, which activates Caspase-9 and Caspase-3/7, resulting in apoptosis.Necroptosis: Initiated by RIPK1-mediated activation of RIPK3, followed by phosphorylation of MLKL. This leads to the formation of membrane pores and the release of DAMPs.Pyroptosis: Activated by Caspase-1 (canonical pathway) or Caspase-4/5/11 (non-canonical pathway), which cleave GSDMD to form membrane pores and release IL-1β and IL-18.Apoptosis and Pyroptosis: Caspase-8 can directly activate GSDMD or participate in inflammasome formation to induce pyroptosis. Necroptosis and Pyroptosis: RIPK3/MLKL interacts with the NLRP3 inflammasome, allowing RIPK3 and MLKL to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome under specific conditions. Apoptosis and Necroptosis: Caspase-8 activity determines whether cell death proceeds via apoptosis or necroptosis, with RIPK1 playing a regulatory role in both pathways Crosstalk between apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis PANoptosis can be viewed as a cell death triangle with apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis at its corners. The relationships between these corners illustrate how different types of PCD interact. For example, the interaction between pyroptosis and necroptosis is demonstrated by the mutual regulation of RIPK3/MLKL NLRP3 NLRP3 MLKL RIPK3 MLKL NLRP3 23 Caspase-8 GSDMD 24 caspase-8 caspase-8 RIPK1 RIPK3 PANoptosis interacts with other key intracellular mechanisms PANoptosis and mitochondrial damage Mitochondria are vital intracellular organelles that perform numerous functions, including energy production, metabolic regulation, ROS signaling, calcium homeostasis, and various aspects of cell death mechanisms. They also serve as hubs for endogenous apoptotic pathways triggered by multiple stimuli [ 25 26 Cytc 27 28 29 PANoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress In addition to mitochondrial damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress should not be overlooked in the development of PANoptosis. Endoplasmic reticulum stress is a response mechanism triggered by endoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, which is usually induced by a variety of factors, such as hypoxia, nutritional deficiencies, pathogen infections, and responses to certain drugs, and leads to the accumulation of unfolded proteins. When the endoplasmic reticulum senses abnormally folded proteins, it initiates an unfolded protein response in an attempt to restore endoplasmic reticulum function and avoid cell death. However, if endoplasmic reticulum stress is too severe to be effectively regulated, cell death may result [ 30 31 32 4-phenylbutyric acid MDH1 IDH1 33 PANoptosis and non-coding RNAs Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), as key regulators of gene expression, exhibit an important role in the dynamic regulation of PANoptosis. miRNAs (e.g., miR-21-5p miR-200a-5p RIPK3 34 miR-133a-3p ELAVL1 NLRP3 NLRP3 miR-133a-3p ELAVL1 NLRP3 35 IRF1 EMBP1 miR-454-3p IRF1 NLRP3 36 Furthermore, diabetic nephropathy is associated with increased expression of circHIPK3 CircHIPK3 miR-124-3p 37 PANoptosis and extracellular traps Extracellular traps (neutrophil extracellular traps, NETs) are chromatin reticulations released by immune cells (e.g., neutrophils, macrophages) through specific programmed deaths. These structures are enriched with antimicrobial proteins and histones, which play important roles in pathogen clearance. NETs have been found to play a key role in exacerbating tissue damage in renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals that IRI promotes PANoptosis signaling in proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTs), whereas peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) knockdown inhibits this process. PTs predominantly express RIPK1-PANoptosomes, and in PTs from mice modeling renal IRI, this complex is responsible for executing PANoptosis signaling induced by NETs. The induced PANoptosis involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) released by NETs, which promotes PANoptosis in PTs. TLR3 38 GSDMD 39 PANoptosis and iron death In oxidative stress and metabolic disease settings, ferroptosis—which is marked by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation—is linked to PANoptosis [ 40 Caspase-1 GSDMD-N 41 ACSL4 PUFA 4-HNE CytC 42 AIM2 43 PANoptosis and autophagy Autophagy has a dual nature. Moderate autophagy can protect cells by removing oxidized or damaged protein aggregates. This is especially important in the early stages of AKI, as it supports healing after renal injury and preserves TEC function. However, excessive autophagy can damage the kidneys and promote renal fibrosis. When autophagy is dysregulated, intracellular autophagosomes may excessively degrade proteins and organelles, leading to cellular dysfunction or death. This also impairs the repair capacity of TEC and releases inflammatory substances that worsen renal inflammation. Basal autophagy degrades pan-apoptotic sensors like ZBP1 44 p62 Nrf2/ROS/Drp1 ZBP1 45 RIPK1 RIPK3 46 47 AIM2 ZBP1 AIM2 19 AIM2 AIM2 19 2 Figure 2  Fig. 2 Mechanistic illustration of PANoptosis in cell death and key cellular processes. This figure illustrates the interactions between PANoptosis and various cellular stress mechanisms. PANoptosis integrates multiple cell death pathways, including mitochondrial damage (releasing CytC and DAMPs), endoplasmic reticulum stress (involving MDH1-K118 and IDH1-K93), ferroptosis (linked to ROS and GPX4), autophagy (regulated by Nrf2 and Beclin-1), and non-coding RNAs (such as miR-21-5P and miR-200a-5P). It also highlights the roles of inflammasomes (AIM2-PANoptosome and NLRP3), extracellular traps (dsDNA and TLR3), and other key molecules like ZBP1-PANoptosome and RIPK1 Key factors in PANoptosis Caspase-8 Caspase-8 caspase-3/7 48 GSDMD GSDME 49 RIPK3-MLKL 50 caspase-8 NLRP3 AIM2 16 51 ZBP1 MLKL NLRP3 52 Caspase-8 FLIP 53 O-GlcNAc 54 In summary, caspase-8 caspase-8 TAK1 TAK1 MAPK RIPK1 TAK1 RIPK1 RIPK1 TAK1 RIPK1 FADD/caspase-8 caspase-3/7 GSDMD 55 TAK1-RIPK1 56 In inflammatory signaling, TAK1 TAK1 RIPK1 TNF 55 57 12 TAK1 RIPK1 15 TAK1 PANoptosis activator PANoptosis can act as a compensatory mechanism to mediate programmed cell death to protect the organism. However, excessive PANoptosis may also trigger inflammation. PANoptosis can be activated or enhanced by various activators, either endogenous or exogenous. Endogenous activators are primarily intracellular signaling molecules, like bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and viral RNA, which are recognized by pattern recognition receptors to activate PANoptosis [ 58 1 IRF IRF1 AIM2 59 HSV1 HSV1 IRF1 Aim2 mRNA GBP2 GBP5 60 IRF1 HMGB1 LDH caspase-1 GSDMD caspase-8 caspase-7 caspase-3 MLKL 61 IRF1 ZBP1 ZBP1 6 IFNγ TNF TNF IFNγ IRF1 62 IRF1 NLRP12 PAMP TNF 21 IFN IRF1 YBX1 Y-box-bindingprotein1 63 YBX1 64 YBX1 YBX1 ZBP1 ZBP1 YBX1 ZBP1 ZBP1 YBX1 ZBP1 Zbp1 ZBP1 65 Other activators and pathways Fucoxanthin 66 (TNF)-α IFN-γ 67 HMGB1 68 69 70 In an acute kidney injury model, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α kinase 2 ( EIF2AK2 AIM2 71 RNF180 ZBP1 KLX RNF180-ZBP1 KLX ZBP1 ZBP1 RNF180 72 KLX HOXD10 ZBP1 CD14 Fas IL-1β 73 74 OTA ZBP1 Caspase1/GSDMD Caspase3/7 RIPK3/pMLKL AIM2 75 In addition to the aforementioned cytokines, PANoptosis may be indirectly affected by certain signaling pathways. For example, NF-κB, JNK, and p38MAPK can influence genes related to PANoptosis and manage inflammatory and immune responses, thereby indirectly inducing PANoptosis [ 76 78 CaS2O8 79  Table 1 PANoptosis activators Agent Category Mechanism of Action Key Findings/Models Ref.

However, most evidence to date is derived from preclinical models, with clinical validation remaining limited. Developing safe, effective, and targeted inhibitors for this complex system still confronts multiple hurdles. Further research is imperative to elucidate PANoptosis’s role and evaluate its inhibitors’ translational potential across various diseases, especially in nephrology, where studies are noticeably scarce.

In recent years, it has been found that PANoptosis plays an important role in the development of AKI, including sepsis, hemolysis, ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), and AKI induced by chemicals and herbal medicines. In sepsis models, AIM2 EIF2AK2 AIM2 71 In an ischemia-reperfusion injury model, 3 4-methylenedioxy-β-nitrostyrene NLRP3 IL-1β IL-18 GSDMD MLKL 93 In cisplatin (CDDP)-induced AKI, CDDP buildup in renal tubular cells triggers DNA damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and endoplasmic reticulum stress, ultimately inducing PANoptosis. Persistent inflammation and fibrosis drive AKI progression to CKD. Studies have demonstrated that mentholated flavonoids ( AME Nrf2 94 AAW 31 Atrazine Lycopene 95 Trichloroethylene 96 In aristolochic acid nephropathy HDAC1 HDAC2 HDAC1 HDAC2- romidepsin FK228 FK228 PSTPIP2 97 In summary, PANoptosis—through the interplay of apoptotic, pyroptotic, and necroptotic pathways—contributes to tubular injury in acute kidney injury triggered by sepsis, ischemia–reperfusion, chemotherapeutics, and environmental toxins. Modulating select PANoptotic components (e.g., AIM2, ZBP1, NLRP3) or their upstream regulators (e.g., EIF2AK2, DR5) has been associated with reduced renal inflammation and may influence the trajectory from AKI toward CKD. Future studies should delineate the spatiotemporal specificity of PANoptosis across AKI subtypes to refine the timing and precision of therapeutic interventions. PANoptosis in renal tumors Clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC), as a major subtype of renal malignancy (~ 80% of cases), is characterized by high aggressiveness and immunotherapy resistance. Although immunotherapy has become a standard clinical regimen, the high heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the dynamic changes in the immune infiltration status have led to significant differences in patient prognosis, limiting the efficacy of existing treatment strategies [ 98 99 Multi-omics analysis based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed that PANoptosis-related gene signatures have significant prognostic value for ccRCC. The high-risk PANoptosis phenotype was found to be positively associated with the enrichment of immunosuppressive cells (e.g., M2-type PD-1/PD-L1 99 Immunity Index AIM2 caspase-3/4 TNFRSF10 100 At the epigenetic level, miR-223-3p NLRP3 miR-21-5p miR-200a-5p 7 LINC00944 LINC02611 101 Research on targeted therapies has shown that cucurbitacin E ( CurE CDK1 CurE 102 CDK1 ASC caspase-8 In conclusion, PANoptosis research offers a new approach for kidney cancer precision treatment. However, clinical translation faces many challenges. To accelerate the transition from basic research to clinical application, future studies should focus on addressing these key scientific issues and promoting PANoptosis’s practical use in kidney cancer treatment. This will provide a scientific basis for developing more precise therapeutic strategies. PANoptosis in DKD The gradual loss of glomerular podocytes is a hallmark of diabetic kidney disease, a common glomerular complication of diabetes, and ultimately leads to proteinuria and disruption of the glomerular filtration barrier. While the exact role of PANoptosis in podocyte damage and DKD is still unclear, recent studies have provided new insights. High glucose and inflammatory stimuli (e.g., TNF-α TNFSF10 TRAIL TNFRSF10B (DR5) 103 TRAIL TNF 104 TRAIL/DR5 TRAIL DR5 caspase-3 caspase-1 MLKL 103 TRAIL 105 RIPK3 PGAM5-Drp1 106 In summary, DR5 TRAIL TRAIL DR5 TRAIL/DR5 PANoptosis in CKD Imbalanced patterns of cell death are an important feature of CKD progression. Traditional studies have focused on the independent role of single forms of death (e.g., apoptosis, necrotic apoptosis), but renal injury is often accompanied by the synergistic activation of multiple types of cell death.PANoptosis forms a dynamic “death signaling network” through the integration of molecular switches for focal, apoptotic and necrotic apoptosis (e.g., ZBP1 107 caspase-8 MLKL gasderminD IL-1β 108 FOS/AP-1 ASC NLRP3 109 110 PTGS2 111 112 In addition to PTGS2 FOS MMP9 COL1A1 AP-1/TNF-α 113 114 FOS PTGS2 Importance of PANoptosis in renal disease In renal disease, PANoptosis may be a useful clinical tool for diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. By coordinating apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis, it offers a framework for disease intervention and is linked to renal tissue injury. However, its therapeutic use in nephrology is still mostly experimental. Dynamic expression of PANoptosis - linked molecules like ZBP1 RIPK1 AIM2 115 AIM2 116 GSDMD 117 118 MLKL RIPK1/3 RIPK1/3 119 PANoptosis triggers a dual - role inflammatory response: low activation may aid damaged cell clearance, while high activation might worsen tubulointerstitial inflammation and fibrosis. Overall, while PANoptosis offers an interesting research framework linking cell death to kidney disease, many questions remain about its cell-type-specific regulation, optimal therapeutic timing, and clinical applicability in human nephrology. To reach its full potential, focused translational research and critical assessment of current findings are needed. Summary The role of PANoptosis in renal disease pathophysiology is gaining attention, but its translation to clinical use faces numerous hurdles. First, the specific molecular regulatory network of PANoptosis in renal disease remains unclear. Further research is needed to clarify the roles of key molecules like ZBP1 AIM2 While PANoptosis is increasingly recognized as important in renal disease pathogenesis, several obstacles must be overcome for its clinical application. One major challenge is the lack of clarity on the precise molecular regulation of PANoptosis in different kidney pathologies. Functions of key molecules like ZBP1 AIM2 Lastly, cross-species validation of PANoptosis pathways is often inconsistent. For instance, differential TRAIL/DR5 sDR5-Fc Despite these challenges and the paucity of research on PANoptosis in immune-mediated kidney disorders like IgA nephropathy, lupus nephritis, and ANCA-associated vasculitis, PANoptosis offers advantages over conventional cell death models. Its integration of key execution components from necroptosis, apoptosis, and pyroptosis within the PANoptosome complex provides a more effective treatment approach. This integration can overcome compensatory mechanisms limiting single-pathway blockage and offer strong immunomodulatory effects. With its natural translational potential and the ongoing development of specific PANoptosis activators and inhibitors, PANoptosis is a promising framework for new nephrology therapies, despite being in its early stages.
