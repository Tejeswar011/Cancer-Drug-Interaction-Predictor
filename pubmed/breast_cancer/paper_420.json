Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers globally, with nearly 1 million new cases diagnosed annually. It is a complex disease, with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections being the most common etiological factors worldwide. Despite advances in therapy, survival rates for advanced and/or metastatic HCC remain low, with mortality rates 2.3 times higher in men than women. The liver’s immune system typically maintains an anti-inflammatory environment, contributing to immune tolerance to exogenous, food-derived antigens. However, disruption of the balanced interplay between immune factors within the hepatic microenvironment—due to viral hepatitis, excessive alcohol intake, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)—can lead to chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, a cumulative mutational burden, cirrhosis, and eventually, malignant transformation. Once HCC is established, however, a functional pro-inflammatory immune response becomes critical to controlling tumor progression, as evidenced by the recent success of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatments in HCC patients. In addition to ICIs, other novel immunotherapeutic intervention strategies, such as cancer vaccines and adoptive T cell therapies, are currently being investigated. Furthermore, adequate nutrition plays a critical role in modulating immune function, with vitamin D being a key nutrient for immune/regulation. In this review, we will discuss the potential role of vitamin D in HCC immunity and recent immunotherapeutic advances in the management of this malignancy. cancer vitamin D HCC liver tumor microenvironment vaccines artificial intelligence technology The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Nutritional Immunology Introduction Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer in the world, with more than 1 million cases expected to be diagnosed in 2025 ( 1 2 3 4 The liver has a complex and dynamic cellular immune microenvironment that includes combinations of cytotoxic, helper and regulatory T lymphocytes, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), dendritic cells (DCs), and natural killer (NK) cells ( 5 6 7 8 9–11 12 13 One of the most valuable micronutrients, with regards to immune function, is vitamin D ( 14 15 16 Given that HCC is widely regarded as a chemo-resistant malignancy, targeted therapeutic approaches have been developed, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, and cabozantinib, as well as antiangiogenic agents like bevacizumab and ramucirumab. These therapies, whether used individually or in combination, have demonstrated significant clinical benefits, leading to their approval for the treatment of advanced HCC ( 17 Figure 1 18 19 Figure 1 Comprehensive overview of the immune system, checkpoint inhibitors and HCC. Illustration of cancer immunotherapy depicting cancer cells, cytotoxic T cells, dendritic cells (DC), regulatory T cells (Treg), and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in a colorful microscopic view. The sidebar lists various antibody drugs, including Tislelizumab and Pembrolizumab, with corresponding action mechanisms, like anti-PD-L1/PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 Ipilimumab. Each cell type and interaction is highlighted with vivid colors and labeled connections. Cancer vaccines stimulate the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. They fall into two categories: prophylactic and therapeutic. Prophylactic vaccines prevent cancer by targeting cancer-causing viruses or bacteria, for example, the HPV vaccine prevents cervical and other HPV-related cancers ( 20 21–27 28–33 34 35 36 37 Hepatocellular carcinoma and its immunological microenvironment To manage the constant influx of intestinal antigens, the liver maintains a largely tolerogenic immune environment, unlike most organs ( 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 + 48 49 50 51 52 53 40 54 55 56 + + 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65–67 68 69 41 70 71 62 72 73 + 74 52 75–77 78 79 + 80 Role of vitamin D on inflammation, immunity and management of HCC Vitamin D is a fat-soluble nutrient essential for various physiological processes, including calcium and phosphorus absorption, immune regulation, and cell growth and differentiation. Although the underlying mechanisms are still being studied, evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency contributes to the development of immune-related disorders and cancers, including HCC ( 81–90 Figure 2 91 81 92 84 91 93 94 2+ 2+ 95–98 Figure 3 99 100 93 101 82 Figure 4 17 102 103 104 105 106 107 2 2 2 108–110 111 112–114 2 93 2 1 17 2 115–117 2 118–121 + + 122 2 123–127 2 128–130 2 110 131 2 132–134 Table 1 2 135–140 2 141 + 142–145 2 146–149 2 150–156 2 157–161 2 162 2 163 164 Figure 2 Diagram illustrating human diseases linked to vitamin D deficiency. Flowchart illustrating diseases associated with Vitamin D deficiency. Central box labeled \"Vitamin D Deficiency\" has arrows pointing to: Type 1 Diabetes, Multiple Sclerosis, Pulmonary Diseases (asthma, tuberculosis, sepsis, chronic pulmonary obstructive disease), Skin Diseases (psoriasis, urticaria, dermatitis), Rheumatic Diseases (lupus, sclerosis, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis), and Cancers (prostate, liver, colon, pancreatic, breast, skin, thyroid, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma). Figure 3 Vitamin D regulates hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, stellate cells, and liver cancer cells through VDR-dependent pathways. It reduces inflammation and stellate cell activation, while in HCC cells it exerts anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic, anti-angiogenic, and pro-differentiative effects via multiple signaling cascades. Diagram illustrating Vitamin D's role in regulating pathways. It inhibits inflammation via STAT3, TGF-B1, and cytokines; reduces cancer proliferation through p27^kip, YAP/TAZ, and CTGF; and limits EMT-invasion with miR 375, YAP-1, and c-myc. Figure 4 Vitamin D has been linked to impaired function of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, increasing susceptibility to the development and progression of various diseases. Diagram illustrating vitamin D immune surveillance. The diagram highlights three components: \"Innate immunity\" with natural killer cells, gamma delta cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils; \"Angiogenesis factors\" with VEGF and MMPs; and \"Anti-inflammatory effects\" including immune activation, combination therapy, immunomodulatory, anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic effect, and regulation of the cell cycle. Arrows point from each component to \"Vitamin D Immune Surveillance\" at the bottom. Table 1 Vitamin D modulates both innate and adaptive immunity by interacting with a variety of immune cell types and influencing key immune processes.

Therapeutic use of vitamin D in cancer: animal and human studies Despite promising epidemiological and preclinical data indicating that 1,25(OH)₂D signaling may offer a preventive or therapeutic strategy against various cancers, including HCC, several challenges have limited confirmation in clinical settings. The primary concern is the risk of hypercalcemia and its associated adverse effects ( 165 166 167 in vivo 168 169 170 In vivo 157 171 in vitro 83 Bacteroides fragilis 172 2 173–177 in vivo 178 179 2 2 2 p 2 p 180 2 107 Emerging immunotherapies in HCC Systemic treatment of HCC is particularly challenging due to its intrinsic chemoresistance and the frequent presence of underlying liver dysfunction, factors that contribute to increased toxicity, limited treatment efficacy, and poor outcomes ( 17 Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in HCC Immune molecular checkpoints deliver inhibitory signals to different cellular components of the immune system and interfere with their ability to recognize and mount an effective response against cancer cells. The use of specific antibodies that block activation of these regulatory molecules associated with immune exhaustion (i.e., CTLA-4, PD-1 and PD1-L1), and known ICIs has rapidly extended the therapeutic armamentarium against HCC and other malignancies. The fully human CTLA-4 inhibitor, tremelimumab, was first tested in advanced, HCV-associated HCC patients, showing a response rate (RR) of 17%, a median time to progression (TTP) of 6.5 months and a probability of 1 year survival of 43% ( 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 Evidence shows that in various cancers, including HCC, Vitamin D modulates immune responses and inflammatory processes within the TME by influencing both innate and adaptive immunity. Through these mechanisms, it may decrease immune tolerance to ICIs and synergistically improve their therapeutic efficacy. As above discussed, it is important to note that a wide range of immune cells, including T cells and macrophages, express both the VDR and 1α-hydroxylase. This dual expression endows these cells with critical functions: they can directly respond to vitamin D signaling, influencing immune responses, and they are also capable of locally activating vitamin D within tissues. Vitamin D modulates immune cells, reducing immunosuppression within the tumor microenvironment and thereby enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of ICIs. Vitamin D can increase CD8 + Challenges associated with ICI therapy Although ICIs are effective against many cancers, most patients eventually develop resistance. These therapies are costly and often inaccessible to patients in low-income regions or without insurance. Additionally, a small subset of patients experienced severe immune-related toxicities affecting organs like the colon, brain, skin, eyes, and liver, requiring immunosuppressive treatment. With new ICIs emerging, further research is needed to better understand their molecular mechanisms, resistance pathways, and ways to reduce side effects, particularly in HCC. Vaccine therapy in HCC Cancer vaccine therapy aims to induce tumor control and/or sustained remission in cancer patients by promoting the detection, identification and eradication of malignant cells by the immune system, representing a promising immunotherapeutic strategy against HCC. As previously mentioned, cancer vaccines fall into two main categories: preventive and therapeutic. Preventive vaccines have shown efficacy in patients with established risk factors, such as viral infections, and vaccination against HBV and HPV has been successful in preventing HCC and cervical cancer, respectively. This preventive vaccination strategy may stimulate immune responses against early-stage malignancies, halting cancer progression in high-risk individuals ( 189 190 191 192 193 Peptide-based cancer vaccines Peptide-based cancer vaccines have shown potential in HCC treatment by inducing targeted immunity TSAs. Glypican-3 (GPC3) is an HCC TAA that has been explored clinically as a therapeutic target. Sawada and coworkers conducted a phase I study of a GPC3-peptide vaccine in HCC patients and reported its association with specific immune responses without meaningful adverse reactions ( 194 195 196 Viral vector-based cancer vaccines Based on viruses’ innate ability to infiltrate cells, the use of viral vector cancer vaccines represents a powerful method for delivering TSAs and triggering a cancer-specific immune response ( 197 198 199 + + + + DNA and mRNA-based cancer vaccines A phase I clinical trial assessed the safety and immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine encoding the HCC-associated peptide GPC3, demonstrating good tolerability and GPC3-specific immune responses in a subset of patients ( 194 200 201 202 Dendritic cell-based cancer vaccines Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized APCs that initiate and regulate immune responses by capturing tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) and presenting them to T cells. DC-based cancer vaccines involve isolating precursor monocytes, differentiating them into DCs ex vivo 203 p 204 205 p p 206 + + p 207 Challenges in the development of cancer vaccines Widespread clinical use of cancer vaccines faces many challenges, including selecting specific immunogenic TSAs, high costs, complex and unstandardized manufacturing, regulatory barriers, identifying ideal patient groups, and competition in immunotherapy. The biggest challenge is finding effective, specific antigenic targets, crucial for vaccine success. Cancer’s evolving mutations create neoantigens, expanding the antigenic landscape and enabling personalized vaccines tailored to individual tumors. Advances in digital medicine and AI are helping to quickly identify these targets, and integrating data mining, machine learning, and AI will be key to making cancer vaccines widely available. Adoptive cell therapy in HCC Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) infuses immune cells, such as LAK, CIK, NK cells, TILs, or engineered T cells, expanded or modified ex vivo 208 209 210 211 212 NCT02008929 NCT02854839 213 NCT03132792 214 31 215 216 NCT03132792 NCT04368182 NCT03971747 NCT03441100 217 218 219 220 28 29 30 221–224 225 + NCT03198546 29 226 227 NCT05131763 NCT03013712 Vitamin D modulates both T cell activation and immune suppression, potentially influencing the efficacy of adoptive cell therapy. While maintaining adequate vitamin D levels may benefit patients undergoing immunotherapy, the underlying mechanisms and optimal levels are still under investigation. Recently, Nath et al. ( 228 Challenges for TCR and CART-based ACT TCR-based therapies are limited to recognizing “matched” and relatively common, HLA alleles (such as HLA-A*02:01) to mount an appropriate anticancer response ( 15 181 in vivo Immunotherapy and artificial intelligence The intersection of cancer immunotherapy and artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for advancing these rapidly evolving fields. AI technologies can accelerate the development of immunotherapy by predicting the immunogenicity of antigenic candidates, assessing their efficacy, and optimizing their composition to induce robust, cancer-specific immune responses. Current algorithms can analyze vast genomic, proteomic, and immunological datasets, enabling the identification of therapeutic targets with greater efficiency and supporting the development of personalized treatments, including antibody therapy, vaccines, and adoptive cell transfer (ACT) ( 229 230 231 232 233–235 236 Conclusion and future perspectives HCC remains a major global health challenge with limited benefit from conventional therapies. Immunotherapy, particularly ICIs, has improved outcomes but is not curative. Combining ICIs with targeted agents shows promise in enhancing response rates and reducing relapse, yet patient outcomes remain highly variable. Resistance, driven by tumor heterogeneity, immunosuppressive cell recruitment, and onco-fetal niches, remains poorly understood ( 237–239 240 241 Bacteroides fragilis 242 243 Author contributions MC-I: Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Writing – original draft, Writing – review & editing.
