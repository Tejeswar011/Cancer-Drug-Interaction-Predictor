Accumulating experimental evidence suggests that CD44 is not merely a passive marker of mesenchymal cell activation but rather an active signaling hub driving fibrosis in many organs, including the lung, skin, heart, and liver. Its involvement in fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts, as well as induction of the invasive phenotype of these cells, shows striking analogies to the mechanisms of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) known from cancer progression. In this paper, we discuss both the molecular mechanisms of CD44-dependent signaling (including through EGFR, MAPK/ERK, CaMKII, lipid rafts, and Smad) and the influence of its modulation (knockout, antibodies, blockade of HA synthesis) on the course of fibrosis in in vitro and in vivo models. In addition, we present the influence of environmental pollutants—such as heavy metals, particulate matter, endocrine disruptors, and microplastics—on the activation of the HA-CD44 axis in connective tissue, with particular emphasis on their role in the induction of chronic inflammation, EMT, and extracellular matrix deposition. The collected evidence suggests that CD44 serves as a central integrator of inflammatory and fibrogenic signals, and its pharmacological modulation may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for treating fibrotic diseases and chronic inflammatory conditions.

Introduction Connective tissue is a highly organized biological structure that plays a key role not only in providing support and mechanical integrity of organs, but also in maintaining the homeostasis of the cellular microenvironment. It participates in regenerative processes, the transmission of biochemical and immunological signals, and in creating a protective barrier against pathogenic factors. An essential element regulating these functions is surface receptors, which enable bidirectional communication between cells and the components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 In physiological conditions, CD44 regulates several biological processes, including adhesion and migration of fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and progenitor cells, participates in the recruitment of immunocompetent cells, and also participates in mechanotransduction, ECM remodeling, and myofibroblast differentiation [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 At the same time, increasing environmental pollution—including air, water, and soil—is associated with an increase in the incidence of immunological disorders and chronic tissue-based diseases. Particularly hazardous are particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), heavy metals (e.g., cadmium, lead, and arsenic), endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs, such as phthalates and bisphenol A), dioxins, and micro- and nanoplastics. Exposure to these substances can lead to oxidative stress, epigenetic modifications, damage to cell membranes, and activation of macrophages. As a result, ECM fragments are released, including degraded HA, which, as a DAMP (damage-associated molecular pattern) molecule, can strongly bind to CD44, activating pro-inflammatory, cytokine, and pro-fibrotic cascades [ 23 24 These observations support the hypothesis that CD44 functions not only as an adhesion receptor but also as a sensor of environmental signals, integrating external stimuli with the cellular response and the remodeling of the tissue microenvironment [ 23 This paper aims to review the current literature on the expression, structure, and function of the CD44 protein, with a particular emphasis on its role as a key regulator of biological processes in connective tissue. An additional goal is to analyze the impact of environmental pollution factors, including chemicals, dust, heavy metals, and microplastics, on the regulation of the CD44 signaling pathway and its interactions with hyaluronan. Particular attention was paid to molecular mechanisms that may provide a basis for using CD44 as a biomarker of environmental exposure or a therapeutic target in diseases associated with chronic inflammation and connective tissue degradation. 2. Molecular Characteristics of the CD44 Protein: Structure, Isoforms, Biological Functions The CD44 protein (also known as the CD44 antigen) is a cell surface glycoprotein encoded by the CD44 gene in humans (uniprot.org). It belongs to the family of CD (cluster of differentiation) particles, such as the CD44 antigen. The CD44 gene is located on chromosome 11 (region 11p13) and is sometimes referred to by various synonyms, including LHR, MDU2, MDU3 MIC4 25 Homing Cell Adhesion Molecule 26 a b b a 25 27 28 In the UniProt database, CD44 is listed under the accession number P16070 29 Table 1 12 30 31 2.1. Biological Functions CD44 is a transmembrane adhesion glycoprotein belonging to the class I receptor family, playing a crucial role in a wide range of biological processes, including both physiological mechanisms of homeostasis and pathological changes associated with inflammatory and neoplastic diseases [ 12 32 4 13 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 Table 2 In the context of the immune system, CD44 is involved in the adhesion and migration of leukocytes, enables the homing of T lymphocytes to lymphoid organs, and participates in the processes of their activation, survival, and proliferation [ 43 44 45 Hematopoietic Cell E-/L-selectin Ligand 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 15 16 17 18 19 30 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 CD44 activation leads to the mobilization of calcium ions, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and alterations in cell adhesion and morphology, which are essential components of processes such as migration, proliferation, differentiation, and inflammatory responses [ 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 Figure 1 4 70 71 72 73 74 75 2.2. Subcellular Localization and Expression Profile of CD44 Isoforms CD44 tends to preferentially localize in specialized domains of the cell membrane, particularly on the surface of microvilli and other membrane protrusions that increase the cell’s surface area of contact with its environment. In dynamic conditions, such as migration or cellular reorganization processes, this receptor concentrates in regions of active cell movement, including within the structures of membrane protrusions—lamellipodia and filopodia [ 80 81 82 55 83 From the cytoplasmic side, the intracellular domain of CD44 interacts with the ERM family of anchoring proteins (ezrin, radexin, moesin), which connect it to the cortical layer of the actin cytoskeleton ( Table 3 52 54 56 84 85 In terms of tissue expression, CD44 has a wide distribution and is constitutively expressed on the surface of many cell types, including both hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells [ 91 92 93 CD44 10 25 83 94 95 2.3. Protein Structure and Isoforms CD44 is a protein characterized by a differentiated domain architecture, the structure of which determines the receptor’s ability to participate in dynamic adhesion processes, signaling, and spatial organization of the cell ( Table 4 96 97 The most extensive part of the molecule is the extracellular domain (residues 21–649), which is responsible for direct interaction with extracellular matrix ligands. Its N-terminal part contains a conserved LINK-type domain, with a structure homologous to glycosaminoglycan-binding proteins, which ensures high affinity for HA and ligand selectivity. In the further part of the extracellular domain, there are regions encoded by alternative exons, the presence of which is the result of the differential splicing mechanism. These fragments, often rich in hydroxyl residues (serine, threonine) and proline residues, are potential sites of post-translational modifications, including O-glycosylation and the attachment of glycosaminoglycan chains (e.g., chondroitin sulfate), which functionally classifies CD44 as a transmembrane proteoglycan. Additionally, the presence of conserved N-glycosylation sites on asparagine residues affects the protein’s proper folding, conformational stability, and correct localization in the plasma membrane [ 25 98 99 The extracellular domain is separated from the cytoplasmic domain by a transmembrane segment (residues 650–670), which takes the form of a hydrophobic α-helix stably anchored in the lipid bilayer. This region is rich in apolar residues, such as leucine, alanine, and valine, which are responsible for the correct placement of the molecule in the membrane and the orientation of the domains. Specifically, the N-terminus is located on the external side, while the C-terminus is positioned in the cytoplasm. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (residues 671–742), devoid of a permanent tertiary structure (intrinsically disordered region), shows high functional flexibility and plays a central role in signal transduction. It contains basic motifs (rich in lysine and arginine) and serine-threonine phosphorylation sites, regulating signaling activity and the stability of interactions with molecular partners. Of key importance are the bindings to adaptor proteins of the ERM family (ezrin, radexin, moesin), which enable anchoring of the receptor in membrane domains with high signaling activity (e.g., lipid rafts) and physical coupling with the actin cytoskeleton. Through these interactions, CD44 integrates signals from the cellular environment, influencing the reorganization of cytoskeletal structures, cell polarity, and its motility and invasiveness [ 25 30 100 101 102 2.3.1. Alternative Splicing of the CD44 The CD44 Table 5 Figure 2 99 100 101 103 The reference isoform is considered to be P16070-1, which includes the complete set of possible exons and encodes a 742-residue polypeptide of approximately 82 kDa. Although sometimes referred to as CD44H or the “full” form of CD44, it is not the same as the so-called standard isoform (CD44s), which in cell biology nomenclature means a simplified, shortened version devoid of variant exons. CD44s corresponds to the P16070-2 isoform and is widely expressed in hematopoietic cells, such as T lymphocytes, where it functions as a basal adhesion receptor. In addition to these two basic variants, numerous isoforms with specific tissue expression or characteristic of pathological conditions have been identified. An example is the P16070-10 isoform, known as CD44E, which occurs in epithelial cells and lacks exons 6–11; this variant often correlates with the presence and aggressiveness of epithelial neoplasms. Another isoform, CD44R2 (P16070-11), lacks exons 6–13, whereas CDw44 (isoform 12) includes a form that excludes exons 6–14, which was initially detected in reticulocytes. Another interesting variant is CD44R5 (isoform 14), in which sequences encoded by exons 6–11, 13, and 14 are excluded, which significantly affects the topology of the extracellular domain. In turn, the Hermes isoform (P16070-15), which lacks exons 6–14 and 19, has been described as an antigen involved in lymphocyte homing—the ability of lymphocytes to migrate and colonize lymphoid organs selectively. Of particular note is the P16070-19 isoform, known as CD44RC, which is a soluble form lacking a transmembrane segment that can be released into the extracellular environment; it has an increased ability to bind hyaluronic acid and can act as a so-called decoy receptor, modulating the availability of the ligand for other forms of CD44. The expression of individual CD44 isoforms is precisely regulated in a manner dependent on the stage of development, cell type, and physiological or pathological condition of the organism. In healthy somatic tissues, the standard form of the protein dominates, while isoforms containing additional exons, collectively referred to as CD44v (variant), appear with greater frequency in pathological conditions, especially in the context of cancer. Molecular observations indicate that variants containing exons v6 and v10 correlate with the intensity of invasive and metastatic features of cancer cells, which suggests their significant participation in the clinical progression of the disease [ 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 ijms-26-08870-t005_Table 5 Table 5 Summary of CD44 Isoforms (based on [ 106 108 109 110 111 112 113 Isoform Length (aa) Mass (Da) pI % Hydrophilic % Hydrophobic Description P16070-1 742 81,538 4.98 57.95% 42.05% Canonical isoform.

Diagram shows the canonical CD44 isoform (P16070-1) and numerous alternatively spliced variants, showing their exonic composition within the N-terminal domain, the variable region (alternative splicing), and the C-terminal domain. Exons encoding the constant N-terminal region (S1–S5, blue) are present in all major variants, while the central variable region (V2–V10, purple/green) reflects the high splicing diversity. The C-terminal region (S6–S10, blue) is conserved in most isoforms, accounting for the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Green labels indicate exons with alternative splice donor/acceptor sites. Individual isoforms (e.g., CD44v2, CD44v4, CD44v6, CD44R1, Hermes) differ in the characteristic presence or absence of selected exons, which determines their diverse biological functions, such as adhesion, cell migration, regulation of the immune response or cancer progression (based on [ 106 108 109 110 111 112 113 2.3.2. Protein Interactions and Complexes CD44 acts as a dynamic transmembrane receptor that integrates signals from the extracellular and intracellular spaces. Its extracellular domain enables the binding of extracellular matrix components, such as hyaluronic acid, collagens, osteopontin, or fibronectin, which promote cell adhesion, migration, and communication with the environment [ 107 114 108 109 115 116 117 118 119 Figure 3 2.3.3. Post-Translational Modifications (PTMs) The CD44 protein is subject to numerous post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are crucial for its localization, stability, molecular interactions, and biological functions. The most important of these include glycosylation, phosphorylation, and proteolysis, as well as rarer modifications such as ubiquitination. Variability in the type, location, and intensity of these modifications contributes to the considerable functional heterogeneity of CD44, especially in the context of tumor pathologies and interactions with the extracellular matrix ( Table 6 3. The Role of CD44 in Pathologies In addition to its physiological functions, CD44 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neoplastic, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases, where its expression and function change. Different CD44 isoforms (standard and variant) play various roles depending on the disease context [ 12 129 141 142 143 144 Table 7 In the context of neoplastic diseases, CD44 acts in a multidirectional manner, promoting the malignant phenotype of cells. Overexpression of this protein is common in tumors showing features of invasiveness, resistance to treatment, and high metastatic potential. CD44-positive cells are characterized by the activation of signaling pathways that increase their survival, migration, and resistance to environmental stress, especially in hypoxic conditions and during cytotoxic therapies. CD44 interacts with the tumor microenvironment, influencing its remodeling, and also supports the formation of pre-metastatic niches through adhesion to the extracellular matrix and localization of proteases, such as MMP-9, on the cell surface [ 145 146 Variant isoforms, including CD44v6 and CD44v3, play an additional role—they participate in angiogenesis, activation of MET and VEGFR2 receptors, and binding of growth factors using heparan sulfate residues [ 147 148 149 150 151 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 In lupus nephritis (LN), the presence of CD44 on tubular epithelial cells and infiltrating leukocytes is associated with increased inflammation and fibrosis. Inhibition of CD44 activity in a mouse model led to reduced proteinuria, collagen deposition, and lymphocytic infiltration [ 140 157 158 129 141 142 143 144 145 159 ijms-26-08870-t007_Table 7 Table 7 Pathological role of CD44 in selected disease entities (based on [ 74 135 146 147 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 Disease/Cancer Type Role of CD44 CD44 Isoforms Mechanism of Action Clinical Significance Breast cancer CSC marker, EMT, therapy resistance CD44s, CD44^high STAT3 and PI3K/Akt activation; splicing toward CD44s Poor prognosis, tumor recurrence Pancreatic cancer Invasion, metastasis CD44v6 MMP-9 localization, interactions with HA Promotes metastasis, reduces overall survival (OS) Lung cancer Proliferation, chemoresistance CD44v MET/VEGFR2, PI3K/Akt signaling Accelerated tumor growth Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Leukocyte adhesion, fibroblast activation CD44v (various) HA interactions, pannus formation CD44 blockade reduces inflammation Lupus nephritis (LN) Inflammation, renal fibrosis CD44s, sCD44 CD4+, CD19+ recruitment, fibroblast activation Disease activity biomarker, therapeutic target Crohn’s disease IL-6 production, Treg deficiency CD44v7 Interaction with osteopontin CD44v7 blockade protects against colitis 3.1. CD44 as a Regulator of Tissue Fibrosis and Myofibroblast Differentiation Fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts is an essential step in the repair and fibrotic processes that occur in response to tissue damage. Myofibroblasts, through the expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and contractile properties, are capable of remodeling the ECM and restoring tissue integrity ( Figure 4 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 175 182 183 184 Despite lacking its kinase activity, CD44 plays a crucial role in initiating signaling cascades by forming dynamic complexes with other membrane receptors and adaptor proteins. One of the most critical mechanisms of CD44 signaling activation is its functional cooperation with the EGFR, which is conditioned by the presence of HA and TGF-β1. In response to these signals, CD44 and EGFR co-localize in lipid rafts—specialized microdomains of the cell membrane rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids, which are platforms for concentrating signaling components. The formation of the CD44–EGFR complex within lipid rafts is necessary for the activation of intracellular pathways leading to the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts [ 185 186 167 176 187 188 189 Notably, the functionality of lipid rafts appears to be critical for effective CD44-dependent signaling. Restriction of HA synthesis—e.g., by knockdown of the HAS2 30 Figure 4 The multifunctional role of CD44 in fibrosis and myofibroblast differentiation (based on [ 175 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 190 3.2. In Vitro and In Vivo Experimental Evidence for the Role of CD44 in Fibrosis (Lung, Skin, Heart, Liver) In numerous experimental models, activation of the HA–CD44 pathway has been shown to promote the transformation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, as well as to maintain their pro-fibrotic phenotype. This relationship has been confirmed both in vitro studies on fibroblasts isolated from human and animal tissues, as well as in vivo studies in animal models of fibrosis of various organs. Notably, interventions targeting CD44, such as its genetic silencing or antibody blockade, effectively limit collagen deposition, reduce fibroblast activation, and slow the progression of fibrosis ( Table 8 Accumulating preclinical data from various in vitro and in vivo models indicate that modulation of CD44 activity, both through genetic interventions and pharmacological approaches, significantly affects the course and intensity of fibrotic processes in numerous organs. These results support the view that CD44 is not only a marker of the profibrotic phenotype but also plays a role as an actively involved mediator of fibrosis pathogenesis, integrating extracellular with intracellular transduction pathways that lead to fibroblast activation, myofibroblast induction, and the overproduction of ECM components. In several animal models, the genetic deletion of CD44 (Cd44 − − 198 199 200 It is worth emphasizing that similar effects were also obtained using the CD44 immunoneutralization strategy. Administration of monoclonal antibodies directed against CD44 (e.g., clone IM7) to mice resulted in a significant attenuation of the progression of liver and lung fibrosis, which was accompanied by a reduction in the expression of activated myofibroblast markers (e.g., α-SMA) and a decrease in the collagen content in the ECM [ 201 202 203 204 205 4 206 207 208 3.3. CD44 and the Invasive Phenotype of Myofibroblasts—Analogies to EMT in Cancer Advanced stages of fibrotic processes are characterized by the emergence of a population of myofibroblasts with an invasive phenotype, which acquire the ability to migrate actively, degrade the ECM, and penetrate surrounding tissue structures. This aggressive phenotype not only maintains the chronic profibrotic state but also promotes spatial expansion of fibrosis and its progression towards adjacent, previously unchanged organ areas [ 192 209 210 211 What is particularly important from the point of view of pathobiological mechanisms is that the behavior of invasive myofibroblasts during advanced fibrosis exhibits striking similarities to the phenotype of cancer cells undergoing EMT. This fundamental phenomenon facilitates the migration, invasion, and formation of metastases by cancer cells. In both cases, increased cell motility, cytoskeletal reorganization, degradation of the basement membrane, and reprogramming of cell adhesion genes, such as E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin, are observed [ 212 213 214 Fibroblasts isolated from the fibrotic lungs of patients with IPF exhibit a highly invasive phenotype that resembles that of EMT cells in terms of their behavior. They can degrade ECM components, cross the basement membrane barrier, and move toward chemotactic gradients—characteristics of transformed cancer cells. A key molecular factor enabling this phenotype is signaling initiated by the HA–CD44 complex. Blocking CD44 or interrupting its interaction with HA (e.g., by using neutralizing antibodies) has been shown to effectively abolish the ability of myofibroblasts to degrade matrix and migrate, thereby inhibiting the progression of fibrosis [ 214 215 216 217 An analogous mechanism is observed in the context of malignant tumor progression. During EMT, induced, among other things, by the action of TGF-β1, epithelial cells acquire the features of mesenchymal cells, which allows them to detach from the primary tumor focus and initiate invasion. In many tumor models (including breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer), TGF-β1 has been shown to induce de novo HA synthesis and CD44 expression, which leads to the formation of the HA–CD44 complex and its interaction with kinase receptors such as EGFR. This signaling axis leads to the activation of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways, as well as cytoskeletal reorganization, resulting in the loss of epithelial features, increased invasiveness, and the acquisition of the complete EMT phenotype [ 216 218 219 220 4. Impact of Environmental Pollutants on CD44 in Connective Tissue Environmental factors, including heavy metals, particulate matter, endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), and microplastics, can impact the function and expression of CD44, thereby modulating inflammatory and fibrotic processes in connective tissue. The characteristic tissue response to these factors is chronic damage with concomitant inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling. 4.1. Heavy Metals Exposure to toxic metals (e.g., lead, cadmium) disrupts the homeostasis of the immune system and connective tissue functions, including the regulation of leukocyte adhesion molecules. It has been observed that chronic exposure to lead leads to a decrease in CD44 expression on the surface of blood cells, for example, in children living in areas contaminated with electronic waste (e-waste). High blood Pb levels have been correlated with lower expression of CD44 and CD58 adhesion molecules on erythrocytes [ 200 201 202 203 204 4.2. Particulate Matter (PM) Air pollutants, especially fine PM 2 5 205 206 207 208 2 5 192 208 209 210 211 4.3. Endocrine-Disrupting Compounds (EDCs) EDCs include pesticides, bisphenols (e.g., BPA), phthalates—substances capable of interfering with the endocrine system and causing abnormal metabolic and inflammatory responses. Increasing evidence suggests that exposure to EDCs can stimulate processes characteristic of EMT (epithelial–mesenchymal transition) and fibrosis in various tissues. For example, bisphenol A (BPA) and styrene derivatives can induce EMT in epithelial cells of the respiratory and reproductive systems. Under the influence of these compounds, epithelial cells undergo a transition to a mesenchymal phenotype, becoming more migratory and invasive [ 211 212 213 214 215 213 214 215 216 218 219 4.4. Microplastics Microscopic plastic particles (originating from degradation of packaging, textiles, or tire abrasion, among others) are a ubiquitous environmental pollutant. They can enter the body through ingestion or inhalation. It has been proven that the accumulation of microplastics in tissues causes inflammatory reactions and fibrosis and also disrupts the composition of the microbiome [ 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 Table 9 5. Limitations and Future Research Directions Despite the abundant evidence indicating the vital role of CD44 in the pathogenesis of tissue fibrosis and inflammatory responses, the current state of knowledge is primarily based on preclinical models, mainly animal and in vitro studies. There is a lack of extensive translational and clinical studies confirming the efficacy and safety of CD44 targeting in humans. Most interventions (e.g., neutralizing antibodies, gene knockouts, or HA synthesis inhibitors) have been performed under controlled conditions, which limits their direct translation into the complex environment of the human body. In addition, the heterogeneity of CD44 isoforms (CD44s, CD44v3, v6, v7, etc.) and their dynamic expression, which varies depending on the cell type, inflammation, or microenvironment, makes it challenging to determine which form of the molecule is the key pathogenic factor. Most studies do not distinguish between isoforms in analyses, which may mask subtle but critical functional differences. Another limitation is the insufficient understanding of the long-term effects of modulating the CD44–HA axis. Although inhibition of this pathway is beneficial in fibrosis models, it is unclear whether it also disrupts physiological healing, regeneration, or immune responses. Furthermore, the influence of environmental pollutants on CD44 expression and function has been described mainly in a correlative context. There is a need for cause-and-effect studies that will unequivocally confirm the participation of this receptor in mediating the harmful effects of factors such as microplastics, EDCs, or heavy metals. In light of the growing interest in targeted therapies in chronic diseases, CD44 appears as a promising molecular target in the context of both antifibrotic and immunomodulatory interventions. Future studies should focus on the development of selective inhibitors of CD44 isoforms that will allow for precise modulation of its activity without interfering with the physiological functions of this receptor in regenerative and immune processes. It will also be crucial to develop and validate biomarkers based on CD44 expression profiles—both its membrane and soluble forms (sCD44)—and hyaluronic acid (HA) levels, which will enable dynamic monitoring of fibrosis progression and response to treatment. A key direction of development is the use of combined therapies, including simultaneous inhibition of the CD44–HA axis and canonical TGF-β/Smad pathways, which may yield a synergistic effect in limiting uncontrolled matrix remodeling. It will also be critical to deepen our understanding of the interactions between environmental factors and the regulation of CD44 expression, taking into account the influence of epigenetic modifications and tissue microbiota disorders. Further studies should also include population and clinical assessments of the efficacy and safety of CD44 inhibitors and HA antagonists (such as 4-methylumbelliferone) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, liver cirrhosis or systemic sclerosis. In parallel, it is worth exploring analogies with oncogenesis, including the mechanisms of EMT and acquisition of an invasive phenotype, which may enable translation of therapeutic strategies used in oncology (e.g., anti-CD44 antibodies) to the treatment of fibrogenic diseases. An integrated approach, combining molecular, toxicological, environmental, and clinical studies, may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the role of CD44 in connective tissue homeostasis and pathology and initiate a new generation of therapies targeting this multifunctional receptor. 6. Conclusions CD44 is an essential pathophysiological factor in the processes of fibrosis and remodeling of connective tissues. Its activity, dependent on interaction with hyaluronic acid and the presence of specific signaling pathways (EGFR, MAPK, Smad), affects fibroblast differentiation, inflammatory cell migration, myofibroblast formation, and intensification of the inflammatory response. Experimental models of lung, skin, heart, and liver fibrosis demonstrate that genetic deletion of CD44, its pharmacological blockade, or inhibition of HA biosynthesis leads to inhibition of the progression of fibrogenic changes. At the same time, the similarity between the phenotypes of invasive myofibroblasts and cancer cells after EMT emphasizes the commonality of mechanisms driving aggressive tissue remodeling. Finally, environmental factors—from heavy metals to microplastics—modulate CD44 activity and may enhance its pathogenic effect by stimulating inflammation, EMT, and matrix overproduction. The collected data identify CD44 as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in fibrotic diseases, as well as a biomarker for assessing exposure to environmental factors.
