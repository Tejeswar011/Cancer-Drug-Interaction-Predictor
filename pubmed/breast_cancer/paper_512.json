We benchmarked five CNV detection tools using simulated and real-world datasets, focusing on sequencing depth, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) artifacts, tumor purity, multi-center reproducibility, and signature-level stability. Our results demonstrate that ichorCNA outperformed other tools in precision and runtime at high purity (≥50%), making it the optimal choice for lcWGS-based workflows. Prolonged FFPE fixation induced artifactual short-segment CNVs due to formalin-driven DNA fragmentation, a bias none of the tools could computationally correct, necessitating strict fixation time control or prioritization of fresh-frozen samples. Multi-center analysis revealed high reproducibility for the same tool across sequencing facilities, but comparisons between different tools showed low concordance.

While deep-coverage whole-genome sequencing (dWGS) offers high sensitivity and resolution, its application to large-scale cohorts remains cost-prohibitive [ 5 6 7 8 While established CNV detection tools exhibit robust accuracy in dWGS data [ 9 10 7 11 12 et al 13 14 15 16–19 In this study, we performed a systematic evaluation of currently widely used CNV detection tools ( Table 1 in silico Table 1 Summary of CNV detection tools used in this benchmark.

The sampling probability was calculated by dividing the original average sequencing depth (computed using Samtools) by the target depth. For each target depth, we generated 10 technical replicates using distinct random seeds (1–10). The performance of downsampling methods was evaluated by comparing the CNV detected from simulated data against the ground truth. We benchmarked three methods: Picard’s ( http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ Fig. S1 Copy number variation detection We benchmarked five CNV detection tools: ACE [ 20 21 22 23 Table 1 26 Table S2 Runtime performance was evaluated using the GNU time command (bash version 5.1.16). All benchmarks were executed on a Ubuntu Linux 22.04.5 LTS system equipped with Intel(R) Xeon(R) Platinum 8375C CPU processors (physical cores: 64, logical processors: 128) operating at 2.90 GHz base frequency. Evaluation of copy number variation detection tools using the NA12878 copy number variation set as the standard set The third-generation sequencing (TGS) dataset contained a total of 20 120 CNVs, comprising 12 535 amplifications and 7585 deletions, with a median length of 106 bp (range: 1–5 686 936 bp). To enable comparative analysis between TGS data and simulated low-coverage WGS (lcWGS) data (median length = 2 238 502 bp, range: 10 001–249 230 622 bp), we implemented a multi-step processing pipeline for the TGS-derived CNVs. First, we filtered out all CNVs shorter than 1000 bp. Next, the remaining 1285 CNVs were consolidated using the bt.merge function in the R package bedtoolsr 27 To evaluate the performance of CNV detection tools, we calculated the precision, recall, and F1 score for each tool. These measurements were calculated as follows, respectively: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n$$ Precision=\\frac{TP}{TP+ FP}, $$\\end{document} \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n$$ Recall=\\frac{TP}{TP+ FN}, $$\\end{document} \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n$$ F1=\\frac{2\\times Precision\\times Recall}{Precision+ Recall}. $$\\end{document} where TP FP FN Profile match score To quantify the consistency between two absolute copy number profiles, we define a metric and calculate it as follows: \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n$$ Score\\left(A,B\\right)=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N\\sum_{j=i}^N\\mathbb{I}\\left({CN}_A(i)={CN}_B(j)\\right)\\bullet \\Delta{L}_{ij}}{L_{total}}, $$\\end{document} \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n$$ \\mathbb{I}\\left({CN}_A(i)={CN}_B(j)\\right)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}1\\ if\\ {CN}_A(i)={CN}_B(j),\\\\{}0\\ if\\ {CN}_A(i)\\ne{CN}_B(j).\\end{array}\\right. $$\\end{document} where A, B \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n${L}_{total}$\\end{document} \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n$CN(i)$\\end{document} \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n${i}^{th}$\\end{document} \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\\usepackage{wasysym}\n\\usepackage{amsfonts}\n\\usepackage{amssymb}\n\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\\begin{document}\n$\\Delta{L}_{ij}$\\end{document} Fig. S1 Feature extraction Copy number feature extraction was performed on absolute copy number profiles derived from copy number detection tools using the sig_tally function in Sigminer v2.3.1 [ 28 et al et al et al et al et al Correlation analysis in feature components For intra-variable comparisons (e.g. between CNV detection tools), we aggregated feature components across all other variables (sequencing depths, FFPE fixation times, and sequencing centers) to generate composite vectors. Specifically, when comparing tool A versus tool B, we compiled all depth/center/fixation-time results for each tool into paired vectors and computed their Spearman’s correlation. This approach was systematically applied to all pairwise combinations within each variable category. Statistical analysis Multi-group comparisons were conducted using the Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric test. Correlation analyses employed Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficient. Cosine similarity was computed to quantify feature profile resemblance between samples.

We collected data from multiple sources for variable comparison in different scenarios, including: TCGA-AG-3890: paired real-world dWGS (51.58×) and lcWGS (3.68×) data for evaluation of downsampling tools; NA12878: third-generation sequencing data providing standard CNV dataset to quantify recall/precision trade-offs across 0.1 ×–10× depth; HCC1395 cell line (Xiao et al 12 N Step 1: Data simulation. Using TCGA-AG-3890 lcWGS data as ground truth, we first established optimal downsampling parameters through systematic tool comparison. Subsequently, NA12878 data (original 11.35×) were subsampled to 13 depth gradients (0.1 ×–10×) and HCC1395 replicates were subsampled to 2× (10 technical replicates per sample). Step 2: CNV detection. Five CNV detection tools were applied. We evaluated the performance in terms of profile match score, number of CNVs, length of segments, and cytoband patterns. Step 3: Copy number feature extraction. Three copy number signature analysis methods were used in detected CNV datasets, and the stability of features were evaluated with feature similarity. The complete analytical framework is systematically depicted in Fig. 1 Materials and Methods Figure 1 Study design. Our experimental design systematically assesses five critical dimensions: (1) biospecimen type, (2) sequencing center variability, (3) tumor purity, (4) sequencing depth variability, and (5) analytical pipelines for CNV detection and signature analysis. The framework integrates in silico simulations with real-world genomic data to benchmark performance across conditions. Performance was benchmarked using five complementary metrics. Schematic diagram of the experimental study design. Performance evaluation for copy number variation detection tools on NA12878 simulated datasets across varying sequencing depths We generated a simulated dataset at 0.1×, 0.2×, 0.5×, and 1×–10× depth for NA12878, and then five CNV detection tools were applied. To precisely compare the performance of these tools, we used a CNV dataset obtained from third-generation sequencing as the gold standard. The CNVs detected at different sequencing depths were compared with this gold standard to calculate precision, recall, and F1 score (details in Materials and Methods Fig. 2a Fig. 2b Figure 2 Performance evaluation for CNV detection tools on NA12878 simulated datasets across varying sequencing depths.

We conducted a comparison of detected CNV numbers across different sequencing depths ( Fig. 2b We further performed arm-level comparisons between the gold-standard CNV and results from the five tools ( Fig. 2c Fig. 2d Impact of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded fixation time on copy number variation detection To investigate the impact of FFPE fixation time on CNV detection, we analyzed samples subjected to FFPE for 1, 2, 6, and 24 h, using matched fresh-frozen samples from the same sequencing center (Illumina HiSeq) as ground truth. All specimens were downsampled to 2× depth (mean of original depth = 64.34×) to simulate low-coverage sequencing scenarios. The total CNV number showed a time-dependent escalation (except CNVs detected by ASCAT.sc), with 24-h-processed specimens exhibiting 26% more events than 1-h counterparts ( P Fig. 3a Fig. 3b P Figure 3 Impact of FFPE fixation time on CNV detection performance under low-coverage sequencing.

Impact of tumor purity on copy number variation detection To evaluate the performance of CNV detection tools under varying tumor purities, we analyzed artificial mixtures of HCC1395 (breast cancer cell line) and HCC1395BL (normal B lymphocyte cell line) at defined ratios (75%, 50%, 20%, 10%, and 5% tumor fraction). All specimens were downsampled to 2× depth (mean original depth = 90×) using matched high-purity (100%) dWGS samples as ground truth. At low purity (<50%), CNVkit demonstrated superior correction capability, effectively mitigating normal cell contamination effects ( Fig. 4a Fig. 4a Fig. 4b c Figure 4 Impact of tumor purity on CNV detection performance under low-coverage sequencing.

Cross-condition correlation analysis of copy number features Copy number signatures represent recurrent patterns of somatic copy number alterations, which provide novel perspectives for the study of tumorigenesis. Copy number signatures are derived from mathematical decomposition of copy number features (e.g. segment size/breakpoint density). Here, we compared three distinct copy number signature analysis methods—the Steele et al 17 et al 16 et al 18 et al et al et al Evaluating signature stability across sequencing depths using HCC1395 samples (simulated depths: 0.5 ×–10× versus original 91.94×) revealed tool-specific patterns ( Fig. 6a Figure 6 Cosine similarity of copy number features cross conditions.

In comparative analysis of FFPE-processed versus fresh-frozen HCC1395 specimens, most tools showed significant variations across FFPE processing times ( Fig. 6b Fig. 6c Fig. 6d Discussion This comprehensive benchmark study provides critical insights into the performance of CNV detection tools in lcWGS data, establishing evidence-based guidelines for optimizing analytical workflows in research or clinical settings. Our findings highlight four major dimensions of variability: (i) sequencing depth dependency, (ii) technical artifacts from FFPE fixation, (iii) tumor purity, and (iv) algorithmic divergence in CNV calling tools and signature analysis methods. Collectively, these factors shape the reliability of CNV detection and downstream signature analysis. The marked superiority of ichorCNA in balancing precision and recall, even at ultra-low depths (0.5 ×–1×) aligns with its superior noise tolerance, as its original application to circulating tumor DNA analysis [ 23 Fig. 2d 19 21 22 7 8 Fig. 5a Our comparative analysis of sequencing depth revealed that the F1 score of CNV detection stabilized at depths ≥3× ( Fig. 2a Fig. 2b Formaldehyde induces DNA crosslinks, fragmentation, and base modifications [ 29 et al 30 et al 31 Fig. 3b 32 At the signature level, global statistical features derived from the Wang method (such as BP10Mb and BoChr) exhibited superior cross-condition stability. Specifically, components including BP10Mb (genome-wide breakpoint density per 10 Mb) and BoChr (chromosomal copy number burden) robustly integrated chromosomal/arm-level variation information, significantly reducing sensitivity to local technical noise ( Fig. S2 Below, we provide condition-specific technical recommendations informed by our systematic benchmarking:  Tool priority:  Signature analysis method selection:  Depth requirements:  FFPE limitations:  Tumor purity requirements:  Multi-center comparability: While we employed third-generation sequencing of NA12878 as a gold-standard reference, its inherent limitations in resolving complex structural variations may compromise the accurate representation of true copy number landscapes. Direct simulation of WGS data—where ground-truth CNVs are predefined—could enable more rigorous benchmarking of tool performance in discriminating deletions versus amplifications and detecting segments across distinct size thresholds. Additionally, real-world clinical specimens often exhibit higher genomic heterogeneity. Future studies should validate these findings in multi-region tumor sequencing datasets. In conclusion, this study establishes that lcWGS can reliably capture biologically informative CNV patterns when analytical workflows are rigorously optimized for depth, specimen type, tumor purity, and tool selection. By mapping the boundaries of technical feasibility, we provide a roadmap for implementing cost-effective copy number profiling in precisiononcology. Key Points We benchmarked five CNV detection tools using lcWGS datasets, evaluating performance across sequencing depth, FFPE artifacts, multi-center reproducibility, and signature stability. ichorCNA outperformed all tools in precision, recall, and runtime, achieving optimal F1 scores even at ultra-low depths (≥0.5×). FFPE fixation induces artifactual short-segment CNVs, a bias no tool could computationally correct, necessitating strict fixation control or fresh-frozen samples. Tumor purity critically modulates accuracy of CNV calling: CNVkit shows good correction ability at low purity (<50%), while ichorCNA requires higher (≥50%) purity for optimal performance. The Wang method for copy number signature extraction showed superior cross-condition stability versus Steele or Tao methods.
