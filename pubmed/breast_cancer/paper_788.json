TJs are highly dynamic structures and can undergo constant architectural remodeling in response to various external stimuli. This is mediated by an array of intracellular signaling pathways that alters TJ protein expression and localization. Dysfunctional regulation of TJ components compromising the barrier homeostasis is an important pathogenic factor for pathological conditions including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous studies have elucidated the significance of TJ barrier integrity and key regulatory mechanisms through various in vitro and in vivo models. In recent years, considerable efforts have been made to understand the crosstalk between various signaling pathways that regulate formation and disassembly of TJs. This review provides a comprehensive view on the novel mechanisms that regulate the TJ barrier and permeability. We discuss the latest evidence on how ion transport, cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix proteins, signaling pathways, and cell survival mechanism of autophagy regulate intestinal TJ barrier function. We also provide a perspective on the context-specific outcomes of the TJ barrier modulation. The knowledge on the diverse TJ barrier regulatory mechanisms will provide further insights on the relevance of the TJ barrier defects and potential target molecules/pathways for IBD. aryl hydrocarbon receptor autophagy inflammatory bowel disease endocytosis tight junction National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases 10.13039/100000062 DK114024 NIH 10.13039/100000002 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
