Introduction Although significant advances have been made in the prevention and management of infectious diseases, their global health burden remains substantial. While the incidence of some conditions has declined over time, especially in well-developed countries, new infectious threats continue to emerge. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has clearly demonstrated that our control over infectious diseases is limited and can be rapidly challenged by novel pathogens [ 1 2 Infectious diseases exert a multifaceted impact on society. Their often-rapid progression poses a direct threat to the health and lives of affected individuals, while their ease of transmission and potential for uncontrolled spread represent a serious public health risk. Beyond clinical outcomes, infectious diseases generate a substantial economic burden, consisting of both direct medical costs (hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, outpatient care) and indirect costs related to productivity loss through absenteeism, presenteeism, informal caregiving, and premature mortality. Cost-of-illness methodology emphasizes that a full societal perspective should capture these categories [ 3 4 5 6 7 In addition to their clinical consequences, infectious diseases impose a substantial economic burden, generating both direct costs for the healthcare system and indirect costs associated with productivity losses—most notably through sickness absence. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published study that comprehensively examines the indirect costs of sickness absence due to all infectious diseases being considered as a single group. The existing literature tends to focus on individual diseases or selected clusters, such as influenza [ 8 9 10 11 12 However, by full economic burden, we refer to the total costs borne by society, including direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs (transport, informal care), indirect costs (absenteeism, presenteeism, premature mortality, permanent or temporary work disability), and intangible costs measured as lost quality and length of life (QALY/DALY) [ 3 4 13 14 15 16 17 This highlights a gap in understanding the full economic burden of infectious diseases from a broader societal perspective, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, where such analyses remain limited. To further clarify what we mean by “social and economic costs”, we emphasize that burden-of-disease studies show that infections such as influenza, tuberculosis, or pneumococcal disease remain among the leading causes of lost DALYs in Europe [ 18 19 20 21 Understanding the social and economic costs associated with infectious diseases is essential for evidence-based public health planning. Among various types of indirect costs, productivity losses due to absenteeism represent one of the most tangible and measurable consequences of infectious morbidity. Workforce health has increasingly gained recognition as a critical component of the public health and economic research agenda. Organizations are becoming more aware that maintaining employees’ health not only reduces healthcare expenditures but also contributes to sustained productivity and competitiveness. As a result, there has been a growing emphasis on identifying and managing productivity losses linked to employee health issues [ 22 In this study, we aim to address this gap by quantifying the indirect costs of infectious disease-related sickness absence in Poland between 2018 and 2023, using national-level administrative data from the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS). Specifically, we focus on assessing the relative contribution of various infectious disease groups to the total economic burden of absenteeism. Additionally, we compare these costs with those associated with other major public health challenges in Poland, including cancer depression and ischemic heart disease. The analysis is conducted from a societal perspective, capturing productivity losses reflected in reductions in gross domestic product (GDP). By highlighting the scale of absenteeism caused by infectious diseases, we aim to foster dialog among stakeholders and contribute to discussions on the need to strengthen prevention efforts, particularly immunization programs. We also seek to advance the scientific discourse by emphasizing that infectious diseases should be regarded not only as epidemiological and clinical challenges, but also as a substantial economic burden with wide-ranging societal impacts. 2. Materials and Methods In our study, we used the most recent data covering the period from 2018 to 2023. This extended time horizon enables us to analyze the situation both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, which is particularly valuable in light of the study’s objectives. The human capital approach (HCA) was adopted in this study to estimate the indirect costs associated with sickness absence, as it remains the most commonly used method in health economic analyses across Europe, particularly in countries with less flexible labor markets and strong public insurance systems. It is especially relevant in studies relying on administrative data, such as those from national social insurance institutions [ 23 24 25 26 In this study, sickness absence was defined strictly as medical leave certified by a physician and recorded in the ZUS system with an ICD-10 diagnostic code. The dataset therefore reflects only the personal illness of the insured employee. Other categories of absence, such as caregiving allowances or administrative quarantine/isolation orders during the COVID-19 pandemic, are recorded by ZUS under separate schemes and were not included in the analysis. All cost values presented in euros (EUR) were converted from Polish zloty (PLN) using average annual exchange rates published by the National Bank of Poland (NBP). Year-specific exchange rates were applied to preserve temporal accuracy and to reflect actual market conditions during each year. All parameters used in the model are presented in Table 1 The absenteeism cost C a b s 24 27 We used the following formula to calculate the cost of absenteeism C a b s C a b s = G D P y e a r N e m p l × β × 1 N w o r k d a y s × D m i s s e d G D P y e a r N e m p l β = Correction factor (0, 65); N w o r k d a y s D m i s s e d Infectious diseases were identified using ICD-10 codes A00–B99. Additionally, selected codes outside this range were included to capture diseases of infectious origin with high absenteeism impact, such as influenza (J09–J11) and COVID-19 (U07.1–U07.2). A detailed list of the included ICD-10 codes is provided in the Results Section. To contextualize the burden of sickness absence due to infectious diseases, we compared them with selected non-communicable conditions representing major public health concerns in Poland. Specifically, we included malignant neoplasms (ICD-10 codes C00–D09), ischemic heart disease (ICD-10 codes I20–I25), and depression (ICD-10 codes F33–F34). These diagnoses were chosen because they are leading contributors to morbidity and mortality in Poland and are also associated with substantial sickness absence. For each of these conditions, we applied the same methodological approach as for infectious diseases, relying on administrative data from the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS) to calculate sickness absence days, complemented by macroeconomic indicators from the Central Statistical Office (GUS) to estimate productivity losses. This ensured consistency and comparability across disease categories. For comparative purposes, we supplemented our analysis of sickness absence with Global Burden of Disease (GBD 2021) estimates of DALYs, YLLs, and YLDs for selected major disease groups. This allowed us to situate the indirect costs of infectious diseases within the broader spectrum of population health losses. 3. Results 3.1. Sickness Absence Due to Infectious Diseases The number of sick leave days due to infectious diseases in Poland varied between 2018 and 2020 ( Table 2 In 2018, over 75% of all sick leave days were due to pneumonia and other acute lower respiratory tract infections (J12–J22), which accounted for 58.9%, and influenza (J09–J11), which contributed 16.24%. In 2019, these conditions were responsible for over 70% of sick leave days—59.29% for J12–J22—while the proportion due to influenza decreased to 11.05%. The year 2020 brought significant changes. The leading cause of sickness absence became COVID-19 (U07–U09), which accounted for 47.32% of all sick leave days. This pushed J12–J22 into second place, with a share of 26.05%. Another clear effect of the pandemic was a marked increase in sickness absence due to conditions in the B25–B34 group, which in 2020 represented 7.41% of all sick leave days. Within this group, the ICD-10 code B34—”Viral infection of unspecified site”—was particularly notable, responsible for nearly 96% of these cases. The number of B34 cases was 14 times higher than in 2019 and 18 times higher than in 2018. Influenza accounted for just 6.5% of sick leave days in the first year of the pandemic. Between 2021 and 2023, the total number of sick leave days remained high, reaching 9.8 million in 2021 and nearly 10.4 million in 2022, before a noticeable decrease was observed in 2023 ( Table 3 28 3.2. Productivity Losses from Infectious Diseases Productivity losses resulting from infectious diseases have been increasing in Poland over the past six years, largely driven by the global health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The total value of absenteeism-related costs ranged from EUR 567.3 million in 2019 to EUR 1.15 billion in 2022 ( Table 4 Over the six-year observation period, nearly 70% of sickness absence costs, above EUR 3.7 billion, were attributable to pneumonia and other acute lower respiratory tract infections (J12–J22), which accounted for 35.63% of the total, and COVID-19 (U07–U09), which contributed 34.3%. Influenza (J09–J11) ranked third, with total costs amounting to EUR 444.54 million, representing 8.38% of the overall burden. Intestinal infectious diseases (A00–A09) ranked fourth in terms of absenteeism-related costs, generating EUR 363.96 million and accounting for 6.86% of the total. Within this group, over 90% of the costs were attributable to A08: Viral and other specified intestinal infections (EUR 107.14 million) and A09: Diarrhea and gastroenteritis of presumed infectious origin (EUR 230.79 million). The B00–B09 category, which includes viral infections with skin and mucous membrane lesions, also represented a considerable share of absenteeism costs during the study period—exceeding 5% of the total, with losses reaching above EUR 270 million. Within this group, sickness absences related to shingles (B02) and chickenpox (B01) were particularly prominent, together accounting for nearly 82% of the category’s total costs. Over the six-year period, the financial burden of shingles amounted to EUR 162.37 million, while chickenpox-related losses reached EUR 58.5 million. The B25–B34 group, classified as other viral infections, accounted for 4.68% of total absenteeism costs, generating EUR 248.6 million in losses. A marked increase in this group was observed during the pandemic, and notably, this elevated share persisted into 2023. This trend may suggest that certain cases of COVID-19 or influenza were coded within this broader category. This hypothesis is supported by the dominance of diagnoses B33: other viral diseases, not elsewhere classified, and B34: viral infection of unspecified site, which together accounted for EUR 234.45 million, representing nearly 95% of the group’s total costs. The remaining disease categories contributed substantially less to the overall burden. Tuberculosis (A15–A19) accounted for 1.94% of total costs, and other bacterial diseases (A35–A49) for 1.45%. HIV and viral hepatitis combined represented less than 1% of absenteeism-related costs due to infectious diseases. Similarly, negligible contributions were observed for the following groups: infections predominantly transmitted through sexual contact (A50–A64): 0.1%; viral infections of the central nervous system (A80–A89): 0.4%; and bacterial and viral agents as causes of diseases (B95–B97): 0.18%. Regardless of the impact the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may have had on these cost data, it is important to emphasize that many of the health conditions contributing significantly to absenteeism costs are diseases for which effective primary prevention measures—namely, vaccinations—are available. This includes, among others, influenza, COVID-19, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and infections caused by pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria meningitidis 3.3. Infectious Diseases as a Public Health Challenge: Comparison with Other Major Conditions To illustrate the broader public health burden associated with sickness absence due to infectious diseases, we compared their impact with that of selected non-communicable diseases that represent major health priorities in Poland. Specifically, we focused on malignant neoplasms (ICD-10 C00:D09), ischemic heart disease (ICD-10 I20:I25), and depression (ICD-10 F33:F34)—conditions that, while differing in etiology, are associated with substantial levels of sickness absence and productivity loss among affected individuals. In addition, to contextualize the magnitude of these costs within the wider framework of population health, we present burden-of-disease estimates expressed as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, communicable diseases still accounted for nearly 15% of all DALYs in Poland, with the majority attributable to Years of Life Lost (YLLs) rather than Years Lived with Disability (YLDs). By contrast, non-communicable diseases such as cancer and ischemic heart disease remain the leading causes of DALYs overall. Table 5 These comparisons illustrate that, although the short- and medium-term economic burden of infectious diseases is largely driven by sickness absence and productivity loss, their overall health impact remains substantial when measured in DALYs. This dual perspective underscores the importance of integrating both economic and epidemiological indicators when designing prevention strategies and setting public health priorities. Depression is increasingly acknowledged in Poland, as in other industrialized countries, as a critical public health concern, closely linked to diminished work performance, including reduced self-assessed work capacity, sickness absence, and occupational burnout [ 29 30 Figure 1 In Poland, cancer poses an escalating burden on the healthcare system, with profound social and economic implications. It ranks as the second leading cause of death and remains the foremost contributor to premature mortality (deaths before the age of 65), especially among women [ 31 32 Figure 2 The Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD 2021) reports that ischemic heart disease (IHD) continues to be the foremost cause of mortality and morbidity globally, accounting for 8.99 million deaths in 2021 [ 33 34 35 Figure 3 A comparison of sickness absence costs reveals that infectious diseases impose a substantially greater economic burden than other major public health issues. Neither cancer, ischemic heart disease, nor depression—which affects a large segment of the population and contributes significantly to sickness absence—generate costs comparable to those caused by communicable diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic further underscored the profound impact that epidemiological crises can have on these costs. While comparing infectious diseases with other major public health challenges provides useful context, important limitations must be acknowledged. Depression, for example, is known to be underdiagnosed and stigmatized, leading to underreporting and consequently lower levels of registered sickness absence [ 36 37 38 39 4. Discussion Our findings align with a growing body of evidence indicating that infectious diseases—particularly respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19, influenza, and pneumonia—are significant contributors to productivity losses across diverse healthcare systems. Similar studies conducted in Europe and worldwide highlight the extent of this burden and reinforce the critical importance of effective preventive measures, especially vaccination and workplace health policies. For example, Fisman et al. [ 8 Table 4 A retrospective study from Greece by Lampropoulos et al. [ 11 11 Furthermore, Golicki et al. explored the indirect costs of pneumococcal disease in Poland using similar ZUS data and found that sickness absence accounted for a considerable share of the overall economic burden [ 12 Streptococcus pneumoniae Beyond infectious diseases, comparative analyses with non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer and depression show that the economic burden of communicable diseases—especially during epidemic periods—can be even more pronounced. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study corroborates that indirect costs from infectious disease morbidity are often underestimated, particularly when presenteeism and long-term disability are excluded [ 33 22 However, a systematic review by Webster et al. [ 40 41 When analyzing healthcare costs, direct costs are the most intuitive and widely recognized category. Indirect costs, on the other hand, are more abstract, as they do not represent actual financial outlays but rather reflect potential losses to society caused by a patient’s reduced ability to participate in economic activities [ 42 Furthermore, a potential limitation of our analysis is the use of the human capital approach (HCA) to estimate productivity losses. While the HCA is consistent with European standards and the Polish HTA guidelines, and facilitates international comparability, it may overestimate costs compared to the friction cost method (FCM). However, in our study this risk is mitigated by the use of conservative assumptions, as we did not include presenteeism, informal caregiving, or intangible costs. Therefore, our estimates should be viewed as a cautious rather than inflated reflection of the economic burden of infectious diseases. Nevertheless, limitations in our study must be recognized. One of the most important is the reliance on administrative data, which may not fully capture disease burden due to underreporting, diagnostic misclassification, or varied sickness absence behavior. As highlighted by Mikos et al. (2020), refusal to take sick leave despite infection remains a real concern in Poland, potentially distorting the true economic picture [ 43 Additionally, our estimates rely on a labor productivity correction factor of 0.65, consistent with previous Polish and European cost-of-illness studies. While this choice is well-founded, we acknowledge that alternative assumptions (e.g., 0.6–0.7) could affect the absolute magnitude of costs. However, such variation would not materially change the relative ranking of infectious diseases compared with other major health conditions. A further limitation relates to the use of GDP per worker as the basis for valuing productivity losses in the human capital approach. During the COVID-19 pandemic, exceptional fiscal measures—such as furlough schemes, direct transfers, and expanded public employment—partially decoupled GDP growth from actual labor input. As a result, GDP-based valuations may not fully reflect the true relationship between absenteeism and productivity losses in this period. Adjusting GDP for such distortions would require detailed fiscal and sectoral data that go beyond the scope of this study. Nevertheless, this issue should be acknowledged when interpreting pandemic-era cost estimates, as our results may overstate or understate the economic impact depending on how government interventions interacted with labor productivity. Our study focuses on short-term productivity losses due to sickness absence, which provides only a partial view of the indirect costs associated with infectious diseases. We did not capture other relevant components, such as long-term disability, informal caregiving, presenteeism, or productivity impairment persisting after recovery. These omissions result from data limitations but should be acknowledged as important aspects of the broader economic and social burden of infectious diseases and should be the subject of future research. Another limitation is that our analysis was restricted to individual-level absenteeism, without considering potential spillover effects on team or organizational productivity. In many work settings, the absence of one employee can reduce overall team output, redistribute workload, or increase stress for co-workers, thereby amplifying the productivity impact beyond the directly absent worker. Empirical evidence confirms that such “second-order” effects are particularly relevant for communicable diseases, where contagion risk can exacerbate disruptions at the workplace [ 44 Another important consideration is that our analysis of the 2018–2023 period was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, whose consequences affected not only sickness absence but also the functioning of the entire healthcare system [ 45 A further source of uncertainty concerns the COVID-19 period, when in some countries sick leave also covered caregiving or quarantine. In Poland, however, these categories were administered separately by ZUS and are not included in our dataset. Nevertheless, their coexistence with standard sick leave schemes may have contributed to some reporting heterogeneity, which should be borne in mind when interpreting pandemic-era results. Importantly, because our dataset spans 2018–2023, it covers both the pre-pandemic years and 2023, when restrictions were lifted in Poland and the pandemic’s impact on healthcare functioning was already minimal. An important limitation is the omission of presenteeism, i.e., working despite being ill, which is particularly common in the health and social care sectors. Evidence shows that a considerable proportion of employees continue to work while experiencing infectious symptoms—systematic reviews report prevalence rates ranging from 35% to 97%, with higher levels observed among healthcare workers [ 40 41 Ultimately, our findings reinforce the importance of renewed investment in prevention and workforce health resilience, particularly through evidence-based immunization programs. Prioritizing such interventions can deliver dual benefits: improving population health outcomes while safeguarding economic productivity. Responsibility in this area should not rest solely with the central government; local government units also play a complementary role, both in financing immunization programs and in promoting vaccination awareness [ 46 5. Conclusions This study analyzed six-year trends in productivity losses due to sickness absence from infectious diseases in Poland. Our findings show that infectious diseases are a major driver of work absence, with the impact strongly amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the burden imposed by infectious diseases on the healthcare system and the wider economy is considerable, even when compared with other leading public health challenges such as malignant neoplasms, ischemic heart disease, and depression. These results underscore the need for sustained investment in effective public health interventions—particularly vaccination programs—to mitigate both the health and economic consequences of infectious diseases.
