The advancement of biotechnologies, particularly next-generation sequencing, has accelerated the discovery of genetic variants linked to cancer susceptibility. While hundreds of cancer-susceptibility genes have been identified, they only explain a small fraction of the overall cancer risk, a phenomenon known as \"missing heritability\". Despite progress, even considering factors such as epistasis, epigenetics, and gene-environment interactions, the missing heritability remains unresolved. Recent research has revealed that an individual's microbiome composition plays a significant role in cancer susceptibility through several mechanisms, such as modulating immune cell activity and influencing the presence or removal of environmental carcinogens. In this review, we examine the multifaceted roles of the microbiome in cancer risk and explore gene-microbiome and environment-microbiome interactions that may contribute to cancer susceptibility. Additionally, we highlight the importance of experimental models, such as collaborative cross mice, and advanced analytical tools, like artificial intelligence, in identifying microbial factors associated with cancer risk. Understanding these microbial determinants can open new avenues for interventions aimed at reducing cancer risk and guide the development of more effective cancer treatments.

The genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach combined with the advent of biotechnologies has successfully identified genetic variants contributing to cancer risk[ 1 11 1 2 8 12 13 The missing heritability of cancer is a notable unsolved problem for genetic association studies. Since few cancers result in mutations in a single gene, cancer susceptibility is usually highly polygenic, i.e. 14 17 1 18 19 12 13 20 22 23 24 12 25 26 There is a growing understanding and appreciation for the functional significance of the human microbiome in health and disease such as cancer[ 27 32 27 31 33 36 1 Figure 1  Contribution of host genetics, microbiome, environmental factors, and their bidirectional interactions to cancer susceptibility. VARIATION IN HUMAN MICROBIOME COMPOSITION AND DIVERSITY Our body harbors 10-100 trillion microbial cells, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi, the majority of which live in the gut[ 37 39 The genetic material of these microbial cells is collectively defined as the human microbiome, which is also referred to as the human “second genome”[ 40 41 37 42 42 35 36 42 37 37 39 42 It is well known that many factors can influence gut microbiota, including host genetics and environmental factors[ 43 45 33 33 43 Importance of the microbiome in cancer susceptibility Accumulating evidence has shown that the human microbiome contributes to all stages of cancer development by modulating the hallmarks of cancer (Figure 2 27 30 32 Figure 2  The microbiome and the hallmarks of cancer. The first evidence for the contribution of specific bacterial species to cancer susceptibility is the link between Helicobacter pylori H. pylori 27 46 H. pylori Schistosoma haematobium Opisthorchis viverrini Clonorchis sinensis 27 46 46 48 49 HOST GENETICS-MICROBIOME INTERACTIONS IN CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY Increasing attention has focused on bidirectional interactions between host genetics and microbiome. On the one hand, host genetics determines the microbiome composition and diversity (Figure 1 33 50 54 1 55 56 Although recent breakthroughs in cancer genetics have identified hundreds of genetic variations responsible for the increased cancer susceptibility, the missing heritability of cancer remains a challenge. Strong links between genetics and microbiome and between microbiome and cancer lead us to hypothesize the effect of some genetic variants on cancer susceptibility through the microbiome, which is defined as an indirect effect. Based on this hypothesis, we could divide pathogenic variants into three categories: (1) Genetic variants, which pose a direct effect; (2) Genetic variants that pose both direct and indirect effects; and (3) Genetic variants that pose an indirect effect on cancer susceptibility (Figure 3 Figure 3  Direct and indirect genetic effect on cancer susceptibility. Mounting evidence has shown that gut microbiota modulates host gene expression[ 57 59 60 63 60 63 64 67 Escherichia coli 68 69 Bacteroides fragilis 70 71 Campylobacter jejuni 68 72 ENVIRONMENT-MICROBIOME INTERACTIONS IN CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY Scientific research has begun to elucidate the diverse mechanisms through which the human microbiome interacts with environmental exposures[ 73 75 4 76 76 77 76 77 Figure 4  Bidirectional interactions between the microbiome and environmental pollutants and their contribution to cancer susceptibility. On the other hand, environmental pollutants can, directly and indirectly, alter the microbiome. Many environmental pollutants have been identified to disrupt the microbiome composition and diversity[ 78 79 78 79 MOUSE MODEL SYSTEMS FOR INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF THE MICROBIOME IN CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY Environmental exposures are difficult to quantify and control for human populations, which severely hinders the identification of microbial determinants of cancer susceptibility in humans. In contrast, mice offer many advantages for the study of the role of microbiome in cancer susceptibility. These advantages include well-designed populations tailored to specific research questions, standardized husbandry conditions, comprehensive phenotypic analyses, and the ability to manipulate the ecosystem to investigate the role of the microbiome in tumor progression and metastasis. Moreover, mouse models have been instrumental in developing our knowledge of the microbiome in vivo 80 83 The CC mouse population model is an ideal system for studying the role of microbiomes in cancer susceptibility The CC is a large panel of novel inbred mouse strains derived from eight genetically diverse founders (A/J, C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, NOD/LtJ, NZO/HlLtJ, CAST/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and WSB/EiJ) through a targeted funneling breeding strategy designed to randomize the genetic composition of each inbred line. The CC captures nearly 90% of the known genetic variation found in laboratory mice, making it a powerful tool to model the genetic diversity of human populations[ 84 50 85 94 52 50 88 95 50 Gnotobiotic mouse model A major driver of advances in microbiome research has been the use of gnotobiotic (or germ-free) mice, which are devoid of all microorganisms and maintained under sterile conditions[ 96 97 98 100 81 101 103 in vivo 98 104 109 ANALYTICAL TOOLS FOR IDENTIFYING MICROBIAL DETERMINANTS OF CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY Microbiome-related studies on cancer development and treatment have notably increased recently[ 110 112 5 Figure 5 Analytical methods for microbiome-wide association study. Classical ML techniques and statistical models in microbiome studies Classical ML and statistical models continue to play an essential role in microbiome data analysis, among which logistic regression (LR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), naïve Bayes classifiers, and random forest (RF) are among the most popular techniques that have been extensively used.  LR: 113 114 115 116  LDA: 117 118 i.e. 118  SVM: i.e. 119  Naïve Bayes classifiers: 120 121  RF: In addition, other statistical models, including the mediation model and Cox proportional-hazards model, have also been widely used in microbiome studies to explore the intermediate role of the microbiome, together with other factors ( e.g. e.g. 122 Artificial intelligence techniques in microbiome studies Motivated by recent neuroscience findings[ 123 124  CNN: e.g. 125 126  PSD: 127  Transformer: 128 129 130 131 132 In summary, these analytical tools, empowered by classical ML and statistical models or more advanced artificial intelligence techniques, provide new avenues to microbiome data processing and knowledge mining with promising potential to further advance the discovery of microbial determinants of cancer susceptibility. CONCLUSION Mounting evidence highlights the microbiome as a vital and dynamic factor in cancer susceptibility. Research is increasingly revealing that the microbiome is not merely a passive passenger but an active modulator of host physiology, immunity, and even the efficacy of anticancer therapies. From influencing genetic stability and inflammation to modulating metabolic pathways and immune surveillance, the microbiome emerges as a critical determinant in both cancer initiation and progression. Despite these advances, much remains to be discovered about the full spectrum of microbes that individually or synergistically affect cancer risk, as well as the mechanisms behind their effects. Progress in this area will require sophisticated analytical tools, including artificial intelligence, to unravel these complexities. Notably, the context-specific roles of the microbiome, ranging from protective to pathogenic, highlight the complexity of its interactions with host and environmental factors. Certain microbial taxa have been implicated in carcinogenesis through genotoxic metabolite production or pro-inflammatory mechanisms, while others exhibit tumor-suppressive effects by enhancing immune responses or maintaining epithelial barrier integrity. This duality underscores the need for precision approaches in microbiome research, tailored to individual host genetics, lifestyle, and tumor microenvironments. Importantly, future research must aim to move beyond association studies and unravel causal mechanisms through integrative multi-omics, longitudinal cohort designs, and functional validation in preclinical models. A major challenge remains in distinguishing correlation from causation and understanding how specific microbial consortia dynamically influence oncogenic processes over time. Longitudinal studies of the fecal microbiome in at-risk populations could help identify microbial markers of increased cancer susceptibility, potentially leading to new early detection tools. Since the microbiome can also modify the effects of environmental pollutants, identifying microbes capable of neutralizing harmful compounds may pave the way for novel preventive or therapeutic strategies. Ultimately, integrating microbiome science into the broader oncology landscape could transform our understanding of cancer etiology and herald a new era of microbiome-informed diagnostics and therapeutics. To fully harness this potential, interdisciplinary collaboration across microbiology, immunology, oncology, and bioinformatics will be essential. In conclusion, the microbiome stands as a pivotal frontier in the quest to understand and mitigate cancer susceptibility. More rigorous research and clinical trials are needed to translate these findings into effective strategies for cancer prevention, treatment, and management.
