Current therapies primarily focus on lowering cholesterol levels or preventing blood clot formation. However, the multifactorial and dynamic nature of atherosclerotic progression is not addressed. We designed a therapeutic platform based on onion-derived extracellular vesicles (Onex), nanovesicles originating from onions with excellent biocompatibility and strong anti-inflammatory effects. Onex was engineered with the VHPK peptide, to construct V-Onex, specifically targeting vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), which is strongly upregulated in inflamed endothelial cells during atherosclerosis. Engineered V-Onex exhibited excellent biocompatibility and stability without inducing cytotoxicity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and THP-1 cells. V-Onex selectively accumulated in inflamed endothelial cells and significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory markers in HUVECs and THP-1 cells. It also suppresses the migration of endothelial cells and reduces their interaction with monocytes, both of which contribute to plaque formation. In THP-1 cells, V-Onex inhibited the uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein and reduced foam cell formation. Collectively, V-Onex is a promising modular targeted nanovesicle platform capable of modulating multiple pathological processes associated with atherosclerosis. atherosclerosis extracellular vesicle onion VHPK peptide VCAM-1 Korean government RS-2022-NR069930 Incheon National University Research Grant This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Korean government (RS-2022-NR069930).

Introduction Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately one-third of all deaths. As the population ages, the burden of CVD is expected to increase, because age-related changes, such as vascular inflammation and lipid imbalance, contribute to atherosclerosis [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized carriers secreted by cells that transport bioactive molecules and modulate cellular responses [ 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 Among plant-derived EVs, onion-derived EVs (Onex) provide an additional advantage, as our previous study demonstrated that Onex suppressed inflammation in LPS-stimulated macrophages by downregulating pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-1β, COX-2, iNOS) via NF-κB modulation, without cytotoxicity even at high concentrations. Moreover, Onex can be obtained with high yield and low cost using SEC combined with ultrafiltration, demonstrating its practicality for reproducible and scalable production [ 44 Scheme 1 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Characterization and Cytotoxicity Assessment of Onex Onex was isolated from Allium cepa g g g Figure 1 Figure 1 To characterize the physicochemical properties of Onex, NTA was conducted. Onex exhibited a consistently high concentration, with an average particle concentration of 1.45 × 10 11 12 12 Figure 1 To evaluate the cytotoxicity of Onex, HUVECs and THP-1 cells were treated with various concentrations of Onex (1 × 10 8 10 Figure 1 2.2. Evaluation of the Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Onex in HUVECs and THP-1 Cells To assess the anti-inflammatory effects of Onex, LPS-induced HUVECs were treated with Onex. HUVECs were stimulated with LPS to induce inflammation, followed by treatment with Onex (1 × 10 10 Figure 1 Figure 1 2.3. V-Onex Construction by Surface Engineering of Onex and Their Characterization Targeting inflammatory endothelial cells is necessary to efficiently control inflammation within an in vivo vascular environment. To enable the targeted therapeutic delivery of Onex to the inflamed endothelium, the VHPK peptide was incorporated onto the surface of Onex using a DSPE-PEG-based insertion strategy to construct V-Onex. The VHPK peptide, which specifically binds to VCAM-1, was first conjugated to DSPE-PEG-COOH via (1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide) (EDC)/N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide sodium salt (NHS) coupling. The resulting DSPE-PEG-VHPK was then spontaneously inserted into the lipid bilayer of Onex via hydrophobic interactions between the DSPE lipid tail and EV membrane ( Figure 2 The structural morphology of the engineered V-Onex was evaluated using TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy, JEM-1010, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The images revealed that V-Onex retained a characteristic cup-shaped morphology, which is consistent with the typical structure of EVs ( Figure 2 Figure 2 Figure S1 To evaluate the cytotoxic potential of V-Onex, HUVEC and THP-1 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of V-Onex ranging from 1 × 10 8 10 Figure 2 Storage and serum stability of V-Onex were assessed by incubating vesicles in PBS and PBS supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C for seven days. In PBS, the particle size remained stable at approximately 160 nm and the particle concentration showed no significant decline. Similarly, in PBS containing 10% serum, both the size and concentration were well preserved, confirming the stability of V-Onex under physiological conditions ( Figure 2 Figure 2 2.4. Targeting Capability of V-Onex in Inflamed Endothelial Cells To validate the targeting capability of V-Onex under inflammatory conditions, its interaction with activated endothelial cells was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy. Onex and V-Onex were labeled with the lipophilic dye DiI. All the samples were applied at a concentration of 1 × 10 10 Figure 2 Figure 3 Supplementary Figure S2 Figure 3 VCAM-1 45 2.5. Evaluation of the Anti-Inflammatory Gene Regulations of V-Onex in HUVECs and THP-1 Cells To assess the anti-inflammatory potential of V-Onex, endothelial and immune cell models were evaluated under LPS-stimulated inflammatory conditions. HUVECs were cultured to confluence and stimulated with 200 ng/mL of LPS for 24 h to mimic the inflamed vascular endothelium. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into M0 macrophages using PMA, followed by stimulation with 100 ng/mL of LPS for 24 h. After the induction of inflammation, both cell types were treated with Onex or V-Onex at a dose of 1 × 10 10 Figure 3 Figure 3 2.6. Enhanced Suppression Activity of Endothelial Cell Migration by V-Onex In atherosclerosis, inflammation-driven endothelial migration contributes to the formation of intercellular gaps, thereby facilitating vascular permeability and immune cell infiltration of the intimal layer. This process accelerates lesion progression and destabilizes the vascular integrity, ultimately aggravating plaque development. Interfering with this process may attenuate the advancement of atherosclerotic plaques and maintain endothelial barrier function. To evaluate the effect of V-Onex on endothelial cell migration under inflammatory conditions, a wound-healing assay was performed using LPS-induced HUVECs. A linear scratch was generated to mimic a wound and the cells were treated with either Onex or V-Onex at 1 × 10 10 Figure 4 46 47 2.7. Enhanced Suppression of Monocyte Adhesion to Endothelial Cells by VCAM-1-Targeting V-Onex Monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells represents a critical early event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, as it initiates vascular inflammation and facilitates the subsequent accumulation of immune cells within the intima. To assess the inhibitory effect of V-Onex on this process, a monocyte adhesion assay was performed using HUVECs stimulated with 200 ng/mL of LPS for 24 h to induce an inflamed endothelial phenotype. The cells were then treated with either Onex or V-Onex at a concentration of 1 × 10 10 Figure 4 VCAM-1 Figure 4 2.8. Suppression of Foam Cell Formation by Onex and V-Onex Function To evaluate whether Onex and V-Onex suppress foam cell formation, Oil Red O (ORO) staining was performed to visualize and quantify intracellular lipid accumulation. Ox-LDL stimulation of THP-1 macrophages resulted in a notable increase in lipid accumulation, as evidenced by the presence of numerous lipid-laden macrophages in the microscopic images. Treatment with either Onex or V-Onex visibly reduced the lipid staining intensity in the images, indicating the attenuation of foam cell formation ( Figure 5 Figure 5 10 Figure 5 In this study, developed a candidate therapeutic drug for atherosclerosis using Onex, a plant-derived EVs with potent anti-inflammatory properties. Specifically, we constructed V-Onex, in which Onex is conjugated with the VHPK peptide, which targets VCAM-1 and is overexpressed in endothelial cells in inflammatory environments. V-Onex exhibits multifunctional therapeutic effects in multiple in vitro models by significantly reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suppressing endothelial cell migration, decreasing monocyte adhesion, and attenuating foam cell formation. These effects collectively demonstrate the capacity of V-Onex to regulate key pathological processes involved in atherosclerosis. Although the reductions in cytokine expression may appear modest in in vitro experiments, these changes were consistently accompanied by functional outcomes such as suppression of endothelial cell migration, inhibition of monocyte adhesion, and reduction in foam cell formation. These processes are expected to coexist and act synergistically in in vivo conditions, thereby amplifying the therapeutic efficacy of V-Onex. Compared with conventional treatments, V-Onex offers several distinct advantages. Its plant origin ensures high biocompatibility and scalability, whereas surface engineering confers targeting specificity, which enhances its efficacy at lower dosages. The simplicity of this engineering strategy, involving membrane insertion facilitated by DSPE conjugation, supports the feasibility of translational development. In contrast to approaches that address single disease pathways, V-Onex has a multifaceted therapeutic effect by modulating vascular inflammation, immune cell recruitment, and lipid handling in macrophages. Together, these findings suggest that V-Onex represents not only a potential therapeutic agent for atherosclerosis but also a modular nanoplatform that can be adapted for other inflammatory vascular disorders. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Cell Cultures HUVECs were maintained in Medium 200 (Cat. No. M200500, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), supplemented with Low Serum Growth Supplement (Cat. No. S00310, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 1% ( v v v v v v 2 3.2. Isolation of Extracellular Vesicles from Onion Onex were isolated from Allium cepa 3.3. NTA and Zeta Potential Analysis Particle size distribution and Onex concentration were measured using a NanoSight NS300 instrument (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK). Zeta potential and PDI were determined using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Panalytical Ltd., Malvern, UK). 3.4. Effects of Onex on Cell Viability To assess cell viability, HUVECs and THP-1 cells were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated for 24 h. Cells were then treated with Onex or V-Onex at concentrations ranging from 1.0 × 10 8 10 3.5. qRT-PCR Analysis qRT-PCR was performed using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) to evaluate the effect of Onex on inflammation-related gene expression. Total RNA was extracted with FavorPrep Tri-RNA Reagent (FAVORGEN, Ping-Tung, Taiwan) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Complementary DNA was synthesized using ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Master Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) and amplification was performed using THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR mix (Toyobo, Japan). Primer sequences used in this study are listed in Table S1 3.6. Construction of V-Onex To modify the surface of Onex with the VHPK peptide, DSPE-PEG-VHPK conjugates were synthesized. FITC-labeled VHPK peptide (VHPKQHRGGSKGC) was purchased from Peptron (Daejeon, Republic of Korea). Conjugation was performed using EDC/NHS chemistry, in which the carboxyl group of DSPE-PEG-COOH (1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-polyethylene glycol) was coupled to the amine group of the peptide. DSPE-PEG2000-COOH was dissolved at 5 mg/mL in MES buffer, followed by the addition of EDC and sulfo-NHS in a 1:1 molar ratio in MES buffer for 15 min. The peptide (10 mg/mL) was then added and incubated for 2 h. The resulting solution was dialyzed against ultrapure water for 3 days using a 2 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane (Spectra/Por, Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the final product was lyophilized and stored at −20 °C. For surface functionalization, the DSPE-PEG–VHPK conjugate was incubated with Onex at 37 °C for 4 h under gentle stirring, and unbound conjugates were removed by ultrafiltration. The resulting V-Onex was subsequently used for characterization and further experiments. 3.7. Targeting Effect Assessment of V-Onex To evaluate the targeting efficiency of V-Onex, both Onex and V-Onex were labeled with fluorescent dye DiI and incubated with HUVECs. Following treatment, the cells were cultured in the presence or absence of the labeled vesicles. Cellular uptake was qualitatively assessed using fluorescence microscopy (Eclipse Ti2, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). 3.8. Monocyte Adhesion Assay HUVECs were seeded at a density of 2 × 10 4 2 4 2 3.9. Migration Assay HUVECs were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 10 4 2 Migration rate (%) = [(A 0 t 0 0 t 3.10. ORO Staining ORO staining was used to assess lipid accumulation in the macrophages. ORO powder (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in isopropyl alcohol and filtered through a 0.2-μm syringe filter (GVS, Zola Predosa, Italy) before use. Cells were fixed with formalin and stained with ORO solution to visualize intracellular lipids. After microscopic observation, the stained lipids were eluted with isopropanol, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Varioskan Flash Multimode Reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to quantify lipid content. 3.11. Statistical Analysis The results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation, n p 4. Conclusions In this study, we demonstrated that engineered V-Onex, which can target VCAM-1-expressing endothelial cells, possesses excellent biocompatibility and stability, and exhibits no cytotoxicity in endothelial cells and macrophages. V-Onex effectively and selectively accumulated in the inflamed endothelial cells, leading to a significant reduction in the expression of inflammatory markers in both cell types. Furthermore, V-Onex suppressed the migration of endothelial cells and reduced their interaction with monocytes, both of which are critical processes that contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation. Importantly, in THP-1 cells, V-Onex inhibited the uptake of ox-LDL and consequently reduced foam cell formation. Collectively, these compelling results highlight V-Onex as a highly promising and modular targeted nanovesicle platform capable of modulating multiple pathological processes associated with atherosclerosis. However, the present study is limited to in vitro validation and did not include pharmacological controls such as NSAIDs. Plant-derived EVs are inherently heterogeneous, and large-scale production and standardization remain challenges for clinical translation. Future research should incorporate in vivo biodistribution and efficacy studies to confirm these therapeutic effects. Also, unlike cell-derived EVs, information about the components of plant EVs is quite limited. To develop a therapeutic agent using plant EVs, it is necessary to identify the components encapsulated within them. Additional research to identify the components loaded onto Onex, such as miRNA, lipids, metabolites, and proteins, is expected to significantly contribute to the development of V-Onex as a new targeted therapeutic agent for atherosclerosis.
