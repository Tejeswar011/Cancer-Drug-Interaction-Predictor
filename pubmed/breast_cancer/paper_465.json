Addressing the socio-demographic elements impacting the awareness of NiV is essential for productive public health initiatives. This study explores the impact of socio-demographic characteristics on individuals’ willingness to get vaccinated (WGTV) for the Nipah virus during an outbreak in Bangladesh and to develop optimal control strategies using machine learning techniques. A cross-sectional survey in Bangladesh examined socio-demographic factors, health conditions, and common misconceptions about vaccination, and statistical analysis was performed using chi-square tests to identify significant associations between demographic variables and vaccination willingness. Machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were employed to predict vaccination willingness and determine feature importance. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis further validated the significance of these features in two distinct scenarios. We analyzed two distinct scenarios in this study. In the first scenario, we utilized all five categories for classification for WGTV, achieving a maximum accuracy of 60.83% with the Random Forest (RF) model. In the second scenario, to address the issue of class imbalance, we transformed the study into a binary classification problem, which significantly improved the model’s performance, yielding the highest accuracy of 85% with the RF model. Notably, the model outputs were influenced by demographic parameters such as age and daily interactions, but their influence was mild compared to the predominant influence of socioeconomic characteristics. Analysis validated key predictors, highlighting socioeconomic factors like education and income as the most influential, while demographic factors such as age and gender had a milder effect. The findings underscore the importance of addressing socioeconomic disparities in public health efforts to boost immunization rates, offering valuable insights for policymakers to design targeted interventions and improve health outcomes.

As of February 2024, a total of 341 confirmed human cases and 242 deaths have been reported nationwide, the majority of cases in Bangladesh were reported in the central and northwest areas, yielding an overall case fatality rate (CFR) of approximately 73% [ 7 8 1 9 9 10 11 The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated how rapidly infectious diseases can escalate from initial detection to global spread. Similarly, Nipah virus (NiV) poses a significant public health threat due to its high mutation rate, enabling adaptation to new environments, cross-species transmission, immune evasion, and potential for increased human-to-human spread [ 12 7 13 14 15 16 17 18 17 19 1 20 21 1 22 22 23 24 25 26 27 Although epidemiological studies have described NiV transmission pathways, a significant gap remains in understanding how Bangladesh’s socio-economic, cultural, and behavioral factors shape public awareness and preventive practices. Addressing this gap is critical for designing effective containment strategies and preventing future public health emergencies. This study evaluates the socio-demographic, economic, and cultural determinants influencing NiV preventive behavior, particularly vaccination willingness. To achieve this, we employ interpretable machine learning models Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) augmented with SHAP analysis to identify the most influential predictors. In parallel, evolutionary-epidemiological models are developed to simulate the impact of awareness-driven behavioral changes and public health interventions, including targeted education campaigns, vaccination programs, and healthcare system strengthening, on NiV transmission dynamics. The findings will generate evidence-based insights to guide policymakers, public health authorities, and healthcare practitioners in reducing NiV-related morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in public health due to its ability to process large-scale datasets with high predictive accuracy and efficiency [ 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 In parallel, numerous studies on vaccination acceptance have applied a variety of approaches, including mathematical modeling, intervention game theory, cross-sectional survey analysis, and contingent valuation (CV) surveys [ 35 35 37 38 36 39 Materials and methods Study design In response to the Nipah virus outbreak in Bangladesh, a comprehensive data collection survey was conducted under the funding of the “Internal Research Project Survey Grant by Research Projects under the Higher Training and Research Program, BUET.” The primary goal was to gain critical insights into the behavioral responses of people in various districts across Bangladesh during the epidemic. To achieve this, a cross-sectional offline survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews with individuals from seven different communities, including Rangpur, Bhola, Feni, Barisal, Narsingdi, Noakhali, and Dhaka. Additionally, an online survey was conducted to gather data from every division and over 30 districts nationwide, ensuring a mix of urban and rural perspectives for a more comprehensive understanding of the Nipah virus’s impact across different settings. The study was designed to capture the diverse effects of the epidemic on individuals from various regions and explore potential health disparities based on demographic factors like age, education, gender, and occupation. A total of 1200 completed questionnaires were collected, with interviews lasting 10–15 min per participant. The minimum required sample size was determined using Cochran’s formula, with a 95% confidence level and a 5% margin of error, based on Bangladesh’s total population (~ 176 million). This calculation yielded a required sample size of 385 respondents. Our study collected 1,200 responses, which far exceeded the minimum threshold, ensuring sufficient statistical power and representativeness. The primary survey was conducted over 17 days, from September 14 to September 30, 2024, by a team of eight interviewers (enumerators) across eight locations in Bangladesh. Trained enumerators holding undergraduate and master’s degrees from local universities engaged respondents in face-to-face interviews. These enumerators underwent a full day of training that covered comprehensive information about Nipah virus’s disease, questionnaire administration techniques, and their responsibilities. They received appropriate compensation for their contributions to the survey. All individuals aged 17 and older were eligible to participate as respondents. The participants represented a broad spectrum of social backgrounds, including differences in age, education, income, daily close contacts, and living conditions. By including a diverse range of participants, the study aimed to reflect the varied experiences and perspectives of the population. The extensive data collected enabled a detailed analysis of how the epidemic impacted different areas and demographic groups across Bangladesh. These findings will guide targeted public health interventions and policies, helping to reduce the epidemic’s effects and improve overall population health. Our proposed methodology (Fig. 1  Fig. 1 The above diagram provides a visual representation of the workflow of this study Questionnaire design Our objective was to collect comprehensive data on people’s perceptions regarding the severity of the Nipah virus, their adherence to preventive measures, cognitive valuation of vaccination, the prevalence of awareness, the behavioral impact of Nipah virus disease, and their health status. To achieve this, we meticulously designed a questionnaire that effectively captured the information necessary for our research objectives. The questionnaire was structured into five sections, each targeting different areas of inquiry. The first section focused on socioeconomic and demographic information, including age, residential area, gender, occupation, education, marital status, income, and contact details. This section aimed to understand participants’ backgrounds and the contextual factors that could influence their experiences and behaviors during the epidemic. The second section addressed health-related factors like chronic conditions like diabetes, cardiovascular or respiratory diseases, and cancer. Participants were also asked about their perspectives on preventive measures and vaccination, including what they believed to be the most critical factors in preventing the spread of the Nipah virus and the considerations influencing their decision to get vaccinated. The third section explored participants’ knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of the Nipah virus. It included questions on symptoms, misconceptions about bats, and behaviors such as consuming bat-bitten fruits or identifying fruits bitten by bats. Participants were asked whether bats were dirty animals, blind, or essential to nature and whether they believed all bats carry the Nipah virus. The fourth section focused mainly on Nipah virus disease awareness and its behavioral impact. It examined the frequency and effectiveness of awareness campaigns, how participants learned about the Nipah virus and their opinions on the importance being informed about its risks. Additionally, participants expressed satisfaction with government efforts to raise awareness about the disease. The final section of the survey focuses on respondents’ preventive behaviors, perceptions, and willingness regarding potential Nipah virus vaccination. It captures self-reported protective measures, perceived importance of vaccination, and the key factors influencing vaccination decisions, such as effectiveness, safety, cost, and accessibility. Statistical analysis To determine the impact of demographic characteristics on an individual’s likelihood to accept vaccination, a chi-square test was performed comparing demographic data with the ‘Willingness to Get Vaccinated’ (WTGV) to check for any significant relationships. A relationship was considered statistically significant if the p Data preparation We used label encoding to convert demographic categorical features to have a numerical representation. This approach is particularly useful when the data has an inherent ordinal relationship or when dealing with high-cardinality features, where one-hot encoding can substantially increase dimensionality, making the model more complex and computationally expensive. In SHAP analysis, one-hot encoding can cause challenges in interpreting feature importance, as it splits a single categorical variable into multiple binary variables, diluting the contribution of the original feature. Label encoding, on the other hand, preserves the feature’s compactness and allows for more straightforward interpretability in SHAP analysis. We trained the machine learning models using demographic features to observe how these algorithms utilize the features in predicting vaccination willingness. This approach also provided insights into whether these features significantly influence a person’s decision. The target variable WTGV consists of five classes. However, we considered two cases in our analysis due to class imbalance, particularly for the “Not willing at all” and “Extremely willing” categories. In the first case, we trained the models using all five classes as the target variable without addressing class imbalance. We recategorized the original response scale into two binary groups for analysis to enhance interpretability. The “Not Willing” group combined individuals who were either Not Willing Slightly Willing Moderately Willing Very Willing Extremely Willing Machine learning and SHAP analysis Machine learning models, particularly tree-based algorithms, effectively identify salient features of a target variable. In this study, we utilized Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and XGBoost classifiers to predict an individual’s willingness to get vaccinated (WTGV). RF and DT classifiers use gini impurity to determine the most relevant features for separating classes, enabling them to identify key factors influencing vaccination attitudes [ 38 40 41 42 Decision tree Decision Tree is a straightforward yet effective machine learning approach for classification and regression problems. In order to produce a tree-like structure, it recursively divides the dataset into subsets according to feature values [ 38 41 Random forest Random Forest (RF) is a robust and widely used ensemble learning algorithm, that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting, suitable for classification [ 38 39 40 XGBoost Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), is a scalable and effective gradient-boosting method that may be used for both regression and classification tasks. Iteratively, it builds an ensemble of decision trees, each of which seeks to fix the mistakes of the one before it. XGBoost uses gradient descent to minimize a loss function at each stage and adds a regularization term to avoid overfitting. In order to create a powerful learner in terms of performance, scalability, and execution speed, it combines multiple weak learners [ 42 SHAP Relying solely on feature importance from these models can be misleading, as they may exhibit bias in specific scenarios. For instance, the Gini impurity measure used in RF and DT can favor features with high cardinality or unique categories [ 43 44 45 46 47 Evaluation metrics for classifier performance The performance of classifiers in identifying significant features influencing the decision of willingness to get vaccinated (WTGV) was evaluated using several key metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. These evaluation metrics are derived from the confusion matrix, a structured representation that compares the predicted classes with the actual classes. The confusion matrix provides critical components for the analysis: True Positive (TP), representing positive instances correctly predicted by the classifier; True Negative (TN), indicating negative instances correctly predicted; False Positive (FP), referring to instances incorrectly predicted as positive when they were actually negative; and False Negative (FN), which denotes instances incorrectly predicted as negative when they were actually positive. These components form the basis for assessing the effectiveness of the classifiers in understanding vaccination-related behaviors. Accuracy Any classifier’s performance is assessed using accuracy, which is determined by comparing the number of properly predicted instances to the total number of instances, which is determined using Eq. ( 1  1 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:\\text{A}\\text{c}\\text{c}\\text{u}\\text{r}\\text{a}\\text{c}\\text{y}=\\:\\frac{(TP+TN)}{(TP+FP+TN+FN)}$$\\end{document} The highest accuracy is insufficient to designate a classifier the best model when the class is unbalanced.

We investigate how different demographic attributes such as age, gender, marital status, educational qualification, family income, family size, and daily social interactions can affect a person’s view on vaccination.

This bar chart of several respondents within each demographic feature by category with respect to “WillingnessTo Get Vaccinated” with a table attached with every graph showcasing the percentage (%) of people distributed among “NW”, “SW”, “MW”, “VW” and “EW” in a category. The y-axis of this figure represents the number of respondents, and the degree of willingness to get vaccinated, which varies depending on demographic characteristics, is expressed by the x-axis. To show the various kinds of responses, different colored bars are assigned. In summary, this figure presents some insights, such as the fact that Urban areas, particularly in the capital city, are more likely to be vaccinated. According to a gender analysis, single people are more likely to be vaccinated, yet nearly 50% of women are quite willing to do so. Educational attainment, occupation, and family income also play a significant role in vaccination willingness. Higher family incomes are associated with greater willingness, while larger family sizes reduce it When considering the area of residence, it is unsurprising that people living in urban settings, particularly in the capital city, are more inclined to get vaccinated than those residing in rural areas or villages. Gender analysis reveals that nearly 50% of women are highly willing to vaccinate (VW and EW categories), compared to only about 36% of men showing similar enthusiasm. Regarding marital status, single individuals are notably more willing to get vaccinated than their married counterparts. Educational attainment also plays a significant role, with more educated individuals demonstrating a considerably higher willingness to vaccinate than those with lower education levels, as shown in Fig. 2 2 Analysis using machine learning Table 4  Table 4 Prediction result of RF, DT, and XGBoost Case-I Algorithms Accuracy Precision Recall F1 Score Random Forest 60.83% 72.91% 47.22% 48.58% Decision Tree 59.58% 53.47% 49.03% 49.84% XGBoost 55.41% 52.85% 50.10% 51.10% Case-II Algorithms Accuracy Precision Recall F1 Score Random Forest 85.00% 82.23% 77.05% 79.04% Decision Tree 84.17% 79.66% 79.04% 79.34% XGBoost 83.75% 78.91% 79.78% 79.33% Figure 3  Fig. 3 Feature importance analysis across different machine learning models. This figure illustrates the feature importance rankings obtained from three machine learning models- Random Forest ( a-i b-i a-ii b-ii a-iii b-iii Case-I Case-II The findings highlight that educational qualifications, income, and occupation are key determinants of vaccination willingness. Interestingly, demographic factors such as area of residence, marital status, and gender play a relatively minor role according to these machine-learning models. This indicates that socio-economic attributes, rather than basic demographics, are more critical in predicting an individual’s likelihood of accepting vaccination. SHAP analysis The summary plot from the SHAP analysis for the trained models is presented in Fig. 4 5  Fig. 4 SHAP value analysis of feature importance across machine learning models. This figure illustrates a detailed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) value analysis of feature importance across three machine learning models- Random Forest( a-i b-i a-ii b-ii a-iii b-iii Case-I Case-II  Fig. 5 Beeswarm plot of SHAP values for correct predictions using three machine learning models. This figure showcases the Beeswarm plots of SHAP values (impact on model output) for accurate projections across three machine learning models: Random Forest( a-i b-i a-ii b-ii a-iii b-iii Case-I Case-II The SHAP values also highlight “family monthly income” as the second most crucial contributor after “max educational qualification” in the Random Forest (RF) model. The analysis reveals that higher family incomes positively influence correct predictions, reinforcing that wealthier individuals are more inclined to vaccinate. However, lower income levels demonstrate mixed contributions, with some leading to positive impacts on predictions while others result in negative influences. This variability underscores that income can be a nuanced predictor depending on additional context within the data. In Decision Tree (DT) models, the beeswarm plots reflect similar findings, with “family monthly income” consistently ranking as the third most influential feature. The similarity between RF and DT results suggests robust patterns across different tree-based models regarding income’s role in vaccination prediction. Conversely, features like “gender,” “marital status,” and “family size” are shown to be less impactful across all models in both cases, indicating minimal influence on the predictions. This aligns with earlier findings where the models also ranked these attributes low in feature importance. Interestingly, in the Decision Tree and XGBoost models, “age” and “average daily interaction” exhibit notable contributions, contrasting with their lower significance in the RF model. In these models, “age” and daily interaction patterns influence predictions more prominently, indicating that demographic and social behavior factors may be more relevant in these specific algorithms. On the other hand, RF continues to downplay their importance, suggesting model-specific differences in feature sensitivity. Overall, the SHAP analysis and beeswarm plots provide comprehensive evidence that socioeconomic factors, especially educational qualification, and income, are the most decisive in predicting vaccination willingness. While demographic factors like age and daily interactions play a role in specific models, they are generally less critical across all cases. The consistency between feature importance rankings and SHAP analyses highlights the reliability of these findings, emphasizing that understanding vaccination behavior requires focusing on socioeconomic disparities more than basic demographic distinctions. Discussion The findings from the socio-demographic analysis and machine learning models provide critical insights into the factors influencing WTGV, which can be utilized to inform and enhance public health policymaking. Higher educational qualifications, family income, and smaller family size were strongly associated with a greater inclination toward vaccination, suggesting that socioeconomic status plays a pivotal role in vaccination acceptance. These patterns align with recent multi-country and regional syntheses, which show that education and economic security underpin vaccine confidence and uptake in low- and middle-income settings, including those in South Asia [ 48 49 49 50 and The machine learning analysis offered a more nuanced understanding of the relative importance of these factors, mainly agreeing with the classical statistical analysis. Across multiple algorithms, “MaxEducationQualification” consistently emerged as the most critical predictor of vaccination willingness, which is also shown in a study across the United States for COVID-19 vaccination as one of six main factors [ 51 52 53 54 Our findings mainly suggest that public health strategies should prioritize education-first messaging by delivering accurate information about vaccination in plain language, busting local myths through trusted messengers or celebrities, complemented with visual tools and community dialogues to engage groups with lower educational attainment. Reducing economic barriers is equally essential, which can be achieved by providing free or subsidized vaccines, deploying mobile clinics near workplaces and markets, and offering modest transport or wage-loss compensation to offset income-related constraints. Engagement approaches should also be tailored to the place in rural settings, leveraging local leaders and in-person forums can build trust, while in urban contexts, digital platforms and workplace-based campaigns may be more effective. Given the observed gender differences, male-targeted outreach should emphasize the benefits of vaccination in safeguarding family well-being and income stability while directly addressing risk perceptions. The higher willingness observed among females emphasizes that they should be given more autonomy in health-related decision-making for the family. Limitations and future directions This study elucidates significant insights regarding the socioeconomic responses to Nipah virus vaccination in Bangladesh; however, it is imperative to acknowledge several limitations. Firstly, the data were derived from a relatively limited cohort of the national population, which may constrain the generalizability of the findings. Despite efforts to capture a diverse array of responses, a predominant portion of the respondents were students (54.5%), skewing the sample toward a younger demographic and potentially affecting the validity of the conclusions. Secondly, the reliance on self-reported data poses inherent challenges such as recall bias, social desirability bias, and potential misrepresentation of sensitive attitudes toward vaccination. Furthermore, while the analysis primarily concentrated on socioeconomic and demographic predictors of willingness to vaccinate against the Nipah virus (WTGV), it did not take into account other significant variables that could influence vaccination attitudes, including cultural beliefs, exposure to misinformation regarding vaccines, trust in health authorities, and perceptions of vaccine safety and efficacy. The omission of these variables could limit the explanatory power necessary for a comprehensive understanding of vaccine hesitancy. Additionally, although the application of machine learning techniques and SHAP analysis yielded valuable insights, the efficacy of these models is contingent upon the quality, completeness, and representativeness of the input data utilized. To address these limitations, future research should aim to conduct more extensive investigations that monitor shifts in public attitudes toward vaccination throughout different phases of an outbreak and post-outbreak scenarios. Expanding the survey scope to encompass a larger, nationally representative sample, in conjunction with qualitative interviews, could facilitate a more nuanced comprehension of the motivations and barriers to vaccination. Moreover, integrating behavioral, cultural, and psychosocial variables alongside demographic factors would enhance predictive modeling and inform targeted interventions. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that willingness to vaccinate (WTGV) against the Nipah virus in Bangladesh is determined by a complex interplay of socio-demographic and socioeconomic factors. Education and family income emerged as the most influential predictors, consistently ranked highest across Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models. At the same time, SHAP analysis further validated that lower education and income levels were associated with reduced vaccination willingness. Statistical analyses also revealed significant associations ( p Supplementary Information Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
