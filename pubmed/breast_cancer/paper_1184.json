Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical role in promoting TNBC metastasis. The natural bioactive substance 3-hydroxy-β-ionone (3-HBI), which has been studied in other cancer types, has not yet been examined in TNBC. This study investigates its potential mechanisms in TNBC cells through a combination of computational and experimental approaches, focusing on apoptosis induction and EMT inhibition. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated strong and stable binding of 3-HBI to key apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2, Bax, caspase-3) and EMT regulators (Smad2, Smad3).

Introduction Breast cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of mammary epithelial cells and is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide, with high incidence and mortality rates [ 1 2 3 4 5 The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process that facilitates tumor progression, invasion, and chemoresistance. In breast cancer, EMT is largely regulated by the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad) signaling pathway, in which phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3 form a complex with Smad4 and translocate into the nucleus to regulate EMT-related genes such as N-cadherin and Vimentin [ 6 7 8 9 9 10 5 6 7 8 9 10 Natural compounds, including alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and phenylpropanoids, have emerged as promising anti-cancer agents due to their biological activity and low toxicity [ 11 12 13 Moringa oleifera 14 15 Rhynchostegium pallidifolium 16 14 17 18 19 In this study, we used both in vitro and in silico methods to examine the anti-cancer properties of 3-HBI found in MO extract in MDA-MB-231, a TNBC cells. We assessed its impact on invasion and migration, apoptosis induction, and cytotoxicity. Key target proteins in the apoptosis and EMT pathways were identified using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations, and these were then experimentally validated using Western blot and RT-qPCR. Here, we show that 3-HBI suppresses breast cancer by causing apoptosis and blocking invasion and migration. Additionally, the study suggests that 3-HBI may target Smad2 and Smad3 in the TGF-β/Smad pathway, Bcl-2–associated X (Bax), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and caspase-3 in the apoptosis pathway in order against TNBC. 2. Results 2.1. The Cytotoxicity of 3-Hydroxy-β-ionone (3-HBI)-Identified from Moringa oleifera Lam. (MO) Extract on Breast Cancer Cell Lines To determine the cytotoxic potential of 3-HBI and MO extract, MTT assays were conducted on TNBC cells. 3-HBI exhibited dose-dependent cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231, as the TNBC cell line. The five percent inhibitory concentration (IC 5 10 50 Figure 1 5 10 50 Figure 1 50 IC 5 10 50 Figure 1 5 10 50 Figure 1 5 10 50 Figure 1 5 10 50 Figure 1 2.2. The Cytotoxicity of 3-HBI on the Fibroblast Cell Line To evaluate the potential of 3-HBI as a future therapeutic agent against triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), we investigated its effects on normal, proliferating human cells. Specifically, we employed the human dermal fibroblast cell line CCD-1123Sk to model the cytotoxic response in non-cancerous cells, recognizing that natural compounds often exhibit limited specificity and may adversely affect rapidly dividing normal cells [ 20 21 Figure 2 Figure 2 50 Figure 1 Figure 2 We selected concentrations of 3-HBI at 60, 80, and 150 μg/mL, and MO at 60, 80, and 100 μg/mL to investigate the effects of 3-HBI-derived MO on key hallmarks of TNBC. All concentrations used were below the IC 50 22 2.3. 3-HBI Inhibited TNBC Colony Formation To assess anti-TNBC activity, we investigated key cancer hallmarks: proliferation, apoptosis resistance, and metastasis. We performed 3-HBI on TNBC proliferation by using colony formation. The colony formation assay is an in vitro cell survival assay based on the ability of a single cell to grow into a colony. Colony formation assays revealed a substantial decrease in the number of colonies in treated TNBC cells ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 2.4. The Role of 3-HBI on Breast Cancer Cell Apoptosis Apoptosis targeting demonstrates effectiveness against various types of cancer [ 23 2.4.1. In Silico Binding to Apoptotic Regulators The interactions between 3-HBI and each apoptosis pathway-related protein were analyzed using AutoDock Vina. The analysis revealed that the proteins with the highest probability of being target proteins are Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase 3, with ΔG values of −6.5, −5.9, and −5.4 kcal/mol, respectively, as shown in Table 1 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Figure 4 Furthermore, we validated the stability of the formed complexes over 250 ns using molecular dynamic simulation. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) indicated that 3-HBI is relatively stable, with values below 2 Å over a time scale of 250 ns for three proteins. Specifically, Bax-3-HBI remained relatively stable within 2–4 Å over a time scale of 250 ns ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 2.4.2. 3-HBI-Induced Breast Cancer Cell Apoptosis To evaluate 3-HBI-induced breast cancer apoptosis, after a 24 h treatment with MO extract and 3-HBI, the cells were assessed using Annexin V/7-AAD. The result showed that MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis was significantly increased in a concentration-dependent manner with 3-HBI compared to the control ( Figure 6 Figure 6 Figure S1 2.4.3. The Effect of 3-HBI on Genes and Proteins in the Apoptosis Pathway Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation-related key genes and proteins involved in apoptosis were validated by RT-qPCR and Western blotting analyses. RT-qPCR showed 3-HBI upregulation of Bax and caspase-3, and downregulation of Bcl-2 at the mRNA level ( Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure S2 2.5. 3-HBI Inhibits TNBC Metastasis The TGF-β/Smad pathway is one of the key pathways involved in EMT [ 9 10 24 25 2.5.1. Molecular Docking and Molecular Dynamics Simulation with the TGF-β/Smad Pathway To predict 3-HBI interactions with each TGF-β/Smad pathway-related protein involved in cancer metastasis, the proteins were analyzed using AutoDock Vina. It was found that the proteins with the highest probability of being target proteins are Smad3 and Smad2, with ΔG of −5.4 and −5.1 kcal/mol, respectively, as shown in Table 2 Figure 8 Further, the Smad3-3-HBI and Smad2-3-HBI constant complexes were verified by molecular dynamics simulation. In both complexes, 3-HBI remains relatively RMSD stable, with values below 2 Å over a 250 ns timescale. The RMSD of the Smad3-3-HBI complex remains consistent at 3–4 Å ( Figure 9 Figure 9 Figure 9 2.5.2. 3-HBI Inhibited TNBC Migration and Invasion To evaluate the effect of 3-HBI on EMT and metastatic potential in TNBC cells, we conducted wound healing and Transwell invasion assays. EMT is characterized by the transition of epithelial cells into mesenchymal-like cells, which enhances their migratory and invasive capacities. The wound healing assay was used to assess cell migration, reflecting the increased motility associated with EMT. In parallel, the Transwell invasion assay evaluated the ability of cells to degrade and ECM, a process facilitated by MMPs secreted during EMT [ 25 Wound healing demonstrated that 3-HBI, derived from MO, significantly suppressed TNBC cell motility. The wound area was assessed at 0, 6, 12, and 24 h. Compared to the untreated control, cells treated with MO extract or 3-HBI exhibited significantly delayed wound closure, with larger wound areas persisting throughout the observation period ( Figure 10 Figure 10 An invasion assay was conducted to evaluate the impact of 3-HBI-derived MO extract on the invasion ability of TNBC. The findings demonstrated that, in comparison to the control, the invasion of cells was significantly reduced in the MO extract and 3-HBI groups as well as in the doxorubicin group ( Figure 11 2.5.3. The Effect of 3-HBI on Genes and Proteins in the TGF-β/Smad Pathway To confirm that 3-HBI inhibits the TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway, RT-qPCR and Western blot analyses revealed that 3-HBI and MO downregulated SMAD2 SMAD3 SMAD4 CDH2 Figure 12 Figure S3 Figure 12 Figure S3 CDH1 Figure 12 Figure S3 Figure 12 Figure S3 3. Discussion Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains one of the most aggressive breast cancer subtypes due to its high recurrence rate, metastatic potential, and lack of targeted therapies [ 3 26 Moringa oleifera 3-HBI has been previously investigated for its anti-inflammatory properties [ 14 27 17 18 19 28 28 29 30 14 Our findings indicate that 3-HBI may exert activity in TNBC, particular in the MDA-MB-231 cell line by targeting apoptosis and metastatic pathways, as supported by the in vitro and in silico data presented ( Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 9 Figure 10 Figure 11 Figure 12 3-HBI-induced breast cancer apoptosis is the beneficial outcome of this investigation ( Figure 6 Figure S1 Figure 4 Figure 5 31 32 Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 4 32 33 34 Figure 6 Figure 7 Figure 4 35 Figure 7 19 17 The main contribution of this work is that 3-HBI prevents TNBC metastasis by interfering with TGF-β/Smad-mediated EMT, which is a crucial mechanism for TNBC metastasis. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation indicated that 3-HBI binds stably to Smad2 and Smad3, potentially preventing phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of the Smad2/3/4 complex ( Figure 8 Figure 9 CHD1 SMAD2 SMAD3 SMAD4 CHD2 Figure 10 Figure 11 Figure 12 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Culture and Chemicals MDA-MB-231 is the human TNBC cell line. MCF7 is a human ER-positive breast cancer cell line. CCD-1123Sk is a human fibroblast cell line. They were obtained from the American Type Cell Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified eagle (DMEM) medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 TM 4.2. Preparation of Moringa oleifera Lam. (MO) Extracts and Identification of Active Compounds As stated in our earlier investigation, moringa leaves were isolated, and the active component was found [ 14 4.3. Cytotoxicity Assay Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, T47D, MCF7, and fibroblast cell line CCD-1123Sk were cultured in 96-well plates at 1 × 10 4 2 Calculated inhibitory concentrations using the equation below, F is the percent of IC, H is the slope factor (Hill slope) from the graph and IC 50 I C F = ( F 100 − F ) H · IC 50 4.4. Colony Formation Assay MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded into 12-well plates at 500 cells/well in DMEM completed medium and treated with doxorubicin, MO extract, and 3-HBI for 24 h. Then cells were washed and replaced with complete DMEM culture for 14 days. Cells were fixed with 10% neutral formalin and stained with 0.5% crystal violet to visualize colonies and photograph them. To dissolve crystal violet, 1 mL of 99.9% methanol was added to each well. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader (PerkinElmer Inc., Hopkinton, MA, USA). 4.5. Migration Assay In vitro scratch assay examined MDA-MB-231 migration. 2 × 10 5 4.6. Transwell Invasion Assay Next, 1 × 10 5 4.7. Reverse Transcription-Quantitative Real-Time PCR (RT-qPCR) The total RNA was isolated by using a Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using Ultrascript 2.0 synthesis kit (PCR Biosystems, London, UK). The thermal cycler program of cDNA synthesis involved incubation at 55 °C for 30 min followed by 95 °C for 10 min to inactivate reverse transcriptase. The synthesized cDNAs were amplified with specific primers using Qpcrbio sygreen mix separate-rox (PCR Biosystems, London, UK). RT-qPCR was conducted in three stages: an initial hold at 95 °C for 10 min; a PCR stage consisting of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 s, annealing at 58 °C for 10 s, and extension at 72 °C for 15 s, repeated for 40 cycles; and a final melting stage at 72 °C for 15 s followed by 95 °C for 15 s. Gene expression differences among groups were quantified based on CT values, normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH (ΔCT), and presented as fold-change over control (2 −ΔΔCT 36 Table 3 4.8. Western Blot Analysis Cells were lysed in Radioimmunoprecipitation Assay (RIPA) buffer supplemented with 1× protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail for 5 min, ice cold and sonicated, and then centrifuged at 14,000× g ® TM 4.9. Molecular Docking The molecular docking study used AutoDock Vina [ 37 38 39 Table 4 4.10. Molecular Dynamics Simulation The top three docking results with energies lower than −5 kcal/mol, related to apoptosis and the TGF-β/Smad pathway, were chosen for further study using molecular dynamics simulations. Molecular dynamics simulation of 3-HBI in complex with the proteins was carried out using the GROMACS 2022.4 software package on GPU accelerators [ 50 51 52 53 + − 4.11. Statistical Analysis Data are expressed as means ± SEM from three independent experiments. In the case of more than two groups, one-way ANOVA with post hoc multiple comparison corrections (Dunnett’s test) was conducted using GraphPad Prism 10.2.3 software. Statistical significance was defined as * p p p p 5. Conclusions The findings indicate that 3-HBI reduces the growth of breast cancer by causing cell death, potentially by influencing the apoptosis pathway’s Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3. Furthermore, 3-HBI suppresses Smad2/3 in TGF-β/Smad signaling, which suppresses breast cancer metastasis. This study highlights 3-HBI as a promising candidate for further exploration in the development of novel anti-triple-negative breast cancer agents.
