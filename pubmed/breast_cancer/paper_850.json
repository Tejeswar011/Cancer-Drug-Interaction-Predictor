Germinated moringa seeds could be marketed as a novel food ingredient for functional food formulations. Attempts to understand the bioactive compounds and their associated health benefits of moringa seeds and sprouts would be conducive to developing functional foods and nutraceuticals. This review summarizes germination and its impact on the bioactive compounds in moringa seeds and sprouts and discusses their bioactivities, with the mechanisms of action in cell and animal models being elucidated. Some applications of moringa seeds and sprouts in functional food formulations are also provided. Germination accumulates a range of bioactive compounds, particularly phenolic compounds, glucosinolates (GSLs), and their corresponding isothiocyanates (ITCs) in moringa seeds and sprouts. Of these, glucomoringin is the most abundant GSL. The health‐promoting properties of moringa seeds and sprouts may be prominently associated with the glycosylated ITC, moringin, which is produced by the hydrolysis of glucomoringin. The reported bioactivities of moringa seeds and their extracts include antioxidation, anti‐inflammation, antidiabetes, anti‐carcinogenesis, and hepatoprotection. Multiple cell and animal studies have demonstrated the protective effects of moringa seeds and their extracts by activating antioxidant gene expression, thereby mitigating oxidative stress. Additionally, their ability to downregulate pro‐inflammatory cytokines helps alleviate inflammation‐associated chronic diseases such as diabetes and cancer. In conclusion, germination is an effective approach to enriching bioactive compounds in moringa seeds, which could be consumed as functional foods or serve as a novel bioingredient for the development of functional foods to prevent and/or alleviate chronic diseases. bioactive compounds germination glucomoringin health benefits moringa seeds and sprouts moringin Ministry of Education ‐ Singapore 10.13039/501100001459 A‐8001953‐00‐00 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes source-schema-version-number 2.0 cover-date November 2025 details-of-publishers-convertor Converter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_JATSPMC version:6.6.4 mode:remove_FC converted:27.09.2025  Liu Y.

Germination also reduces some antinutritional components of edible seeds, while increasing digestibility. Generally, the germination process of moringa seeds involves three prominent steps, namely, sanitation, soaking, and sprouting. 2.1 Sanitation Surface sanitation is a common practice prior to seed soaking, although it is occasionally omitted in certain studies (Dawood 2020 2020 2017 Of the various sanitizing reagents, sodium hypochlorite solution (0.02%–5.25%, w/v) is the most widely used for surface sanitation of moringa seeds (Coello et al. 2020 2018 2013 2024 1991 2.2 Soaking Germination initiates itself with the absorption of water by the inactive seeds (imbibition). Therefore, soaking is a necessary step to activate dry, dormant mature seeds, as it enables the rapid resumption of metabolic processes, leading to the breakdown of storage macromolecules in the endosperm that subsequently provide energy and nutrients for embryo expansion and radicle penetration (Tesfay et al. 2016 2023 2020 2.3 Sprouting Hydrated moringa seeds are normally sprouted in soil or vessels, such as in incubators or germination trays lined with wet filter papers (Coello et al. 2020 2024 2023 2023 2020 2020 2024 2023 However, sprouting moringa seeds presents several practical and technical challenges. For example, their relatively hard seed coat may hinder uniform water absorption and radicle emergence, making optimization of the soaking process essential. In addition, moringa seeds are highly susceptible to microbial contamination during germination, particularly under warm and humid conditions such as 35°C and 90% relative humidity. Therefore, sanitation is a critical preparatory step to disinfect seeds and enhance germination rates. Furthermore, the white wings on the seed coat need to be removed prior to soaking and germination, as their high moisture absorption can lead to rancidity and promote microbial growth. However, the removal of wings without damaging the seed coat is labor‐intensive and time‐consuming, particularly in large‐scale sprouting operations. Interestingly, advanced techniques such as cold plasma treatment have been applied to enhance the germination rate of moringa seeds. For example, moringa seeds treated with cold plasma at 100 W and an argon gas pressure of 2 torr for 1 min achieved an initial germination rate of approximately 85% on day 1, which rose to nearly 100% after 2 days of germination, representing an increase of about 20%–25% compared to untreated seeds (Dawood 2020 3 Physiological and Biochemical Changes of Moringa Seeds During Germination Moringa seed germination generally comprises three phases: (1) the initial uptake of water by the seeds and DNA repair in phase I; (2) the translation or degradation of stored mRNA and substantial transcription of new genes in phase II; and (3) the radicle emergence in phase III signifying the completion of germination (Bewley et al. 2012 2023 2012 2014 2014 Numerous intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g., morphological and physiological status of the embryo, seed nutritional reserves, seed coat characteristics, type of dormancy, maceration and time, and environmental conditions), either independently or in combination, can affect the seed germination and the final quality of sprouts (Liu et al. 2022 2023 3.1 Morphological Changes The outer morphology of moringa seeds is shown in Figure 1A 2016 2015 2016 1B FIGURE 1 (A) Moringa pods and seeds; (B) the anatomy of moringa seeds; (C) the structural changes of moringa seeds during germination. Source 2024 To germinate, dormant moringa seeds must be hydrated under appropriate conditions that support metabolic reactivation. Water uptake by the dry seeds is crucial for initiating metabolic processes and cellular activities, leading to radicle emergence and the subsequent development of the early seedling. Upon imbibition, respiration is immediately activated to provide the metabolic energy required for the germination progress (Tesfay et al. 2016 2010 1C 3.2 Degradation of Seed Storage Reserves After imbibition, moringa seeds mobilize their storage reserves, primarily carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins deposited in the cotyledons, to initiate germination and provide energy for the early seedling growth. The required energy is tightly associated with catalytic enzyme activities where, under suitable conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity), these stored macromolecules are hydrolyzed to simple, soluble, and mobile compounds that are utilized for growth and development. In addition to these primary reserves, phytin, although present in a relatively small quantity, is significant as it serves as a critical source of phosphate and essential mineral elements for the seeds. 3.2.1 Carbohydrates Starch represents the primary form of stored carbohydrates present in moringa seeds. During germination, starch is broken down to simple sugars (e.g., glucose, sucrose, and fructose), which are readily utilized as energy sources for embryonic growth. The hydrolysis and mobilization of starch are associated with catalytic enzymes (e.g., α‐amylase), of which the higher activity can accelerate the speed of seed germination and increase the germination rate. Temperature, as a critical climatic factor, plays a pivotal role in regulating enzyme activity during the germination of moringa seeds. It is reported that the amylase activity shows a positive correlation with germination temperature. For example, the 30°C/20°C (day/night) temperature regime leads to a sharp increase of amylase catalysis of starch after 24 h seed imbibition, as compared to that at lower temperature regimes (25°C/15°C and 20°C/10°C) (Tesfay et al. 2016 2016 3.2.2 Lipids Storage lipids are the major energy reserves in moringa seeds, primarily existing as triacylglycerols (TAGs), which consist of a glycerol (Gly) molecule with three FAs bound to it (de la Mora‐López et al. 2018 P 2012 2018 2018 2020 3.2.3 Proteins During germination, the hydrolysis of storage proteins involves the action of various proteases that release free amino acids or small polypeptides, which might be subsequently degraded by peptidases. Regarding their substrate specificities, the proteases can be classified into endopeptidases and exopeptidases (e.g., aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases), based on their mode of action. Endopeptidases remove internal peptide bonds within the protein, producing smaller polypeptides, whereas exopeptidases sequentially remove terminal amino acid from the free amino end of the polypeptide chain (Bewley et al. 2012 2018 2020 2018 2018 3.2.4 Phytin Phytin, also known as myo 2012 2022 2022 2022 4 Bioactive Compounds in Moringa Seeds and Sprouts Table S1 4.1 GABA GABA is a four‐carbon free amino acid commonly found in bacteria, plants, and vertebrates (Diana et al. 2014 2015 2017 2019 2022 l 1990 2014 2012 2019 It is reported that germination remarkably increases the GABA content in moringa seeds (Coello et al. 2020 2020 2020 2020 2011 4.2 Phenolic Compounds Phenolic compounds are chemically defined as a class of molecules containing one or more hydroxylated aromatic rings and are primarily biosynthesized through the shikimate and phenylpropanoid pathways (Corso et al. 2020 2012 2020 2004 2013 2013 2013 2024 S1 Recent studies have demonstrated that germination can significantly enhance the total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant capacity of moringa seeds (Coello et al. 2020 2018 2024 2011 2017 2014 4.3 GSLs and Their Corresponding ITCs GSLs are a class of sulfur‐containing secondary metabolites invariably present in plants of the Brassicales order. They have long been recognized for anti‐carcinogenesis (Augustine and Bisht 2015 1997 2012 d 2021 2010 2019 2010 To date, over 120 GSLs have been characterized in plants, with more being continuously discovered (Blažević et al. 2020 2003 2020 2018 2024 2 1964 2003 2020 FIGURE 2 Chemical structures of glucosinolates (GSLs) identified in moringa seeds and/or sprouts. Source 2024 The content of glucomoringin in moringa sprouts fluctuates widely, depending on the germination temperature and duration (Coello et al. 2020 2020 2024 BCA CYP AOP 2019 2024 So far, the biosynthetic pathways of glucomoringin in moringa sprouts have yet to be well elucidated. In our previous study, we proposed that tyrosine could be the precursor amino acid for glucomoringin biosynthesis in moringa sprouts, as exogenous tyrosine remarkably stimulated the production of glucomoringin during moringa seed germination (Liu, Zhang, et al. 2024 3 2024 2025 3 2025 para FIGURE 3 The potential/proposed biosynthetic pathways of glucomoringin in moringa sprouts.

These bioactivities are largely attributed to their rich profiles of phytochemicals, such as phenolic compounds, glucomoringin, and moringin. Although the body of preclinical and clinical research on the health effects of moringa seeds, sprouts, and their extracts remains limited, numerous in vivo studies using animal models have consistently demonstrated their therapeutic potential (Al‐Malki and El Rabey 2015 2010 2021 1 TABLE 1 Health benefits of moringa seeds and their extracts in animal studies.

Their in vitro antioxidant capacities have been demonstrated through free radical scavenging assays, such as 2,2‐diphenyl‐1‐picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′‐azino‐bis (3‐ethylbenzothiazoline‐6‐sulfonic acid) (ABTS), and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), as well as reducing power assays like ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) (Cirlini et al. 2022 2018 2024 2024 2020 2024 2016 In animal studies, the activation of antioxidant gene expression via the nuclear factor erythroid 2‐related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway is a key mechanism through which moringa seeds and their extracts exert various health benefits, including anticancer, hepatoprotective, and antidiabetic effects (Wen et al. 2022 S 5.2 Anti‐Inflammatory Effect Inflammation is a typical physiological defense response to tissue damage, driven by oxidative stress and the excessive secretion of inflammatory cytokines (Wang et al. 2022 2016 2016 Moringa seed extracts also show promising anti‐inflammatory effects in both cell and animal models. For example, cellular studies have demonstrated the anti‐inflammatory effects of moringa seed extracts by reducing NO production via mediating the iNOS pathway (Jaja‐Chimedza et al. 2017 2017 The anti‐inflammatory effects of moringa seeds and their extracts have also been confirmed in various animal studies, contributing to the alleviation of inflammation‐associated chronic diseases, such as diabetes and cancer (Jaja‐Chimedza et al. 2018 5.3 Protection Against Carcinogenesis Cancer has become a major public health threat, with risk factors including exposure to chemicals and radiation, lack of exercise, aging, and genetic predisposition. Although traditional cancer therapies, such as percutaneous ablation treatment, surgical resection, and chemotherapy, have significantly improved survival rates, the overall prognosis remains poor (Wu et al. 2021 4 FIGURE 4 The potential anti‐carcinogenic mechanisms of moringa seeds and their extracts, along with the key signaling pathways involved (Brunelli et al. 2010 2019 2022 Source Multiple cancer cell lines have been utilized to evaluate the anti‐carcinogenic and anti‐proliferative effects of moringa seeds and/or their extracts (Das et al. 2024 2020 2010 2019 2022 The anti‐carcinogenic effects of moringa seeds and their extracts have also been evidenced in animal studies. For example, moringa seed ethanolic extracts have been shown to reduce angiogenesis in tumors and improve metabolic health in mice with triple‐negative breast cancer (Zunica et al. 2021 2023 2010 Although the anticancer activities of moringa seeds and their extracts have been demonstrated in various cellular and animal studies, clinical evidence in humans remains scarce. Further well‐designed clinical research is necessary to evaluate their safety, efficacy, and therapeutic potential as an anticancer agent. 5.4 Protection Against Diabetes Mellitus (DM) DM is a metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia, the primary cause of diabetic complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, posing a serious health threat to populations worldwide (Al‐Malki and El Rabey 2015 5 FIGURE 5 The potential antidiabetic mechanisms of moringa seeds and their extracts, along with the key signaling pathways involved (Aljazzaf et al. 2023 2018 2022 Source Oral administration of moringa seed powder (50 and 100 mg/kg body weight per day for 4 weeks) was found to restore kidney and pancreatic function in the streptozotocin (STZ)‐induced diabetic rats by reducing lipid peroxidation, IL‐6, immunoglobulins (e.g., IgA and IgG), and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, while raising antioxidant enzyme activity (e.g., catalase, SOD, and GSH) in the serum and kidney (Al‐Malki and El Rabey 2015 2023 2015 2022 2022 2018 However, human studies on the antidiabetic and hypoglycemic effects of consuming moringa seeds, sprouts, and their extracts remain scant. Although animal studies have demonstrated promising results, including improved glucose tolerance and restored renal function, well‐designed clinical trials are needed to confirm these effects on humans. Further research is required to determine their optimal dosage, long‐term safety, and underlying mechanisms of action in DM management. 5.5 Hepatoprotective Effect Hepatic injury has emerged as a significant global health concern, driven by alcohol consumption, drug use, viral hepatitis, and metabolic disorders, which can lead to inflammation, necrosis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis (Sun et al. 2019 4 2010 2010 2013 4 2012 2019 O l 4 2019 5.6 Other Health Benefits Administration of ethanolic extracts of moringa seeds (100 mg/g body weight per day, 8 days) protected against arsenic‐induced uterine damages in rats, potentially by restoring the arsenic‐detoxified environment and upregulating liver metallothionein to mitigate oxidative stress (Jana et al. 2020 2022 2017 2016 S 2024 6 Impact of Processing on Chemical Composition and Bioactive Compounds of Moringa Seeds and Sprouts Different processing techniques like thermal and non‐thermal methods can greatly impact the chemical composition and bioactivity of moringa seeds and sprouts. Although a recent review has summarized the effects of heat (e.g., roasting and cooking) and biological treatments (e.g., fermentation and germination) on the proximate composition, micronutrients, and antinutrients of moringa seeds (Saa et al. 2019 2 TABLE 2 Impact of roasting, boiling, and fermentation on the nutrients, bioactive compounds, and organoleptic properties of moringa seeds.

( 2024 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 6.1 Roasting Roasting is a key heat treatment that can induce chemical changes in moringa seeds and sprouts, which may in turn impact their nutritional composition, bioactive compounds, flavor, aroma, and sensory acceptability, among others. For example, after being roasted at 140°C for 50 min, the content of crude fibers and crude proteins in defatted moringa seed flour significantly increased from 3.7 to 4.8 g/100 g DW and from 58.7 to 61.8 g/100 g DW, respectively, whereas the amount of antinutrients, including saponins, trypsin inhibitor, oxalates, and phytates, significantly decreased (Saa et al. 2022 2020 2020 On the other hand, the effect of roasting treatment on the bioactive compounds of moringa seeds, including glucomoringin, moringin, and phenolic compounds, mainly depends on the different degrees of roasting (e.g., light, medium, and excessive roasting). Light (roasted either at 125°C and 150°C for 10 min or at 175°C for 5 min) to medium roasting (roasted at 175°C for 10 min) significantly increased the glucomoringin content from 43.7 µmol/g DW (raw moringa seed kernels) to the maximum of 127.3 µmol/g DW (roasted at 175°C for 5 min) (Liu, Chin, Huang, et al. 2024 2024 2024 2024 Despite their high nutritional value and bioactive compounds, the strong pungent and bitter taste of moringa seeds and sprouts restricts their potential utilization either as a bioingredient for functional food formulations or as a functional food for consumption. Roasting could be a promising processing technique to improve the sensory acceptability of moringa seeds and sprouts by developing nutty and caramelic aromas. This improvement is likely attributed to multiple thermal reactions, such as Maillard reaction and caramelization, which generate complex aroma compounds that may help musk undesirable taste attributes (Liu, Chin, Sun, et al. 2024 6.2 Boiling Boiling is a common processing method that has been employed to modify the nutritional composition of moringa seeds. Compared to unprocessed moringa seeds, boiling (100°C for 15 min) significantly reduced antinutrients, including tannins, phytates, oxalates, saponins, trypsin inhibitor, and cyanogenic glycoside, among which tannins were the dominant antinutrients in moringa seeds (Matthew et al. 2022 2022 Apart from the loss of certain vitamins, boiling or even sub‐boiling treatment may lead to a reduction of moringin content in moringa seeds. Lu et al. ( 2021 2021 2012 2025 6.3 Fermentation Fermentation is an effective biological treatment that can boost the nutritional value and bioactivity of moringa seeds. For example, spontaneous fermentation at room temperature for 72 h significantly modified the proximate composition of moringa seeds, increasing carbohydrate content from 53.4% to 61.1% and protein content from 18.9% to 21.2%, whereas lipid (13.4%–14.0%) and dietary fiber (5.0%–6.2%) levels remained comparable to those of raw moringa seeds (Ijarotimi et al. 2013 2023 Rhizopus Rhizopus oligosporus Rhizopus stolonifer R. oligosporus R. stolonifer R. oligosporus R. stolonifer 1995 2013 2013 R. stolonifer 2018 The effect of fermentation on TPC in moringa seeds varies, possibly depending on the inoculated microbial species. The phenolic content in moringa seeds sharply decreased by 42.5% after natural fermentation at room temperature for 72 h (Ijarotimi et al. 2013 R. oligosporus R. stolonifer 2023 Aspergillus oryzae Aspergillus niger 2024 2020 Additionally, fermentation is an effective biotechnique to reduce the bitterness of moringa seeds by using appropriate microorganisms that produce myrosinase to degrade GSLs. For example, Puspitasari et al. ( 2024 A. oryzae A. niger A. oryzae A. niger 2024 7 Applications of Moringa Seeds and Sprouts in Functional Food Formulations Germination is one of the most dynamic stages in the growth of moringa trees. As discussed, it can not only break down macromolecules (e.g., carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids) in moringa seeds into smaller substances that are more easily to be digested and absorbed by human body but also reduce antinutrient factors (e.g., phytin, tannins, and saponins) and upregulate certain bioactive compounds (e.g., GABA, phenolic compounds, and GSLs) with enhanced health‐promoting properties. These beneficial aspects may promote moringa seeds and/or sprouts as emerging dietary supplements and innovative bioingredients for functional food formulations.

( 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Moringa seeds and sprouts are commonly used in the form of flour that is incorporated into foods, serving as an alternative source of nutrients. To produce moringa seed or sprout flour, seeds are typically cleaned, dehulled, and dried, whereas sprouts are harvested after a defined germination period and then dried and milled into a fine powder (Coello et al. 2022 2024 2014 2019 2011 2016 Apart from their applications in bakery products, the enrichment of pasta products with moringa seed and sprout flour has also been reported (Coello et al. 2021 2021 2025 2025 Listeria monocytogenes Escherichia coli Salmonella Staphylococcus aureus 2020 Lactobacillus bulgaricus Streptococcus thermophilus Moringa seeds and sprouts have also been supplemented at various concentrations for manufacturing healthy and ready‐to‐eat snack bars with acceptable texture and odor (Coello et al. 2022 Overall, moringa seeds and sprouts are a promising bioingredient for functional food formulations. Their incorporation into food products, including breads, cakes, cookies, noodles, and snacks, not only enhances their nutritional value but also provides an alternative for vegans/vegetarians to consume sufficient proteins. In the case of meat and milk products, the addition of moringa seeds and sprouts may also improve the antioxidant and antimicrobial capacity of the products with high quality and extended shelf life. However, adding high concentrations of moringa seeds and sprouts can lead to bitter and astringent taste, negatively impacting the overall acceptance of the final products. Herein, more relevant studies are necessary to identify the taste‐evoked compounds (e.g., phenolics, GSLs, and ITCs) and elucidate their formation mechanism. Some effective strategies should be constructed, from cultivation practices to innovative food processing technologies, to reduce or even eliminate the perception of the unpleasant taste. 8 Opportunities and Challenges of Moringa Seeds and Sprouts Moringa seeds and sprouts have a great nutritional value and contain a variety of bioactive compounds, particularly glucomoringin and moringin, with health‐promoting properties. These nutritional properties and beneficial health effects make moringa sprouts a promising functional food or a novel bioingredient for functional food formulations. Critically, moringin extracted and purified from moringa seeds and/or sprouts may be used as a novel chemotherapeutic agent due to its potent chemopreventive activity against a broad range of cancers, as reported in numerous in vivo studies. However, there are still some major concerns regarding moringa seeds and sprouts that are required to be further investigated, ranging from upregulation of bioactive compounds through abiotic and biotic elicitors to validation of safety of glucomoringin and moringin in clinical studies. The challenges are listed as follows: Seed germination is a complex biological process influenced by both internal (e.g., seed viability and hormonal balance) and external factors (e.g., temperature, moisture, light exposure, and oxygen availability). These factors may affect not only germination rate but also the activation of metabolic pathways responsible for the synthesis of secondary metabolites, such as phenolic compounds and GSLs. However, how these variables influence both germination performance of moringa seeds and phytochemical accumulation during germination remains underexplored. Therefore, further research is warranted to comprehensively evaluate the impact of these internal and/or external sprouting conditions on the germination dynamics and bioactive compounds in moringa seeds and sprouts. For example, the composition of both free and bound phenolic compounds in moringa seeds and sprouts can be determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The dynamic changes in phenolic profile during germination may contribute to the enhanced antioxidant capacity of moringa sprouts, as discussed in Section 4.2 The precise metabolic pathways of glucomoringin in moringa sprouts remain poorly understood, and the bioavailability of moringin upon consumption has yet to be fully elucidated. Further research is needed to clarify the biosynthetic mechanism of glucomoringin, which could support strategies to enhance its accumulation in moringa sprouts by targeting key metabolic enzymes and regulatory genes involved in its biosynthesis. Integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches may be used to identify the intermediate compounds and candidate genes associated with glucomoringin biosynthetic pathways. For example, ultraperformance liquid chromatography quadrupole time‐of‐flight mass spectrometry (UPLC‐QTOF MS) provides a reliable platform for the identification of plant metabolites and can be used to characterize candidate intermediates involved in glucomoringin metabolism. Isotope‐labeling techniques may further validate the proposed glucomoringin biosynthetic pathways derived from untargeted metabolomic analysis. Key genes implicated in glucomoringin biosynthesis can be identified through de novo Both abiotic and biotic elicitors can induce physiological and biochemical changes in plants, potentially diversifying the phytochemical composition and enhancing the accumulation of bioactive compounds. Elicitors like amino acids, sugars, and slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) have been used for modulating GSL composition during edible seed germination (Baenas et al. 2014 2018 2014 Brassica oleraceae Brassica napus Brassica rapa Raphanus sativus 2014 2018 Moringa seeds and sprouts are rich in glucomoringin and moringin with various biological activities. Although the mechanisms of moringa seeds and their extracts as a protective agent against some chronic diseases have been well evidenced, these bioactivities are mostly demonstrated based on animal models. Clinical trials assessing the efficacy of moringa seeds, sprouts, and their derivative products (e.g., extracts and formulated supplements) in treating chronic diseases remain underexplored. Therefore, further human intervention studies are needed to gain a deeper understanding of their beneficial effects on human health, as well as to assess their cytotoxicity and safety after consumption. Despite the observed nutritional improvements after germination, moringa sprouts are likely to constitute only a small portion of the average consumers’ diet and may therefore have a limited impact on overall nutrient intake. To increase their health outcomes, future work could explore the potential of fortifying staple foods with moringa sprout extracts or concentrates to enhance bioavailability and nutritional contribution without the need for large‐quantity consumption. As discussed in Section 7 For example, the incorporation of moringa seeds and sprouts as a bioingredient into traditional staple foods like noodles offers a dual advantage of masking bitterness and improving the nutritional and functional quality of the final product. However, on the basis of the sensory evaluation results of fortified noodles (Liu et al. 2025 Another technique that can be adopted in future studies is fermentation, which is a promising biological treatment that may reduce the GSL content. Fungal strains such as Aspergillus A. oryzae A. niger 2024 A. oryzae A. niger Additionally, roasting is another viable method for decreasing bitterness of moringa seeds, while simultaneously generating favorable sensory attributes such as nutty and roasted flavors (Liu, Chin, Huang, et al. 2024 2024 2024 6. The application of moringa seeds and sprouts as bioingredients in functional food formulations is still in its early stage, and the development of novel food products is of great significance for achieving their functional benefits. However, current processing regulations and quality standards remain insufficient, highlighting the need for their establishment to support the growth of the emerging functional food market. To promote the development of moringa‐based functional foods, it is essential to scientifically evaluate the safety and nutritional value of moringa seeds and sprouts, as well as to identify key bioactive compounds, such as GSLs and phenolic compounds. Standardized processing procedures, such as germination, drying, and bioactive compound extraction, should be implemented, and reliable analytic techniques like HPLC are needed for the determination of bioactive compounds. To ensure novel food approval, proper labeling, and health claims, regulatory compliance must be achieved in accordance with local or international food safety authorities, for example, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) in Singapore. 9 Conclusion Moringa seeds are a rich source of essential nutrients and bioactive compounds, such as phenolic compounds, glucomoringin, and moringin. These phytochemicals are closely associated with promising therapeutic effects, including anticancer, antidiabetic, and hepatoprotective activities. Germination is an effective biotechnique that can further enhance the nutritional value of moringa seeds through improving protein digestibility and bioavailability and reducing the levels of antinutrients, such as phytates, tannins, saponins, oxalates, and trypsin inhibitors. Additionally, germination stimulates the biosynthesis of these health‐promoting compounds, thereby augmenting the functional value of moringa seeds. Given their high nutritional value and health benefits, moringa seeds and sprouts enriched with bioactive compounds hold great potential for direct use as functional foods or as novel bioingredients in the development of functional food formulations. However, several challenges still constrain the potential applications of moringa seeds, sprouts, and their extracts as functional foods and nutraceuticals. For example, although germination elevated the levels of phytochemicals, particularly GSLs, they may contribute to undesirable sensory attributes such as bitterness and astringency, potentially reducing consumer acceptance. Therefore, advanced processing techniques are required to mitigate or even eliminate these sensory drawbacks while preserving or enhancing nutritional quality. Fermentation, for example, is a promising biological treatment that may reduce the GSL content.
