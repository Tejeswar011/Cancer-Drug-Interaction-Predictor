This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness and value of implementation of surgery plus adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) compared with PET for older women with early breast cancer who are fit for surgery. Method A partitioned survival analysis model was developed using effectiveness data from the published literature (time horizon: lifetime). Health outcomes were measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; EQ-5D-3L UK tariff). Direct costs were estimated from the perspective of NHS England (discount rate: 3.5%). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and value of implementation analysis were conducted using a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000-£30,000 per QALY gained. Results Surgery + ET resulted in higher QALYs (4.57) compared to PET (3.87) and higher costs (£10,628 vs. £6,102). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £6,412.62 per QALY gained, indicating that surgery + ET is cost-effective compared to PET. The value of implementation analysis showed that imperfect implementation of surgery + ET resulted in a loss of 0.12 QALYs per patient, equating to 9,267 QALYs at the population level. Conclusion Surgery with adjuvant ET is a clinically effective and cost-effective strategy compared with PET for older women with ER + operable early-stage breast cancer. Strengthening adherence to national guidelines will improve population health outcomes and healthcare resource use. Future economic evaluations should focus on the value of management strategies for older patients unfit for surgery due to frailty or comorbidities.

All else being equal, health outcomes at a population level will be lower if fewer individuals receive a first-line surgical intervention with adjuvant ET that is more effective than PET. Moreover, the healthcare resources forgone to deliver PET could be diverted towards higher-value surgical interventions to improve the cost-effectiveness of care. Therefore, evidence is required to reinforce the current recommendations for managing early-stage breast cancer in older women and support healthcare decision-makers to improve the uptake of first-line surgery in this population where feasible. Value of implementation analysis is a method used in health economics research to quantify the population-level health outcomes forgone when the uptake of an effective and cost-effective intervention is less than perfect [ 16 16 Method Study design A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis and value of implementation analysis compared surgery + ET with PET for women aged 70 + with early-stage breast cancer in the UK who were suitable for surgery, without severe local spread or metastases, and with any ER status.

(Note) PET: Primary endocrine therapy Value of implementation analysis At the threshold of £20,000 and £30,000, the estimated net benefit per individual under the perfect implementation of surgery + ET was 4.04 QALYs or £80,877.96, and 4.22 QALYs or £126,630.72, respectively. The estimated net benefit per individual based on current levels of implementation was 3.93 QALYs or £78,576.48, and 4.09 QALYs or £122,635.40, respectively. Therefore, the EVPImp per individual was 0.12 QALYs or £2301.48, and 0.13 QALYs or £3,995.32, respectively. At the population level, at the threshold of £20,000 and £30,000, the EVPImp expressed in health outcomes was 9,267 and 10,725 QALYs, respectively, representing the current disease burden and benefits forgone due to the imperfect implementation of surgery + ET. The population-level EVPImp expressed in monetary units was £185,340,619.79 (£0.19 billion) and £321,747,086.46 (£0.32 billion), respectively. The results indicate that implementation strategies to improve the uptake of surgery + ET are likely to be cost-effective. Discussion This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness and value of implementation of surgery plus ET compared with PET for older women with early breast cancer who are fit for surgery. The findings confirm that surgical intervention with adjuvant ET is cost-effective compared with PET for this population. These findings align with current clinical guidelines while highlighting substantial health economic implications: the observed trend toward PET utilisation resulted in 9,267 QALYs forgone at current implementation levels at the threshold of £20,000. Rather than advocating for reduced PET use, we emphasise that within shared decision-making frameworks, clinicians should actively consider both the clinical and economic benefits of Surgery + ET when clinically appropriate. We therefore recommend integrating these economic insights into patient-clinician discussions to support value-informed choices, particularly for patients where surgical feasibility aligns with personal treatment goals. There is a growing need for evidence supporting ways to improve the cost-effectiveness of healthcare for older people diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. The most relevant previous study related to the present findings was by Holmes et al., who reported a model-based health economic evaluation of surgery with adjuvant ET compared with PET for older women [ 12 12 8 37 38 12 There are several reasons why older people with early-stage breast cancer may receive PET instead of surgery within routine clinical practice. Treatment decisions for breast cancer are made within a shared decision-making environment, which is shaped by the preferences of those receiving and providing care. However, the findings from this study show that widespread use of PET amongst individuals who are eligible for surgery corresponds with lower health outcomes at the individual and population levels. The results from this study may help support future shared decision-making consultations by providing evidence on quality-of-life outcomes and life expectancy. Meanwhile, multidisciplinary insights, including input from a UK breast surgeon and a clinician survey [ 39 PET may have a more promising role in managing older people with early-stage breast cancer who are not fit for surgery. For example, surgery is likely to pose higher risks for those individuals with significant comorbidities or high levels of frailty. Understanding the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PET within this subpopulation will be a valuable topic for future research to help support management decisions for these individuals who experience a high burden of disease relative to those eligible for surgery. While the EVPImp quantifies potential health gains, achieving perfect implementation would require investments in patient education, clinician training, and systemic support. These costs were not modeled here but could offset net benefits. When expressed in monetary units, the EVPImp represents the upper-bound on the cost of any implementation activities to be cost-effective for the healthcare system. Future research should evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alternative implementation strategies (e.g., decision aids, audit-feedback) within an expected value of specific implementation framework to prioritise implementation strategies based on their expected cost and likely benefit [ 16 The present study has several key strengths. First, the value of implementation analysis provides a unique contribution to the debate about using PET for older people with early-stage breast cancer. The findings will give healthcare decision-makers much-needed evidence about the potential consequences of using PET in routine practice. Second, using RCT data with a 20-year follow-up period meant that parameter uncertainty within lifetime survival extrapolations was reduced substantially. However, there are limitations to this study. First, the underlying RCT data did not report results by ER status. The underlying RCT was selected from a meta-analysis [ 11 40 12 5 41 42 43 Second, the estimated incident population for the value of implementation analysis assumed that all individuals who did not receive surgical intervention received PET instead. In practice, this may have overestimated the proportion receiving PET, and the value of implementation analysis results should be interpreted as an upper bound. Third, while RCT data reduce uncertainty in survival extrapolation, they may not fully reflect real-world effectiveness due to strict inclusion criteria and standardised protocols. For instance, older patients in routine practice often have higher comorbidity burdens than RCT participants, potentially overestimating the benefits of surgery + ET. Finally, the value of implementation analysis assumed all non-surgical patients received PET. In practice, some patients who are eligible for surgery may receive a different non-surgical intervention such as targeted therapy or radiotherapy. By assuming that the comparator arm reflected PET only rather than a weighted average of alternative treatments, the value of implementing surgery plus adjutant ET may be overestimated reinforcing that these findings should be interpreted as an upper-bound. Third, while QALYs are the preferred outcome measure for health economic analyses to support decision-making within the UK, they may not fully capture clinical outcomes such as disease-free survival or patient-reported quality of life measured by instruments like the EORTC QLQ-30. Policymakers in other healthcare jurisdictions and clinicians may find QALYs challenging to interpret compared to direct clinical endpoints. Future studies could strengthen the analysis by incorporating disease-free survival rates or validated patient-reported outcome measures to complement QALY estimates. Finally, the model’s three health states may not fully reflect the complexity and heterogeneity of individual clinical pathways, such as the specific quality-of-life impact of mastectomy in elderly women or the cumulative burden of sequential salvage therapies following multiple progressions, as these are aggregated within the broader progression-free and progressed states. Future research could undertake a value of implementation analysis comparing surgery with adjuvant ET and PET within different healthcare jurisdictions by using data on the uptake of these interventions for older people with early-stage breast cancer in different countries. Future observational data analysis will also be valuable in estimating the relative effectiveness of PET for people who cannot receive surgical interventions due to frailty or comorbidities [ 44 Conclusion Surgery with adjuvant ET is highly likely to be more effective and cost-effective than PET for older women with operable early-stage breast cancer. Healthcare decision-makers and care providers can achieve substantial population health benefits by reducing PET within this population. Nonetheless, PET may hold promise as a cost-effective alternative for frail older women with early-stage breast cancer, which should become the focus of future health economic research.
