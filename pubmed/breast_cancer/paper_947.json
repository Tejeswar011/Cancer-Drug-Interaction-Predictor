Introduction The town of Taranto, located in the Apulia region of southern Italy, serves as the primary harbor in Southern Italy and is one of the most industrialized cities in the country. This is largely due to the presence of a significant industrial area that includes a large refinery, a cement plant, and the ILVA steel plant, which is the largest steel production facility in Europe. The activities of the ILVA plant, which began in the early 1900s, have been identified as the primary source of extensive and long-lasting pollution in the Taranto area. This pollution is characterized by the release of heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and dioxins into the environment. Due to the presence of the former ILVA plant, as well as other emission sources—including both regulated and illegal waste disposal sites—Taranto has been classified as a high environmental risk area in Italy. Along with the neighboring municipality of Statte, it has been included in the list of Italian Polluted Sites (IPS) of national interest. Epidemiological surveillance in this IPS has been periodically conducted under the SENTIERI Project [ 1 2 3 4 The most recent update from the SENTIERI Project [ 4 Dioxins, which include polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), are organic pollutants of significant toxicological concern, primarily associated with industrial and metallurgical activities. The most important effects determined on human beings include skin problems like chloracne, liver damage, and potential impacts on the immune, reproductive, and endocrine systems [ 5 6 7 However, similar to trends observed in other countries, exposure to PCDDs, PCDFs, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Italy has been declining, with chemical-specific rates of decrease [ 8 9 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Donor Selection and Recruitment The Department of Prevention of the ASL of Taranto was responsible for donor recruitment and sample collection. Participants were selected based on their residential area: women residing in Taranto and Statte (referred to as the “exposed” group) and women residing in municipalities located more than 30 km from Taranto, considered to have background exposure levels (referred to as the “non-exposed” group). Inclusion criteria for donating mothers, all from the general population, were as follows: age between 20 and 40 years, local residency for at least 10 years, physiological childbirth, exclusive breastfeeding of one child, and primiparity. Between March 2017 and March 2018, 150 breast milk samples were collected, comprising 76 from the exposed group and 74 from the non-exposed group. During recruitment, particular attention was given to balancing the donors by age group, a critical parameter given the known influence of age on the body burden of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as those analyzed in this study. Each participant, assisted by an ASL operator, completed a questionnaire regarding lifestyle and dietary habits to support the interpretation of analytical data. Personal data were collected and stored in compliance with privacy protection legislation. The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee of Brindisi (ASL BR (Independent Committee of Medical Ethics of Brindisi)). 2.2. Sample Collection All participants received detailed instructions on the proper collection and storage of breast milk samples, which were to be collected between the fourth and eighth week postpartum, according to standardized milk sampling and analytical protocols provided by the WHO in collaboration with the UNEP [ 10 2.3. Participating Institutions The study was conducted by the Italian National Institute of Health (ISS), specifically the “Human Exposure to Environmental Contaminants” unit, in collaboration with the Department of Prevention of the ASL of Taranto. The ISS designed the study, developed written protocols for local medical professionals (including doctors, pediatricians, gynecologists, and midwives), prepared donor materials, performed contaminant analysis, and conducted exposure assessments. The Department of Prevention of the ASL of Taranto was responsible for donor recruitment, sample collection, and the selection of local healthcare facilities involved in the study. They also distributed informational materials, administered questionnaires and informed consent forms, collected and stored samples until shipment to the ISS, and collaborated with the ISS in communicating the results. 2.4. Chemical Analysis Milk samples were stored under refrigeration until analysis. After thawing and homogenization, each sample (20 g) was spiked with internal standards containing PCDD, PCDF, and PCB congeners to be quantified, (obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, USA, and from Wellington Laboratories, Guelph, Canada). After, milk was subjected to liquid–liquid extraction using a mixture of ethyl ether, n-hexane, and methanol (20 mL each). The organic extract was purified by elution through a sodium sulfate column. The eluate was further treated and purified using the multicolumn DEXTech system (LCTech, DE). The fat content was determined gravimetrically from a fraction of the eluate. Quantification of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) was performed in accordance with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) methods 1613b [ 11 12 2.5. Quality Assurance (QA)/Quality Control (QC) Analytical reliability was ensured through the analysis of procedural blank samples and blind replicates. The acceptability limits for the blanks were adapted from Section 9.5.2 of EPA 1668C [ 12 13 13 The analytical method was validated through participation in various national and international quality control studies and proficiency tests. The laboratory is accredited according to ISO/IEC 17025 standards [ 14 2.6. Statistical Analysis A targeted questionnaire was administered to participants to identify potential factors influencing the body burden of pollutants. The questionnaire collected data on personal, environmental, and dietary variables, which were initially checked for missing values, and their relative frequencies were estimated. Given the large number of variables, a statistical screening approach was employed to identify variables showing a significant difference ( p p p p 15 16 3. Results 3.1. Participant Characteristics The inclusion criteria for participants were met in both groups. The characteristics of the donors are summarized in Table 1 Table S1 3.2. Levels of Selected Contaminants in Human Milk Milk concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs detected in the exposed and not exposed group were comparable to data from studies conducted in Italy in the same period on milk samples from groups of donors residing in industrial areas and in areas at background exposure, respectively [ 17 18 Table 2 Table 3 Table 4 These tables display the adjusted means and 95% confidence intervals for the categories of predictors of interest, calculated from the predictions of the relevant models at fixed values of the covariates. The corresponding regression models are detailed in Table S2 p Table 2 Table 3 Table 4 Table 5 4. Discussion In Table 2 p 7 10 Table 2 10 19 Table 3 Table 4 6 7 10 TEQ 20 The congeners that best characterize the exposed group, based on those showing the highest differences (6th column of Table 5 4 6 6 6 7 5 21 Table 3 p 4 5 6 6 5 6 7 6 8 6 7 Table 2 Table 5 TEQ 7 10 Table 5 These findings align with the results presented in Table 2 4 Table 2 Table 3 Table 5 6 22 23 4 5 5 24 7 p 6 7 21 5. Conclusions Contaminant concentrations in the exposed and not exposed group from this study were almost comparable with data from studies on human milk conducted in Italy in the same period on population groups residing in industrial areas and in areas at background exposure [ 17 18 10 4 6 6 6 7 4 6 6 Table S2 25 26 Acknowledgments The study was carried out in collaboration with the Department of Prevention, Public health, and Hygiene, Azienda Sanitaria Locale (ASL) of Taranto, with funding from ILVA S.p.a, within the framework of the Collaboration Agreement between Istituto Superiore di Sanità e ILVA S.p.a. “Studio di monitoraggio di policlorodibenzodiossine (PCDD), policlorodibenzofurani (PCDF), e policlorobifenili (PCB) nel latte materno di donne residenti a Taranto e provincia” (13 July 2015–13 July 2018).
