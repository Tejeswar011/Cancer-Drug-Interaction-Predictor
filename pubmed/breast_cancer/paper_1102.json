Introduction Acute and late skin and mucosal toxicities, along with associated mucositis, are among the most significant side effects of radiotherapy or chemotherapy for head and neck and genitourinary cancers [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Due to its increasing use in oncology care and a better understanding of the biologic mechanisms and clinical outcomes, it is important to document the safety of PBM use in oncology settings [ 7 8 9 10 11 Direct investigation of the radio-modulatory effects of PBM on tumor response is limited. It is now proven that the effect of the combination of low-intensity laser light and ionizing radiation on tumor cells can vary widely and lead to diverse effects depending on the fluence, wavelength, and sequence of exposure (PBM and IR). Most data indicate that PBM exposure prior to IR does not have a protective effect in relation to tumor cells, and instead may reduce the number of viable tumor cells both at high [ 12 13 14 15 16 17 2 15 2 2 2 18 The state of the mitochondrial membrane, cell cycle, and cell death pathways is known to be among the main targets of PBM. These issues are discussed in the most detail in [ 13 2 2 2 2 19 20 21 The potential for PBM to negatively influence tumor growth and/or reaction to cytotoxic treatment has had a limited evaluation to date and is currently unresolved. Conflicting data refute or support the potential for PBM to impact tumor activity and responsiveness to treatment. Our study aimed to highlight the effects of PBM with a wavelength of 640 nm and ‘low’ fluence (less than 1 J/cm 2 2. Results 2.1. Viability of HeLa Kyoto Tumor Cells After IR To assess the effects of ionizing radiation on cell viability, two independent methods were employed: the MTT assay and colony formation analysis. Irradiation of HeLa Kyoto tumor cells showed a standard survival curve for the IR doses (2 Gy, 4 Gy, 6 Gy) at 24 h post-exposure ( Figure 1 The characteristic shoulder on the survival curve at a dose of 2 Gy is clearly visible in Figure 1 2.2. Influence of Photobiomodulation on the Cell Cycle of HeLa Kyoto Cells Analysis of the distribution of HeLa Kyoto culture cells across phases of the cell cycle when exposed only to low-intensity light without IR showed that PBM itself does not cause its changes. Figure 2 0 1 2 Supplementary Figure S1 IR at a dose of 2 Gy did not cause any changes in the number of cells in G 0 1 2 Figure 3 0 1 2 Figure 3 The combined effect of PBM with F = 0.3 J/cm 2 Figure 3 0 1 2 Figure 3 Irradiation at a dose of 6 Gy in combination with PBM (IR→PBM) led to a substantial decrease in the proportion of cells from 61.3 ± 5% to 53.9 ± 6.2% for G 0 1 2 Figure 3 2 0 1 Figure 3 Thus, PBM after gamma irradiation contributed to partial relief of radiation mitotic arrest; PBM before irradiation, on the contrary, contributed to the delay in cell division in the G 2 2.3. The Study of the Impact of PBM in Combination with IR on the Process of Cell Death of HeLa Cells Figure 4 First, the influence of ionizing radiation without PBM on the process of cell death of HeLa tumor cells was investigated. In the intact sample, the percentage of late apoptotic/necrotic cells and cells entering the apoptotic pathway was 3.4 ± 0.9% and 3.2 ± 0.6%, respectively. Exposure to gamma radiation at a dose of 2 Gy resulted in a decrease in the number of living cells in the irradiated sample to 88.4 ± 3%, with the percentage of late apoptotic/necrotic cells and cells entering the apoptotic pathway increasing to 5.9 ± 0.7% and 5.7 ± 2.4%, respectively, compared to the intact sample ( Figure 5 Figure 5 Figure 5 The combined effects of IR at a dose of 2 Gy and PBM did not lead to significant changes in the distribution of HeLa cells into early apoptotic, living, and late apoptotic/necrotic cells compared to cells exposed to IR alone (2 Gy), regardless of the sequence of the two interventions ( Figure 5 2 Figure 5 2 Figure 5 2 Figure 5 2 Figure 5 2 Figure 5 2.4. The Study of the Impact of PBM in Combination with IR on the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential of HeLa Kyoto Cells Figure 6 IR leads to an accumulation of cells in the lower left part of the image compared to the intact sample, corresponding to cells with depolarized mitochondrial membrane. After 6 Gy + 0.3 J/cm 2 The energy exchange in the cell and its physiological state directly depend on the condition of the mitochondria, which is determined by the integrity of their inner membrane and the transmembrane potential formed on it [ 22 Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 Figure 7 PBM in combination with irradiation at a dose of 2 Gy did not lead to significant changes in the mitochondrial potential of HeLa cells compared to cells exposed to IR alone (2 Gy), regardless of the sequence of the two exposures ( Figure 7 2 Figure 7 2 Figure 7 2 Figure 7 2 Figure 7 2 Figure 7 3. Discussion The aim of our study was to investigate the mechanisms of cellular response in tumor HeLa cells to low-intensity light (F < 1 J/cm 2 A typical cellular response to ionizing radiation involves cell cycle arrest—particularly a radiation-induced mitotic arrest—which provides time for error correction and DNA damage repair [ 23 0 1 2 22 2 0 1 The combination of 6 Gy + 0.3 J/cm 2 0 1 2 Figure 3 0 1 Figure 3 0 1 15 16 1 2 2 24 The combination “0.3 J/cm 2 2 0 1 Figure 3 15 25 2 One of the important cellular targets for IR is the electron transport chain of mitochondria [ 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Our research revealed a significant decrease in the number of cells with depolarized mitochondrial membrane and an increase in the number of cells with undamaged MM when using PBM after 4 Gy and 6 Gy exposure, compared to cells after gamma irradiation alone. These results are in line with previous findings showing an increase in the number of viable cells in the MTT assay when exposed to IR→PBM [ 15 34 At the same time, we did not reveal changes in the number of cells with depolarized mitochondrial membrane in the samples exposed to low-intensity red light before IR. These results correspond to our previous data on the absence of a protective effect of PBM on tumor cells, and to research data that showed a decrease in the mitochondrial activity of tumor cells upon exposure to PBM with λ = 780 nm and λ = 660 nm at an energy density of F = 1–6 J/cm 2 35 There is evidence that PBM with fluences of 0.3 J/cm 2 2 36 2 37 2 2 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Cell Line We used the conditionally “immortal” human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa Kyoto (Shemyakin-Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, RAS (IBCh RAS), Moscow, Russia) as the subject of research. The cells were cultured under aseptic conditions in a 25 cm 2 2 2 4.2. Assessment of Cell Radiosensitivity The radiosensitivity of the HeLa Kyoto cell line to ionizing radiation was evaluated after irradiation at doses of 0, 2, 4, and 6 Gy. Quantitative analysis was performed using the MTT assay in three biological replicates, after which the obtained data were confirmed by the colony formation assay method in one replicate, which demonstrated results consistent with the MTT assay data. MTT assay. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates (2000 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 To confirm the MTT assay results, a colony formation assay was additionally performed. Cells were seeded into 6-well culture plates at a density of 200 cells/well and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO 2 4.3. Photobiomodulation The fluence of 0.3 J/cm 2 The cell culture flask was illuminated with low-intensity red light at a wavelength of λ = 640 ± 11 nm for 75 s. The light source used for PBM was the ‘CDM-08’ (Photon Technologies Institute, Moscow, Russia), which is based on an LED matrix with light passing through a lens of 4 cm diameter. The beam divergence angle was 60 degrees. The light intensity at the working surface was monitored using a FieldMaster power meter with an LM-10HTD sensor head (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). To analyze the spectral composition, a USB4000 spectrometer (Ocean Optics, Largo, FL, USA) with a resolution of 1.5 nm was employed. The distance from the lens to the surface of the flask, positioned under the emitter, was 46 cm, ensuring uniform illumination with an intensity of 4 ± 0.5 mW/cm 2 Table 1 4.4. Ionizing Radiation Cells were irradiated using a Novalis Tx linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA, beam energy 6 MV, dose rate 6 Gy/min). Radiation exposure was performed once at clinically relevant doses (2 Gy, 4 Gy, and 6 Gy). To achieve a uniform dose distribution inside the culture flask due to the peculiarities of the depth distribution of the high-energy photon beam, cells were irradiated from below, with the beam passing through 5 cm plates made of water-equivalent polystyrene “RW3”. Calculations of irradiation parameters and dose distribution were performed in the Eclipse dosimetric planning system using the AcurosXB 16.1 calculation algorithm based on CT images of the culture flask. 4.5. Experimental Design First, we examined the effect of PBM on tumor cells pre-exposed to IR (IR→PBM) ( Supplementary Figure S2A 2 Table 1 The effect of PBM on tumor cells pre-exposed to low-intensity light and then exposed to IR (PBM→IR) ( Supplementary Figure S2B 4.6. Cell Cycle Definition Cell cycle phase distribution (G 0 1 0 1 2 Cell preparation, BrdU cell labeling, subsequent staining, flow cytometric analysis, and interpretation of the results were conducted according to the BD Pharmingen™ BrdU Flow Kits Instruction Manual. 4.7. Transmembrane Mitochondrial Potential Study The percentages of live cells, dead cells, and cells with depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential were determined in five independent biological experiments with two technical replicates each. Calculations were performed relative to the total number of cells within the defined analysis gate. The processing for determining the mitochondrial potential was carried out according to the manufacturer’s protocol (BD Pharmingen™, San Diego, CA, USA). Staining of cells with TMRE (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) was carried out simultaneously with staining with the fluorescent dye 7-AAD (7-aminoactinomycin D, cat № 559763, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA), which allows assessment of the integrity of the cell’s plasma membrane. 7-AAD penetrates cells through damaged membrane and binds to fragmented/degraded DNA at sites between guanine and cytosine, which is a marker of late-stage apoptosis or necrosis [ 38 4.8. Assessment of Cell Death Pathways The percentage distribution of late apoptotic/necrotic, early apoptotic, and living cells was evaluated in three independent biological experiments with two technical replicates each. Percentages were determined relative to the total number of cells. Cell death assessment in cell culture was performed using the Annexin V-Phycoerythrin (PE) Apoptosis Detection Kit (cat. no. 559763, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). The use of two dyes, Annexin V and 7-AAD, allowed for the discrimination of three distinct cell populations: (1) live cells (Annexin V − − + − + + 39 Sample preparation, cell staining with annexin-V PE and 7-AAD, cytometric analysis, and interpretation of the results were conducted in accordance with the Technical Data Sheet of the PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit. 4.9. Statistics Cell cycle analysis, mitochondrial transmembrane potential changes, and cell death assessment following PBM→IR and IR→PBM exposures were performed in at least three independent biological replicates with two technical replicates each. Experimental data were statistically analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 software (GraphPad Prism Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The Kruskal–Wallis test was applied to evaluate the statistical significance of differences in mean values compared to control samples, with a significance threshold of p 5. Conclusions Photobiomodulation demonstrates multidirectional effects on tumor cells exposed to ionizing radiation, depending on the sequence of the two exposures. The “IR→PBM” protocol results in a decrease in cells with depolarized mitochondrial membrane and a partial removal of radiation-induced mitotic arrest of HeLa Kyoto cells. These changes correlate with an increase in the number of viable tumor cells after exposure to a PBM fluence of 300 mJ/cm 2 2 Acknowledgments We express our great gratitude to Nikita Vladimirovich Minaev, head of the laboratory of the National Research Center “Kurchatov Institute,” for his help in creating the SDM-08 device.
