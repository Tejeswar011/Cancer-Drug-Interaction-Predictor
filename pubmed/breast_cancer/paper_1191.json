Introduction Due to the ageing population, early detection, and effective treatment option, the number of colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors is expected to increase [ 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 Emerging cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy, increase survival rates but also raise the risk of age-related diseases [ 9 11 12 13 14 13 15 Telomere length is a well-known marker of cellular senescence and biological ageing [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 Ageing coincides with decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) levels, a coenzyme crucial for energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cell signaling [ 25 26 27 27 29 We hypothesize that accelerated ageing may contribute to the development and progression of PN. This study examines longitudinal associations of ageing markers— LTL, NAD⁺ (accelerated ageing), and PCC (oxidative stress)—with PN in CRC survivors up to 2 years post-treatment. We also explored modifications by chemotherapy [ 11 26 30 31 32 33 2. Materials and methods 2.1 Study design and participants This study used data from PROCORE, a prospective cohort evaluating the impact of cancer and its treatment on patient-reported outcomes [ 5 5 2.2 Data collection and blood processing Data were collected using the PROFILES (Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial Treatment and Long Term Evaluation of Survivorship) registry, which is linked to the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) [ 34 2.3 Sociodemographic, lifestyle and clinical factors Sociodemographic characteristics (age and sex), and clinical information (cancer stage, primary treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery), and tumor type) were retrieved from the NCR. BMI (kg/m 2 35 2.4 Peripheral neuropathy PN was assessed with the “European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-CIPN twenty-item scale (EORTC QLQ-CIPN20)”, which has three subscales: sensory (SPN, nine items), motor (MPN, seven items), and autonomic neuropathy (APN, two items) [ 36 36 2.5 Measurement of plasma NAD levels and protein carbonyl content (PCC) levels Thawed plasma samples were centrifuged to use only soluble parts for biomarker measurements. Given the multicenter design and logistical constraints, we measured NAD in plasma rather than in cellular fractions. Plasma total NAD levels (NAD + 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 + + 2.6 Measurement of leukocyte telomere length (LTL) LTL as a marker of biological age, was measured by isolating DNA from whole blood using a QIAamp® DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen), with quality checked by NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Isogen Life Science, Belgium). DNA was stored at −20°C until LTL was measured by monochrome multiplex quantitative PCR (qPCR) [ 44 45 DNA of two reference samples with known LTL length (HeLa S3: 5.5 kB, HeLa 229: 14.5 kB) were provided by Prof. Alexander Bürkle, University of Konstanz, Germany. Average PCR efficiencies were 96% for telomere and 94% for β-globulin primers. Telomere length in kB was estimated via regression using HeLa cell lines as references. The Hela S3 (DNA was included in 5 dilutions, 4.0–0.25ng/μL) was used as reference to calculate T/S values and by definition has a T/S value of 1.0, and the average T/S value of the Hela 229 was 3.4 (range 2.6–4.4). Out of 974 samples, 103 (10.5%) were rerun; for 84 (8.6%) CV > 10%, additional replicates resulted in average LTL = 6 [5–9] and for 9 (0.9%) no LTL could be determined. The average LTL was 6.5 ± 0.4(SD) kB. Intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.807(95%CI: 0.783–0.828) for T/S values and 0.823(95%CI: 0.803–0.845) for LTL, indicating good reliability [ 46 47 2.7 Statistical analysis Descriptive analyses compared sociodemographic and clinical characteristics at diagnosis using t-tests/Mann-Whitney for continuous and chi-square for categorical variables. Biomarkers at each time point were described with frequencies, means±SD, or medians (IQR) as appropriate. Pearson’s correlation assessed age with accelerated ageing markers LTL and NAD ⁺ . Longitudinal associations between PN scores (total, SPN, MPN, APN scores) and biomarkers (LTL, NAD ⁺, PCC) from diagnosis to 2-year follow-up were evaluated using linear mixed models. Model assumptions (normality of residuals, linearity, and homoscedasticity) were checked and met for all analyses. Follow-up time was treated as a variable (diagnosis, 1-year and 2-year follow-up). LTL data were handled two ways: log-transforming LTL in kB since we introduced two reference samples with known telomere length, and z-score transforming T/S values [ 48 + 49 50 51 52 Interaction effects of LTL and NAD⁺ with age, tumor type, vigorous physical activity (MVPA), and chemotherapy were also tested [ 11 26 30 33 53 3.

All eligible participants were measured repeatedly at diagnosis, 1-year and 2-year follow ups. Since this current study mainly focused on the biomarkers after colorectal cancer treatment, only available plasma and/or whole blood samples and post-treatment data on the EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 questionnaire, relevant co-variates and self-reported physical activity were included in this study. A detailed description of the PROCORE study design has been published previously [ 5 Compared to patients not receiving chemotherapy (n = 312, 68.3%), those receiving chemotherapy were younger, had higher CRC stage, fewer comorbidities (<2), more frequently received radiotherapy, and underwent surgery less often. There were no significant differences in PN-related comorbidities, including joint inflammation and diabetes. 3.2 PN scores and biomarkers concentrations among the course of follow-ups 3.2.1 PN. Median PN scores increased at 1-year and 2-year follow-up compared to diagnosis ( Fig 2 10.1371/journal.pone.0332579.g002 Fig 2 Median scores of EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 questionnaires (total score, sensory, motor and autonomic subscale scores) of participants who were and were not treated with chemotherapy at diagnosis, and after 1-year and 2-year follow up.

Discussion In this longitudinal study among CRC patients, we tracked changes in LTL, NAD⁺ levels, and PCC over 2 years post-diagnosis and related them to PN. Longer LTL was linked to higher PN total scores, SPN, and MPN, while lower NAD⁺ levels correlated with increased SPN complaints. These NAD⁺ –SPN associations were mainly due to inter-individual changes; lower NAD + Over 2 years, PN symptoms persisted and did not return to baseline, aligning with previous findings that PN can persist over time [ 54 2 51 Our findings indicate that NAD⁺ levels are related to PN among CRC patients treated with chemotherapy. Consistently, animal studies show NAD⁺ metabolism modulates axonal degeneration—a feature of PN [ 55 26 56 57 59 55 56 60 61 62 63 64 Although there is evidence for a contribution of oxidative stress to the development of PN [ 65 39 66 67 LTL is recognized as an ageing biomarker [ 68 17 69 70 71 72 73 26 74 77 Study limitations include declining response rates across follow-up waves, which may have introduced attrition bias—particularly if participants with more advanced disease or comorbidities were more likely to drop out due to illness or death—potentially leading to an underestimation of the observed associations between biological aging markers, oxidative stress, and peripheral neuropathy. Due to the multicenter study design, an inclusion period of a little more than three years, and a follow-up of two years, some blood and plasma samples were stored for a period of a little more than six years before analyses were done. Since the stability of PCCs and NAD + To our knowledge, this is the first study examining PN’s longitudinal association with markers of biological ageing (LTL, NAD⁺ status) and oxidative stress (PCC) in CRC patients up to 2 years post-diagnosis. We found that longer LTL was linked to more PN, and among chemotherapy patients, lower NAD⁺ was associated with increased PN. As these results suggest NAD⁺ status is relevant to PN symptoms, future intervention studies should explore maintaining NAD⁺ levels to prevent or alleviate PN, promoting healthy ageing and improved quality of life post-diagnosis and treatment.

Scientific Remarks & Literature Alignment Strengths: First longitudinal study to explore ageing biomarkers and PN in CRC survivors. Thoughtful stratification by chemotherapy status and inclusion of intra/inter-individual modeling. Weaknesses/Points for Clarification: - Biological paradox: The finding that longer telomeres correlate with higher PN is unexplained. While speculative explanations (e.g., inflammation-mediated leukocyte shifts) are offered, no supporting data are shown. Consider adding CRP/IL-6 as inflammation markers if available. PCC (oxidative stress): Not associated with PN, despite a strong literature link (e.g., Areti et al. 2014, Redox Biology). Was this due to measurement variability? Report CV% and inter-assay consistency more explicitly. - NAD+ as a therapeutic target: This is compelling, but would benefit from referencing emerging human studies or clinical trials (e.g., NR supplementation in aging/neurodegeneration). Currently, discussion leans heavily on animal data. - Confounding by cancer stage or surgery type is not discussed. Could residual confounding explain some of the associations? - Missing Variables: No mention of neuropathy-related medication (e.g., duloxetine, gabapentin) use, which could bias PN reporting. 2. Language, Grammar, and Style Issues Below is a list of the most critical issues (by line number or paragraph reference): Line 1 (Title): Suggest revising to “Association of Ageing-Related Biomarkers with Peripheral Neuropathy in Colorectal Cancer Patients Over a Two-Year Period” for clarity and smoother flow. Line 50: \"autonomically (APN)\" → awkward phrasing. Consider \"autonomic (APN), manifesting as...\". Line 57: “increase survival” → should be “increase survival rates”. Line 89: “all participants provided written informed consent.” → better phrased as: “Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.” Line 144–145: “PN (total, SPN, MPN, APN scores)” → Redundant use of \"PN\". Suggest: “Peripheral neuropathy scores (total, SPN, MPN, and APN)”. Line 163–164: Sentence structure is choppy. Consider: “Among 713 invited patients, 457 (64%) participated at diagnosis, with 321 (45%) and 264 (37%) completing follow-up at 1 and 2 years, respectively.” Line 248: “Surprisingly, longer LTL was associated with more PN symptoms, a finding hard to explain biologically.” → Reword to avoid informal tone: “Notably, longer LTL was associated with increased PN symptoms—a counterintuitive finding lacking a clear biological explanation.” Line 262: “markers of biological ageing (LTL, NAD⁺ status), and oxidative stress (PCC)” → Comma after “ageing” is unnecessary. This list is not exhaustive. The manuscript would benefit from thorough copyediting for consistency in punctuation, hyphenation (e.g., “post-treatment” vs. “posttreatment”), and smoother flow in many paragraphs. 3. Statistical and Graphical Review Statistics: Appropriateness: The use of linear mixed models (LMMs) is appropriate for longitudinal data. Confounder adjustment is also justified. Concerns: Line 185–194 (and Table 2): It’s unclear whether model assumptions (normality, linearity, homoscedasticity) were tested. Please specify model diagnostics. LTL modeling (log-transformed vs. z-scored) is well justified, but effect sizes (e.g., 35-point change in PN score for a 10% LTL increase) seem clinically implausible. Reassess the scaling of predictors. Effect modifier analysis (Line 210+): No correction for multiple testing is mentioned. With multiple interaction terms, control for type I error (e.g., using Bonferroni or FDR) is recommended. Figures: Figure 2 (PN scores): Clarity issue—chemotherapy vs. non-chemotherapy group lines overlap and aren’t well-distinguished. Use different line types or colors. Figure 3 (Biomarkers): Axis scaling should be standardized across time points for better comparison. Outliers dominate visualization; consider trimmed mean lines or boxplots with whiskers to mitigate this. 4. Overall Recommendation: Major Revisions The manuscript addresses a novel and clinically relevant question. The study design is robust, and the statistical approach is broadly appropriate. However, before publication, the following are essential: - Substantive grammar/spelling corrections. - Justification of effect sizes and confirmation of model assumptions. - Clarification and enhanced visualization of figures. - Deeper biological contextualization of surprising findings (e.g., longer telomeres → worse PN). - Discussion of potential confounders (e.g., medications, vitamin deficiencies). Reviewer #2: This study provides valuable longitudinal insights into the associations between ageing-related biomarkers (LTL, NAD+, and PCC) and peripheral neuropathy (PN) in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The prospective design, large sample size, and repeated measurements strengthen the findings. The exploration of chemotherapy’s modifying effect on NAD+ and PN is particularly noteworthy, offering potential clinical implications for mitigating PN in CRC survivors. The methodological rigor, including confounder adjustment and sensitivity analyses, enhances the reliability of the results. However, to further strengthen the manuscript, the following revisions are suggested: 1. The association between longer LTL and higher PN scores contradicts existing literature. The authors should discuss potential explanations (e.g., leukocyte turnover, inflammation) and acknowledge limitations of LTL as a proxy for neuronal ageing. 2. Provide details on the enzymatic cycling assay (e.g., sensitivity, specificity) and justify why plasma NAD+ was chosen over cellular NAD+ levels, which may better reflect tissue-specific metabolism. 3. The manuscript mentions outliers but lacks a clear rationale for their exclusion (>±3SD). Include a sensitivity analysis showing results with and without outliers to assess robustness. 4. The EORTC QLQ-CIPN20 is self-reported. Discuss potential biases (e.g., recall, subjectivity) and consider referencing objective PN measures (e.g., nerve conduction studies) for future work. 5. The observational design precludes causal inferences. Explicitly state this and suggest mechanistic studies (e.g., NAD+ supplementation trials) to explore causality. 6. The type/duration of chemotherapy regimens are not detailed. Stratify analyses by specific chemotherapeutics (e.g., oxaliplatin) known to induce PN. 7. Address how declining response rates (64% to 37%) may bias results. Perform attrition analysis comparing baseline characteristics of completers vs. dropouts. 8. The null findings for PCC are underdiscussed. Explore methodological reasons (e.g., assay limitations) or biological explanations (e.g., compensatory mechanisms). 9. Include hemoglobin levels in all models (not just NAD+), as anemia could influence both oxidative stress and PN. 10. The chemotherapy subgroup (n=145) may lack power. Report interaction p-values and confidence intervals to assess reliability. 11. The ICC for LTL (0.807–0.823) suggests moderate reliability. Discuss implications for misclassification bias. 12. Elaborate on how the NAD+-PN association could translate to interventions (e.g., NAD+ boosters). Cite ongoing clinical trials if available. Reviewer #3: I reviewed this interesting paper examining biomarkers that are usually associated with ageing and their association with Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral neuropathy. The research was conducted in a scientifically sound methodology and there was adequate ethical oversight, which was reported in the manuscript. The manuscript was easy to read and understand. It described the methodology in a character that was clear and repeatable. The results were presented in full and the write up adequately referenced the results. Of note, the unusual finding of longer Leucocyte Telomere Length (LTL) association with increased CIPN was reported and discussed. The conclusions were scientific and did not overstate the findings. Suggestions for future work to expand on the findings were made. I find this study to be neatly described and reported, and I feel it makes an interesting addition to the literature around this important chemotherapy side effect.

There is no requirement to cite these works unless the editor has indicated otherwise. Additional Editor Comments: Thanks for submitting your revised paper to PLOS ONE. The previous reviewers are not available this time. Thus, I have carefully assessed your revision work. Based on the manuscript revisions, here are critical questions for the authors to address: 1. NAD⁺ Measurement Validity in Plasma: The manuscript states plasma NAD⁺ was measured due to \"multicenter design and logistical constraints,\" citing Lautrup et al. (2024) to justify its relevance to systemic NAD⁺ status. However, Lautrup’s review primarily discusses intracellular NAD⁺ roles. Please provide additional evidence that plasma NAD⁺ levels reliably reflect tissue-level NAD⁺ bioavailability in neurons, especially given that intracellular NAD⁺ is more directly linked to neuroprotection. Did you validate this against cellular NAD⁺ in a subset of samples? 2. Inconsistency in LTL-PN Association: Longer LTL was unexpectedly associated with worse PN (Table 2). The discussion proposes chemotherapy may select for hematopoietic stem cells with longer telomeres (Benitez-Buelga et al. 2015), but this does not explain why longer LTL correlates with neuropathy severity. Could residual confounding (e.g., unaccounted inflammatory markers or cell-type composition shifts) drive this association? Provide sensitivity analyses adjusting for NLR (neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio) or other immune indices. 3. Data Availability Limitations: Data are accessible via PROFILES registry \"upon written request and possible purchase.\" PLOS ONE mandates unrestricted public access. Clarify how this complies with PLOS’s data policy. Will data be deposited in a public repository (e.g., Dryad) with anonymized identifiers to ensure accessibility without barriers? 4. Chemotherapy Subgroup Heterogeneity: Table 3 shows strong NAD⁺-PN associations in chemotherapy-treated patients but a positive trend (β=3.75, p=NS) in non-chemotherapy patients. Is this divergence biologically plausible? Could unmeasured factors (e.g., specific neurotoxic agents like oxaliplatin) explain this? Provide subgroup analysis by chemotherapy regimen if feasible. 5. Protein Carbonyl (PCC) Stability Concerns: PCC showed no association with PN. The authors note samples were stored >6 years, and stability beyond 1 month at −70°C is unverified (Firuzi et al. 2006). Provide evidence that PCC remained stable under your storage conditions (e.g., correlation between baseline/follow-up levels in controls or spike-in experiments). 6. Attrition Bias in Longitudinal Data: Only 37% completed the 2-year follow-up (page 18), with responders likely healthier than non-responders. How was attrition addressed in mixed models? Provide a comparison of baseline characteristics between completers vs. dropouts to quantify potential bias. 7. Ethical Oversight Clarification: The ethics statement lists approval number \"NLS1119.060.14\" (page 4), but the Methods section (page 44) cites \"NL51119.060.14.\" Please confirm the correct approval number and ensure consistency throughout the manuscript. 8.
