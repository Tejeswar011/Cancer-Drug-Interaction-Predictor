Comparison of concentration levels of seven autoantibodies in different groups The concentrations of CAGE, GBU4-5, MAGEA1, P53, PGP9.5 and SOX2 were significantly higher than those of lung benign disease group, other malignant solid tumor group, autoimmune disease group and healthy body group, while the concentration of GAGE7 in lung cancer group was significantly higher than that of healthy body group. However, there was no significant difference between the levels and those of lung benign disease group, other malignant solid tumor group and autoimmune disease group. Efficacy of seven autoantibodies alone & in combination in the diagnosis of NSCLC The combined assay of seven autoantibodies had an AUC of 0.791, with an overall sensitivity of 60.1% and a specificity of 83.0%. It is suggested that seven lung cancer-related autoantibodies have good efficacy in the auxiliary diagnosis of NSCLC. Comparison of sensitivity between seven autoantibodies & three traditional tumor markers in the diagnosis of NSCLC The combined detection of seven autoantibodies showed consistent sensitivity in the diagnosis of different stages and pathological types of NSCLC, and the sensitivity in the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma was significantly superior to CEA, NSE and CYFRA21-1. Conclusion The combined detection of seven autoantibodies has certain clinical application value.
