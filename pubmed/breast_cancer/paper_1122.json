PSA screening for PCa diagnosis is not disease-specific; the discovery of novel and efficient biomarkers is therefore recommended. The concentration and integrity of circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) in the blood of PCa patients could represent innovative and more specific tools for the clinical management of PCa.

Introduction Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common and deadly cancers in men worldwide [ 1 2 3 4 The development of novel and more specific molecular biomarkers will be key to the early identification of PCa patients, and the monitoring of response, treatment resistance and relapse. In this context, minimally invasive blood-based “liquid” biopsies are attractive as a practical substitute for solid tissue, as they provide information on the diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic response of the tumour. Components of liquid biopsies, such as circulating tumour cells and circulating cell-free tumour DNA, have shown remarkable potential to provide insights into PCa patient outcomes by detecting specific genomic and transcriptomic alterations [ 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 EEF1A2 15 ESR1 2. Results 2.1. Characteristics of the Study Population Patients admitted to the Urology Unit of Cattinara Hospital (Trieste) for a transrectal control biopsy of the prostate, were invited to participate in this prospective, blinded study. From November 2021 to May 2022, a total of 58 patients were enrolled in the study. The blood samples were taken before the biopsy. After analysis of the collected plasma, patients were divided into two groups based on their histological diagnosis: Patients with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and patients with Prostate Cancer (PCa). We did not include a group with normal prostates as our cohort consisted of men referred for biopsy due to clinical suspicion and/or elevated PSA. In this setting, histological BPH is highly prevalent with increasing age (approximately 50% aged 51–60 years and ≥80–90% beyond 70), so truly normal tissue is rarely found [ 16 17 The clinical characteristics of these patients are listed in Table 1 The two groups were not homogeneous in terms of age, with the median (IQR) of age being 76.0 (66.8–79.3) and 68.0 (60.3–74.5) for the PCa group and the BPH group, respectively. This was not surprising as the American Cancer Society emphasises that the risk of developing PCa increases significantly with age, so it is more common in older men, particularly those over 50 [ 18 2.2. Evaluation of ALU 260/111 and LINE-1 266/97 Copy Number Ratio and cfDI in the Plasma of Patients’ Cohort Fragmentation of ccfDNA was assessed in the plasma of the patient cohort 19 20 21 22 23 24 22 23 25 As shown in Table 2 Figure 1 p p p p Figure 2 Table 3 Moreover, we investigated the possible improvement of the diagnostic efficiency of the ALU 260/111 and LINE-1 266/97 copy number ratios by combining them in a composite score, as previously reported [ 22 26 27 Figure 2 Table 3 It is noteworthy that the ratios of ALU 260/111 and LINE-1 266/97 and their product A*L, do not correlate with age in either PCa or the BPH group (see Supplementary Materials, Table S1 2.3. Evaluation of ccfDNA Quantity by EEF1A2 and ESR1 Copy Number in the Plasma of PCa and BPH Patients The amount of ccfDNA in the plasma of PCa and BPH groups was calculated by ddPCR based on the copy number of EEF1A2 ESR1 Table 4 Figure 3 EEF1A2 ESR1 EEF1A2 p ESR1 p EEF1A2 ESR1, EEF1A2 p ESR1 p Table 4 EEF1A2 ESR1 EEF1A2/ESR1 p Table 4 EEF1A2 ESR1 Supplementary Materials, Table S2 2.4. Correlation of ALU 260/111 and LINE-1 266/97 Copy Number Ratio with the Clinical-Pathological Status of PCa Patients As a secondary endpoint of this study, we investigated the correlations between the clinical-pathological parameters of the PCa patients and the ALU 260/111 or LINE-1 266/97 copy number ratios at the start of the study and after one-year. Table 5 The correlation of our parameters with PSA levels at baseline or at one-year follow-up in the PCa and BPH groups is shown in Table 6 p 3. Discussion Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer and the sixth leading cause of cancer death in men worldwide [ 1 9 In our study, we investigated the role of ccfDNA fragmentation by analysing the copy number ratio of long (260 bp and 266 bp) and short (111 bp and 97 bp) ALU and LINE-1 fragments in the plasma of a cohort of patients who had undergone transrectal prostate biopsy. After histological analysis, the patients were divided into two groups: those with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and those with Prostate Cancer (PCa). The study was performed the using digital droplet PCR, a PCR platform in which DNA templates are split into thousands of nano-sized droplets, which improves the sensitivity and reproducibility of the amplification process. ALU and LINE-1, together with HERV and SVA, represent the four primary classes of human retrotransposons, mobile DNA elements that make up about 45% of the human genome. LINE-1 and HERV encode their own reverse transcriptase, whereas ALU and SVA require the retrotranscription machinery of LINE-1 [ 28 29 12 30 31 To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the role of ALU 260/111 and LINE-1 266/97 ratios for PCa by liquid biopsy. Many studies have evaluated the plasma ALU 260/111 and LINE-1 266/97 ratios as diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers for several tumours including breast cancer (BC). In BC, plasma ALU 260/111 and LINE-1 266/97 ratios were found to be lower compared to healthy controls [ 15 19 19 32 33 15 19 34 35 36 37 38 Supplementary Materials, Table S3 39 40 Supplementary Materials, Table S3 One of the major limitations of our current research is the limited number of participants in the pilot study. Moreover, our population lacks a consistent number of patients with advanced and metastatic PCa tumour stages, with a focus on early-stage PCa (number of patients: Stage I–II = 30, Stage III–IV = 8). Further studies in a larger and more heterogeneous cohort of PCa patients will be necessary to validate our results. The extension of the study to the healthy population is another important point in order to deepen the diagnostic values of the biomarkers. However, the fact that we found no age-dependence for the biomarkers analysed and used a highly reproducible method, supports this finding and future studies in a larger cohort to confirm the ALU 260/111 and LINE-1 266/97 copy number ratios as biomarkers for prostate cancer detection. It is important to point out that in the literature, ccfDNA fragmentation studies using ALU and LINE-1 sequences have been performed by targeting long and short fragments of different sizes, which in turn affects the outcome of the analysis. For example, the LINE-1 259/97 ratio in the plasma of BC patients was found to be higher than in patients with benign breast disease (BBD) and healthy controls. This ratio also decreased in the plasma of patients’ after adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) compared to before ACT [ 41 20 21 22 23 24 42 9 EEF1A2 ESR1 41 43 44 45 46 EEF1A2/ESR1 EEF1A2 ESR1 Supplementary Materials, Table S4 EEF1A2 ESR1 p ESR1 p EEF1A2 ESR1 EFF1A2 ESR1 ESR1 ESR1 p Finally, our results showed no significant correlation between ALU 260/111 and LINE-1 266/97 copy number ratio and the clinical-pathological features of PCa patients neither at diagnosis nor at 1-year follow-up. This is probably due to the limited number of patients analysed in this pilot study. In addition, the lack of statistical significance for the parameters recurrence and tumour stage, could be related to the low heterogeneity in terms of the number of patients in the categorical groups studied. Indeed, there are only four PCa patients with tumour recurrence and eight PCa patients with advanced tumour stages (III and IV). However, these preliminary findings do not rule out the possibility that ALU and LINE-1 biomarkers may also be useful in distinguishing between aggressive and non-aggressive cancers and metastasis. In colorectal cancer cell lines, it was found that the accumulation of non-coding ALU RNA activates the epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and increases the metastatic potential of cancer cells [ 47 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Study Population The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Trieste (n. 110, 25 January 2021). From November 2021 to May 2022, we enrolled 58 patients who underwent prostate biopsy for suspected prostate cancer at the Urology Unit at the University of Trieste, Cattinara Hospital. Exclusion criteria were patients unable to sign a consent form and patients with active cancer under treatment. At our centre, we routinely perform a blood test to assess blood clotting, haemoglobin levels, and blood cell count. During this period, we collected 12 mL of venous blood from every enrolled patient for liquid biopsy. The signature of consent and the blood sample collection were performed before the diagnosis of prostate cancer, so the enrolment in this study must be considered double-blinded. We enrolled 58 male patients eligible for the study with a mean age of 72 y.o. and a mean PSA level of 6.6 ng/mL before biopsy. After histological diagnosis of prostate cancer and signing of informed consent, patients underwent standard staging procedures, including imaging and laboratory tests, according to international guidelines to define the extent of disease and support therapeutic decision-making https://uroweb.org/guidelines/prostate-cancer https://uroweb.org/guidelines/prostate-cancer https://doi.org/10.6004/jnccn.2024.0024 https://uroweb.org/guidelines/prostate-cancer https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2013.09.002 4.2. Plasma Preparation and ccfDNA Extraction Blood was collected by venipuncture into a 10 mL Vacutainer K2-EDTA tube (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and processed within one hour from collection. The blood was centrifuged at 3000× g g Circulating cell-free nucleic acids (ccfNAs) were extracted from the plasma samples (1 mL) using the Maxwell ® 2 4.3. ddPCR Analysis on EEF1A2, ESR1 and ccfDNA Quantity The quantification of the copy number of ESR1 EEF1A2 The EEF1A2 EEF1A2 EEF1A2 ESR1 ESR1 ESR1 ESR1 ESR1 ESR1 ESR1 ESR1 ESR1 EEF1A2 ESR1 λ = −log (1 − p) 48 ® The quantification of ccfDNA in plasma by EEF1A2 ESR1 49 c c f D N A  ( E E F 1 A 2 ) ( n g m L ) = n c E E F 1 A 2  ∗  3.3 1000 c c f D N A  ( E S R 1 ) ( n g m L ) = n c E S R 1  ∗  3.3 1000 EEF1A2 ESR1 4.4. ddPCR Analysis on ALU 260, ALU 111, LINE-1 266 and LINE-1 97 Fragments The copy numbers of ALU 260 bp, ALU 111 bp, LINE-1 266 bp, and LINE-1 97 bp in the plasma of PCa and BPH patients were determined by ddPCR using the EvaGreen assay (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Due to the abundance of larger and shorter fragments, DNA samples were diluted as follows to optimise the ddPCR analysis: 1:60 for ALU 260, 1:540 for ALU 111, 1:20 for LINE-1 266 and 1:120 for LINE-1 97. The primer sequences were the same as those of Madhavan et al. [ 19 A further ratio between the amount of the larger and shorter fragments of ALU and LINE-1, expressed in ng/mL plasma, was determined to compare the results with those reported in the literature. The following formulae were used to convert the copy numbers of ALU and LINE-1 fragments into DNA quantities: ALU cfDI (ng/mL): (copies/mL of plasma ALU 260 × bpn × 618 × 1.7 × 10 −15 −15 LINE-1 cfDI (ng/mL): (copies/mL of plasma LINE-1 266 × bpn × 618 × 1.7 × 10 −15 −15 −15 cfDI LINE-1 = (copies/mL of plasma LINE-1 266 × 266)/(copies/mL of plasma LINE-1 97 × 97) cfDI ALU = (copies/mL of plasma ALU 260 × 260)/(copies/mL of plasma ALU 111 × 111) 4.5. Statistical Analysis Categorical variables were presented as absolute values (percentages), and continuous variables as medians and interquartile ranges [IQR]. Normality was assessed using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Continuous variables were compared using the student’s or Mann–Whitney tests (and Kruskal–Wallis tests), depending on data distribution and the number of groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to obtain the values of the area under the curve (AUC), with 95% CI, to determine which biomarker was the most reliable in identifying prostate cancer. For the prostate cancer patients, Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to assess the relationship (i) between ALU 260/111 or LINE-1 266/97 copy number ratio and the other biomarkers and (ii) between age and the biomarkers. The significance threshold was set at p The data were analysed using R statistical software (R version 4.2.3, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.

Conclusions This study represents the first investigation of ALU 260/111 and LINE-1 266/97 in the plasma of PCa and BPH patients, and paves the way for groundbreaking insights into their applicability and reliability in a clinical context. The ALU 260/111 and LINE-1 266/97 copy number ratio in plasma appear to be valuable biomarkers that could be developed for screening patients for prostate cancer. These non-invasive, highly reproducible ddPCR blood tests could help to better define the diagnosis and differentiate prostate cancer patients from benign lesions or healthy conditions. If the test is validated in a large cohort, it could enter into clinical practise to reduce the need for biopsy in patients, thereby reducing healthcare costs and patient suffering. In addition, the test could potentially be developed as a tool for molecular stratification of patients in follow-up care. It should be noted that this study has demonstrated the potential of ALU and LINE-1 targets as diagnostic biomarkers for Prostate cancer (PCa) in liquid biopsy, but the limited number of patients and the lack of heterogeneity in clinical subgroups hinder the adequate evaluation of their prognostic potential. In addition, the substantial amount of ALU and LINE-1 targets in ccfDNA, offers unique opportunities for the study of plasma biomarkers in liquid biopsies in cancer, including PCa. Overall, these results are encouraging and deserve further investigation with a larger cohort studied at diagnosis and follow-up to clarify the clinical significance of ALU 260/111 and LINE-1 266/97 copy number ratios in PCa.
