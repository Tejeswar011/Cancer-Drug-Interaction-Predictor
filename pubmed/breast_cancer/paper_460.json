No studies have directly compared BMI, race, and volumetric breast density in relation to breast cancer risk. This study examines the associations between BI-RADS density and Volpara-derived volumetric breast density measures and breast cancer risk in non-Hispanic Black and White women, focusing on BMI’s influence. Methods A nested case-control study was conducted with 3699 women (526 Black, 3173 White) from Mayo Clinic and the University of Pennsylvania. Invasive breast cancer cases ( n n Results Black women had higher dense volume but lower volumetric percent density and BI-RADS density compared with White women. All density measures were significantly associated with breast cancer risk in both groups, with stronger associations after BMI adjustment for BI-RADS density and volumetric percent density. BI-RADS density showed a stronger association in Black women (OR  2.06, 95% CI 1.45–2.91) than in White women (OR  1.55, 95% CI 1.38–1.74) when adjusted for BMI (p-interaction = 0.04). Dense volume showed similar predictive value for both groups, regardless of BMI adjustment. Conclusion Using BI-RADS density categories to assess breast cancer risk requires adjustment for BMI for equitable comparison of predictive values across race. Associations of dense volume are not altered when BMI is included as an adjustment factor.

Further, dense volume measures are not dependent on the non-dense tissue or BMI and may be more robust measures of density across racial groups. Several studies have examined the associations between BMI, race/ethnicity, and breast density, considering age and menopausal status [ 9 14 9 12 14 Few studies have examined Breast Density Measures and Breast Cancer Risk for Black and White Women. The purpose of this study was to compare the associations of BI-RADS density with quantitative measurements of dense volume and volumetric percent density with breast cancer risk, examine in Black and White women, and how BMI may influence these associations. Methods We pooled data from two nested case-control studies from women ages 35 and older receiving full field digital mammography (FFDM) screening examinations at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota (MN) (years 2008 to 2017) and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (PA, UPENN) (2011 to 2014) from Hologic-Selenia mammography units. Incident invasive breast cancers were identified from linkages to institutional and state cancer registries and included at least six months after screening mammography. Both screen-detected and symptomatically detected cancers were included. Three controls without a history of breast cancer were initially matched to cases based on facility, race, age, and year of screening mammogram; however, due to various reasons, some controls dropped out due to breast area exclusions and imaging artifacts, resulting in certain cases having only one matched control in the final analyses. For this analysis, only those with non-missing information on breast density measures and BMI, and who self-identified as non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic White, were included. The final study population included 3699 women, of whom 526 were Black and 3173 were White, with each patient contributing one screening mammogram to the analysis. Self-reported demographic and reproductive breast cancer risk factors, such as family history of breast cancer, were available from mammography screening questionnaires administered as part of routine practice. BMI values were extracted from electronic medical records recorded on the screening date, if available, and if not, within 1 year before or after the screening mammogram. The study was HIPAA-compliant and approved by the Institutional Review Boards at both Mayo Clinic and University of Pennsylvania, and a waiver of informed consent was granted for this review of existing clinical data. BI-RADS breast density was obtained from radiology reports, visually determined by one interpreting radiologist, as is standard practice in the U.S. The measures were derived according to the American College of Radiology BI-RADS Atlas 4th Edition [ 8 Quantitative measures of volumetric breast density were obtained using Volpara™, a fully automated software that computes volumetric breast density from FFDM images. Briefly, Volpara uses an area of entirely fatty tissue as a reference point to estimate the thickness of dense tissue at each pixel in the image [ 26 We used conditional logistic regression to compare matched cases and controls to assess the association between the density measures (BI-RADS density, dense volume DV, volumetric percent density VPD) and risk of invasive breast cancer. We estimated the association of density measures using odds ratios and discriminatory accuracy using the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The AUC was calculated within matched pairs. Odds ratios for volumetric percent density and dense volume are presented per 1 standard deviation in the log-transformed measure. BI-RADS density was modeled as an ordinal trend across categories. This was done given the small sample size of Black women in the extremely dense category. AUCs when BI-RADS density was modeled as a four-level categorical variable were very similar to models using ordinal trend (See Additional File 1). Analyses were adjusted for age and BMI as continuous variables, and comparisons were made between models adjusted for age alone and those adjusted for both age and BMI. We also tested models including family history as a covariate, as well as an interaction between menopausal status (age greater than or equal to 55 or age less than 55) [ 18 For primary analyses, AUC was compared between race groups based on results from 1000 bootstrapped samples. In analyses of age and BMI subgroups, non-conditional logistic regression analysis was used, and matching factors were also included in the adjustment variables. As a secondary analysis, we explored the association between each of the density measures and breast cancer risk stratified by age (as a proxy for menopausal status), obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m 2 Results section The nested case-control study consisted of 1013 invasive breast cancer cases and 2686 matched controls, with 14% Black and 83% White women. White women contributed 875 cases, and 2298 controls, and Black women contributed 138 cases and 388 controls. There were differences in both BMI, family history, and breast density between Black and White women (Table 1 2 2 3 3  Table 1 Demographic characteristics of the patient population by race and case-control status Black women White women Control N Case N Total N Control N Case N Total N Age at mammogram 60.4 (11.38) 60.6 (11.37) 60.5 (11.37) 60.5 (11.22) 60.8 (11.55) 60.6 (11.31) BMI 30.5 (9.67) 30.2 (9.07) 30.4 (9.51) 27.2 (8.18) 27.8 (7.73) 27.4 (8.06) Post menopausal, n (%) ( n 305 (80) 100 (73) 405 (78) 1711 (76) 659 (78) 2370 (77) First degree relative B.C., n (%) ( n 65 (17.5%) 27 (20.1%) 92 (18.2%) 513 (22.5%) 283 (32.6%) 796 (25.3%) Time in years from mammogram to breast cancer diagnosis, Median (IQR) 3.0 (2.0, 4.4) 3.4 (2.0, 4.8) ER+, n (%) ( n 99 (72%) 756 (87%) HER2+, n(%) ( n 18 (13%) 87 (10%) BI-RADS density, n (%) ( n a 77 (19.8%) 15 (10.9%) 92 (17.5%) 459 (20.0%) 110 (12.6%) 569 (17.9%) b 238 (61.3%) 74 (54.0%) 312 (59.4%) 1003 (43.7%) 364 (41.6%) 1367 (43.1%) c 72 (18.6%) 46 (33.6%) 118 (22.5%) 724 (31.5%) 345 (39.4%) 1069 (33.7%) d 1 (0.3%) 2 (1.5%) 3 (0.6%) 111 (4.8%) 56 (6.4%) 167 (5.3%) Volpara volumetric percent density, Median (IQR) 4.6 (3.6, 6.9) 5.9 (4.2, 8.8) 4.8 (3.6, 7.2) 5.9 (4.3, 9.8) 6.4 (4.6, 11.5) 6.1 (4.3, 10.3) Volpara dense volume, Median (IQR) 56.5 (44.4, 79.6) 72.6 (50.4, 95.4) 60.5 (45.4, 83.9) 52.0 (38.9, 69.9) 59.2 (45.2, 83.0) 53.8 (40.5, 72.8) Study, n (%) Mayo 0% 0% 0% 1913 (83.2%) 736 (84.1%) 2649 (83.5%) UPENN 388 (100%) 138 (100%) 526 (100%) 385 (16.8%) 139 (15.9%) 524 (16.5%) BI-RADS density, dense volume, and volumetric percent density were all significantly associated with breast cancer risk in both Black and White women, when adjusted for age alone, both age and BMI, and age, BMI, and menopausal status (Table 2 2  Table 2 Conditional logistic regression models for breast cancer outcome adjusted for age only and age and BMI, with the respective volumetric density exposures Variables/ White/black combined Black women White women OR AUC Race/ OR AUC OR AUC BI-RADS* Density per 1 category Age adjusted 1.44 (1.30, 1.59) 0.575 (0.556, 0.593) 0.07 1.92 (1.39, 2.66) 0.605 (0.557, 0.654) 1.39 (1.25, 1.55) 0.568 (0.548, 0.588) Age + BMI adjusted 1.58 (1.42, 1.77) 0.590 (0.572, 0.609) 0.04 2.06 (1.45, 2.91) 0.634 (0.586, 0.682) 1.55 (1.38, 1.74) 0.593 (0.573, 0.613) Volumetric percent density (log) per 1 SD Age adjusted 1.25 (1.15, 1.36) 0.561 (0.543, 0.580) 0.15 1.45 (1.17, 1.79) 0.582 (0.533, 0.632) 1.22 (1.12, 1.33) 0.565 (0.545, 0.585) Age + BMI adjusted 1.40 (1.28, 1.54) 0.591 (0.572, 0.610) 0.16 1.53 (1.21, 1.93) 0.611 (0.562, 0.659) 1.39 (1.25, 1.54) 0.591 (0.571, 0.611) Dense volume (log) per 1 SD Age adjusted 1.46 (1.35, 1.59) 0.600 (0.582, 0.619) 0.38 1.61 (1.29, 2.00) 0.603 (0.554, 0.652) 1.44 (1.33, 1.57) 0.596 (0.576, 0.616) Age + BMI adjusted 1.46 (1.35, 1.58) 0.601 (0.583, 0.620) 0.37 1.61 (1.29, 2.00) 0.603 (0.554, 0.652) 1.44 (1.32, 1.57) 0.603 (0.583, 0.623) * Radiologist reported BI-RADS Density *One black case and 1 white control were dropped in the analysis of BI-RADS density due to missing data When comparing differences in the breast density associations by race, BI-RADS density was more strongly associated with breast cancer risk for Black women (OR 2.06, 95% (1.45, 2.91) compared with White women (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.38, 1.74) (p-interaction = 0.04, adjusted for BMI and age).

First, we found that Black women had higher levels of dense volume, but lower BI-RADS density and percent volumetric density compared with White women. Second, although all measures of breast density were strongly associated with invasive breast cancer risk for both Black and White women, adjustment for BMI strengthened associations of BI-RADS density and volumetric percent density measures with breast cancer, while dense volume had a stable association with breast cancer risk regardless of additional adjustment for BMI. Taken together, our study suggests that using BI-RADS density or volumetric percent density unadjusted for BMI will identify fewer Black women as high risk, but using BMI-adjusted BI-RADS density or volumetric percent density measures or dense volume combined with BMI may better identify Black women at elevated breast cancer risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest study to explore differences in the association between volumetric density measures and breast cancer risk between Black and White women. Our results confirm previous literature, which states that Black women have less dense breasts compared with White women using BI-RADS density or volumetric percent density [ 9 14 10 11 12 9 19 20 We confirm studies that Black women have a lower percentage of breast density or BI-RADS density and higher absolute breast density compared with White women, prior to adjustment for BMI. BI-RADS density is currently relied upon to determine which women are eligible for supplemental screening. Based on our findings, using BI-RADS density measure or relative measures such as volumetric percent density, which reflect BMI instead of absolute measures of glandular tissue such as dense volume, may lead to inequitable screening practices between Black and White women [ 9 21 22 23 We found that dense volume is a strong predictor of invasive breast cancer risk for both Black and White women, with similar discriminatory accuracy regardless of BMI considerations. Given that dense volume has a strong association with breast cancer risk and similar discriminatory accuracy for both Black and White women, this may be a more robust measure of risk to use in diverse populations [ 21 24 21 25 Strengths of this study include the multi-institutional collaboration and investigation of volumetric breast density measures and breast cancer risk for both Black and White women. Several limitations should be considered. Though this was the largest study on the topic to date, our study included only 138 breast cancer cases for Black women. Larger studies should confirm our findings. We utilized only one software program to quantitatively estimate breast density, Volpara. Though this measure was developed in a European population, it has been widely validated in populations from Europe, the U.S., and Asia and shown to be correlated with other quantitative density measurement software [ 26 18 In summary, all the qualitative and percent density measures were strongly associated with breast cancer risk after adjustment for both age and BMI. Only a statistically significant race and density interaction existed between BI-RADS density and race, with Black women having a stronger breast cancer risk association compared with White women. The association of dense volume and breast cancer risk was similar after adjustment for BMI or stratification by BMI, age, and time until breast cancer diagnosis. Future studies should consider investigating dense volume as a more equitable breast density measure, both for clinical use and for inclusion in risk prediction models when considering supplemental screening.
