Kampo medicines (e.g., Hangeshashinto [Chinese name, Ban-Xia-Xie-Xin-Tang], Orento, and Orengedokuto) have been widely used to treat stomatitis, such as gargling with Hangeshashinto. However, the mechanisms by which Kampo medicines work are not widely understood due to their oral administration and the subsequent digestion, absorption, and metabolization of their components. Stomatitis is associated with advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in patients with lifestyle diseases, and can be induced by both intra- and extracellular AGEs (blood and dietary AGEs). Various natural products inhibit intracellular AGE generation and suppress cytotoxicity, such as inflammation caused by extracellular AGEs. This review summarizes 19 natural products identified in the Hangeshashinto water extract and 16 natural products identified in the crude drug extract. The data show that several natural products, such as glycyrrhizin, baicalin, 6-shogaol, quercetin, epigallocatechin-3-galate, and genistein, inhibit intracellular AGEs and suppress extracellular AGE inflammation. Furthermore, several natural products in the Hangeshashito water extract can suppress cytotoxicity in stomatitis. stomatitis Hangeshashinto Kampo medicine traditional Chinese medicine water extract gargle lifestyle-related disease advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) dietary AGEs natural products JSPS KAKENHI JP24K14802 This work was supported by JSPS KAKENHI [grant number JP24K14802 (T.T.)]. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Stomatitis is a painful condition that affects the mouth lining, and there are numerous types and causes, such as traumatic stomatitis [ 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 5 9 5 9 5 9 5 5 5 5 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 10 6 20 21 22 23 24 25 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 26 27 28 29 26 27 28 29 N ε N ε N δ 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 26 27 28 29 10 27 28 29 33 34 35 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 10 2. Various Types of Stomatitis Stomatitis can be caused by various factors ( Figure 1 1 48 Section 6 2 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 1 56 2 6 12 56 57 1 2 6 12 3 4 3 4 8 15 3. Treatment of Stomatitis with Hangeshashinto and Predicted Mechanisms 3.1. Traditional Chinese and Kampo Medicines To describe the Hangeshashinto treatment for stomatitis, we first introduce the relationship between traditional Chinese medical science and Kampo, which is traditional Japanese medicine [ 58 59 60 61 62 63 62 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 6 64 65 72 73 74 59 60 61 62 Figure 2 59 60 61 62 75 76 Table 1 5 6 7 8 11 11 Japanese Pharmacopoeia Figure 2 5 6 7 8 Section 3.2 3.2. Hangeshashinto (Ban-Xia-Xie-Xin-Tang) Treatment Effects and Mechanisms Many Kampo medicines are orally administered water extracts from crude drugs [ 73 74 Japanese Pharmacopoeia 5 6 7 8 11 5 6 7 8 11 16 77 10 6 7 10 16 77 Porphyromonas gingivalis 6 7 2 2 16 77 3.3. Natural Products in Hangeshashinto and Their Anti-Inflammation Effects Oh et al. and Endo et al. analyzed the components in Hangeshashinto water extract using 3D-HPLC and identified approximately twenty natural products [ 6 20 6 6 6 20 6 20 6 O 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 22 20 6 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 2 16 2 78 79 21 16 80 O 16 23 80 81 82 82 83 84 85 86 22 87 16 24 88 16 24 25 2 6 20 4. AGEs 4.1. AGE Origins Saccharides, saccharide metabolites, and their non-enzymatic reaction products react with proteins to generate AGEs via the Maillard reaction [ 26 27 28 29 89 90 91 92 26 27 28 29 93 94 26 27 28 29 93 94 95 96 97 Figure 7 Figure 8 26 27 28 29 26 27 28 29 29 98 99 4.2. Free AGEs While AGEs can react with proteins to generate AGEs via the Maillard reaction, they can also react with amino acids to produce free-type AGEs ( Figure 9 Figure 10 26 27 28 29 Figure 9 26 27 28 29 100 101 102 103 104 105 Figure 10 Figure 9 Section 4.5.5 N α 104 105 4.3. Previous AGE Categories and Potential Improvements In the middle of the 20th century, a classical category for AGEs was established [ 26 27 28 29 26 27 28 29 95 Figure 11 28 96 97 105 106 107 108 105 106 107 108 4.4. Structure of AGE-Modified Proteins AGEs can exist as AGE-modified proteins or animals in the organs [ 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 Section 4.6 109 110 111 112 116 117 Figure 12 27 28 29 27 28 29 Figure 12 27 28 29 27 28 29 27 28 29 118 Figure 12 4.5. Intra-/Extracellular AGEs and LSRDs 4.5.1. Intracellular AGEs and LSRDs AGEs are generated from saccharides, their metabolites, and non-enzymatic production in the cultured cells [ 116 119 116 119 109 110 111 120 4.5.2. AGEs in the Extracellular Matrix and LSRDs Pentosidine-modified collagens are AGE-modified extracellular matrix proteins [ 29 121 122 29 121 122 4.5.3. AGEs in the Blood, Urine, Saliva, and LSRDs AGEs, including free types, and AGE-modified proteins have been detected in blood [ 29 123 124 125 29 126 29 101 29 127 128 129 130 130 Section 4.5.4 33 34 35 131 132 133 134 135 108 136 4.5.4. Dietary AGEs and LSRDs Various types of saccharides are contained in foods and beverages, and they are processed using heat treatments in factories and homes [ 28 89 133 137 138 89 133 133 137 4.5.5. AGEs in the Body Fluid as a Biomarker for LSRDs and Dietary Lifestyle To diagnose LSRDS, such as non-alcoholic heptosteatosis (NASH), hyperuricemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), uric acid, creatinine, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and urinary pH, have been measured in the blood and urine [ 139 140 29 95 114 115 140 141 137 138 95 95 114 N ε 141 114 142 137 138 4.6. Identification and Quantification of AGEs We introduce fluorescence, immunostaining, slot blotting, Western blotting, ELISA, GC-MS, ESI-/MALDI-MS, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as methods to identify and quantify AGEs [ 26 27 28 29 143 144 144 145 26 27 28 29 26 27 28 29 26 146 147 148 149 117 150 120 149 26 146 147 148 151 26 152 153 154 155 26 89 111 123 124 141 156 157 26 89 111 123 124 141 156 157 Figure 10 Figure 12 26 152 153 154 155 Figure 10 Figure 12 26 109 110 111 118 26 28 5. Mechanisms of Inhibition of Intra-/Extracellular AGE-Induced Cytotoxicity by Anti-AGE Compounds Numerous strategies have been reported for the inhibition of intra-/extracellular AGE-induced cytotoxicity. The carbonyl trap system and activation of glyoxalase-1 can inhibit the generation of intracellular AGEs ( Figure 13 27 28 29 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 13 27 28 29 27 28 29 Figure 13 27 28 29 6. Potential of AGE-Induced Cytotoxicity and Dysfunction for Oral Squamous Cells 6.1. Potential of Intracellular AGE-Induced Cytotoxicity and Dysfunction for Oral Epithelial Cells Oral epithelial cells are located on the oral squamous and typically undergo rapid turnover within 7–14 days [ 158 10 30 31 32 159 159 31 10 32 30 30 6.2. Potential of Extracellular AGE-Induced Cytotoxicity and Dysfunction for Oral Epithelial Cells RAGE and TLR4 are expressed on oral epithelial cells as well as other organs [ 10 33 34 35 132 10 33 34 35 132 7. Natural Products in Hangeshashinto Water Extract Inhibit the Generation of Intracellular AGEs in Stomatitis Some researchers have suggested inhibiting the generation of intracellular AGEs [ 28 121 149 160 161 162 163 164 Figure 7 Figure 8 Figure 13 Figure 8 Figure 13 28 121 160 161 162 165 166 Figure 3 28 160 161 Figure 4 28 160 161 Figure 5 28 160 28 167 p Figure 6 28 168 169 169 36 36 170 36 170 37 171 Plasmodium falciparum 172 173 174 173 174 40 41 175 10 169 36 170 36 36 37 171 40 41 40 41 175 8. Natural Products Obtained from Hangeshashinto Water Extract Suppress Extracellular AGEs-RAGE/TLR4 Signaling in Stomatitis Baicalin may suppress the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway in vitro and in vivo ( Figure 3 38 39 38 39 Figure 3 176 Figure 3 177 178 Figure 4 179 180 179 180 Figure 5 181 182 Figure 6 183 Figure 6 42 9. Beneficial Natural Products in Seven Crude Drugs Obtained from Hangeshashinto Plant leaves, blanch, roots, seeds, and seed vessels contain high levels of natural products [ 184 185 6 20 Pinellia ternate Scutellaria baicalensis Coptis japonica Zingiber officinale Panax ginseng Glycyrrhiza uralensis Zizpbus jujura Table 1 186 Section 10 Section 11 186 10. Natural Products in the Crude Drugs Obtained from Hangeshashinto That Inhibit the Generation of Intracellular AGEs Natural products in plants can suppress the generation of intracellular AGEs. We introduced quercetin, chrysin, genistein, (+)-catechin, (−)-epicatechin, epigarocatechin-3-gallate, hesperidin, imperialine, curcumin, piperine, diphylorethohydroxyarmalol, and resveratrol in Figure 14 28 121 160 161 187 28 121 160 161 187 162 Table 2 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 11. Natural Products in Crude Drugs from Hangeshashinto Suppress Extracellular AGEs-RAGE/TLR4 Signaling We introduce ferulic acid [ 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 O 223 Figure 15 p Section 10 Figure 14 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 p 231 232 233 234 Table 3 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 223 247 248 O Glycyriza glabra 249 12. Limitations While it is likely that AGE-induced oral squamous cell syndromes occur as a result of modern lifestyles, we targeted the intracellular AGEs in the oral epithelial cells and extracellular AGEs that directly combine with the surface. AGEs in other organs can promote cytotoxicity for oral epithelial cells via inflammation and saliva dysfunction; however, we were unable to review this phenomenon. Various natural products are generally contained in the roots, leaves, radix, and seeds of the plants [ 10 184 185 Section 9 Section 10 186 Section 9 Section 10 13. Conclusions While intra-/extracellular AGEs may induce oral squamous cell syndromes, these syndromes have not been recognized in clinical or basic medical science. Hangeshashinto treatments are generally administered orally, and the mechanisms by which they attenuate the mouth, esophagus, and gut have been widely investigated. This review focused on treatments of oral epithelial cells that involve gargling and coating the mouth with Hangeshashinto water extract. Nineteen natural products that can suppress the generation of intracellular AGEs and extracellular AGEs-RAGE/TLR4 signaling have been isolated from the Hangeshashinto water extract. In addition, sixteen natural compounds in seven crude drugs obtained from Hangeshashinto may show anti-intra-/extracellular AGE effects. To inhibit the generation of various types of AGE-modified proteins, the carbonyl trap system and activation of glyoxalase-1, which are natural products in the water extract of Hangeshashinto or seven crude drugs, are beneficial because they can react with AGE-origin compounds. Although they can suppress the signaling of AGEs in the body fluid or the beverages/foods and RAGE/TLR4 in oral epithelial cells, the possibility that they can suppress various or whole types of AGEs-RAGE/TLR4 signaling remains unclear. Each natural compound may suppress an individual structure in the AGE-RAGE/TLR4 axis; this will require further investigation. Natural products in Hangeshashinto water extract may directly prevent and modulate stomatitis induced by intra-/extracellular AGEs. This review will be beneficial for future investigations that aim to reveal the mechanisms by which the Hangeshashinto water extract attenuates AGE-induced stomatitis.
