Methods This prospective observational cohort study evaluated the preventive effect of risk-stratified nursing on PICC-related thrombosis in cancer patients. Chemotherapy patients undergoing PICC placement in the oncology department of our hospital from January 2023 to December 2024 were enrolled. Participants were allocated into two cohorts based on the implementation timeline of the nursing protocol: Control group (n=117) received routine PICC care (January 2023–December 2023), while intervention group (n=119) received risk-stratified nursing interventions (January 2024–December 2024) guided by a logistic regression model identifying key thrombosis risk factors (eg, tumor staging, comorbid diabetes, D-dimer levels). Results The intervention group (2024) exhibited a significantly lower PICC-related thrombosis incidence compared to the control group (2023) (4.20% vs 29.91%, χ²=28.436, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis identified tumor stage III/IV (OR=2.556, 95% CI 1.798–5.564), history of thrombosis (OR=19.273, 95% CI 10.674–37.561), diabetes (OR=2.572, 95% CI 1.027–5.712), catheter tip malposition (OR=14.339, 95% CI 8.916–29.795), and elevated D-Dimer (OR=9.528, 95% CI 6.703–15.597) as independent risk factors, while anticoagulant use (OR=0.449, 95% CI 0.089–0.874) was protective. In the intervention cohort, protocol-guided anticoagulation showed enhanced protection (OR=0.332, 95% CI 0.121–0.898, P=0.028). The intervention group also demonstrated improved quality of life across all SF-36 domains (eg, physical functioning: 58.94±1.97 vs 45.93±3.02, P<0.05) and significantly higher nursing satisfaction (96.64% vs 86.32%, χ²=8.091, P=0.004). Conclusion Risk-stratified nursing interventions, guided by logistic regression analysis of thrombosis risk factors, significantly reduce PICC-related thrombosis incidence and improve patient quality of life and nursing satisfaction. This protocol offers a practical framework for oncology nursing to enhance patient outcomes.

With the continuous advancement of early screening and treatment technologies, the survival period of cancer patients has been significantly extended. To cope with the discomfort and side effects of chemotherapy, an increasing number of cancer patients opt for peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement to ensure safe and effective drug infusion. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Risk-stratified nursing interventions represent a systematic approach that integrates nurses’ expertise with patient-specific risk profiles to optimize care delivery. 10 11 12 13 Materials and Methods Study Design This prospective observational cohort study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a risk-stratified nursing protocol for preventing PICC-related thrombosis in cancer patients. Chemotherapy patients undergoing PICC placement in the oncology department of our hospital from January 2023 to December 2024 were enrolled. To minimize temporal bias, participants were allocated into two cohorts based on the implementation timeline of the nursing protocol: Control group (n=117): Patients admitted from January 2023 to December 2023 received routine PICC care following hospital SOPs. Intervention group (n=119): Patients admitted from January 2024 to December 2024 received risk-stratified nursing interventions based on identified thrombosis risk factors. This study was approved by the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University Medical Ethics Committee (Approval No.: 2024-ZL-003) and conducted in strict accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all study participants. Participant Recruitment Participants were consecutively enrolled through a stratified random sampling method. Eligibility criteria were applied to all chemotherapy patients scheduled for PICC placement during the study period. Randomization was performed using computer-generated random numbers, with allocation concealment achieved through sealed opaque envelopes.

Exclusion criteria: ① Severe organ dysfunction (defined as Child-Pugh Class C liver cirrhosis, eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m², or NYHA Class III/IV heart failure); ② Active systemic infections (eg, HIV, tuberculosis, or sepsis); ③ Cognitive impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination score <24) or psychiatric disorders impairing cooperation. Research Methods Establishment of Influencing Factors Logistic Regression Model Literature Review A comprehensive review of existing literature and guidelines was conducted to systematically evaluate the influencing factors of PICC-related thrombosis formation in oncology patients, and a draft of the evaluation form was created. By conducting in-depth searches on platforms such as PubMed, the China Biological Medicine Database (CBM), and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), relevant factors related to PICC-related thrombosis formation were collected and summarized. The Chinese search terms included “peripherally inserted central catheter”, “malignant tumor”, “thrombosis”, etc., while the English search terms included “PICC”, “thrombosis”, “risk factors”, etc. Selection of Relevant Risk Factors In selecting influencing factors, multiple dimensions were comprehensively considered to fully reflect the clinical status of patients. Specific considerations included: ① Patient factors: Basic information was collected from patients, including gender, age, the presence of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, as well as whether there was a history of thrombosis, use of anticoagulants, and the tumor’s location and staging. ② Catheter factors: During the catheterization process, factors such as the number of punctures, the choice of the puncture vein, the position of the catheter tip, and the duration of catheterization could all affect thrombosis formation, and these factors were included in the analysis. ③ Laboratory indicators: These included fibrinogen (Fib), plasma D-dimer (D-D), and platelet count (PLT). Nursing Methods Control Group Received conventional nursing care, including catheter maintenance (eg, patency checks), medication administration, and general condition monitoring. Intervention Group The intervention group received risk-stratified nursing interventions led by a specialized oncology team (1 head nurse + 5 staff nurses), incorporating a comprehensive protocol with four core components: risk stratification, standardized procedures, patient education, and fidelity assurance. Patients were categorized using the modified Khorana score, with high-risk individuals (≥2 risk factors) undergoing daily catheter site inspections, biweekly Doppler ultrasound surveillance, and individualized anticoagulation plans (eg, enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily). Low-risk patients (<2 risk factors) received standard monitoring every 72 hours and routine institutional anticoagulant prophylaxis. Standardized care included ultrasound-guided basilic vein selection (≥3 mm diameter) and cavoatrial junction positioning via intracavitary ECG during catheter insertion. Maintenance protocols required 10 mL saline flushing pre/post-infusion and heparin lock (10 U/mL) for intermittent use, with dressing changes every 7 days or as needed. Patient education emphasized limb elevation and symptom recognition (eg, swelling, pain) pre-insertion. Anticoagulation management followed D-dimer thresholds (≥1.5 μg/mL triggering hematology consultation), with weekly audits ensuring 100% flushing compliance and documentation accuracy. Fidelity was maintained through a 4-hour pre-intervention workshop on risk assessment tools, ultrasound techniques, and adverse event management, alongside biweekly dynamic reassessment of risk status using updated laboratory parameters (platelet count, D-dimer). Evaluation Indicators (1) Incidence of catheter-related thrombosis and accompanying diseases: The occurrence of PICC-related thrombosis in both groups was statistically recorded by relevant nursing staff at our hospital. (2) Quality of life: Before discharge, the patients’ quality of life was assessed using the Quality of Life Questionnaire (SF-36). 15 (3) Nursing satisfaction: Before discharge, nursing satisfaction was evaluated using the Newcastle Satisfaction with Nursing Scale (NSNS). 16 Statistical Methods All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) and GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Categorical variables were presented as frequencies (n, %) and analyzed using the χ² U To identify independent risk factors for PICC-related thrombosis in oncology patients, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted. Candidate variables were selected based on univariate analysis results with p < 0.20. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. For model robustness, sensitivity analyses were performed by varying the inclusion criteria for risk factors (eg, adjusting the univariate screening threshold to p < 0.10 or p < 0.15). A two-tailed p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Study Design Clarification This observational cohort study compared outcomes between historical controls (2023, routine care) and the intervention cohort (2024, risk-stratified nursing).

Firstly, drugs are directly infused into the large veins, which avoids the damage caused by highly irritating chemotherapy drugs to the peripheral veins, thereby reducing the adverse reactions caused by vein irritation. 21 22 23 24 25 Analysis of Influencing Factors of PICC-Related Thrombosis in Cancer Patients The results of this study indicate that tumor stage, history of thrombosis, coexisting diabetes, repeated punctures, catheter tip position, and D-Dimer (D-D) level are risk factors for PICC catheter-related thrombosis in cancer patients (OR > 1, P < 0.05), while the use of anticoagulants is a protective factor (OR < 1, P < 0.05). Our identification of tumor stage III–IV (OR=2.556), diabetes (OR=2.572), and catheter tip malposition (OR=14.339) as independent risk factors align with prior studies from South Korea 26 27 28 29 30 31 First, cancer patients are often in a hypercoagulable state due to their pathological characteristics, which is primarily caused by several mechanisms. On the one hand, tumor cells can directly activate the coagulation system, causing the blood to exhibit a hypercoagulable tendency. 32 33 34 Mechanistic Insights The hypercoagulable state in advanced tumors, driven by endothelial damage and thrombin activation [Germany], 35 36 37 38 39 40 Diabetes has also been identified as an important risk factor for PICC catheter-related thrombosis in cancer patients. The reason lies in the fact that prolonged hyperglycemia promotes the synthesis of endothelin in plasma, 41 42 43 Risk Response Nursing Can Reduce the Incidence of Thrombosis, Improve Patients’ Quality of Life, and Increase Satisfaction with Nursing Care In response to the aforementioned influencing factors, our hospital implemented risk-stratified nursing measures for the intervention group. The study results showed that the incidence of PICC catheter-related thrombosis in the intervention group (4.20%) was lower than that in the control group (29.91%) (P < 0.05), confirming the effectiveness of risk-stratified nursing. Geographic and Clinical Context As a single-center study conducted in Zhengzhou, China, our findings reflect local nursing practices and patient demographics. For example, the high prevalence of gastric cancer (22.2% in controls) aligns with regional epidemiology, which may influence thrombosis risk profiles compared to Western populations with higher breast/prostate cancer rates. Future multi-center studies across East Asia are needed to validate generalizability. The reasons for this are as follows: ① Early Risk Identification and Assessment: At the early stage of patient admission, nursing staff evaluated the risk factors for thrombosis formation. This early risk identification allowed nursing staff to take preventive interventions at an earlier stage, avoiding the passive waiting typical of conventional nursing. ② Personalized Nursing Interventions: Based on the risk assessment, nursing staff implemented personalized nursing interventions tailored to each patient’s specific condition. For example, for diabetic patients, timely adjustments to nutrition management and blood glucose control strategies were made to reduce the damage caused by hyperglycemia to the vascular endothelium. For patients who had undergone multiple punctures, stricter aseptic procedures and vascular protection measures were taken to reduce local endothelial damage caused by puncture. ③ Close Monitoring and Intervention: Throughout the treatment process, patients in the intervention group received more frequent health monitoring. Close intervention allowed nursing staff to detect risks of thrombosis at an early stage, thereby helping patients reduce the risk of thrombosis formation. Additionally, the study also showed that the quality of life scores and nursing satisfaction of the intervention group were higher than those of the control group (P < 0.05), consistent with the results of Zhu et al’s research. 44 45 Despite the significant results achieved in this study, there are still some limitations. First, the sample size of this study is relatively small and limited to a single medical institution, which may cause the research results to be influenced by regional and institutional differences, making it less representative of other regions or medical institutions. Second, the follow-up period in this study was short, and the long-term effects of nursing interventions on thrombosis formation have not yet been observed. Future research should extend the follow-up period to assess the long-term effects of risk-stratified nursing. In addition, this study did not delve into the impact of individual patient differences (such as different tumor types and chemotherapy regimens) on the incidence of thrombosis. Future studies should further refine patient classification and explore the applicability of personalized nursing plans for different types of patients. Conclusion This study demonstrates that risk-stratified nursing significantly reduces the incidence of PICC line-associated thrombosis in cancer patients. By identifying and addressing key risk factors—such as advanced tumor stage, history of thrombosis, comorbid diabetes, catheter tip position, and elevated D-Dimer levels—this approach enables early intervention and improved clinical outcomes. The implementation of this nursing model led to a marked reduction in thrombosis rates (from 29.91% in the control group to 4.20% in the observation group), enhanced quality of life across all measured domains, and increased patient and nurse satisfaction. These findings underscore the importance of individualized, evidence-based nursing strategies in oncology care, particularly for patients undergoing long-term intravenous therapy via PICC lines. Risk-stratified nursing not only improves safety and efficacy but also supports better coordination between healthcare providers and patients, ultimately enhancing overall care delivery. Implications and Recommendations The results of this study provide strong support for the adoption of risk stratification and targeted nursing interventions in the management of cancer patients with PICC lines. Healthcare institutions are encouraged to integrate these practices into standard protocols to reduce thrombotic complications and improve patient outcomes. Furthermore, training programs for nurses should emphasize the identification and management of thrombosis risk factors, including the appropriate use of anticoagulants and optimal catheter placement techniques. Implementation of a standardized risk assessment tool, along with continuous monitoring and feedback mechanisms, can further enhance the effectiveness of nursing interventions. Future research should aim to validate these findings in larger, multi-center studies and explore the impact of tumor-specific or treatment-specific variables on thrombosis risk.
