Highlights • Among mothers living with HIV, interventions increased exclusive breastfeeding. • Facility-based support showed borderline effect on maternal viral suppression. • No consistent benefit observed for peer, nutritional, or remote interventions. • All studies conducted in high-burden, socioeconomically deprived settings. • Further research needed to strengthen evidence on HIV breastfeeding support. Background Breastfeeding improves infant survival, especially in low-resource settings. Although the risk of postnatal transmission is below 1% among virologically suppressed mothers living with HIV, exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rates and retention in HIV care remain suboptimal. This review evaluated the effect of non-pharmacological interventions aimed at supporting breastfeeding among people living with HIV (PLWH). Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to Jan 1, 2025, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing facility- and community-based interventions. Outcomes included any breastfeeding, EBF, maternal-infant retention, and maternal viral suppression. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB2 tool. Data were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis, and evidence certainty was rated using GRADE. The study adhered to PRISMA statements and was registered with PROSPERO, https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42025636327 Findings Eight RCTs ( n Conclusions Facility- and community-based interventions may increase EBF among PLWH. The main limitation of the included RCT was the absence of blinding. No publication bias was detected. More context-specific trials are needed to assess their impact on HIV-related outcomes.

Globally, EBF rates increased over the last decade and reached 48.6% in 2019 among the general population, which is still far from the target set by World Health Assembly goal of reaching at least 70% by 2030. Among PLWH, EBF rates are unclear, but available evidence mainly focuses on LMICs and suggests that EBF rates range from 58.1% to 88.8% [ 7 8 Since 2010, WHO has recommended that, regardless of national feeding policies, pregnant women and mothers living with HIV should receive comprehensive counseling on infant feeding options and be supported in making an informed decision [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 Methods The research question guiding this systematic review follows the PICOs framework: among PLWH (P) it investigates whether nonpharmacological interventions (I), compared to standard care or other approaches (C), improve breastfeeding practices, maternal viral suppression and retention into protocol (O), with evidence drawn from randomized controlled trials (S). This systematic review and meta-analysis adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement [ 15 https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=636327 Outcomes definition We adopted the following outcome definitions for this review (1) Maternal viral suppression Maternal and infant retention into protocol: Exclusive breastfeeding rate: Any breastfeeding rate: Data sources and literature search strategy Using a highly sensitive search strategy developed by an information specialist (detailed in Supplementary Table 1), we searched PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane library from inception to 1 January 2025 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing non-pharmacological interventions (in terms of psychosocial interventions, counseling, peer support, group meeting, health promotion, health education and viral load monitoring or similar) to support breastfeeding among mothers living with HIV. For this systematic review, no language restrictions were applied, and grey literature was not considered. However, we did not find any eligible article in languages other than English. Study selection RCTs were included if they reported on the impact of an intervention on the following outcomes among mothers with HIV: maternal viral suppression, maternal and infant retention into protocol. There were no restrictions based on follow-up time. Study selection was made by two reviewers working independently and in pairs (FDG and FVS), with a third author resolving the conflicts (NV). The title/abstract and full-text screening were made in Covidence (covidence.org). Data extraction Data extraction was conducted by two reviewers working independently and in pairs (FDG and FVS), with a third author resolving the conflicts (NV) in Covidence. The following data were extracted: (i) study data (sponsorship source, country, setting, author details, publication date, trial start and end dates), (ii) method data (design, groups details, aim of the study, length of follow-up, unit of allocation), (iii) population data (inclusion and exclusion criteria, group differences, sample size, baseline demographics and characteristics), (iv) intervention data (number of participants allocated to each group, intervention type, intervention setting, intervention details, providers, economic information, resource requirements) and (v) outcome and results data. For the purpose of this review, we used the following definitions to categorize interventions: Healthcare support Peer support: Nutritional support: Remote intervention: Any Mother and Child Health intervention: Evaluation of the risk of bias The quality of individual studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for Randomized Trials (RoB2) [ 16 Statistical analysis and data synthesis strategy The feasibility of conducting a meta-analysis was determined based on the results of the systematic review, specifically the heterogeneity of studies in terms of design, intervention types, intervention duration, methods, exposures, and outcomes. Only results from a homogeneous set of participants, intervention, control group, outcome, and study design were pooled together. Study results were pooled using random effects meta-analysis, anticipating a clinical heterogeneity. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted using the Sidik-Jonkman estimator combined with the Hartung and Knapp adjustment, since less than 10 studies were pooled. Data, according to their nature, were reported as relative risks (RRs). In case of a high heterogeneity, e.g., I 2 17 Results Literature search As shown in Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Prisma flowchart.

Standard infant feeding counselling according to the provincial guidelines 52 27 Exclusive breastfeeding rate, Maternal/infant retention into protocol EBF: exclusive breastfeeding: PMTCT: prevention of mother-to-child-transmission. When assessing healthcare support interventions, there was no clear evidence of a difference in maternal viral suppression compared with standard care (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00-1.47). This estimate was imprecise and derived from one RCTs judged to be at high risk of bias, with pooled absolute effects ranging from 0 fewer to 313 more cases of viral suppression per 1000 mothers. Similarly, for exclusive or any breastfeeding at the end of follow-up, no significant differences were observed compared with standard care. These outcomes were subject to multiple methodological concerns, including risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, resulting in a very low certainty of evidence according to the GRADE approach (see supplementary material). Maternal-infant retention into protocol also showed no significant difference between healthcare support and standard care (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.95-1.19), with the evidence again rated as low certainty due to the inclusion of trials with high risk of bias. Regarding peer support interventions, one RCT involving 145 mothers living with HIV reported no difference in any breastfeeding at the end of the intervention compared with standard care (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.78-1.28). The study was assessed as having a very serious risk of bias and serious imprecision, resulting in a very low certainty of evidence according to GRADE. Similar findings were observed at the end of follow-up. For exclusive breastfeeding, no significant differences were found either at the end of the intervention or follow-up, with the evidence again rated as very low due to the same methodological limitations. For nutritional support interventions, only one RCT reported data on exclusive breastfeeding, any breastfeeding, and maternal-infant retention. Across all four outcomes, no significant differences were observed between nutritional support and standard care. The certainty of evidence was rated as very low according to GRADE, primarily due to the high risk of bias in the included trial and the wide confidence intervals indicating serious imprecision. For remote interventions, one RCT involving 52 PLWH found no significant difference in exclusive breastfeeding compared to standard care (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.44-1.52). The certainty of evidence was rated as very low according to GRADE, primarily due to a high risk of bias and extremely serious imprecision. Overall, two RCTs reported on the effects of remote interventions on exclusive breastfeeding and maternal-infant retention at the end of follow-up. For both outcomes, no significant differences were observed compared to standard care, with very low certainty of evidence driven by serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision. Finally, all eight RCTs reported exclusive breastfeeding outcomes at the end of follow-up. When pooling data from 3481 PLWH, integrated Mother and Child Health (MCH) support was associated with higher exclusive breastfeeding rates compared to standard care (RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.06-1.80; Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 2 Forest plot of the effect of interventions versus standard care on exclusive breastfeeding among mothers living with HIV, stratified by intervention type.

Figure 3 Discussion In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the effect of non-pharmacological interventions aiming to promote breastfeeding among women living with HIV. To do this, we analyzed the effect of four intervention types – facility-based professional support, community-based peer support, nutritional support, remote support through phone or tablets – on breastfeeding, retention and viral suppression. Our findings indicate that, regardless of the specific intervention adopted, supported mothers living with HIV are more likely to engage in exclusive breastfeeding. Breastfeeding remains a fundamental component of infant nutrition and survival, particularly in LMICs, where alternative feeding options often pose significant risks due to limited access to safe and affordable alternatives, generally for the cost of them and for adequate healthcare [ 18 19 20 10 21 19 Evidence supporting this approach is robust. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that HIV-free survival rates are higher among breastfed infants of mothers receiving ART compared to those who receive formula feeding, particularly in resource-limited settings. A pooled analysis of eighteen cohort studies conducted by Chikungu and colleagues [ 22 In terms of intervention type, we found that facility-based interventions provided by experienced HCW might be effective in increasing maternal viral suppression rates. Although only one randomized controlled trial assessed the effect of healthcare-based interventions on maternal viral suppression among breastfeeding mothers living with HIV, findings suggest a potential benefit, ranging from 0 to 313 more mothers per 1,000 achieving viral suppression. In the study, conducted by Myers et al. [ 23 24 [25] [26] [27] 28 Furthermore, although inconclusive, our findings indicate that both remote interventions and community-based approaches led by peers may hold potential in enhancing exclusive breastfeeding uptake. In particular, a systematic review conducted by Mushamiri and colleagues [ 29 30 Although the search strategy was not explicitly limited to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), all included studies were conducted in high-burden, highly vulnerable settings. Mothers living with HIV in resource-constrained environments often face multiple structural and socio-economic challenges, including HIV-related stigma, gender inequalities, economic hardship, and overstretched healthcare systems. These intersecting factors collectively impact their ability to initiate and sustain exclusive breastfeeding, adhere to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and remain engaged in care [ 13 This review has several limitations. First, the included studies exhibited a high degree of clinical and methodological heterogeneity, reflecting variability in intervention design, delivery settings, outcome definitions, and follow-up durations, which limited comparability and the ability to pool data. Second, the nature of the interventions rendered blinding of participants unfeasible in most trials, introducing a high risk of performance bias. Third, the absence of a unified framework for classifying interventions hindered consistent categorization of intervention types, potentially limiting reproducibility. Third, because only eight RCTs were available, we did not run sensitivity analyses, as leave-one-out tests or meta-regression with so few studies would be under-powered and potentially misleading. To address the heterogeneity (I² = 60.4%), we instead applied the Sidik–Jonkman/Hartung–Knapp random-effects model, yielding conservative confidence intervals with small samples, and downgraded the GRADE certainty for inconsistency. Lastly, as discussed, a persistent gap in the evidence base constrains the overall certainty of findings. While some interventions showed promise in improving exclusive breastfeeding, we found very limited or no data on the effect of breastfeeding support interventions on maternal and infant HIV-related outcomes, such as maternal viral suppression, AIDS-related mortality, and disease progression. For viral suppression specifically, we found a promising trend, but it failed to be statistically significant. This underscores the critical need for more observational and randomized studies that are adequately powered, implement standardized intervention models, and evaluate integrated approaches to MCH and HIV care. Conclusions In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence supporting the implementation of community- and facility-based interventions for breastfeeding mothers living with HIV, with the aim of enhancing ART adherence, improving retention of mother–infant pairs, and optimizing breastfeeding practices. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of such interventions on HIV-related outcomes, including viral suppression and progression to AIDS in both mothers and infants.
