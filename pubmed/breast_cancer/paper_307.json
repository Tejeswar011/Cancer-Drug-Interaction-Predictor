For example, cells reintroduced into decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM) structures assume identities similar to the missing cell population ( Capella-Monsonís et al., 2023 Singelyn et al., 2012 Chen et al., 2010 Procès et al., 2024 Irimia and Toner, 2009 Petrie et al., 2009 Rolli et al., 2010 Stinson et al., 2025 Despite these insights, the microenvironment's influence on microglia function remains understudied in comparison. Microglia, the resident immune cell of the central nervous system (CNS), are responsible for maintaining CNS homeostasis by supporting synapse formation, clearing debris, and responding to inflammatory cues within the brain and spinal cord ( Brabazon et al., 2018 Kim et al., 2013 Melo et al., 2022 Parkhurst et al., 2013 Fig. 1A Soles et al., 2023 in vitro in vitro in vivo Jeong et al., 2013 Karperien et al., 2013 Vidal-Itriago et al., 2022 in vitro in vivo Sharaf et al., 2022 Sharaf et al., 2022 Iwashita et al., 2014 Lu et al., 2006 Heit and Kubes, 2003 Mori et al., 2013 Fig. 1. The brain is a confined environment. https://BioRender.com/btwt9d3 https://BioRender.com/khn4ts9 When seeking to model the physiological environment of the brain, there are many other factors to consider. Elastic, soft confining environments composed of agarose, collagen, or Matrigel have all been used to interrogate the role of the actin cytoskeleton in cellular behavior. A study performed on dendritic cells under agarose demonstrated that increased agarose stiffness resulted in decreased cell velocity and distance travelled during cell migration ( Gaertner et al., 2022 Yousafzai et al., 2024 Jain and Vogel, 2018 Paterson and Lämmermann, 2022 in vivo Therefore, we set out to examine the effects of confinement on microglia phagocytosis by directly comparing IgG phagocytosis in confined and unconfined cells, using agarose with a stiffness akin to brain parenchyma. We discovered that confinement promotes more efficient phagocytosis, an effect that is dependent upon Arp2/3 complex. In contrast, we noted that confinement continues to promote phagocytosis after inhibition of myosin II or inhibition of new filament formation via cytochalasin D treatment compared to analogous treatments on unconfined cells. These findings imply that there may be an actomyosin-independent phagocytic component that remains activated under physical confinement. We also discovered that confinement and phagocytic uptake work together to induce ‘phagocytic priming’, where cells migrate in a highly persistent fashion immediately after phagocytosis. Phagocytic priming required integrin-dependent adhesion to the ECM in confined and unconfined settings, while Arp2/3 complex and myosin II function were only required under confinement. As a whole, this work supports the idea that the molecular requirements for phagocytosis and cytoskeleton-dependent priming may be context-dependent and especially responsive to physical confinement. In addition, phagocytic priming may be crucial for supporting innate immune processes like antigen-presenting cells homing to the lymph node, enhanced surveillance of the microenvironment, or phagocytic cells responding to wounds and infection. RESULTS Confinement enhances phagocytic uptake and persistent migration Many of the molecular mechanisms pertaining to glial cell biology have been discovered and interrogated chiefly in 2D culture systems. Therefore, we designed a low-cost, accessible assay to interrogate the influence of confinement on cell motility and phagocytosis. Using a four-chamber dish, cells were either left unconfined in a well filled with media or confined under a layer of 1% agarose ( Fig. 1B Stinson et al., 2025 Heit and Kubes (2003) Fig. 1B First, we compared the ability of microglia-like BV2 cells to phagocytose unconfined in media to their phagocytic ability when confined under 1% agarose. Murine IgG was labeled with a pHrodo fluorescent tag and used to opsonize 2 µm polysphere beads. The pHrodo tag was used because it fluoresces under acidic environments, meaning that uptake by the acidic phagolysosome would result in bead fluorescence. Thus, we were able to detect complete phagocytosis in an unbiased fashion over 8-h time-lapse movies ( Fig. S1A Fig. S1B Fig. S1C,D Fig. S1D Fig. S1D Fig. S2A Fig. S2B Phagocytosis was measured at the 2-h mark, as cells after this time point became saturated with beads and stopped phagocytosing. Example images for both the media well ( Fig. 2A Fig. 2B Fig. 2C Fig. S2C + Fig. 2D-F Fig. 2. Confinement enhances phagocytosis and primes post-phagocytosis cells to migrate persistently. 2 2 N n n n P P P From the time lapse movies, it became apparent that phagocytosis altered the migratory trajectory of cells. Specifically, bead uptake seemed to induce more persistent migration tracks compared to non-phagocytic cells ( Movie 1 Fig. S3A-C Fig. 1C Fig. 2G-I Fig. 2G-I Fig. 2G-I Fig. 2G-I Fig. 2J Movie 2 Fig. 2J Fig. 2J Movie 2 The Arp2/3 complex is required for phagocytic priming and uptake We first interrogated the Arp2/3 complex, a seven-subunit branched actin nucleator responsible for generating the branched actin networks that form lamellipodial protrusions linked to environmental sensing ( Goley and Welch, 2006 Rotty et al., 2017 Tokuraku et al., 2020 We reused our four-chambered dish, and this time added the Arp2/3 complex small molecule inhibitor CK-666 or vehicle control (DMSO) into the media or the agarose gel ( Fig. S3D Fig. S3E-K Fig. S3E-H Fig. S3I-K Arp2/3 complex disruption with the small molecule inhibitor CK-666 decreased the percent of phagocytic cells in both media and confined conditions compared to vehicle ( Fig. 3A Fig. 3B Fig. 3C Fig. S3L Fig. 3C Fig. S3M Fig. 3D Movie 3 Fig. S3N,O Fig. 3. The Arp2/3 complex is required for phagocytosis and phagocytic priming in response to confinement. 2 N n n n P P The actin cytoskeleton and non-muscle myosin II facilitate phagocytic priming and uptake Previous studies examining myosin II in confined environments have demonstrated that it is needed for cell velocity but not for directional responses to either chemotactic ( Barbier et al., 2019 Stinson et al., 2025 Fig. 4A Fig. 4B Fig. 4C Fig. S4A Fig. 4. Confinement enhances phagocytic uptake and priming via actomysosin. 2 2 N n n n P P P P Contrary to our expectations, myosin II disruption decreased phagocytic priming under confinement, as evidenced by decreased post-phagocytic persistence of confined cells treated with blebbistatin ( Fig. 4D Movie 4 Fig. S4B Fig. 4D Fig. S4C Inhibition of either the Arp2/3 complex or myosin II did not fully impair phagocytosis under confinement, pointing towards another component playing a compensatory role during confined phagocytosis. We next treated cells with cytochalasin D to inhibit new actin filament formation, examining the necessity of filamentous actin (F-actin) in phagocytic uptake and priming under confinement. Cytochalasin D treatment resulted in a significant decrease in confined and unconfined phagocytosis ( Fig. 4E Fig. 4F Fig. 4G Fig. S4D Fig. S4E It was less straightforward to interrogate phagocytic priming during cytochalasin D treatment. Cytochalasin D-treated cells were dramatically less migratory, and traveled far shorter distances than DMSO-treated counterparts in unconfined and confined settings ( Fig. S4F Movie 5 Fig. 4F Fig. 4H Wu et al., 2012 Chabaud et al., 2015 Phagocytic priming, but not uptake, is dependent on ECM interaction We started by using cilengitide to inhibit αv-containing integrins. Cilengitide would be expected to impair BV2 interaction with the fibronectin substrate on the glass surface in confined and unconfined settings, as these cells express αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins ( Welser-Alves et al., 2011 Fig. 5A,B Fig. 5C Fig. S4G Fig. 5. Cell adhesion is required for confinement-induced phagocytic priming, but not uptake. 2 2 N n n n P P P However, cilengitide dramatically impacted phagocytic priming. Cilengitide-treated post-phagocytic cells were less persistent than control cells in both settings ( Fig. 5D Movie 6 Fig. S4H Fig. 5E,F Fig. S4I Fig. 5H Movie 7 Fig. S4J DISCUSSION In the present study, we report that confinement increases phagocytosis, enabling more cells to take up IgG-opsonized beads compared to their unconfined counterparts. In addition, we discovered that phagocytosis had a ‘priming’ effect on cell motility, resulting in increased cell persistence after cells underwent an initial phagocytic event. Phagocytic priming was especially pronounced under confinement. Confined phagocytosis resembled unconfined phagocytosis, except that confinement is capable of partially rescuing phenotypes seen in unconfined settings. This led us to propose a two-part process that allows phagocytes to respond to phagocytic cues under confinement. First, confinement stimulates Arp2/3 complex and myosin II to take up IgG-beads more efficiently ( Fig. 6 Fig. 6 Fig. 6. The actin cytoskeleton and cell-ECM adhesion respond to confinement and phagocytic targets to tune phagocytic uptake and priming. https://BioRender.com/rigafy4 Post-phagocytic cells under confinement consistently demonstrated persistent migration, which we term phagocytic priming. Disrupted phagocytic priming sometimes correlated with altered phagosome measurements (as with treatment with CK-666 or cytochalasin D), but other times phagosome measurements were unaffected by the lack of priming (as with treatment with blebbistatin, cilengitide, or cells plated on PEG-PLL). A study by Procès et al. found that BV2 cells activated via mechanical stretch became more directionally persistent in one-dimensional assays in PDMS microchannel devices ( Procès et al., 2024 Barbier et al., 2019 Bieling et al., 2016 Liu et al., 2015 Lomakin et al., 2020 Mueller et al., 2017 Papalazarou and Machesky, 2021 Procès et al., 2024 Procès et al., 2024 Irimia and Toner, 2009 Rolli et al., 2010 Petrie et al., 2009 The results of this study also reinforce the idea that Arp2/3's influence is context dependent. Here, we show that Arp2/3 loss impacts IgG phagocytosis in confined and unconfined settings. However, post-phagocytosis persistence is only impaired under confinement, while migration velocity is only impaired in unconfined settings. This is in line with previous studies demonstrating Arp2/3's context dependence. Directional motility is impaired in a variety of Arp2/3-deficient cell types in haptotactic ( Nicolai et al., 2020 Rotty et al., 2017 Wu et al., 2012 Davidson et al., 2018 Rotty et al., 2017 Vargas et al., 2016 Wu et al., 2012 Rotty et al., 2017 Stinson et al., 2025 in vivo IgG opsonizes foreign bodies in the context of infection and can initiate tissue inflammatory immune pathways by binding to Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) expressed on the plasma membrane ( Castro-Dopico and Clatworthy, 2019 in vivo Hampton and Chtanova, 2019 Liu et al., 2021 Hulse et al., 2008 van der Poel et al., 2020 Kellner et al., 2009 Rotty et al., 2017 in situ Paterson and Lämmermann recently discovered that macrophages manage phagocytosis via an integrin-dependent process termed haptokinesis ( Paterson and Lämmermann, 2022 Paterson and Lämmermann's The present work is consistent with the idea that integrating microenvironmental factors in a controllable fashion is key to understanding complex cellular behaviors. It reveals that an intersection of mechanical cues, adhesion cues, and phagocytic uptake together stimulate a two-part response to IgG beads, driven by differential cytoskeleton regulation. This integration of multiple microenvironmental factors is important in aligning a cell's behavior in an in vitro in vivo in vitro in vivo Asai et al., 2015 Frakes et al., 2014 Hulse et al., 2008 Kellner et al., 2009 Lee et al., 2010 Liao et al., 2012 Maezawa and Jin, 2010 van der Poel et al., 2020 MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells The murine microglia-like BV2 cell line was used for all experiments, and were received from Dr Gabriela Dveksler (Uniformed Services University). Cells were grown in complete cell culture media, containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Gibco, 31053028), 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, 10437028), 1% glutaMAX (Gibco, 35050061), and 1× antibacterial-antimycotic (Gibco, 15240062) at 37°C and 5% CO 2 Four-well chamber preparation Four-well chambers (Cellvis, C4-1.5H-N) were coated in 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Gibco, 33016015) for 1 h at 37°C. Chambers were washed three times with 1× Cell Culture Phosphate Buffered Saline (Corning, MT21040CV) (referred to from here on as PBS). Two wells were each filled with 1 ml PBS (for later replacement by complete cell culture media) and two wells were each filled with 1 ml 1% agarose. Agarose was prepared as follows: 2.5 ml of 2× Hank's balanced salt solution (Sigma, H1387-10X1L) and 5 ml of complete cell culture media (as defined above) were combined and placed in a 68°C bead bath for 1 h. 0.12 g of low gelling temperature agarose (Sigma, A9045-5G) was added to 2.5 ml of sterile water (Corning, 25-055-CV) and heated in a microwave until fully dissolved. The two solutions were combined to create a warm 1% agarose mixture. 1 ml of the mixture was poured into each well and allowed to solidify for 90 min at room temperature. Chambers were wrapped in parafilm and stored at 4°C for up to 1 month. Phagocytosis bead preparation 100 µg of Normal Mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich, 12-371) was pHrodo labeled using the pHrodo™ iFL Red Microscale Protein Labeling Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, P36014 Cell preparation Agarose wells had two punches placed in each for cell and bead insertion using a 0.75 mm biopsy punch tool (LabTech, 52-004908). Unconfined media wells had PBS replaced with complete cell culture media in preparation for cell seeding. Confluent cell culture dishes were treated according to the standard passaging protocol (above). For cell migration experiments, 13,000 cells were added to each media well. For phagocytosis, 18,000 cells were added to each media well. Lower numbers were used for migration experiments to minimize cell–cell interactions and allow more room for uninterrupted random migration. For both types of experiments in the confined condition, 15,000 cells were inserted under the agarose in each punched location using a gel-loading pipette tip. If the volume of media containing 15,000 cells exceeded 15 µl, the cells were spun down at 1000× g Phagocytosis microscope assay Upon completing the 3-h incubation, IgG beads were added to wells. Media wells received 5 µl of beads. For confined wells, a 1:4 dilution of the beads was made with PBS and inserted into each punch in the agarose to match bead density with the media condition. Chambers were then placed in a Tokai Hit INU incubation system controller on the Olympus IX83 and maintained at 37°C, 90% humidity, and 5% CO 2 Analyzing bead density Each phagocytosis file was opened in Fiji ImageJ. A bandpass filter was then run on the relief contrast channel. Structures were filtered to fit between 5 and 15 pixels and then threshold filtered until only the beads were highlighted in red. The analyze particles function was used to count bead density. Area threshold was set to 10-30 micron 2 2 Analyzing phagocytic rate Each phagocytosis file was opened in FIJI ImageJ. Channel colors were corrected and brightness/contrast adjusted to create the same brightness and contrast parameters for each file. Using the cell counter plugin, the total number of fluorescent and non-fluorescent cells was counted at each measured time point throughout the phagocytosis videos. Comparisons between treatment groups at individual time points as well as comparing changes over time within each group were conducted with GraphPad Prism. Graphs were normalized to T=0. Fluorescent cells at the beginning of the videos were removed from the count of both fluorescent cells and total cells per field of view. Data comparisons were broken up by bead density, only comparing media and confined fields in the low bead density category to each other. Blebbistatin auto-fluoresces under fluorescent imaging. Visual inspection of phagocytic cells ensured that counted fluorescent internalized pHrodo-IgG and not blebbistatin. Analyzing phagosome size Each phagocytosis file was opened in CellSens Dimension software under the Count and Measure plugin. Under detection options, minimum object size was set to 5 pixels. Under the Thresholding tab, the adaptive threshold was selected. Selecting the DsRed channel, the maximum was set to 65,000 (the maximum) and the minimum was changed for each image to label only internalized beads, although never going below 1000. Selecting the relief contrast channel, the maximum was set to 2 and the minimum to 1 so that only fluorescent labels were detected. Outputs of total number of phagosomes and their average size per field of view were then verified at each timepoint before the data was exported to an excel file. This data was presented three ways. The average size of phagosome was reported by dividing the average size per field of view at 2 h by the total number of phagosomes detected at 2 h. Average size of phagosome per phagocytic cells was reported by dividing the average size per field of view by the number of phagocytic cells at that timepoint. The average number of phagosomes per phagocytic cell was reported by dividing the total number of phagosomes at 2 h by the number of phagocytic cells at that timepoint. Average size of phagosome and average size of phagosome per phagocytic cell differ as the former examines whether beads are trafficked into the same or different lysosomes and the latter examines if more beads overall are being trafficked in each treatment condition. Analyzing motility Each motility file was opened in FIJI ImageJ. The Manual Tracking plugin was used to track 10 cells per field of view, using the base of each cell's forward-most protrusion, and data was combined across all fields of view within treatment groups. Cell tracking was stopped if a cell divided or ran into another cell, resulting in a changed direction. To obtain post-phagocytosis motility measurements, tracks were obtained only after a cell phagocytosed at least one pHrodo-IgG bead. In the case of cytochalasin D trials, there were far fewer cells taking up beads in the presence of drug. Thus, not as many cells in these trials fit the inclusion criteria, thereby accounting for the smaller number of cells analyzed for motility in this condition. The resulting measurements were uploaded into the Ibidi Chemotaxis and Migration Tool ImageJ plugin to measure velocity, accumulated distance, and persistence. Persistence (also termed D/t) is a measure of the straight-line distance between a cell's starting and ending position on a track (D) divided by its overall track length (t). Thus, a value very close to zero (high t, low D) is understood to be meandering much more than a cell moving along the shortest distance between its start and end (d=T), which has a value of 1. The closer the value to 1, the more persistent the migration is. These data tables were exported to GraphPad Prism to graph differences in velocity, distance, and persistence between treatment groups. Different agarose concentrations Four-well chamber dishes were coated with fibronectin, as described above. These chambered dishes were made to contain one well of PBS, one well of 1% agarose, one well of 2.5% agarose, and one well of 5% agarose. 1% agarose was prepared as stated above. For both the 2.5% and the 5% agarose concentrations, only the amount of agarose added to the sterile water differed in the protocol. 2.5% agarose was prepared using 0.3 g of agarose in 2.5 ml of sterile water and 5% agarose was prepared using 0.6 g of agarose in 2.5 ml of sterile water. Chambers were wrapped in parafilm and stored at 4°C for up to 1 month. Microscope setup for motility assay Upon completing the 3-h incubation, chambers were placed in an environmental chamber on a Tokai Hit INU incubation system controller on the Olympus IX83 and maintained at 37°C, 90% humidity, and 5% CO 2 Inhibitor-containing agarose CK-666 (abcam, ab141231), Blebbistatin (ThermoFisher Scientific, NC0664123), and Cytochalasin D (ThermoFisher, PHZ1063) were resuspended in anhydrous DMSO (ThermoFisher Scientific, D12345 Inhibitor phagocytosis and motility runs Cells were prepared as previously described. Media wells contained either vehicle or drug at the same concentration present in the agarose. Cells were seeded as previously described and plates run on Olympus IX83 as previously detailed. Quantification of unconfined and confined cell height Four-chamber well dishes were created as previously described, with the addition of Cascade Blue-labeled 3000 M.W. dextran (ThermoFisher Scientific, D7132) at 10 µg/ml to the agarose prior to pouring. Cascade Blue dextran was also added to the media for unconfined cells (at 5 µg/ml) prior to imaging, and beads were added to the agarose well 2 h prior to imaging. A Nikon inverted spinning disk confocal microscope outfitted with an EMCCD camera (Yokogawa) and 60× Plan Apo 1.4 NA oil objective was used to image the BV2 cells. NIS-Elements software controlled the microscope during image acquisition. Z-sections were taken at 0.3-micron intervals for a total of 26 µm per image. Fiji ImageJ was used to count the number of Z-sections in each cell and to construct the side projections of cells. Cell heights were calculated by multiplying the number of steps required to encompass the cell by the step size (0.3 µm). Despite the cells being unlabeled, due to our BV2 cells not tolerating tracker dye well, cell edges could be clearly defined and differentiated from the dextran in both the media and agarose. Statistical analysis The Kruskal–Wallis with Dunn multiple comparisons test was used to assess significance in experiments where a normal distribution of the dataset could not be assumed. When only two experimental conditions were tested, we used Mann–Whitney tests when we could not assume normality.
