The association\nof ZnONPs and PPy is a strategic step to enhance\nthe antibacterial properties of the nanoparticles.

The assay was conducted\nunder sunlight (A, B) and dark (C, D) exposure conditions, allowing\ncomparison of the effects of different experimental conditions on\nantimicrobial activity against S. aureus E. coli The pure polypyrrole samples showed moderate antibacterial\nactivity,\nwith variable efficacy for E. coli S. aureus E. coli 6 1 S. aureus As expected,\nthe antibacterial action of pure polypyrrole was not\ninfluenced by light since there was no significant variation in the\nnumber of viable colonies by comparison of systems under exposure\nto solar radiation and the dark environment. On the other hand, the\nZnONPs@PPy composite demonstrated superior antibacterial performance\ncompared to pure ZnONPs and pure polypyrrole. For E.\ncoli S. aureus The kinetic tests reinforce\nthat exposure to light enhances the\nantibacterial activity of ZnONPs@PPy against S. aureus E. coli  Combining the antimicrobial mechanisms\nof polypyrrole and ZnONPs\nexplains the superior efficacy of the ZnONPs@PPy composite. While\nPPy destabilizes the cell membrane through electrostatic interactions,\nZn 2+  The superior performance observed for samples excited with\nthe\nsunlight can be explained as follows: with the reduction in the bandgap\nof the composite, the photoinduced process is favored, with ZnO absorbing\nUV light and generating electron–hole pairs (e – + 2 – + Figure S5 2 2 E. coli Antibacterial Assays with Modified Textiles To evaluate\nthe efficiency of impregnated textiles with composites against bacteria,\nagar diffusion tests were performed using cotton fabric discs impregnated\nwith ZnONPs, PPy, ZnONPs@PPy, and control discs (fabrics without adding\nantimicrobial agents). Each test was conducted in triplicate against\nthe pathogenic bacteria S. aureus E. coli For tests with impregnated fabrics,\nthe concentration of ZnONPs had to be increased 10-fold due to absorption\nby the fibers. Thus, a 20 mg/mL concentration was established for\nthe experiments involving textiles impregnated with ZnONPs. The inhibition zone diameters showed higher efficacy for PPy-based\nand ZnONPs@PPy-modified fabrics than ZnONPs-impregnated fabrics, as\nshown in Figure E. coli Figure S. aureus Figure Figure S6 S. aureus E. coli 8 (A) Photo of\nthe inhibition zones obtained for cotton fabric samples\nimpregnated with ZnONPs, PPy, and ZnONPs@PPy, compared to the negative\ncontrol against S. aureus S. aureus E. coli E. coli Previous work by the authors’ team – Rumex nervosus S. aureus E. coli The qualitative evaluation of the antibacterial activity\nof the\nnanomaterial-impregnated fabrics (cleaning prototypes) was performed\nusing a surface disinfection test on sterilized stainless-steel plates\n(5 × 5 cm). The results in Figure S7 S. aureus E. coli These findings indicate that ZnONPs@PPy composite enhances antimicrobial\nactivity, resulting in a highly effective material for surface decontamination.\nThe superior performance of ZnONPs@PPy suggests its applicability\nin self-decontaminating fabrics and other antimicrobial surfaces,\nmaking it a promising alternative for preventing the spread of pathogens. The antibiofilm activity assays were also\nevaluated for modified\ntextiles. The results demonstrated high antibiofilm activity for both\nthe fabric with PPy and the fabric with the ZnONPs@PPy composite,\nwith both showing 99.99% efficacy in inhibiting S.\naureus E. coli Figure Figure S8 in vitro E. coli 9 (A) Results\nfor inhibition of biofilm formation of S. aureus E. coli On the other hand, the samples containing ZnONPs\nshowed variations\nin the levels of inhibition of biofilm formation. For S. aureus Figure E. coli Figure Figure S9 S. aureus Figure S10A E. coli  Figures S9B–D and S10B–D S. aureus E. coli The zeta potential values obtained\nfor the polypyrrole (PPy), ZnONPs@PPy\ncomposite, and pure ZnONPs samples provide crucial information about\nthe materials’ surface interactions with bacterial cells and\ninsights into mechanisms for antibacterial activity. Polypyrrole presented\na zeta potential of (+35.2 ± 1.0) mV, while the ZnONPs@PPy composite\npresented a value of (+30.8 ± 1.4) mV, and pure ZnONPs, in turn,\nhad a negative value of (−11.6 ± 1.9) mV. Although\nthe presence of ZnONPs slightly reduced the positive charge\nof the ZnONPs@PPy composite (+30.8 ± 1.4 mV), the antimicrobial\nactivity was enhanced since it remained positive (ζ > 30\nmV).\nThe antibacterial mechanisms of ZnONPs are incorporated to those of\npolypyrrole, providing a synergistic effect. The composite’s\nhigh electrostatic force facilitates the rupture of the bacterial\ncell membrane, promoting the destruction of anionic lipids. Table S3 Furthermore, the results obtained by UV–vis absorbance spectrum\nrevealed the reduction of the band gap of ZnONPs from 2.97 to 2.88\neV in the ZnONPs@PPy composite, indicating a clear improvement in\nthe photocatalytic potential compared to pure ZnONPs. As reported\nin the literature, ZnO has a high UV light absorption capacity and\nexhibits strong photoconductivity due to the generation of highly\nreactive oxygen species (O 2 – 2 2– Conclusions This study evaluated the efficiency of S. joazeiro Materials and Methods The experiments were carried\nout using zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn­(CH 3 2 2 2 S. joazeiro Preparation of Aqueous\nExtract of S. joazeiro Plant leaves were collected in Campus III of the\nBahia State University (UNEB), Juazeiro, Bahia, Brazil. To ensure\nbotanical authenticity, a voucher specimen was collected, herborized,\nand deposited in the Northeastern Sertão Reference Herbarium\n(HRSN), from the São Francisco Valley Biodiversity Center at\nFederal University of São Francisco Valley (CEBIVE/UNIVASF),\nunder registry number HRSN 25443. The species was confirmed as Sarcomphalus joazeiro The\naqueous\nextract of S. joazeiro  Green Synthesis of ZnO Nanoparticles (ZnONPs) The biosynthesis\nof zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) was carried out based on the\nmethod described by Selim et al. 3 2 2 3 2 2 2 As a first step, 2.5 mg of the lyophilized extract\nwas dissolved in 25 mL of ultrapure water, resulting in a final concentration\nof 0.1 mg/mL. The solution was heated on a magnetic stirrer at 60\n°C. After stabilizing at 60 °C, 2.5 g of zinc acetate\ndihydrate\nwas gradually added to the solution under intense stirring. The solution\nwas kept under the same conditions for 1 h until the color changed\nto light yellow, indicating the progress of the reaction. Purifying\nthe resulting paste involved multiple washes with distilled\nwater and anhydrous ethyl alcohol (3:1). Each wash cycle was followed\nby centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 10 min to remove impurities. This\nprocedure was repeated until the washing solution became clear. As a final step, the sample was calcined in a muffle furnace with\ncontrolled heating at a 5 °C/min rate until it reached 400 °C.\nThe temperature was maintained for 2 h, forming white ZnONPs powder. Synthesis of PPy and ZnONPs@PPy Composites For the\nsynthesis of PPy, 35 μL of pyrrole was added to 25 mL of 1.0\nM hydrochloric acid (HCl) aqueous solution, followed by stirring for\n5 min for complete homogenization. A second solution containing the\noxidizing agent was prepared by dissolving 0.082 g of ferric chloride\n(FeCl 3 The composite of ZnONPs@PPy was prepared with an additional\nstep, involving the addition of 50 mg of ZnONPs dispersion into the\nmonomer solution. All of the steps remain the same, as previously\ndescribed in the polymerization of PPy, allowing chemical polymerization\nby coating ZnO nanoparticles with PPy. Synthesis of PPy and ZnONPs@PPy\nComposites on Cotton Fibers\nand the Impregnation of ZnONPs into Cotton Fibers Cleaned\ncotton fabric (5 cm × 5 cm) was immersed in the solution containing\npyrrole, which was kept under stirring to provide the homogeneous\nimpregnation of monomers into the cotton fibers. The following polymerization\noccurs according to previously reported steps. The impregnation favored\nby the adsorption of species into cotton fibers makes possible the\ndirect polymerization of polypyrrole on cotton fibers that progressively\nacquire a dark aspect. Incorporating ZnONPs@PPy composites on cotton\nfibers follows the same steps as preparing the composite, with the\ncotton fiber immersed in the mixture of monomers and ZnONPs (50 mg). The direct impregnation of ZnONPs into cotton fabrics was conducted\nas follows: previously washed and dried fabrics were immersed in a\nsolution containing 20 mg/mL of ZnONPs. The system was immersed in\nan ultrasonic bath for 30 min, providing a uniform dispersion of the\nnanoparticles and their efficient adhesion to the fibers. After\nthis step, the fabrics were removed from the solution and\ndried at room temperature, preserving the cotton’s structural\nproperties. The resulting material was stored under appropriate conditions\nfor subsequent characterization and evaluation of its antibacterial\nproperties. Characterization Techniques The\nabsorption spectra\nof zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs), polypyrrole (PPy), and zinc\noxide nanoparticles coated by PPy (ZnONPs@PPy) were measured using\na Hach DR500 UV–vis spectrophotometer in the range of 200 to\n800 nm, with a step of 1 nm. The data obtained were treated according\nto the Tauc method. Preparation of Standards\nfor HPLC/DAD Analysis Standard\nsolutions for the seven investigated phenolic acids and flavonoids\n(Sigma-Aldrich) were prepared: caffeic acid, p-coumaric acid, ferulic\nacid, cinnamic acid, naringenin, pinocembrin, and apigenin. The solutions\nwere prepared by dissolving the standards in HPLC-grade methanol (Agilent\nTechnologies, Germany) to produce 1000 ppm stock solutions, which\nwere then used to prepare concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 ppm.\nThe absorbance of the 20 ppm standards of each phenolic acid and flavonoid\nwas measured at wavelengths 190 to 400 nm to find the optimal wavelength\nfor HPLC-DAD measurements.

The objective was to adjust\nthe cell concentration to values previously established as equivalent\nto 1.5 × 10 8 –1 The broth microdilution test was carried out according\nto the guidelines\nof (CLSI, 2019) to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration\n(MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of ZnONPs, PPy,\nand ZnONPs@PPy aqueous dispersion, in which a predetermined content\nof sample was sonicated for 30 min. In a 96-well microplate, 100 μL\nof sterile TSB broth and 100 μL of the solutions under study\nwere added, followed by serial dilutions. Ten μL of bacterial\nsuspensions (1.5 × 10 5 –1 For agar diffusion assays, 5 mm diameter cotton disks were used.\nThese disks were previously impregnated with zinc oxide nanoparticles\n(ZnONPs), polypyrrole (PPy), and polypyrrole with zinc oxide nanoparticles\n(ZnONPs@PPy). Bacterial suspensions of E. coli S. aureus 8 –1 The kinetics of the death time curve was determined by evaluating\nthe interaction of bacterial suspensions of E. coli S. aureus 6 –1 The surface disinfection\ntest used sterilized square stainless-steel\nplates (5 × 5 cm). The surfaces of the plates were rubbed with\n100 μL aliquots of bacterial suspensions containing 1.5 ×\n10 8 –1 The inhibition of biofilm formation was investigated\nusing S. aureus E. coli 5 –1 For the treatments,\ncotton fabric samples (5 cm × 5 cm) previously\nimpregnated with zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs), polypyrrole (PPy),\nor (ZnONPs@PPy) were used. The samples were added to test tubes containing\nthe corresponding bacterial suspensions and divided into two experimental\ngroups: one group was exposed to sunlight for 60 min before incubation,\nand the other was kept in the dark. In parallel, controls containing\n10 mL of TSB, bacteria, and cotton fabric without the addition of\nantibacterial agents were prepared, both in light and dark conditions.\nAfter preparation, all tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. After incubation, the contents of all tubes were discarded, and\nthe tissue samples were transferred to sterile tubes. The tissues\nwere washed thrice with 10 mL of sterile distilled water, with the\nliquid discarded after each wash. Subsequently, the tubes with the\ntissues were left to dry at room temperature for 5 min and inverted\non paper towels. Then, 10 mL of saline solution was added to\nthe tubes. Then, the\ntubes were sonicated in an ultrasonic bath at 40 kHz for 15 min to\nremove the cells adhered to the walls of the tubes and tissue samples.\nAfter sonication, the bacterial suspension was diluted to 1:100 in\na saline solution. Aliquots of 100 μL of the resulting suspension\nwere collected in triplicate from each system and plated on tryptic\nsoy agar (TSA). After plating, the plates were incubated at 37 °C\nfor 24 h. At the end of the incubation, bacterial growth was assessed\nby directly examining the colonies formed after resuspension of the\nviable biofilm cells. The quantification of cultivable biofilm\ncells was calculated from\nthe antibacterial rate: antibacterial activity ( % ) = N control − N sample N control × 100 % 3  N control N sample Nitroblue Tetrazolium (NBT) Reduction Assay\nfor Reactive Oxygen\nSpecies (ROS) Assessment The potential for reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS) generation was assessed by the nitroblue tetrazolium\n(NBT) reduction assay. The culture medium was prepared with 4% (w/v)\nagar, sterilized by autoclaving, cooled, and supplemented with 0.1%\n(w/v) NBT in a 1:1 (v/v) ratio. The mixture was poured into 12-well\nplates, allowed to solidify, and then drilled to create 5 mm-diameter\nwells. A suspension of E. coli 7 The suspensions were\npreincubated for 20 min. Then, 100 μL of each mixture was added\nto the wells. The negative control consisted of a mixture of saline\nsolution (0.85%) and bacterial suspension (1:1, v/v), and a second\ncontrol contained saline solution supplemented with PPy at 4x MBC.\nThe positive control consisted of a hydrogen peroxide solution (1.5%).\nROS generation was inferred by formazan formation, evidenced by purple\nhalos around the wells, with the intensity and diameter used as indicators\nof sample activity.
