Introduction The tumor size in lung cancer determines the prognosis. At a size of 10 mm (T1b), the probability of five-year survival decreases from 92% to 84% [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 In previous experimental studies, we developed a method to completely visualize the lung via sonography. By filling one lung wing with isotonic saline (called one-lung flooding, OLF), the air content is replaced with fluid. With OLF, we have developed a technique for the percutaneous, transpleural sonographic detection and nodule punction of very small pulmonary nodules located deep in the parenchyma [ 11 2. Materials and Methods We report on two patients who had indeterminate small pulmonary nodules with a moderate to high probability of malignancy according to the Mayo model [ 12 We thoroughly informed the patients about the new experimental method, which had not yet been used in humans. The patients agreed and provided written informed consent. In the case of non-diagnosed USgTTcNB, the patients also gave informed consent for a surgical biopsy, which would need to be performed in the same session. Each patient received body plethysmography with diffusing capacity, echocardiography, flexible bronchoscopy, and chest computer tomography (CT). The patients were anesthetized and intubated with a left-sided double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT), followed by total intravenous anesthesia and pressure-controlled ventilation of both lungs. A cuff controller (VBM Medizintechnik GmbH, Sulz a.N., Germany) was used to maintain a constant pressure of 50 cm H 2 Supplementary Figure S1 After the right lung could be imaged with ultrasound (bk5000; bK medical GmbH, Quickborn, Germany), the patient was placed in supine position. To avoid dislocation of the DLT during this position change, the action was monitored via fiberbronchoscopy. After the pulmonary nodule was located, a biopsy needle was inserted under sonographic guidance, and a core biopsy was performed. The specimen was examined via the frozen section procedure. After that, the patients were placed in trendelenburg position to improve passive flow of the fluid through the opened right tubus leg. At the end of this drainage process, the tubus leg was connected to the ventilator, and both lungs were ventilated. After sufficient spontaneous breathing with an tcSO 2 The patients gave informed consent that in the case of malignancy, the tumor would be resected in the same session via videothoracoscopy or thoracotomy. In the case of a benign diagnosis, the patient would be extubated. A complete description of the method can be found in Supplementary File S1 3. Results 3.1. Case 1 A 65-year-old man presented to our lung cancer center for further evaluation of a solitary pulmonary nodule in the middle lobe, growing from 5 to 10 mm in size in two years ( Supplementary Figure S2A ® ® Supplementary Figure S2B 3.2. Case 2 Our second case was a 61-year-old patient suffering from a breast carcinoma on the right side. Twelve years ago, she received an operation and radio-chemotherapy due to a breast carcinoma on the left side. During staging, a chest CT-scan demonstrated a small pulmonary nodule about 5 mm in size in the middle lobe, which was new compared with a follow-up CT 6 months ago and suspected to be metastasis ( Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 ® ® Figure 1 Figure 1 Supplementary Figure S3 Figure 2 In both patients, hemodynamics and gas exchange were not affected during and after the procedure ( Table 1 4. Discussion This work provides the first experiences with USgTTcNB of small pulmonary nodules under OLF. Using OLF, very small lung lesions could be localized with ultrasound deep in the lung parenchyma. In both cases, USgTTcNB was able to confirm the diagnoses for both a malignant and a benign nodule with one-time puncture. USgTTcNB could reduce the false-negative rate of benign, non-specific biopsies, which is currently between 7% and 29% [ 13 OLF comprises a one-time filling with saline and is not comparable with lung lavage, in which intra-alveolar proteins are flushed out through numerous cycles of in- and outflow. Both of our patients had normal and stable hemodynamic values during and after the procedure. In case two, the intervention under OLF did not result in any deterioration in selected lung function values after the intervention. OLF not only enables USgTTcNB for histological confirmation but also could be suitable for the application of focused ultrasound for tumor ablation during the same session. Furthermore, an ultrasound-guided transbronchial biopsy under OLF is conceivable. However, the following limitation should be considered: The feasibility and safety of USgTTcNB were shown on only two patients with normal lung function. Therefore, a larger cohort study should be performed, in particular in patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, USgTTcNB under OLF is feasible and enables a histological confirmation of small pulmonary nodules via the frozen section procedure. By confirming a benign diagnosis, futile operations can be avoided. However, a larger study is needed to verify the diagnostic yield and safety of the procedure.
