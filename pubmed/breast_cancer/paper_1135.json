We evaluated the impact of pharmacological B12 and G-CSF, alone or in combination with cisplatin, on hormone receptor-positive (MCF-7) and triple-negative (MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells, conducting in vitro assays of cell viability, cytotoxicity, caspase activation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytolytic protein expression. Neither B12 nor G-CSF alone induced cytotoxicity; instead, both promoted proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. When combined with cisplatin, they consistently attenuated drug-induced cytotoxicity, suppressed caspase-3/-8/-9 activation, preserved mitochondrial integrity, and reduced perforin/granzyme expression, exhibiting stronger effects in MCF-7 cells. G-CSF markedly increased proliferation (>130% at 50 ng/mL), while B12 modestly enhanced viability and mitigated cisplatin-induced damage, particularly in triple-negative cells. These findings indicate that B12 and G-CSF can impair cisplatin efficacy by blunting apoptotic signaling and mitochondrial injury in different breast cancer subtypes. These preclinical findings warrant prospective, biomarker-driven in vivo and clinical studies to delineate the clinical contexts in which B12 and G-CSF can be safely integrated into supportive care without compromising antitumor efficacy. breast cancer cisplatin resistance vitamin B12 G-CSF the Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Gazi University TCD-2022-7970 This study was supported by the Scientific Research Projects Coordination Unit of Gazi University (BAP, Project Code: TCD-2022-7970). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Tumor cells have an increased demand for vitamin B12 (cobalamin, B12) because of their rapid proliferation and dependence on DNA synthesis and methylation pathways [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 This overexpression may contribute to the elevated serum B12 levels observed in patients with solid tumors such as breast, lung, and colorectal cancers—even in the absence of exogenous supplementation. These findings suggest that tumor-derived TCN overexpression may drive circulating B12 elevation and potentially enhance tumor progression [ 7 8 9 10 11 4 5 12 Breast cancer represents a heterogeneous group of diseases encompassing multiple molecular subtypes, each with distinct biological characteristics and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer, modeled using the MCF-7 cell line, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), modeled using MDA-MB-231 cells, are among the most studied subtypes. While HR+ tumors typically respond well to endocrine therapies, TNBC lacks estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression and is characterized by a more aggressive clinical course with limited targeted treatment options. Systemic chemotherapy remains a cornerstone of therapy for both subtypes, and platinum-based agents such as cisplatin are frequently employed in TNBC and occasionally investigated in HR+ [ 13 G-CSF is commonly used in oncology to prevent or manage chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that some tumors, including TNBC, may endogenously produce G-CSF, which may further modulate tumor behavior. Notably, the MDA-MB-231 cell line has been shown to express higher G-CSF levels compared to non-invasive breast cancer lines such as T47D and MCF-7. Elevated G-CSF expression has been linked to increased cancer cell migration and invasiveness [ 14 15 In this study, we aimed to explore the potential effects of B12 and G-CSF on breast cancer cell proliferation and response to chemotherapy. Using the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines, we investigated whether exposure to these agents modulates cellular viability and the apoptotic response to cisplatin. Our objective was to determine whether commonly used supportive care agents may interfere with the efficacy of chemotherapy in biologically distinct breast cancer subtypes and to provide mechanistic insights into their potential contribution to therapeutic resistance. 2. Results 2.1. Assessment of How Single Doses of Vitamin B12, G-CSF, and Cisplatin Affect Cell Viability The effects of B12, G-CSF, and cisplatin on the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were assessed by MTT after 24, 48, and 72 h of treatment with increasing doses of single agents ( Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 1 Figure 2 In MCF-7 cells, treatment with G-CSF (0.001–50 µg/mL) resulted in a significant dose- and time-dependent increase in viability ( Figure 1 Figure 2 Cisplatin treatment significantly decreased the viability of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner ( Figure 1 Figure 2 p p p p 2.2. Effect of Dual and Triple Combinations of Cisplatin with Vitamin B12 and G-CSF on Cell Viability The impact of dual and triple combinations of cisplatin with B12 and/or G-CSF on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell viability was evaluated across cisplatin concentrations of 20, 40, and 80 µM ( Figure 3 Figure 3 Figure 3 Although not all comparisons reached statistical significance, the overall trend indicated that B12 and G-CSF—either individually or in combination—consistently mitigated cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity. These findings support the hypothesis that such supportive agents may inadvertently promote tumor cell survival and potentially compromise the therapeutic efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy, particularly in tumor subtypes with intact apoptotic pathways. 2.3. Cytotoxic Effects of Cisplatin and Its Combinations with Vitamin B12 and G-CSF Cytotoxicity was quantified by LDH release in the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells ( Figure 4 2.4. Effects of Vitamin B12 and G-CSF on Cisplatin-Induced Caspase Activation Caspase activity was quantified using a fluorometric multiplex caspase activity assay. Treatment with cisplatin (40 µM) alone markedly increased the activity of both initiator caspases (caspase-8 and caspase-9) and the executioner caspase (caspase-3) ( Figure 5 2.5. Effects of Vitamin B12 and G-CSF on Cisplatin-Induced Loss of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss was evaluated using the TMRE (tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester) assay ( Figure 6 2.6. Effects of Vitamin B12 and G-CSF on Cisplatin-Induced Perforin and Granzyme Expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 Cells A Western blot assay was performed to assess the effects of cisplatin, B12, and G-CSF on perforin, granzyme A, and granzyme B expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells ( Figure 7 Figure 5 Figure 6 p p 2.7. Combination Index Analysis To further explore drug–drug interactions, MTT data were analyzed using the Chou–Talalay method ( Figure 8 3. Discussion Our in vitro findings demonstrate that B12 and G-CSF promote proliferation and enhance viability in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. Neither agent alone induced cytotoxicity; however, they significantly reduced cisplatin-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity when co-administered. This protective effect was most pronounced in MCF-7 cells, where B12 or G-CSF preserved mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased activation of caspases-3, -8, and -9, suggesting inhibition of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. A similar, though slightly less marked, effect was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells. The stronger cytoprotective response in MCF-7 cells may be attributable to the presence of estrogen receptor signaling and wild-type p53, 16 17 p53 p53 Collectively, these findings suggest that B12 and G-CSF may impair the pro-apoptotic efficacy of cisplatin across distinct molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Notably, this raises important translational concerns regarding the use of supportive care agents during cytotoxic chemotherapy, particularly in the case of aggressive or apoptosis-reliant tumors. Our Chou–Talalay analysis further confirmed that the protective effects of B12 and G-CSF translated into predominantly antagonistic interaction profiles with cisplatin, particularly in the MDA-MB-231 line, while synergy was observed only under limited conditions in the MCF-7 line. From a clinical perspective, multiple population-based and integrative reviews report that supraphysiologic or persistently elevated plasma B12 is associated with a higher short-term incidence of newly diagnosed cancer and with increased mortality, although concerns regarding reverse causality and confounding (e.g., liver disease, occult malignancy) remain; these data argue against unnecessary supplementation in oncology unless deficiency is documented [ 5 11 18 Although we did not experimentally examine downstream signaling pathways in our models, prior preclinical and translational studies indicate that G-CSF can activate pro-survival signaling pathways (STAT3 and PI3K/AKT), induce the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), and expand myeloid-derived suppressor cells, thereby fostering an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment [ 19 20 21 Clinical observations have associated certain supplementation practices—including B vitamin supplementation—with poorer chemotherapy outcomes in some cohorts. Emerging preclinical and translational evidence suggests that G-CSF can promote tumor progression and treatment resistance in defined contexts [ 14 22 23 Several preclinical studies have investigated the complex relationship between B12 exposure and cancer biology, though the evidence remains inconclusive. Large observational and clinical datasets have generally not shown a consistent association between elevated circulating B12 and cancer progression across tumor types, with liver cancer representing a notable exception—likely due to the liver’s central role in B12 metabolism and storage [ 23 24 25 Prior reports indicate that depriving cells of cobalamin disrupts DNA synthesis and curtails proliferation, nominating B12 pathways as potential therapeutic targets in select cancers [ 2 3 26 5 TNBC, especially its basal-like subtypes, displays high genomic instability due to deficiencies in DNA repair mechanisms, notably homologous recombination. This inherent vulnerability is thought to underlie the increased sensitivity of TNBC cells to DNA-damaging agents, including platinum-based chemotherapies [ 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 34 36 37 CD320/TCblR 3 4 10 2 26 A major additional finding is that G-CSF promotes proliferation and reduces cisplatin sensitivity in TNBC cells. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 50 ng/mL G-CSF for 48 h increased viability by >130% compared to untreated controls. The effect was time- and dose-dependent, peaking at 48–72 h. In cisplatin-treated groups, G-CSF reduced LDH release by ~40% and suppressed caspase activation while restoring mitochondrial membrane potential. These data indicate that G-CSF interferes with both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. Interestingly, co-administration of B12 and G-CSF suppressed cisplatin-induced upregulation of cytotoxic effectors such as perforin and granzymes A/B, raising the possibility that these agents may interfere with immunogenic cell death, which warrants validation in immunocompetent models [ 38 Although G-CSF is widely used to manage chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, growing evidence suggests that it has pro-tumorigenic effects. Tumor-derived or elevated G-CSF has been described in several solid tumors and has been associated with aggressive clinical behavior [ 14 19 39 CSF3R 40 41 42 43 44 45 CSF3R CSF3R CSF3R In vivo, G-CSF can expand myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and skew macrophage polarization toward pro-tumorigenic phenotypes, creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment [ 19 41 19 39 40 46 Several limitations of our study must be acknowledged. First, our experiments were performed in vitro without immune cells, precluding the assessment of systemic immunologic effects such as leukocytosis or potential changes in circulating B12. Therefore, future studies in immunocompetent in vivo models are warranted to validate these findings and to better delineate the interactions of B12 and G-CSF with chemotherapy within the tumor immune microenvironment. Second, a subset of the concentrations explored—specifically 500 µM B12 and 50 µg/mL G-CSF—exceed clinically observed plasma levels; these exposures should be regarded as suprapharmacological and exploratory, and their translational relevance should be interpreted with caution. Third, the BRCA1/2 CSF3R TCN2 Nevertheless, our study highlights that agents typically considered benign or beneficial in supportive care—such as G-CSF and B12—may exert pro-survival effects on tumor cells under certain molecular conditions. Importantly, these effects were observed across distinct molecular subtypes of breast cancer, suggesting a broader relevance. These findings underscore the need for caution when administering supportive agents during cytotoxic therapy and call for further preclinical and clinical studies to determine the safety and implications of their use in oncology. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Chemicals and Reagents Vitamin B12 (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; Cas No: 68-19-9), G-CSF (G-CSF; Sigma Aldrich; G0407), cisplatin (Merck, St. Louis, MO, USA; Cas No: 15663-27-1), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Merck; Cas No: 298-93-1), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma Aldrich; Cas No: 67-68-5) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Merck (St. Louis, MO, USA). B12 was applied at concentrations ranging from 0.0005 to 500 µM [ 26 46 32 47 The breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 ( p53 p53 p53 p53 4.2. Cell Culture The human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin and maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO 2 4 6 4.3. Cell Viability Assessment The MTT test was used to assess changes in cell viability in the groups following 24, 48, and 72 h of both single and combined drug treatments. The assay was performed by replacing the cell media with complete media containing 0.5 mg/mL MTT and incubating the cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO 2 48 4.4. Cytotoxicity Assay Cytotoxicity was assessed using the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay at 24, 48, and 72 h post drug treatment. The manufacturer’s protocol was followed, and in the final step, the optical density (OD) was measured at 490 nm with a Spectramax M3 microplate reader (Molecular Devices, CA, USA). Each experiment was conducted in three separate trials with six replicates [ 48 4.5. Caspase Activity Assays The activity of caspase-3, -8, and -9 was assessed using the Multi-Activity Assay Kit (Abcam, ab219915, UK), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were added to 100 μL/well of caspase assay solution after a 24-h combination drug treatment and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Fluorescence intensities were measured at Ex/Em wavelengths for each caspase: Ex/Em = 535/620 nm for Caspase-3, Ex/Em = 490/525 nm for Caspase-8, and Ex/Em = 370/450 nm for Caspase-9. 4.6. Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Measurement Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed using the TMRE Assay Kit (CST, 13296, Danvers, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After the combined drug interaction, the cell lines were incubated with 200 nM of TMRE for 20 min and maintained at 37 °C in an incubator before analysis. The cells were washed three times with warmed 1X PBS and then incubated in pre-warmed 1X PBS. In the final step of the assay, the reader settings included excitation at about 550 nm and emission at 580 nm. 4.7. Western Blot Analysis Proteins were extracted from the cells with RIPA lysis buffer on ice and quantified using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Thermo Scientific). Protein lysates were separated with 10–12% SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis)–polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF, Millipore) membranes. After incubation overnight with primary antibodies (granzyme A (1:1000); granzyme B (1:1000), perforin (1:1000), and β-actin (1:1000)), the membranes were treated for 90 min with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Immunoreacted bands were detected using a Chemi Doc 48 4.8. Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat v3.5 software (Systat Software, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). All MTT data were expressed as the mean values ± standard deviation (SD) and analyzed via Student’s t 49 p 5. Conclusions Our study demonstrates that pharmacologic exposure to B12 and G-CSF can enhance breast cancer cell proliferation and attenuate cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in vitro. These effects were observed in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer models and were associated with reduced apoptotic signaling and preservation of mitochondrial integrity. These findings raise important concerns regarding the empirical use of supportive care agents during chemotherapy. Specifically, our data suggest that a subset of patients may be vulnerable to B12-associated chemoresistance, highlighting the need to maintain serum B12 levels within physiological ranges and to avoid unnecessary supplementation, particularly in cases of triple-negative breast cancer. These results also support the exploration of anti-cobalamin strategies as a potential therapeutic approach in biologically defined subgroups. Furthermore, our preclinical observation that exogenous G-CSF promotes tumor cell survival and attenuates cisplatin efficacy supports a biomarker-informed, guideline-directed risk–benefit appraisal within established indications for neutropenia prophylaxis. The clinical implications remain incompletely defined, and particular caution may be warranted in patients with G-CSF-producing tumors or CSF3R Disclaimer/Publisher’s Note: Author Contributions Conceptualization, V.A., D.D.U., A.S.Y.S. and N.Ö.; methodology, V.A., D.D.U., A.S.Y.S. and N.Ö.; validation, V.A., D.D.U. and A.S.Y.S.; investigation, V.A., D.D.U. and A.S.Y.S.; data curation, V.A., D.D.U. and A.S.Y.S.; writing—original draft preparation, V.A., D.D.U. and A.S.Y.S.; writing—review and editing, V.A., A.S.Y.S., D.D.U., A.Ö., O.S., K.D. and N.Ö.; supervision, A.S.Y.S. and N.Ö.; project administration, V.A., D.D.U. and N.Ö.
