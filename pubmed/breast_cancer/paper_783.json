Background Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is an emergency medical procedure designed to restore circulation and respiratory function in patients who have suffered cardiac arrest. This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the upload sources, content characteristics, and video quality of CPR-related videos on YouTube, Bilibili, and TikTok, with a view to providing a reference for improving public first aid awareness and skills. Methods In December 2024, we searched each platform using “Cardiopulmonary resuscitation” and “CPR” (including “心肺复苏” for Bilibili and TikTok), retrieving the top 100 videos per platform. After screening, 239 videos (YouTube: 80; Bilibili: 72; TikTok: 87) met inclusion criteria. Meanwhile, we quantitatively assessed the video quality using the Patient Education Material Assessment Tool (PEMAT), Video Information and Quality Index (VIQI), and Global Quality Score (GQS) assessment tools. We assessed the correlation between video quality scores and viewer interaction data (likes, comments, favorites, and retweets). Results A total of 239 videos were included for analysis (YouTube: 80; Bilibili: 72; TikTok: 87). Short-form CPR videos have increased yearly. Uploaders differed by platform: YouTube—mainly professional institutions; Bilibili—Non-professional individuals; TikTok—Non-professional Institutions. TikTok had the highest uploader certification rate (72.97%), and videos by professional individuals gained the most interactions. Content varied: YouTube focused on CPR knowledge (85.00%), TikTok on News and Reports (48.28%), and Bilibili was mixed. The automated external defibrillator (AED)-related videos on TikTok received the most likes. YouTube videos had the highest quality scores, especially those from professionals. However, correlation between quality scores and interaction data showed no strong positive correlation. Conclusion Social media plays a growing role in CPR education, yet overall video quality—especially in accuracy and completeness—needs improvement. Involving more professionals in content creation and enhancing platform recommendation algorithms could help disseminate reliable first aid information more effectively. cardiopulmonary resuscitation social media public education public health information quality PEMAT VIQI GQS The author(s) declare that no financial support was received for the research and/or publication of this article. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes section-at-acceptance Digital Public Health Introduction Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is one of the most important first aid skills in acute and critical care medicine ( 1 2 3–5 6 7 8 Although CPR is a highly technical first aid measure, its basic operation is relatively simple and can be mastered by the general public through standardized training. However, due to the practical application, there are often problems such as insufficient compression, substandard frequency, or poor ventilation, which affect the resuscitation effect ( 9 In recent years, with the rapid development of digital technology, online video platforms are becoming an important way for the public to obtain health information ( 10 11 12 13 Currently, all major video platforms feature a large number of short videos related to CPR, with YouTube, Bilibili, and TikTok being the most common ( 14–16 17 18 19 20 Materials and methods Ethical considerations All information comes from publicly available YouTube, TikTok, and Bilibili videos, and does not involve any personal privacy issues. The study did not use clinical data, human samples, or laboratory animals. Therefore, ethical review is not required. Search strategy and data collection The video search was conducted on January 6, 2025. To minimize interference from personalized recommendation algorithms, we prepared new devices before retrieval and did not log into any related accounts. On the YouTube platform, the keywords “Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation” and “CPR” (this is both a scientific name and a common colloquial term) were used for retrieval; on the Bilibili and TikTok platforms, the Chinese keyword “心肺复苏” and the English “CPR” were used, respectively. No filtering conditions were set during retrieval, and videos were arranged in the default sorting order. Considering the stability of video exposure, attention, likes, and comments, videos published within the past week were excluded, and the retrieval cutoff date was set as December 30, 2024. Ultimately, the top 100 ranked videos on each platform were selected for subsequent analysis ( 21 22 Video and uploader characteristics For the videos included in the analysis, the data we collected included the upload platform, video title, uploader’s identity (account name, self-description, certification status, number of followers), upload time, video lengths, number of views, likes, comments, favorites, and shares. However, it should be noted that TikTok does not provide the number of views, and YouTube lacks data on favorites and shares. All collected data were recorded in Excel (Microsoft Corporation). We categorized video uploaders based on their identity into Professional Individuals, Non-professional Individuals, Professional Institutions, and Non-professional Institutions. Among Professional Individuals, we further divided them into Doctors Specializing in Emergency Medicine, Doctors in Other Fields of Modern Medicine, First Aiders and Care Personnel, and Other Healthcare Professionals. The content categories of the videos are as follows: (1) CPR Knowledge, (2) Case Analysis and Practice, (3) Application of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs), (4) CPR Skills Challenge Footage, (5) News and Reports. For specific classification criteria ( Multimedia Appendix 1 in Supplementary material Video evaluation Three evaluators independently rated each video using the following three tools, and inter-rater reliability among the three independent raters was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). In case of discrepancies in the ratings, the team members discussed together to determine the final score. Video quality assessment was conducted from three dimensions: information quality, content quality, and overall quality. Information quality mainly examined the fluency and accuracy of the information, assessed using the Video Information and Quality Index (VIQI). Content quality focused on the reliability and completeness of the video content, evaluated using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). Overall quality integrated the above aspects to assess the video’s usefulness to viewers, using the Global Quality Score (GQS). All of the above tools have been validated in previous studies ( 16 23 The specific scoring methods and characteristics of each assessment tool are as follows ( Multimedia Appendix 2 Supplementary material VIQI ( 24 The PEMAT was developed in 2014 and has good internal consistency, reliability and construct validity. The tool contains 25 items, of which 21 assess the understandability of the health information and 4 assess the actionability of the recommended measures. The scoring format is “Agree = 1, Disagree = 0, Not Applicable = Not Counted.” The total score (PEMAT-T), understandability score (PEMAT-U), and actionability score (PEMAT-A) were calculated as “sum of scores/total possible scores×100%.” A score of ≥70% indicates that the information is easy to understand or has actionable guidance ( 23 GQS ( 14 Statistical analysis We used IBM SPSS Statistics version 24.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, United States) for statistical analysis of the data. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess the normality of continuous variables. For normally distributed continuous variables, results are presented as mean ± standard deviation (mean ± SD); for non-normally distributed continuous variables, results are presented as median ( M post hoc r r r r r r r r p Results Video characteristics A total of 239 videos were included in this study, comprising 80 videos from YouTube, 72 from Bilibili, and 87 from TikTok.

Quality analysis We evaluated the quality of videos included from the three video platforms according to established scoring criteria. Overall: the PEMAT-T score for all videos was 67.0 (34.0–100.0), the VIQI-sum score was 13.0 (11.0–15.0), and the GQS score was 4 0.0 (3.0–5.0). Statistical analysis showed that videos on the YouTube platform scored significantly higher than those on Bilibili and TikTok in both PEMAT-T and VIQI-sum, with statistically significant differences. Although there was no statistically significant difference in the GQS scores among the three platforms, the IQR showed that YouTube’s GQS scores were still higher than those of the other two platforms. From the overall trend, YouTube videos were of higher quality than those on Bilibili and TikTok, as reflected not only in higher PEMAT-T and VIQI-sum scores, but also in various sub-scores (such as VIQI-2 to VIQI-4, PEMAT-U, and PEMAT-A), with only VIQI-1 showing no significant difference ( Table 3 Table 4 Table 3 Quality analysis of videos about CPR on YouTube/Bilibili/TikTok.

Discussion With the rapid development of social media platforms, short videos have become an important vehicle for health education, enabling the public to access medical information more conveniently ( 25 17 As the influence of short videos continues to expand in the field of health communication, how to balance the professionalism and accessibility of the content to promote effective learning for the public has become an important topic for future health communication research. This study is the first comprehensive evaluation of CPR videos on YouTube, Bilibili, and TikTok. With the development of the Bilibili and TikTok platforms, the number of related videos has increased year by year, especially TikTok has grown significantly. Our detailed statistical analysis shows that YouTube and Bilibili videos lengths are significantly longer than TikTok (57.0 (21.0, 416.0) seconds for TikTok), which correlates with platform-specific time limits and previous literature ( 26 27 28 29 Statistical analysis shows that YouTube displays a large number of professional videos on CPR knowledge and the use of AEDs, while TikTok mainly covers news report content. YouTube videos focus more on the principles and critical steps of CPR, which may enhance public understanding of first aid procedures, improve implementation accuracy, and ultimately reduce patient mortality. In contrast, Bilibili and TikTok—both Chinese short-video platforms—feature a substantial amount of “CPR Skills Challenge” footage, primarily recorded during competitions. While these videos demonstrate professional techniques, they often lack explanations of basic concepts and supplementary information, which likely contributes to their relatively low audience engagement. Although these videos may be engaging, they contribute little to enhancing the public’s fundamental first aid skills. Furthermore, a notable gap exists in pediatric and infant CPR content across all three platforms, particularly on TikTok. Given the critical importance and real-world applicability of pediatric and infant CPR, professional organizations should increase the production and dissemination of related educational videos to ensure that parents are better prepared in emergencies and to help prevent avoidable tragedies. To further address the scarcity of pediatric CPR content, we recommend three actionable steps. First, collaborate with organizations such as regional pediatric associations to develop high-quality, social media-tailored pediatric CPR content. Second, partner pediatric medical institutions with social media creators, leveraging their audience insights to turn professional guidelines into accessible, shareable material. Third, integrate pediatric CPR into school curricula and community programs, encouraging participants to share their learning online to amplify reach. These steps would strengthen pediatric CPR education across platforms. We employed three validated assessment tools—PEMAT, VIQI, and GQS—to comprehensively evaluate video quality. The findings indicate that demonstrated significantly higher overall quality and reliability compared with those on Bilibili and TikTok. In contrast, TikTok videos are limited by their short video lengths and low information content, while Bilibili have a higher proportion of non-professional individuals. Furthermore, both platforms lack rigorous video review mechanisms, which likely contributed to their overall lower quality scores. The findings indicate that non-professional uploaders and the absence of robust review mechanisms are key contributors to the low quality of videos. Platforms should strengthen the qualification of uploaders and improve the content monitoring mechanism to improve the quality of healthy videos. This study also found a weak correlation between video quality and viewer interaction (e.g., likes and comments), consistent with previous research ( 30 31 Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, although anonymous device access was employed and no user accounts were logged in, the influence of personalized recommendation algorithms could not be entirely eliminated. Second, the exclusion of videos without subtitles may have resulted in the omission of some high-quality content. Third, although three evaluators were used to independently score and standardize the disagreement, the scoring tool itself is still subjective and cannot avoid potential systematic bias. Future research could develop a more comprehensive and objective content quality assessment tool, combining with AI technology to improve assessment efficiency and accuracy. Finally, the sample size was limited, and some videos were uploaded earlier. With the evolution of technology and platforms, the quality of CPR videos may be further improved in the future, which deserves continuous attention and evaluation. Conclusion CPR-related videos on social media platforms have contributed to the popularization of first aid knowledge and skills among the public. TikTok’s short-form, highly interactive videos attract substantial viewer attention, while YouTube and Bilibili offer longer, more professional content with higher quality ratings. Nonetheless, video quality across all platforms remains suboptimal, particularly regarding content completeness and professionalism. Therefore, there is an urgent need to encourage more professionals to participate in the production of CPR videos, while platforms should strengthen their content review and recommendation mechanisms to ensure that high-quality videos are fully exposed. By optimizing the algorithms, the platforms are able to push more scientific and accurate first aid knowledge to users, further enhancing the public’s first aid awareness and practical operation ability. In conclusion, improving the overall quality of CPR-related content and minimizing public exposure to misleading information is essential for advancing social first-aid capacity and safeguarding public health—an objective that requires coordinated efforts from multiple stakeholders. The authors would like to express their gratitude to the video uploaders for their contributions to public health. And thanks to teacher Chuanliang Pan for the guidance of the experiment.
