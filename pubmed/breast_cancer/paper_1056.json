Introduction It is well known that neutropenia is one of the most common complications of chemotherapy in cancer patients, leading to an increased risk of infection [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 Filgrastim is characterized by a short half-life (2–4 h) with elimination from the body by renal clearance and G-CSF receptor-associated uptake by neutrophils [ 7 8 9 10 In practice, compliance with these instructions presents, in some cases, significant difficulties, since it requires the patient to re-visit a medical institution and receive additional injections. The problem is that exactly during this period the maximum manifestation of systemic chemotherapy side effects (vomiting, diarrhea, fever, neurotoxicity, etc.) is observed. In this regard, some patients do not receive this maintenance therapy partially or at all, which negatively affects the overall outcome of treatment. In order to reduce the effective course of G-CSF, various approaches are being developed aimed at prolonging the circulation of the active substance in the body. This can be achieved by placing the active compound on a biodegradable platform or in a scaffold. In this case their kinetics of bio-resorption will determine the bioavailability of the drug. Additionally, creating conjugates can change the pharmacokinetics of the active compound. Thus, in recent years, the drug pegfilgrastim, of prolonged action, containing pegylated filgrastim, has been actively used in clinics. The median serum half-life of pegfilgrastim is 42 h due to the impossibility of clearance by the kidneys due to the large size of the conjugate molecule. As a result, it can be administered to patients once, resulting in the effect of neutropenia stimulation corresponding to 11 injections of filgrastim [ 11 12 Meanwhile, intensive chemotherapy can cause myelosuppression, which is manifested in a decrease in the content not only of white blood cells (WBCs), but also of red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets (PLT) in the circulating blood. In this case, along with a violation of anti-infective immunity due to leukopenia, patients experience anemia, leading to fatigue, and thrombocytopenia, and thus to fear and anxiety [ 13 Myelosuppression is often the cause of low efficiency of cancer treatment due to increase of intervals between chemotherapy courses, cancellation of effective cytostatics, or reduction of their dose. Obviously, such patients require supportive therapy to restore the cellular composition of the blood, including not only G-CSF containing drugs, but also transfusion of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, blood or platelet concentrate [ 14 15 16 Therefore, the urgent task is not only the development of new medicinal forms of hemo-stimulants, but also the search for new active compounds that are promising for the prevention of myelosuppression due to the effect on various blood cells. In this regard, of particular interest are studies of promising candidates among sulfated oligo- and polysaccharides of natural origin, which include fucoidans [ 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 19 20 21 22 23 The aim of this study was both to confirm the prospects of using natural FCS extracted from the sea cucumber C. japonica 25 26 27 28 25 26 27 28 29 30 2. Results 2.1. Material Characterization After severe plastic deformation by ECAP, the Fe–Mn–C and Fe–Mn–Pd alloys had an ultrafine-grained austenitic structure. The size of the structural elements was 100–250 nm, with release of α-Mn nanoparticles in the Fe–Mn–C alloy [ 30 2 3 29 Table 1 2.2. Characteristics of Alloy Degradation Products Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 1 Figure 2 Based on the presence of elements on the surface of the samples in the composition of the corrosion products, one can assume a mixture of oxides, hydroxides and phosphates on the surface of the samples. Typically, culture media contain Ca 2+ 2+ + + − 4 2– 4 3− 3 − 31 Figure 1 Figure 2 2.3. Administration of Active Compounds to Animals The Fe–Mn-C and Fe–Mn-Pd alloy scaffolds loaded with FCS or rG-CSF were implanted subcutaneously in mice with induced immunosuppression immediately after the end of the last course of CPh ( Figure 3 2.4. Hematological Parameters Analysis of hematological parameters of mice with immunosuppression without treatment (group CPh) shows that a course of the cytostatic drug induced a dramatic decrease in the concentration of hemoglobin, platelets and WBCs in the blood compared to the intact control ( Figure 4 At this stage of the research, our task was not to optimize the scaffold composition, but to identify the fundamental possibility of the use of the described scaffolds to manage a delayed effect of FCS and rG-CSF. As expected, the study revealed a number of desirable statistically significant results ( Figure 4 Figure 5 p The study compared the effect of FCS in the Fe–Mn–C+FCS, Fe–Mn–Pd+FCS and FCS groups, when administered subcutaneously to mice with CPh-induced immunosuppression. FCS administered in the form of a solution demonstrated the greatest effect on WBC recovery. This result was the best among all the studied groups. The most pronounced statistically significant restoration of WBCs under the influence of hemo-stimulants was observed in the Fe–Mn–C+FCS, FCS and rG-CSF groups: on average, the concentration of these cells was increased in comparison with the CPh group by 1.3, 1.6 and 1.7 times ( p Figure 4 Figure 4 The treatment of animals with FCS or rG-CSF, both using scaffold and injection solution, resulted in a tendency to increase the concentration of RBCs and hemoglobin without significant differences between groups ( Figure 4 p Figure 4 2.5. Proliferative Activity of Cells Ki-67 is a well-known marker of actively dividing cells. The number of cells labeled Ki-67 was used for assessing the proliferative activity of bone marrow cells after treating animals with scaffolds for delayed stimulation of hematopoiesis. The obtained data showed, as expected, that treatment of animals by CPh resulted in suppression of the number of proliferating cells in their bone marrow ( Figure 5 Figure 5 p p The data on the concentration of Ki-67(+) cells in general were confirmed by the results after assessing the morphology of bone marrow cells. The largest number of pools of dividing cells in the bone marrow was observed in animals of the Fe–Mn–C+FCS group ( Figure 6 2.6. Spleen Morphology The spleen plays a significant role in the innate and adaptive immune responses. Thus, it is one of the most important organs of the immune system. The results after studying the spleen morphology of mice from different groups showed that the CPh course without subsequent therapy led to depletion of the cellular composition of the organ ( Figure 7 In comparison with the CPh group, the treatment of mice by rG-CSF and FCS loaded into scaffolds or injected in solutions resulted in minimization of negative changes in the spleen morphology. This can be regarded either as a consequence of rapid restoration of the organ’s cellular composition or as a consequence of the protective effect of hemo-stimulating agents that prevented cellular depletion of the organ due to active stimulation of cell proliferation. Comparing the effect of the two hemo-stimulating agents, it should be noted that the use of rG-CSF contributed to the restoration of WBC concentrations in the spleen to a greater extent, whereas the effect of FCS resulted in equilibrium restoration of both WBC and RBC content in the organ tissue. 3. Discussion The obtained results confirm previously published data on the hemo-stimulating activity of natural FCS extracted from the sea cucumber C. japonica Psolus peronii Holothuria nobilis 22 23 It is obvious that this result is determined by the partial similarity of the mechanism of therapeutic action of FCS and rG-CSF. The data obtained earlier show that both rG-CSF and sulfated polysaccharides, which include FCS extracted from sea cucumbers, inhibit the induction by cells of interleukin-6, which has an ambivalent effect on the immune system [ 22 In comparison with subcutaneous injection of rG-CSF and FCS solutions, the implantation of a biodegradable scaffold loaded by active substances led to the prevention of pancytopenia. It resulted also in the restoration of platelet and hemoglobin concentrations in the mice blood, as well as maintaining the supply of RBCs and lymphocytes in the spleen. Since an increase in the concentration of Ki-67(+) cells was found in the bone marrow of mice with implanted scaffolds, it can be assumed that the delayed release of FCS and rG-CSF stimulated the proliferative potential of bone marrow hematopoietic cells, which was reduced after the CPh course. It is obvious that the mechanisms of stimulation of hematopoiesis by FCS and rG-CSF differ. As we have shown earlier, FSC stimulates the proliferation of stem hematopoietic cells (CD34+CD45+) and accordingly leads to the restoration of various links in hematopoiesis [ 22 32 This effect was achieved by reducing the bioavailability of hemo-stimulants that were immobilized in a scaffold covered with a polyethylene glycol film in the first hours after implantation. Polyethylene glycol was used to encapsulate the contents of the scaffold, preventing leakage and evaporation of Matrigel and protecting medical personnel from coming into contact with the hemo-stimulants during the process of implanting the device under the patient’s skin. The release of the active compound into the tissues surrounding the implant became possible only after the sequential biodegradation of the polyethylene glycol layer, the alloy of the scaffold wall and Matrigel, followed by diffusion of the hemo-stimulant into the surrounding tissues. Therefore, the effect of the hemo-stimulant (rG-CSF or FCS) is realized after the removal of CPh from the body, which prevents the onset of severe immunosuppression. It can be assumed that rG-CSF and FCS, which entered from the implant, neutralized the negative effect of the cytostatic on blood cells due to increased proliferation of hematopoietic cells, contributing to the preservation of the cellular composition of the bone marrow and spleen. It should be noted that the most pronounced effect of hematopoiesis stimulation under the influence of FCS was achieved after its introduction as part of a scaffold based on the Fe–Mn–C alloy after ECAP. It is possible that the advantage of the Fe–Mn–C alloy in this case was a lower rate of biodegradation compared to the Fe–Mn–Pd alloy after ECAP, which resulted in the maintenance of the kinetics of the hemo-stimulator entering the bloodstream that was optimal for hemo-stimulation. It is possible that it was the elemental composition of the scaffold that also contributed to a more significant manifestation of the planned therapeutic effect. Microelements released from the scaffold during its biodegradation can affect hematopoiesis through different mechanisms. It is known that erythropoietic tissue is the main consumer of iron required for heme synthesis [ 33 34 35 35 36 37 38 39 40 On the other hand, the reduced activity of Fe–Mn–Pd scaffolds compared to Fe–Mn–C may be explained by the negative effect of Pd ions on the proliferation of hematopoietic cells. It was previously shown that Pd ions are capable of prolonging the G1 phase of the cell cycle, thus preventing cell proliferation [ 41 42 In our previous work, we assessed the effect of implantation of an Fe–Mn-based alloy on changes in blood biochemistry parameters (total bilirubin, urea, creatinine and albumin in blood serum), correlating with impaired renal and hepatic function. No evidence of significant differences was found in comparison with intact animals [ 43 A slightly different picture was observed after subcutaneous injection of FCS and rG-CSF solutions in mice immediately after the end of the CPh course. It can be assumed that, due to high bioavailability, FCS and rG-CSF began to realize a stimulating effect on cell growth in a short time even before the end of the cytopathogenic effect of the cytostatic. In this case, CPh canceled the effect of hemo-stimulants due to the direct cytotoxic effect on recruited cells in the systemic bloodstream, leading to their massive death. Potentially, such a scenario can provoke toxic damage to the liver and/or kidneys due to the increased load on these organs, due in turn to the need to remove a large volume of metabolites from the body. In this case, the potential for therapy of CPh-induced immunosuppression, which developed as a result of pancytopenia, could be reduced due to the depletion of the number of blood cells deposited in the bone marrow and spleen. The achieved results may be of interest for the development of a device that could be implanted in a cancer patient simultaneously with the injection of a chemotherapy drug in order to prevent complications such as pancytopenia, which can occur due to the delayed onset of the hemo-stimulating effect of the active substance. The use of biodegradable components eliminates the need for surgical intervention to remove the implant parts after the end of its therapeutic effect. The potential therapeutic benefits of this design should be further explored through a series of subsequent experiments. This approach aims to reduce hospital visits for patients on the first day after chemotherapy, a period that is usually the most difficult for patients to tolerate, and to reduce the risk of a sudden drop in blood cell concentration due to the programmed timely start of maintenance therapy. 4. Materials and Methods 4.1. Sulfated Polysaccharides The FCS sample was extracted from a body wall of the sea cucumber C. japonica 44 4.2. Scaffolds The scaffold shells were made of the Fe–Mn-C and Fe–Mn-Pd alloys melted in a Leybold Heraeus (VAR) L200DI vacuum arc remelting furnace (Leybold, Cologne, Germany) from technically pure iron with the addition of electrolytic manganese (≈99.8% Mn). The chemical composition of the alloys is presented in Table 2 The alloys were subjected to homogenizing annealing followed by ECAP. To maximize structure refinement, the Fe–Mn–C alloy samples were processed with six ECAP passes and the Fe–Mn–Pd alloy samples at 450 °C were processed with four ECAP passes. The obtained samples were used to manufacture tubular scaffold shells with a length of 8 mm and an internal diameter of 2 mm ( Figure 8 The scaffold shells were washed in distilled water in an ultrasonic washer and then kept in 70% ethanol for 4 h. After drying, the shells of the Fe–Mn-C and Fe–Mn-Pd alloy scaffolds were filled with Matrigel (Corning, USA) containing 0.1 mg of FCS solution (Fe–Mn-C+FCS and Fe–Mn-Pd+FCS, respectively) or 0.6 nmol rG-CSF (Leucita, Sygardis AqVida, Germany) (Fe–Mn-C+rG-CSF and Fe–Mn-Pd+rG-CSF, respectively), kept at 37 °C for gel polymerization, immersed in sterile 6% polyethylene glycol solution and incubated at 37 °C until the start of the experiment. The loaded scaffolds were used no later than 4 h after preparation. 4.3. Animal Model The animal protocols used in this work were evaluated and approved by the local ethical committee of the N.N. Blokhin National Medical Research Center of Oncology (Protocol 12-2024). They are in accordance with the order 490 (5 November 2008) of the Agricultural Ministry of Russian Federation and meet National GLP Standard of Russian Federation [ 45 Forty-eight mice of the Balb/c line (males, weight 21 ± 2 g) were divided into 8 groups with 6 animals in each group. Before and during the experiment, the animals were in standardized vivarium conditions (at 20 ± 2 °C with free access to food and water). For the inducing of myelosuppression, CPh (Endoxan, Baxter, Germany) at a dosage of 100 mg/kg was injected to animals of 7 groups once daily parenterally for 3 days. Intact animals were designated as the Intact Control group. Immediately after the last injection, animals were either implanted subcutaneously with prepared scaffolds (Fe–Mn-C+FCS, Fe–Mn-Pd+FCS, Fe–Mn-C+rG-CSF, and Fe–Mn-Pd+rG-CSF groups) or injected subcutaneously with 0.2 mL of FCS or 0.6 nmol rG-CSF. One group of animals with CPh-induced immunosuppression was left without treatment (CPh). The animals were euthanized after 3 days. Blood and bone marrow were stabilized by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), spleen was fixed by 10% formalin and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE). In the blood, we studied the concentration of white blood cells (WBCs) and, in particular, neutrophils (Neu), lymphocytes (Lym), monocytes (Mono) and eosinophils (Eos), as well as the concentration of red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin (HGB), and platelets (PLT). These hematologic parameters were analyzed with an automatic analyzer Diatron Abacus Junior 30 (Diatron, Budapest, Hungary). The proliferative activity of bone marrow cells was assessed by determining the con-centration of cells labeled with the Ki-67 (Ki-67(+) cells) using the Muse Cell Analyzer (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and the Muse ® 4.4. Statistical Analysis The results of the individual parameter evaluation were presented in the form of the mean (M) and standard deviation (SD). To evaluate the hematological parameters, the studies were performed in triplets. To evaluate the proliferative activity, at least 5000 cells were examined in each sample. A comparative analysis was performed using the median test. Differences were considered significant at p 5. Conclusions In this study, a biodegradable scaffold loaded with FCS isolated from the sea cucumber C. japonica This effect of the implants developed, together with an increase in the concentration of Ki-67(+) cells in the bone marrow, indicates the stimulation of their proliferation, as well as elevation of the content of lymphocytes and RBCs in the spleen, which is one of the main organs of the immune system. It was found that the most significant effect of hemo-stimulation occurred in animals after the implantation of scaffolds made from the Fe-27Mn-0.2C after ECAP. Compared to Fe-22Mn-0.9Pd, this alloy has a lower biodegradation rate (this was confirmed by in vitro experiments), which allowed the active compounds to enter the blood after CPh had been eliminated from the body. In addition, the elements released during the alloy biodegradation (primarily iron) were also potentially capable of providing an additional hemo-stimulating effect. The developed design appears to be a promising model of a medical device for reducing the severity of pancytopenia in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy due to the preventive administration of hemo = stimulators with delayed effect. The use of FCS from sea cucumber C. japonica The comparison of hemo-stimulating activities of FCS and rG-CFS was previously studied by us in experiments on cyclophosphamide-induced mice. This demonstrated the advantage of FCS over rG-CFS because of the ability of FCS to stimulate not only neutropoiesis but all links of hemopoiesis [ 19 20 Acknowledgments The study of the microstructure was carried out using research equipment of the Shared Facility Center at P.N.
