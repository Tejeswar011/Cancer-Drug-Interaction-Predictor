We profiled malignant epithelial cells from 5 gastric adenocarcinoma patients through single-cell sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, demonstrating the heterogeneity of gastric adenocarcinoma (GA), and identified the CCKBR+ stem cell-like cancer cells associated poorly differentiated and worse prognosis. We further conducted targeted analysis using single-cell transcriptome libraries, including 40 samples, to confirm these screening results. In addition, we revealed that FOXOs are involved in the progression and development of CCKBR+ gastric adenocarcinoma. Inhibited the expression of FOXOs and disrupting cancer cell stemness reduce the CCKBR+ GA organoid formation and impede tumor progression. Mechanically, CUT&Tag sequencing and Lectin pulldown revealed that FOXOs can activate ST3GAL3/4/5 as well as ST6GALNAC6, promoting elevated sialyation levels in CCKBR+ tumor cells. This FOXO-sialyltransferase axis contributes to the maintenance of homeostasis and the growth of CCKBR+ tumor cells. This insight provides novel perspectives for developing targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at the treating CCKBR associated gastric cancer.
