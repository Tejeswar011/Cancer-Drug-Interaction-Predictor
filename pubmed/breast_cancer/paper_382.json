Moreover, the molecular pathways that modify cell mechanics may also be potential novel targets for managing lethal diseases, such as cancer, by specifically changing the mechanical phenotype of cells along with the associated functional phenotype. This study explores the relationship between the viscosity and stiffness of cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms. We used a large linked molecular dataset to explore the correlations between gene expression, cell migration, and cell mechanical properties, which were quantified by two viscous rate constants from a standard linear solid viscoelasticity model and apparent Young’s modulus from a Hertzian contact mechanics model. Using a causal network analysis built on known relationships curated from literature in Qiagen’s Ingenuity Pathway Analysis package, we identified potential molecular control nodes that could modify the expression of multiple genes correlated with cell mechanics. We investigated the up- and down-regulation of expression by two predicted potential small molecule regulators (lacidipine and AG879) and four predicted potential gene regulators ( AKT2 ITGB6, mir-183, CD82 Keywords Cell viscoelasticity Network analysis Molecular regulators Ovarian cancer Subject terms Biological physics Gynaecological cancer Cell biology Gene expression http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002 National Institutes of Health 1F31CA243345-01 http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001 National Science Foundation CBET 2225476 pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement yes pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes issue-copyright-statement © Springer Nature Limited 2025 Introduction Ovarian cancer is a lethal gynecological malignancy with low survival rates largely due to late-stage diagnoses. For example, between 1975 and 2021, at the time of diagnosis only 19% of ovarian cancer cases in the SEER 22 cancer registries were limited to the ovaries, while 74% showed advanced cancer spread to regional or distant sites (7% were unstaged) 1 2 3 10 11 14 In previous work, we developed a method to investigate the intersection between cell mechanotype, functional phenotype, and genotype 15 1 2 1 The main focus of this manuscript is to test several hypotheses generated by the single cell genomechanical method to modify genes of interest and adjust targeted cell mechanical properties. Because decreased cell stiffness and decreased cell viscosity are both associated with ovarian cancer malignancy, we explore the genetic regulation of both mechanical properties. Through the use of a genomic network analysis, we have identified several putative control nodes that can regulate the expression of our previously identified genes significantly correlated with the fast viscous rate constant, the slow viscous rate constant, and cell stiffness. We chose to focus our study on 6 regulators predicted by the network analysis, four predicted potential gene regulators, AKT2, ITGB6, miR183, CD82, Results Network analysis results in hypothesis generation and testing of putative targets that affect cell viscosity Given the wide range of genes previously identified in our genomechanical analysis that correlate with mechanical properties (Supplementary Fig. 1 15 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 AKT2 1 1 2 ITGB6 2 3 1 2 CTNNB1 TP53 1 CDH3, COL5A1, FN1, LAMC2, LOX, MMP3, POSTN, RB1 2 Table 1 Network analysis reveals control nodes that could control cell fast viscous rate constant (λ 1 λ 1 Control node regulators Molecule type Activation z-score Network bias-corrected p-value Lacidipine Small molecule 2.449 0.0038 PAX5 Transcription regulator 2.000 0.0006 CCN5 Growth inhibitor 2.000 0.0058 NDRG1 Enzyme 2.000 0.0080 AKT2 Kinase −2.000 0.0640 MMP9 Enzyme −2.000 0.0497 TBX3 Transcription regulator −2.000 0.0378 WNT5A Cytokine −2.236 0.0190 CREB3 Transcription regulator −2.646 0.0186 Network analysis of genes correlated with cell viscous rate constant, λ 1 Table 2 Network analysis reveals control nodes that could affect cell slow viscous rate constant (λ 2 λ 2 Control node regulators Molecule type Activation z-score Network bias-corrected p-value ERBB3 Kinase 2.449 0.0143 YAP1 Transcription regulator 2.236 0.0464 ITGB6 Cell adhesion molecule 2.236 0.0316 WWTR1/TAZ Transcription regulator 2.121 0.0267 mir-221 miRNA 2.111 0.0410 miR-17-5p miRNA −2.000 0.0167 SPDEF Transcription regulator −2.000 0.0219 CADM1 Cell adhesion molecule −2.309 0.0169 mir-223 miRNA −2.324 0.0300 AG879 Small molecule −2.357 0.0142 TEAD2 Transcription regulator −2.449 0.0162 CCN5 Growth inhibitor −2.646 0.0002 Estrogen receptor Transcription regulator −2.714 0.0001 Network analysis of genes correlated with cell viscous rate constants, λ 2 Table 3 Selected control node regulators and how they were tested.

From a network analysis, we identified several putative gene and small molecule regulators that affect multiple genes significantly correlated with cell viscous properties and with cell stiffness. The viscoelastic properties of cells are determined by several cellular components, such as the cell membrane, cytoskeleton and viscosity of their cytoplasm. Two examples of this include the active contraction of the cytoskeleton resulting in intracellular poroelasticity and differences in cytoskeletal fluidity based on differences in non-covalent bonds holding together the various filaments 17 19 20 ATK2 ITGB6 miR183 CD82 These six predicted regulators represent both activators and inhibitors of our three mechanical properties of interest, the fast viscous rate constant, the slow viscous rate constant, and cell stiffness. This combination of gene regulator targets and small molecule regulators was chosen because they could be simply perturbed by treatment with a small molecule drug, through RNA interference with a commercially available, tested siRNA or through microRNA interference. We surmised that simple modulators of the target pathways would allow for a simpler translation to future preclinical and clinical testing through multiple types of potential treatments. Furthermore, these six regulators were predicted to perturb genes that were specifically correlated with each mechanical parameter (Supplementary Fig. 1 YAP1, WWTR1 TAZ), TEAD2 YAP TAZ TEAD2 YAP1 21 YAP1, TAZ, TEAD2, 2 4 Our first regulator node perturbation, AKT2 1 AKT2 22 24 AKT2 25 AKT2 CDH1 Our next target node was the small molecule drug, lacidipine, a voltage-gated calcium channel blocker, which is commonly used as an anti-hypertensive agent, but has recently been studied as a novel therapeutic targeting ovarian cancer stem cells 26 27 AKT2 28 To affect the slow viscous rate constant instead of the fast viscous rate constant, we used the predicted small molecule drug AG879, a tyrphostin-kinase inhibitor specific for ERBB2 VEGF 29 RB1 KISS1 30 33 RB1 KISS1 The final viscous node regulator we perturbed was ITGB6, ITGB6, ITGAV ITGB6 34 ITGB6 TGM2 ITGB6 TGM2 35 In addition to exploring the molecular mechanisms related to cell viscosity, we found that the overexpression of miR-183 miR-183 36 38 39 miR-183 40 41 42 miR-183 Additionally, we identified 17-ODYA as a cell stiffening small molecule inhibitor through its minor up-regulation of CD82 CD82 43 44 CD82 MMP9 45 CDH1 5 Table 5 Summary of hypothesis testing of control node regulation of mechanics and gene expression.

Alignment with predicted gene expression changes based on significant changes (p < 0.05, Welch’s two sample t-test). Overall, this study used a systems biology network approach to investigate biomechanical mechanisms by testing several hypotheses linking cell mechanical properties to the expression of genes that can be manipulated with pharmacological agents or gene therapies. Many of these genes also play a role in ovarian cancer cell metastasis. We identified a number of cell line specific regulation points that have an effect on cell viscous properties (e.g. AKT2, ITGB6 miR-183 Methods Single cell genomechanics dataset A data set was generated from a single cell genomechanical method 15 1 2 1 Gene network analysis We applied a Causal Network Analysis 46 46 Ovarian cell culture The ovarian cancer cell lines OVCAR3, HEY, and its derivative cell line HEY A8 were cultured in RPMI-1640 media (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were cultured at 37℃ at 5% CO 2 Control node perturbations We tested the effect of modulation of multiple potential control nodes of cell mechanics and gene expression, including: genes ( AKT2, ITGB6, CD82) . AKT2 Lacidipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, was used as a regulator of genes correlated with λ 1 AG879, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was used as a regulator of genes correlated with λ 2 ITGB6 ITGB6 Mature microRNA miR-183 was overexpressed in cells via transfection with mirVana miRNA mimic for hsa-miR-183-5p (ThermoFisher). Alternatively, cells were transfected with a negative control mimic miRNA (ThermoFisher). Additionally, we transfected cells with mirVana miRNA inhibitor for hsa-MIR183-5p or a negative control inhibitor miRNA at a ratio of 1:5 mimic to inhibitor. We determined optimal transfection conditions to be 2 μL of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Transfection Reagent (Life Technologies) and 30 pmol of miRNA per 1 mL of media as well as the optimal incubation time post-transfection. After 6 h, the transfection media was exchanged for fresh media, and cell stiffness was measured 72 h post-transfection with atomic force microscopy, as described below. CD82 CYP2J2, 45 AFM and force curve analysis To characterize the mechanical properties of each cell, we used force spectroscopy to obtain force-indentation curves with an atomic force microscope (Asylum Research) with an integrated optical microscope (Nikon) on a vibration isolation table. For improved global stiffness measurements of the cell, 5.24 μm spherical silica particles were attached to tipless silica nitride cantilevers (Bruker Probes) using a two-part epoxy. Each cantilever was calibrated to determine the deflection inverse optical lever sensitivity and spring constant (k is approximately 10–25 pN/nm). For measurements, the cantilever probe was visually aligned with the cell center and translated with a velocity of 2 μm/s to indent the cell with increasing compressive force until a force trigger of 5 nN was reached. This constant force trigger resulted in an indentation depth of approximately 2–6 µm with an average indentation depth of 2.5 µm, which is equivalent to approximately 25% of the average cell height. The cantilever was held in position for 10 s, dwelling towards the surface, to record the viscous relaxation of the cell before reversing the probe velocity.

An initial 30 s melt phase at 95℃ was followed by 40 cycles of a 10 s melt phase at 95℃ and a 30 s anneal and extend phase at 60℃ with a final melt curve analysis afterwards. All primers used for downstream gene analysis were previously validated and listed 15 https://www.medischebiologie.nl/files/ t t t GAPDH RPL32 t -ΔΔCt RNU6B Migration assay To test the migratory properties of cells after 17-ODYA treatment, we used the Cultrex 24-well transwell migration assay (Trevigen), where 100,000 cells of each cell population were seeded in serum free media (RPMI-1640) in an 8-micron pore well insert, leading to a well filled with complete media (RPM1-1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin–streptomycin). After 8 h of incubation, the cells that migrated through the pores were detached, lysed and stained with Calcein-AM fluorescent dye. The amount of fluorescence per well was read with a microplate reader at 480 nm/520 nm (BioTek Synergy H4). A standard curve was performed to determine the relationship between fluorescence and number of cells. Supplementary Information  Supplementary Information.
