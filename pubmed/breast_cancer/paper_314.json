Radiogenomics integrates imaging phenotypes with genomic profiles, offering a pathway to precision diagnostics. However, existing classical machine learning models often struggle with the high dimensionality and heterogeneity of multimodal data, leading to issues in calibration and reproducibility. This study presents Q RadFusion, a hybrid quantum-classical framework designed to enhance breast cancer diagnosis by fusing mammography and genomics data.\nMethods:\nQ RadFusion was implemented on two publicly available datasets: CBIS-DDSM (2,600 curated mammography cases, TCIA) and TCGA-BRCA (1,000 genomic profiles, GDC). Imaging preprocessing included bias-field correction, segmentation, and harmonization, while genomic data underwent normalization and imputation. Feature selection was performed using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), and features were mapped into a quantum Hilbert space using Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC). For multimodal fusion, ResNet encoded mammography features, and a Transformer encoded genomic features. Patient-level and site-held-out splits were used for evaluation.\nResults:\nQ RadFusion achieved an AUC of 0.96 and accuracy of 94%, outperforming baselines including CNN-LSTM, ResNet + XGBoost, and multimodal Transformers. Ablation studies confirmed the contribution of quantum components, with optimal performance observed at circuit depth \\(\\:L=6\\), qubits \\(\\:Q=10\\), and QAOA layers \\(\\:p=3\\). The model also demonstrated improved calibration and ~ 80% fewer parameters compared to deep fusion networks.\nConclusion:\nQ RadFusion demonstrates that hybrid quantum–classical radiogenomic integration can deliver accurate, reproducible, and clinically meaningful diagnostic support for breast cancer, with strong potential for future clinical translation. pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version yes pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint yes pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
