See: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ Abstract Objectives This qualitative study aimed to address the following central research question: what are the key factors and behavioural trajectories influencing delayed medical care-seeking among participants with breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL), and how do these factors operate across the stages of symptom perception, alertness and decision-making? Design This qualitative study employed a phenomenological approach, with semistructured interviews conducted to explore participants' experiences. Setting A tertiary hospital located in North China. Participants 18 patients with BCRL were recruited through purposive maximum variation sampling and interviewed in person between January and June 2023. Results 10 themes emerged and were categorised into three stages: (1) the perception stage (lack of disease knowledge, risk underestimation and symptom avoidance); (2) the alertness stage (failed self-management, negative coping and exposure to misinformation) and (3) the decision-making stage (financial burden, limited healthcare access, insufficient social support and fatalism). The average delay was 10.2 months, with prolonged delays (>12 months) linked to severe lymphoedema progression. Conclusion Delayed care seeking in BCRL is a multifactorial behavioural trajectory shaped by knowledge gaps, systemic barriers and psychosocial factors. Clinicians should prioritise early patient education and context-sensitive interventions to mitigate delays.

Semistructured interviews were combined with NVivo V.12 coding to identify 10 critical themes, deepening qualitative insights into care delays. Purposive sampling from a high-volume tertiary hospital ensured diverse patient representations (age, education and income), enhancing generalisability. Introduction In 2020, the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer reported that breast cancer was the most prevalent cancer globally, contributing to 2.26 million new cases. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 This study had two primary objectives: (1) to systematically map the behavioural trajectory of delayed medical care seeking in participants with BCRL by examining their experiences across three critical stages—symptom perception, alertness and decision-making—and (2) to identify multifactorial barriers (eg, knowledge gaps, systemic inequities and fatalistic attitudes) influencing delays at each stage of this trajectory. Our findings contribute to the literature in three key ways. Theoretically, we propose a novel three-stage behavioural model integrating cognitive psychology (eg, symptom misinterpretation) and health systems research (eg, structural barriers to care), 15 16 17 Participants and methods Study participants The purposive sampling method was employed to select participants who attended the lymphoedema treatment centre at a tertiary general hospital in North China from January 2023 to June 2023. This hospital is categorised as a Grade III Class A facility, with the Department of Breast Surgery conducting over 800 breast cancer surgeries annually. This enabled the study to obtain a representative sample through maximum variation sampling. Participants were recruited through purposive maximum variation sampling to ensure diversity across demographic and clinical dimensions, including age (targeting four groups: 30–39, 40–49, 50–59 and ≥60 years), education level (junior high school or below, high school/technical school, undergraduate or above), occupation (workers/farmers, retired/unemployed, professionals such as teachers or civil servants), household income (¥<3000, ¥3000–5000 and ¥>5000) and delay time (3–6 months, 7–12 months and >12 months). Recruitment involves screening hospital records to identify eligible candidates, with intentional selection to fill gaps in the sampling matrix (eg, prioritising under-represented subgroups such as farmers with long-term delays). Data saturation was determined when three consecutive interviews yielded no new themes, following initial interviews that identified core issues (eg, lack of disease knowledge) and subsequent interviews that expanded themes to include fatalistic attitudes. Participant diversity was evident in contrasting profiles: a 32-year-old highly educated teacher with minimal delay highlighted workplace stigma, whereas a 68-year-old farmer with limited income and a 24-month delay emphasised rural healthcare barriers, collectively capturing the spectrum of BCRL care-seeking experiences. Research methods Research instrument Data were collected through semistructured, in-depth interviews, a method consistent with the study’s phenomenological design, to capture rich and contextual insights into participants’ care-seeking trajectories. The study was guided by the three-stage behavioural model—perception, alertness and decision-making—adapted from Leventhal’s Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation 15 8 We adhered to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research guidelines to ensure methodological rigour. These units were synthesised into essential themes through iterative reflection, emphasising the existential essence of delay rather than categorical frequencies. For example, the theme ‘fatalistic attitudes’ emerged not as an isolated category but through narratives intertwining cancer survival struggles with lymphoedema burdens, exemplified by one participant’s account: ‘I not only have breast cancer but also have high blood pressure… there is no point for me to live (tears), so I do not want to receive treatment’ (Participant N13). Member checking and peer debriefing ensured trustworthiness, with participants validating interpretations and interdisciplinary researchers challenging analytical rigour. The interview was structured around the main theme of ‘reasons for delayed consultation’, with the following specific questions: (1) please describe your thoughts and feelings since first noticing the condition’s symptoms. (2) How do you perceive these symptoms? (3) What prompted you to seek medical treatment? (4) What were your experiences prior to receiving a definite diagnosis? (5) Please explain the impact of the period between symptom onset and the decision to seek medical attention. (6) What support do you believe is required from society and healthcare personnel? Data collection method Before the interviews were conducted, appointments were scheduled with potential participants to ensure convenience after their clinical visits. A total of 20 patients were initially approached through purposive maximum variation sampling. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants using a standardised form approved by the Ethics Committee (No YXLL-2023-082). The form outlined the study objectives, procedures, potential risks and benefits, confidentiality measures (including the use of pseudonyms), voluntary participation and the right to withdraw at any time. After verbal confirmation of understanding, each participant signed two copies of the form—one retained by the researchers and one by the participant. Two patients declined participation due to personal time constraints, resulting in 18 participants who completed the study. No participants withdrew after providing informed consent. The interviews were conducted individually in a private demonstration classroom to ensure confidentiality. Each session lasted 25–40 min and was audio-recorded with explicit written consent for recording obtained via the informed consent form. Non-verbal cues (eg, emotional tone, pauses and gestures) were documented in written field notes by the researchers. The participants were encouraged to express their experiences openly, with follow-up questions used to clarify responses while avoiding leading prompts. The transcripts were later verified against the recordings to ensure accuracy. Data analysis method NVivo V.12 software was used to analyse the original interview data in this study. The data were analysed via Colaizzi’s seven-step phenomenological approach, 18 19 Ethical consideration This study meets the requirements of the Helsinki Declaration, and ethical clearance was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Shanxi Bethune Hospital of China. Quality control To strengthen the trustworthiness of the findings, we implemented the following strategies. Participant diversity: participants were purposively selected through maximum variation sampling to capture a broad spectrum of experiences across age (30–69 years), education level (junior high school to postgraduate), occupation (farmers to professionals) and delay duration (3–24 months). Credibility: transcripts and preliminary interpretations were shared with participants for verification (member checking), and two researchers (ML and PW) independently reviewed the coding processes to resolve discrepancies. Audit trail: all analytical decisions (eg, codebook revisions, theme merging) were systematically documented in NVivo V.12. Reflexivity: researchers maintained journals to record preconceptions (eg., assumptions about rural healthcare barriers) and minimise bias during analysis. Procedural details from the original study were retained: two patients participated in preinterviews to refine the interview guide; their data were excluded from formal analysis. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim within 48 hours and returned to the participants for corrections. Patient and public involvement Semistructured interviews were conducted with participants; however, neither the participants nor the public were involved in the design, execution, reporting or dissemination plans of the study. The findings were subsequently presented to the hospital’s patient participation group, whose feedback informed the development of future research directions. On acceptance, the study results will be shared with participants via email. Sincere appreciation is extended to all participants for their valuable contributions to this project.

More than 50% of the respondents in our study reported symptoms related to the disease, but they were unable to identify BCRL because of a lack of awareness. (1) Swelling; N2: ‘Some time ago, when I woke up in the morning, my skin felt a little tight, and I did not take it seriously’. (2) Heaviness; N7: ‘I felt like I could not lift my arms when I slept at night and did not pay much attention to it’. (3) Deepening of the skin folds; N10: ‘Some time ago, it was noticed that the texture of the skin was aggravated, and I did not know what was wrong’. Theme 2: insufficient perception of danger Owing to the chronic and progressive nature of BCRL, many participants lack sufficient awareness of the potential danger of the disease. The long-term persistence of lymphoedema often leads participants to become accustomed to living with the condition, resulting in the neglect of self-management and the absence of optimal treatment opportunities. N1: ‘At the beginning, it was just swelling, and I didn't worry about it’. N13: ‘There was always an unspoken discomfort, which was also completely tolerable’. N9: ‘I know it’s lymphoedema, but it’s not cancer, it can't die’. N10: ‘My arm has been swollen for years, and it doesn't affect my daily life, it’s not a big problem, so let’s leave it at that’. Theme 3: self-avoidance symptoms The respondents in this study reported engaging in self-avoidance behaviours, convincing themselves that recovery would occur in a few days, which ultimately led to delays in seeking care. N1: ‘Once it was red and hot and swollen, then it was relieved by some anti-inflammatory medication, so I thought that if I was more careful in the future, I should be fine’. N5: ‘It was actually a bit swollen during radiotherapy and then it got better for a while’. N15: ‘At that time, I thought I might be a bit tired, and it got better with rest’. Alertness stage Theme 4: failure of symptom self-management Self-management behaviours, which initially seemed to successfully relieve symptoms, led to a delay in medical consultation. Medical help was sought only when symptoms worsened after ineffective self-management. N3: ‘I knew some ways to relieve lymphoedema and carried out massages on my own, which was fine at first, but the swelling got worse over a while’. N16: ‘I bought my own therapeutic device; each time I did it, I could get relieved, but the swelling did not go down; then, the doctor said the pressure of the device was wrong, I truly regret it’. Theme 5: negative response After undergoing surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other treatments, many participants focused their time and energy on cancer treatment, neglected lymphoedema management and responded negatively to self-management of the condition. N6: ‘I am too busy with treatments and reviews; how can I have time and energy to focus on lymphoedema?’. N12: ‘Who knows how long I can live, so let my hands swell’. N14: ‘I am tired of heading to the hospital all day long’. Theme 6: information lack and bias On accepting their diagnosis, participants frequently engage in active information-seeking related to the disease. However, the reliability of the information obtained is often questionable, leading to confusion and uncertainty. N7: ‘I have checked a lot, and the internet says it cannot be cured at all’. N8: ‘I joined a group of participants, and there are all kinds of claims in it’. N11: ‘There are many claims on the internet; I don't know what to do’. N18: ‘I googled lymphoedema recovery exercises; they are not quite the same; I don't know which version to do’. Decision-making stage Theme 7: heavy financial burden China’s current medical security system requires improvement, and respondents indicated that illness imposes a significant financial burden. N3: ‘The family is just farming, they don't earn much money a year, and it’s difficult economically, so hospitals can be avoided without going there’. N17: ‘Living here costs money every day’. N18: ‘I've spent a lot of money on this disease, and now I have to treat my arm, so I don't know how much I'll have to spend’. Theme 8: limited medical resources Some participants expressed a willingness to receive treatment, but the nearest healthcare facilities were unable to meet their treatment needs. N2: ‘We can't treat it locally, and it takes too much time’. N6: ‘I've wanted to receive treatment for a long time too, but it’s too much trouble to come all the way here every time’. N17: ‘It would be convenient if I could be treated in our local area’. Theme 9: weak social support Most interviewees reported weak family and social support and needed multidimensional assistance. N10: ‘Going to the hospital means that I have to go back and forth alone, and my partner is not in good health’. N12: ‘I took leave from work when I was sick, and now my arm is swollen, and I have to take time off again. What organisation wants someone who takes time off from work all the time?’. N14: ‘There are many things to do at home, so I cannot get away’. Theme 10: fatalism As BCRL is a chronic and incurable disease, 2 Discussion With the transformation of medical models, the postoperative quality of life of patients with tumours has become one of the most significant indicators for assessing overall treatment efficacy. 20 21 22 23 Enhancing the popularisation of BCRL-related knowledge and improving participants' symptom recognition ability It has been reported 24 1 25 Although the advent of the internet has facilitated easier access to health information, concerns regarding the accuracy and reliability of online content persist. Participants in this study demonstrated varying levels of health literacy, which led to differential understanding and interpretation of information provided by healthcare professionals. In particular, individuals with limited cognitive capacity and low disease awareness frequently disregard early symptoms, contributing to delayed care-seeking. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network 26 Fully mobilising the social support system to create a supportive diagnostic and treatment environment for participants Lymphoedema rehabilitation requires long-term effort, necessitating support from family and social systems. 27 28 et al 7 Optimise healthcare structures to promote positive healthcare behaviours Lymphoedema is chronic and progressive, 29 30 31 32 26 33 Methodological limitations While this study offers nuanced insights into care-seeking delays, several methodological limitations merit consideration. First, the purposive sampling was restricted to a single tertiary hospital in North China. Although maximum variation sampling captured a range of socioeconomic and clinical profiles, the absence of participants from primary care settings or rural communities may constrain the transferability of findings. Patients attending specialised lymphoedema centres are likely to possess greater resources or motivation, potentially excluding the experiences of untreated or underserved populations. Second, reliance on retrospective self-reporting introduces recall bias, particularly among participants with extended delays (>12 months), who may inaccurately reconstruct initial symptom experiences. Third, while offering rich contextual depth, the phenomenological approach is inherently shaped by the researcher’s interpretation. Despite implementing rigorous safeguards (eg, member checking, intercoder reliability), the dual role of clinicians as researchers may have subtly influenced thematic prioritisation, especially concerning systemic healthcare barriers. Finally, the sample size (n=18), while adequate for achieving thematic saturation in qualitative inquiry, limits statistical generalisability and may overlook infrequent themes, such as fatalistic beliefs among higher-income participants. Future research should adopt multisite recruitment and longitudinal designs to objectively map delay trajectories and reduce reliance on retrospective accounts. Summary This study delineates the multifaceted behavioural trajectory underlying delayed medical care-seeking among patients with BCRL, illustrating how interrelated cognitive, psychosocial and systemic barriers—from initial symptom misinterpretation to deeply rooted fatalism—prolong the treatment pathway. The analysis yielded three critical insights: delays are sequentially shaped through a three-stage behavioural model—perception, alertness and decision-making—with distinct barriers predominating at each stage. Early delays stemmed from knowledge gaps and symptom misattribution, whereas systemic inequities (eg, financial strain, rural healthcare scarcity) and fatalistic attitudes became pivotal in later stages. Clinically, prolonged delays (>12 months) are strongly associated with irreversible lymphoedema progression, including tissue fibrosis and functional disability. The findings underscore the need to integrate cognitive psychology (eg, addressing symptom interpretation biases) and health system reform (eg, expanding insurance coverage for decongestive therapies) into intervention design. Future research should validate this model in diverse cultural contexts, develop stage-specific strategies (eg, community-based symptom education for the perception stage) and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of policy initiatives such as subsidising compression garments under national health schemes. By bridging patients’ lived experiences with systemic actionability, this work charts a roadmap for reducing delays and improving lymphoedema outcomes globally.
