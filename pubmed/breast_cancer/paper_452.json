Current treatment primarily consists of general lifestyle recommendations, with effective self-management being essential for integrating these recommendations into daily life. However, no self-management interventions currently address the unique needs of people with lipoedema. This study aimed to develop an evidence-based, theory-informed intervention to enhance self-management in people with lipoedema using the Intervention Mapping (IM) approach. Methods Following the first four steps of the IM approach, this study used a participatory methodology involving stakeholders, empirical data, and theory. Steps included: 1) needs assessment; 2) identification of outcomes, performance objectives, and change objectives; 3) selection of behavioural change methods; and 4) development of program components. Results The resulting intervention includes a program for people with lipoedema and a training program for healthcare professionals (HCPs). The intervention aims to empower patients to engage in self-management and equip HCPs to provide effective support. Key determinants targeted include self-efficacy, self-regulation skills, knowledge, attitudes, and social facilitation. The program for people with lipoedema consists of seven themes aligned with self-management behaviours and is delivered through 19 sessions: seven one-on-one sessions, one session involving supportive individuals, and 11 group sessions. The program for HCPs is delivered through six group sessions, each focusing on the core skills HCPs need to effectively deliver self-management support to their patients. Conclusion The IM approach effectively guided a systematic, transparent, and reproducible development process. Grounded in established theories and behavioural change methods, the intervention provides a strong foundation for implementation and evaluation among people with lipoedema. The fifth and sixth steps of IM are considered future priorities.

The most recent guideline on lipoedema highlights the critical role of self-management in managing the condition. 9 10 11 Self-management interventions for people with chronic conditions have shown positive results, including improved functioning, quality of life, health behaviours and communication with HCPs. 12–14 13 15 This study aimed to develop an evidence-based, theory-informed intervention to enhance self-management in people with lipoedema, using the Intervention Mapping (IM) approach. This intervention, delivered by an interprofessional team, aims to provide people with lipoedema and their HCPs with a structured, evidence- and theory-based framework to effectively enhance self-management and self-management support. This improvement is expected to lead to better functioning and, ultimately, an enhanced quality of life for people with lipoedema. Furthermore, this theoretically grounded development process lays a solid foundation for future empirical studies that address the critical gap in care for people with lipoedema. Methods This study adhered the steps and tasks of the IM approach, which was chosen for its systematic and stakeholder-driven methodology. IM enabled a predominantly participatory process that actively engaged relevant stakeholders, empirical data, and theory throughout the development of the intervention. IM is an iterative process for addressing complex problems, consisting of six steps designed to create a blueprint for developing, implementing, and evaluating interventions ( Figure 1 16 17 Appendix I Figure 1 The six steps, its tasks and core processes of the Intervention Mapping approach. Data from Eldredge et al, 2016 16 17 The first step was to conduct a needs assessment (outlined in a previously published paper) to explore the needs, barriers, and facilitators of self-management, focusing on patients and HCPs. 15 16 In step two, the behavioural outcomes, performance objectives, and change objectives of the self-management intervention were identified. The targeted outcomes were further refined using the Theory of Self-Regulation, which emphasises key processes such as self-monitoring, recognizing patterns and triggers, and developing self-reflective and reactive capabilities. 18 19 20–24 16 25 16 In step three, to achieve the change objectives, relevant behaviour change methods were selected from the taxonomy of behaviour change methods, 16 26 27–31 32 In step four, the program content for each intervention session was developed based on the change objectives and selected behaviour change methods. Additionally, the needs assessment and planning group contributed to the program’s development. At the end of the development phase, the authors, the planning group, and people with lipoedema were invited to review the content and provide feedback. Their input was used to enhance clarity, improve content, and refine the suitability and visuals of the program materials. Results Step 1 Needs Assessment The needs assessment, as outlined in a previously published paper, identified a set of determinants that were presented to the planning group. 15 Figure 2 16 Figure 2 Logic Model of the Problem. ( A B C D E F Step 2 Identification of Outcomes, Performance Objectives and Change Objectives Outcomes and Determinants for Self-Management Behaviour The intervention aims to empower people with lipoedema to actively engage in self-management behaviours such as goal setting, self-monitoring, reflective thinking, decision making, planning, taking action, self-evaluation, and emotional control. 18 25 33–38 The intervention targets the determinants of self-efficacy, self-regulation skills, knowledge about lipoedema and self-management, and attitude. Additionally, it addresses social facilitation, which refers to how relationships influence performance through support, cooperation, and social influence. 39 25 40–45 46–48 Outcomes and Determinants for Self-Management Support The intervention aims to empower HCPs involved in the care of people with lipoedema to provide effective self-management support, enabling patients to successfully adopt and maintain self-management behaviours using the 5 A’s model. 19 The key determinants for achieving environmental outcomes include knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy. The needs assessment among HCPs highlighted their need for these determinants, along with greater confidence in providing effective self-management support. Furthermore, a holistic understanding of their patients’ issues was identified as essential. Research has shown positive associations between self-efficacy and self-management support, with higher qualifications and greater experience among HCPs linked to improved outcomes. 49 50 Performance, Change Objectives, and Logic Model of Change The performance objectives developed to address the behavioural outcomes related to self-management, as detailed in the Logic Model of Change, are presented in Figure 3 Table 1 Supplementary Tables 1 2 Table 1 Examples of Performance Objectives, Personal Determinants, Change Objectives, Behaviour Change Methods and Their Application for People with Lipoedema Performance Objective Personal Determinant Change Objective Behavioural Change Method Application PO.0. Decide to improve an aspect of their life Knowledge Explain in which areas of their life improvement is possible. Discussion Group session Introduction and getting acquainted. The HCP provides information on lipoedema, symptoms, self-management, related behaviours, and their role in managing lipoedema. The patient completes the Self-management Web, and the patient and HCP review the results together and identify key areas for improvement and discuss the patient’s most significant barriers. Motivational interviewing is used to enhance the patient’s motivation and commitment to positive life changes, to assess patient’s knowledge and beliefs about lipoedema and to evaluate the patient’s readiness for behavioural change and explains its importance for overall functioning.

( A B C D E F G Step 3 Theory- and Evidence-Based Change Methods Several behavioural change methods were selected to enhance knowledge as a determinant ( Supplementary Tables 3 4 51 16 52 53 16 15 To enhance skills and self-efficacy, methods primarily rooted in theories of self-regulation were used, including guided practice, self-monitoring of behaviour, cue altering, goal setting, planning coping responses, and motivational interviewing. 18 16 18 16 Motivational interviewing was used as a behavioural change technique to explore and address patient ambivalence about self-management, while also improving skills and self-efficacy through patient-centered, collaborative, and goal-driven communication. 54 16 15 To promote attitude change, persuasive communication and argumentation were used to help individuals develop a desired attitude by offering information and rationale to motivate specific behaviours. 16 16 54 16 Step 4 Producing Program Components Program for People with Lipoedema Several practical applications of behavioural change methods were implemented to target behavioural determinants ( Supplementary Table 3 15 The theme of the program for people with lipoedema is: “SELF-MANAGING your lipoedema”. This title reflects the self-management behaviours and determinants targeted in the intervention: self-efficacy, self-evaluation, and self-monitoring (SEL); social facilitation (F); making decisions (M); action planning (A); kNowledge (N); attitude (A); goal setting (G); skIlls (I); and reflective thinkiNG (NG). The program consists of seven program themes that align with seven self-management behaviours. It includes 19 sessions of approximately one hour each: seven one-on-one sessions, one session with supportive individuals, and 11 group sessions, organised into three phases ( Figure 4 55 15 4 15 Figure 4 Program content “SELF-MANAGING your lipoedema”. Program for HCP The HCP program consists of six group sessions, each lasting between one hour and one-and-a-half hours ( Figure 5 Supplementary table 4 Figure 5 Program content for healthcare professional training. The program themes for HCP training are: assess, advise, agree, assist, and arrange, representing the core skills HCPs need to effectively support their patients in the self-management of lipoedema. 19 15 19 15 15 15 Discussion This study describes the development of an evidence-based, theory-informed self-management intervention aimed at improving the functioning and quality of life of people with lipoedema. The first four steps of the IM methodology guided the process in a systematic, transparent, and reproducible manner. Grounded in widely accepted theories and incorporating proven behavioural change methods, the intervention provides a solid foundation for its implementation and evaluation. Although this is the first study to describe the development of a lipoedema-specific intervention focused on enhancing self-management, the determinants targeted (ie, knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, and attitude) are commonly included in interventions aimed at improving self-management behaviour in individuals with chronic conditions. 27–31 16 17 15 49 46 Strengths and Limitations Firstly, this is the first study describing the development of a self-management intervention that considers the needs, barriers, and facilitators for self-management (support) of people with lipoedema and HCPs. This was achieved through a comprehensive needs assessment, incorporating a narrative review and focus groups. 15 18 19 25 This study also has some limitations that should be taken into account. Firstly, this study focuses only on steps 1 to 4 of IM. Steps 5 and 6, ie, implementation and evaluation, were not conducted, meaning that the effectiveness of the intervention has not yet been tested. However, the selection of proven and evidence-based methods from behavioural change science suggests that the intervention has good potential to be effective. Furthermore, the study makes a valuable contribution by addressing a critical gap in lipoedema care by providing a structured, theory-based intervention framework that lays the groundwork for future empirical research and practical application. Secondly, although the planning group and the iterative process of IM contributed to the continuous refinement of the intervention, feasibility or sustainability in the long term is not guaranteed. However, involving stakeholders throughout the development process is expected to reduce potential implementation barriers. Finally, although the IM approach is methodologically strong, proper implementation of the intervention is time-consuming and resource-intensive. The program consists of 19 patient sessions and requires HCPs to complete specific training. These requirements may present practical barriers in clinical settings. Furthermore, variations across healthcare systems may affect the feasibility of implementing the intervention as originally designed. This may pose challenges, especially in low-resource settings or healthcare systems with limited capacity. However, the transparency of the development process and the strong theoretical foundation of the intervention are intended to support flexible adaptation to diverse contexts. For example, implementers may tailor delivery methods, session formats, or intensity levels to fit local constraints, as long as the core components (eg, parameters for using behavioural change methods and the core sessions) are maintained. In addition, the intervention was designed with input from various stakeholders, which increases its relevance and cultural sensitivity. The training for HCPs, as described in this paper, is also expected to facilitate correct and efficient implementation across different settings. Implications The developed intervention has the potential to improve self-management behaviours in people with lipoedema by enhancing their knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, attitudes, and support. This is achieved through a tailored support program that combines one-on-one patient-HCP sessions with group sessions. HCPs play a crucial role in the intervention, and the training based on both Self-Regulation Theory and the Five A’s model provides them better insights into the challenges and needs of their patients, which could lead to more effective interventions. 18 19 26 Future research should focus on implementing the intervention and evaluating its long-term effectiveness in improving self-management behaviour, functioning, and quality of life among people with lipoedema. Ideally, this should be assessed using a randomised controlled trial or other appropriate designs, such as a single-case experimental design. Recommended outcome measures include the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey to assess quality of life and subjective functioning, and the Self-Management Web to evaluate self-management behaviour. 56 57 58 Conclusion This study described the development of an evidence-based and theory-informed self-management intervention aimed at improving the functioning and quality of life of people with lipoedema. The first four steps of the IM methodology guided the process in a systematic, transparent, and reproducible manner. Grounded in widely accepted theories and incorporating proven behavioural change methods, the intervention provides a theoretically grounded framework for its implementation and evaluation. The dual patients-HCPs approach offers an innovative and transferable model for self-management support across chronic conditions. Future research should focus on implementing the intervention and evaluating its effectiveness and feasibility in people with lipoedema considering self-management behaviour, functioning, and quality of life, using rigorous study designs, appropriate outcome measures, and suitable follow-up periods.
