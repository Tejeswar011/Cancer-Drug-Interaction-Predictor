However, its effect on long-term survival remains unclear. Reliable prognostic biomarkers are needed to guide personalized postoperative strategies. Objectives: To evaluate the prognostic significance of the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and to construct a predictive model for overall survival (OS) in this clinical setting. Design: This was a retrospective, multicenter cohort study involving an internal development cohort and an external validation cohort. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 178 HER2-negative breast cancer patients treated with taxane–carboplatin NAC at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC). The optimal PLR cutoff (129.75) was identified via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Logistic regression assessed the association between PLR and pCR, and multivariate Cox regression evaluated its prognostic value for OS. A nomogram incorporating PLR, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and clinical stage was built using the FUSCC cohort. The nomogram was externally validated in 34 patients from Fujian Cancer Hospital. Results: Among the 178 patients, 94 (52.8%) had high PLR and 84 (47.2%) had low PLR. High PLR was not independently associated with pCR (odds ratio = 1.006; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.999–1.013; p p p Conclusion: This is the first study to evaluate PLR as a prognostic marker in HER2-negative breast cancer treated with taxane–carboplatin NAC. High PLR was independently associated with poorer survival. The proposed nomogram provides a practical tool for postoperative risk stratification and personalized care.

Despite these encouraging findings in terms of pCR improvement, whether the taxane plus carboplatin regimen results in better long-term survival outcomes remains unclear. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that can predict both pCR and OS is essential for making more precise treatment decisions. Platelets facilitate tumor proliferation, angiogenesis, and immune escape in the tumor microenvironment. 18 19  20 21 22 Therefore, this study evaluated baseline PLR as a predictor of pCR and OS in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer treated with taxane–carboplatin NAC. We also explored potential biomarkers for personalized therapy and examined the clinical implications of this regimen. Materials and methods Patient selection This retrospective study included patients with HER2-negative breast cancer who received taxane–carboplatin-based NAC followed by surgery at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (FUSCC) between January 2010 and December 2019. Clinical data were extracted from medical records, including age, menopausal status, and clinicopathological characteristics: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, Ki-67 index, clinical T and N stages, pCR, and PLR. PLR was calculated using peripheral blood counts obtained within 1 week prior to NAC initiation. Clinical staging was determined according to the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy before NAC, (2) pathologically confirmed HER2-negative breast cancer, (3) complete baseline laboratory data, (4) taxane–carboplatin-based NAC followed by surgery, and (5) comprehensive follow-up and clinicopathological data. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) bilateral or inflammatory breast cancer, (2) male breast cancer, (3) neoadjuvant endocrine therapy only, (4) NAC completed without surgery, (5) postoperative HER2-positive pathology, (6) presence of acute or chronic inflammatory diseases, identified either by clinical records (such as active infections or autoimmune diseases) or by abnormal laboratory indicators (including elevated C-reactive protein (>10 mg/L) and/or abnormal white blood cell (WBC) counts (WBC >10 × 10⁹/L or <4 × 10⁹/L)), all assessed within 1 week prior to the initiation of NAC, (7) history of other malignancies, and (8) use of medications that could significantly affect peripheral blood cell counts (such as systemic corticosteroids or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), within 1 week prior to the initiation of NAC. A total of 178 patients were included and categorized into the training and validation sets (7:3 ratio) to develop the prediction model. Thirty-four patients with HER2-negative breast cancer treated with taxane–carboplatin-based NAC and surgery at Fujian Cancer Hospital between 2019 and 2024 formed the external validation group. Figure 1 Figure 1. Flow chart. HER2, human-epidermal growth factor receptor 2. flow chart shows two sets of patients with HER2 negative breast cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Pathology Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on core needle biopsy and resected tumor specimens using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. ER, PR, HER2, and Ki-67 expression were assessed. ER and PR positivity were defined as ⩾1% nuclear staining or Allred scores 2–8, and negativity with a score of 0.  23 24 25  26  27 Study endpoints The primary endpoint was OS, defined as the time from diagnosis to death from any cause. The secondary endpoint, pCR, was defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer in the breast and lymph nodes, with possible ductal carcinoma in situ in the breast. 28 29 Statistical analysis Categorical variables are expressed as frequencies and percentages. The optimal PLR cutoff was identified using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to maximize sensitivity and specificity for survival prediction. Binary logistic regression was employed to assess pCR predictors. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared via the log-rank test.

The AUC was 0.864 ( Supplemental Figure 3(A)) Supplemental Figure 3(B)) Discussion This study systematically evaluated the prognostic significance of baseline PLR in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer undergoing taxane–carboplatin-based NAC. While PLR was not independently associated with pCR, a high PLR was significantly correlated with poorer OS, particularly in the non-pCR subgroup. These findings suggest that PLR may potentially serve as a simple and accessible marker of systemic inflammation and immune status, holding promise for identifying high-risk patients and informing individualized postoperative treatment strategies. Recent advances in biomarkers and treatment strategies have significantly transformed breast cancer management. In particular, Ki-67 can be used to predict pCR in luminal breast cancer,  31  32  33  34 Taxane–carboplatin combination is a commonly used NAC regimen for HER2-negative breast cancer. Carboplatin triggers apoptosis via DNA double-strand breaks, showing efficacy in patients with TNBC with BRCA-associated DNA repair deficiencies.  35 11 36 9 15 8 17 The taxane–carboplatin NAC regimen has significantly improved short-term efficacy, as reflected by higher pCR rates. However, its impact on long-term survival remains inconclusive, and there is a lack of reliable tools for risk assessment, particularly in the postoperative management of non-pCR patients. This study identified PLR as an independent predictor of OS, demonstrating strong risk stratification capability, especially within the non-pCR subgroup. Incorporating PLR into this treatment pathway may help address the limitations of this regimen. Thus, it could help evaluate long-term outcomes, enhance overall management strategies, and provide more targeted postoperative interventions for patients without complete remission. Ultimately, this would facilitate a clinical shift from “improving response rates” to “improving survival outcomes.” PLR serves as a low-cost indicator of systemic inflammation and immune status. Platelets promote tumorigenesis and progression by enhancing angiogenesis, preventing apoptosis, and protecting circulating tumor cells from immune detection.  37  18 Our findings showed that in TNBC, high PLR was not an independent predictor of pCR post-NAC, consistent with those from previous studies. 38 39  40  41  42 While some studies  43 Notably, high PLR was significantly more associated with lower OS than low PLR in the non-pCR subgroup. PLR may serve as a marker for identifying high-risk cases given the poor prognosis of non-pCR patients, particularly those with TNBC. Consistent with the CREATE-X study,  44  45  46 The nomogram model constructed using PLR, ER status, and clinical stage demonstrated excellent performance in predicting OS in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer. The model achieved a C-index of 0.863, with 3-, 5-, and 8-year AUC values of 0.920, 0.887, and 0.845, respectively, indicating strong discriminative ability and long-term predictive accuracy. The calibration curve showed good agreement between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes, while decision curve analysis further confirmed the model’s high clinical net benefit. Notably, in the non-pCR subgroup, the model enabled early identification of high-risk patients and provided a scientific basis for identifying patients who needed intensified postoperative interventions. Furthermore, the model is based on three routinely available preoperative indicators (PLR, ER status, and clinical stage), requires no additional testing, and is easy to implement in clinical settings—including those with limited medical resources. External validation in an independent cohort from Fujian Cancer Hospital yielded results consistent with those of the FUSCC cohort, suggesting that the model has strong generalizability and broad clinical applicability. In conclusion, this study is the first to systematically validate the prognostic value of PLR for OS in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer treated with a taxane–carboplatin NAC regimen. The results help address the lack of long-term prognostic biomarkers in this field. The nomogram model incorporating PLR, ER status, and clinical stage serves as a valuable tool for clinical risk stratification and treatment decision-making, particularly in guiding intensified interventions for non-pCR patients. This model holds significant potential for broad clinical translation. Nevertheless, this study has several limitations despite the inclusion of a large multicenter cohort and external validation. First, selection bias may have occurred due to the retrospective design, as patients with incomplete clinical or follow-up data were excluded, potentially affecting the representativeness of the study population. Second, the absence of dynamic PLR monitoring precluded assessment of the impact of PLR changes during NAC on prognosis. Serial measurements may better reflect the patient’s inflammatory response and treatment efficacy over time. In addition, the external validation cohort included only 34 patients, which may limit the generalizability and statistical power of the nomogram model. These limitations highlight the need for larger, prospective multicenter studies to further validate the model’s predictive performance and clinical applicability. Conclusion This study assessed PLR’s prognostic value in patients with HER2-negative breast cancer receiving taxane–carboplatin NAC. The results showed that while baseline PLR did not predict pCR, high PLR was independently associated with worse survival post-NAC. A nomogram incorporating PLR and clinicopathological variables exhibited strong predictive accuracy for patients with diverse treatment responses, aiding in postoperative risk assessment and personalized treatment planning. Therefore, taxane–carboplatin combined with PLR assessment may be pivotal in treating HER2-negative breast cancer. However, due to the retrospective design and limited external validation, prospective multicenter studies are warranted. Future research may also explore the integration of PLR-guided strategies into clinical decision-making algorithms to improve survival outcomes, particularly in non-pCR patients.
