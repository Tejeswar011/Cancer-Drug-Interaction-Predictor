Histological subtypes include adenocarcinoma, acinar adenocarcinoma, ductal adenocarcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and adenosquamous carcinoma, with adenocarcinoma accounting for over 95% of cases [ 1 2 Due to its insidious onset, early-stage PCa often presents with no obvious symptoms. As the disease progresses, patients may develop urinary obstruction, sexual dysfunction, and bone pain, leading to a diagnosis at an advanced stage for many. Although PCa is initially sensitive to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), most patients inevitably progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is associated with a poor overall prognosis. In recent years, the advancement of precision medicine has underscored the growing value of radiomics, genomics, and biomarkers in disease screening and treatment [ 3 5 3 5 1  Fig. 1 The Integrated Framework of Precision Medicine for Prostate Cancer. This schematic illustrates the central role of the patient in precision oncology. Data from multiple sources, including advanced imaging (MRI, CT, PET), tissue biopsies, and blood samples, are collected. These data feed into three key analytical domains: Radiomics, which extracts quantitative features from images; Genomics, which identifies critical genetic alterations (e.g., driver mutations, fusions); and Biomarker analysis, which measures levels of molecules like PSA and CTCs. The information from these domains is integrated, often using artificial intelligence and machine learning models, to generate a comprehensive patient profile. This profile informs a personalized treatment plan, enabling precise risk stratification, tailored therapeutic guidance (e.g., surgery, radiotherapy, targeted therapy), and accurate prognosis prediction, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes Personalized treatment with radiomics Radiomics is a high-throughput technique for extracting quantitative image features from standard medical images. By integrating raw image data with advanced algorithms and statistical analysis, radiomics provides deeper, more comprehensive information than traditional radiological interpretation, facilitating precision diagnosis and treatment. The radiomics workflow typically involves image acquisition and processing, segmentation of the region of interest (ROI), feature extraction and selection, and the construction and validation of predictive models (Fig. 2  Fig. 2 The Standardized Workflow of a Radiomics Study. The process begins with the acquisition of high-quality medical images (e.g., MRI, CT, PET). The next step is the segmentation of the region of interest (ROI), which involves accurately delineating the tumor volume on the images. Following segmentation, a large number of quantitative radiomic features—describing tumor shape, intensity, and texture—are extracted from the ROI. To avoid overfitting and identify the most informative features, a feature selection process is employed. Finally, these selected features are used to build and validate a predictive model (e.g., using machine learning algorithms) for a specific clinical endpoint, such as diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment response prediction Personalized treatment with MRI radiomics in PCa Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred imaging modality for diagnosing PCa. It primarily includes T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging. mpMRI plays a critical role in early screening, diagnosis, risk stratification, treatment guidance, and efficacy assessment of PCa. A key challenge in clinical practice is the management of indeterminate lesions, such as those classified as PI-RADS 3. Radiomics and deep learning models are increasingly being investigated to improve the characterization of these lesions, helping to differentiate between clinically significant PCa and benign conditions, thereby guiding decisions on whether to proceed with biopsy [ 6 MRI prediction of radiotherapy (RT) efficacy in PCa patients Abdollahi et al. [ 7 8 9 7 MRI prediction of endocrine therapy efficacy and biochemical recurrence (BCR) In the context of endocrine therapy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels typically drop significantly in PCa patients after ADT, limiting PSA’s ability to discern gradients of treatment response. Tharmalingam et al. [ 10 BCR is a primary cause of treatment failure and mortality in PCa patients. Early and accurate prediction of BCR is crucial for formulating appropriate clinical treatment plans and improving prognosis. Gnep et al. [ 11 12 13 14 Application of CT, ultrasound, and PSMA-PET radiomics in PCa Although CT imaging lacks specificity and sensitivity for detecting PCa lesions, it provides valuable information for NM staging, especially for patients with MRI contraindications. CT radiomics can offer supplementary data to refine PCa diagnosis and treatment. Osman et al. [ 15 16 68 17 18 Ultrasound is a non-invasive, radiation-free, and cost-effective imaging modality that plays an indispensable role in prostate biopsy guidance. With the emergence of advanced ultrasound techniques, radiomics research in this area is expanding. Ou et al. [ 19 20 21 22 PSMA-PET/CT is one of the most promising imaging modalities for PCa. Multiple studies have shown its superiority over MRI, enhanced CT, or Choline-PET/CT for NM staging, and it has become the gold standard for re-staging recurrent PCa [ 23 24 68 25 68 26 68 27 18 Summary of radiomics applications The application of radiomics in PCa has shown considerable promise across multiple imaging modalities for various clinical endpoints, from diagnosis and risk stratification to prediction of treatment response and recurrence. Such models, by translating images into quantitative data, can potentially reduce inter-reader variability and provide decision support, for instance, by flagging suspicious lesions or predicting aggressiveness to help avoid unnecessary biopsies for indolent disease.

Key genomic alterations play a central role in driving PCa pathogenesis, progression, and treatment resistance (Fig. 3  Fig. 3 Key Genomic Pathways Driving Prostate Cancer Progression. This diagram contrasts a normal prostate epithelial cell with a prostate cancer (PCa) cell, highlighting key genomic alterations that promote tumorigenesis.

Predicting this transition and assessing prognosis are therefore critical. De Laere et al.

FOXA1 has been shown to inhibit EMT and tumor cell invasion, a function that is lost upon mutation. Mutant FOXA1 can activate EMT, potentially contributing to PCa metastasis and progression [ 51 52 Assessment of PCa prognosis with FOXA1 High FOXA1 TMPRSS2-ERG FOXA1 53 54 Other clinically relevant genomic alterations and pathways Beyond the individual genes discussed, several other alterations and pathways are critical drivers of PCa. Alterations in the Androgen Receptor (AR) pathway, including AR gene amplification, point mutations, and structural variants, are central to the development of CRPC by enabling ligand-independent activation [ 55 PTEN 56 SP OP 57 Personalized treatment with biomarkers Biomarkers not only aid in the diagnosis of PCa but also ideally provide crucial information for treatment efficacy assessment and prognosis. Common PCa-related tumor markers include PSA, HK2, EPCA, and CTCs. Leveraging the strengths of different biomarkers can improve the accuracy and sensitivity of PCa diagnosis and enable personalized, precise treatment. Prostate-Specific antigen (PSA) PSA, a serine protease, is the most widely used and recognized biomarker for PCa. In the bloodstream, most PSA binds to protease inhibitors (complexed PSA, cPSA), while a smaller fraction exists in an inactive, free state (free PSA, fPSA). Total PSA (tPSA) is the sum of these two forms. Aizawa et al. [ 58 59 r P 60 61 Human Kallikrein 2 (HK2) HK2 is a serine protease with 79% amino acid sequence homology to PSA. Guerrico et al. [ 62 63 64 Early prostate cancer antigen (EPCA) In the 1980s, researchers observed that a key feature of PCa cells is their altered nuclear morphology and size, which is maintained by the nuclear matrix. This led to the discovery of nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) specific to PCa, such as the early prostate cancer antigen (EPCA). Li et al. [ 65 66 Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) The primary clinical application of CTCs in PCa is as a prognostic biomarker in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The landmark study by de Bono et al. demonstrated that a baseline CTC count of ≥ 5 cells per 7.5 mL of blood was a significant predictor of median overall survival, leading to FDA approval of the CellSearch ® 67 68 69 70 However, it is crucial to clarify that the utility of CTCs is context-dependent. In localized PCa, CTCs are rarely detected, and studies have questioned their prognostic value for predicting early biochemical recurrence post-radical prostatectomy. For instance, Meyer et al. found CTCs in only 11% of patients before surgery, with no significant correlation to disease status or recurrence-free survival [ 71 72 Novel urinary and epigenetic biomarkers To address the low specificity of PSA for PCa diagnosis, several novel biomarkers, particularly those detectable in urine, have been developed and integrated into clinical practice. The Prostate Cancer Gene 3 (PCA3) test measures the level of this long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) in urine samples collected after a digital rectal exam. Elevated PCA3 scores are associated with a higher probability of a positive biopsy, and the test is commercially available as the Progensa PCA3 assay to help in the decision-making process, especially for men with a prior negative biopsy [ 73 HOXC6 DLX1 74 Integration into clinical practice and future directions A potential clinical decision framework The successful deployment of these advanced tools into routine clinical practice requires a structured, integrated framework. For a patient presenting with an elevated PSA, the current standard of care often involves a reflex to mpMRI. Here, a PI-RADS score of 4 or 5 typically leads to a targeted biopsy. However, for indeterminate PI-RADS 3 lesions, a precision medicine approach could integrate urinary biomarkers like the PCA3 or SelectMDX tests. A low-risk score from these tests might support a decision to defer biopsy and continue monitoring [ 75 77 ® ® ® 78 BRCA2 Challenges and future perspectives Despite significant progress, the application of radiomics, genomics, and biomarkers in PCa faces several challenges that require further research.
