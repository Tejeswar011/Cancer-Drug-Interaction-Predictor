Introduction Cancer-related bone metastases are a significant global health problem that develop in many advanced cancer cases [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 RT, a common treatment modality for managing bone metastases, affects both biochemical markers and blood parameters [ 10 11 11 12 Understanding the interactions between pain and its treatment in patients with bone metastases through biochemical markers can provide information on pain modulation and predict treatment responses, thus promoting personalized therapy strategies. Therefore, these biomarkers can guide optimization of a combination of treatment strategies, reflecting the actual changes in pain perception of clinical trial results. 2. Methods The study was conducted prospectively in the Radiation Oncology Clinic of Recep Tayyip Erdogan University with the approval of local ethics committee (Approval No: E-40465587-050.01.04-1190 and date: 22 August 2024). The financial resources required for the study were provided by Recep Tayyip Erdogan University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Office (TSA-2023-1466). 2.1. Patient Selection and Radiotherapy The study included 105 patients. A new ‘revised pain and response scale’ based on standardized scales such as VRS, NRS, VAS, and FPS was developed and used for the study. Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 The study included 105 patients. A new ‘revised pain and response scale’ based on standardized scales [ 13 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Figure 1 Bone metastasis information was obtained from positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT), SUV-max values from Gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen (Ga-PSMA)-PET for prostate cancer, and fludeoxyglucose F18 (FDG)-PET reports for other cancer types were used. According to the number of bone metastases, oligometastasis was accepted if 4 or fewer, and multiple metastases were accepted if more than 4. Based on location, metastases were classified as axial (there was no calvarial bone in the study) if they were vertebral and vertebra–costal; appendicular if they originated from the pelvis and extremities; and mixed if they were present on both sides. In addition, according to the composition of the metastasis, it was classified into five groups: soft tissue lytic/destructive, PET CT involvement only, sclerotic, lytic, and mixed (if it contains more than one component). PET-CT fusion was used to ensure the necessary precision in drawing the RT target tumor volumes of the patients. Different daily fraction sizes and total doses used according to the institutional protocol are shown in Table 1 14 15 2.2. Determination of Biochemical Pain Biomarkers TRPV1 (Cat. No: SEF839Hu), bEP (Cat. No: CEA806Hu), NT (Cat. No: CEB203Hu), and OXA (Cat. No: CEA607Hu) levels in serum samples obtained before and during the first week following RT were determined using commercially obtained enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits from USCN. Microplates were coated with antibodies specific for the target biomarker. Samples were reacted with biotin-conjugated antibody and HRP-conjugated avidin. The color produced by the addition of TMB (3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine) substrate was measured spectrophotometrically at a wavelength of 450 nm. Biomarker concentrations were calculated in pg/mL by comparing the optical density (OD) values of the samples with the standard curve. 2.3. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed using the SPSS (Version 22 for Windows, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software package. Data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation and/or median (minimum and maximum value) for continuous variables. Frequency data were expressed as numbers and percentages (%). In statistical analyses, the conformity of continuous variables to normal distribution was evaluated by the ‘Kolmogorov–Smirnov Test’ and the ‘Shapiro–Wilk Test’ when necessary. The ‘Pearson Chi-square Test’ was used to compare frequency data. Since continuous variables did not conform to normal distribution, the ‘Kruskal–Wallis Test’ was used for intergroup comparisons. The ‘Wilcoxon Test’ was used to compare the data before and after RT in each group. Survival analyses were performed with the Kaplan–Meier test. In all statistical comparisons, p 3. Results Patient and tumor characteristics and RT response data are summarized in Table 1 n n n Patients with severe pain scores before treatment had ‘poorer response’ ( p p n n Table 1 A good pain response rate was higher in patients with breast and prostate cancer ( p p There was no correlation between SUVmax values of the primary tumor, involved lymph node, or bone metastasis and pain response scores. However, SUVmax values of patients with poor pain response were higher than those with good response. Patients with SUVmax values above 10 had a poorer response score. No statistically significant correlation was found between RT-related variables (previous RT, RT interval (“time between the start and end of RT (days)”), RT total dose, fraction dose, size of the target volume, percentage of dose covering the target volume, RT dose rate, Monitor unit (MU) and RT technique and post-treatment pain response scores. The relationship between complete blood count (CBC), routine biochemical tests, and pain biomarkers with pain response score is shown in Table 2 p p p Leu was statistically significantly decreased in all patients after RT compared to pre-RT; poor and good response rates were 1.2 (0.2–2.0) vs. 0.9 (0.2–4.7) ( p p Neu/Leu ratio (NLR) was found to be statistically significantly lower post-RT than pre-RT. Before RT, NLR was 4.0 (1.3–36.7) in patients with poor response and 2.6 (1.2–11.4) in patients with good response ( p p PLT was statistically significantly lower after RT than before RT for all pain scores. ALP and LDH values were not significantly different before and after treatment. ALP was lower after RT than before RT. There was no correlation between elevated tumor markers before RT and pain palliation.

Patients with a good response had a higher survival rate ( Table 1 4. Discussion There are several basic scales for palliation and monitoring of cancer pain, effective pain management, and improving the patient’s quality of life [ 16 17 18 Figure 1 10 In general, patients with fewer bone metastases and without previous RT benefit more from treatment [ 19 20 The presence of PNI, vertebral, extremity, or mixed localization of metastasis was not found to differ in terms of pain response. When comparing all morphological features of metastasis, including lytic, destructive, soft-tissue, and PET-CT lesions with only PET-CT uptake and no equivalent on conventional imaging, the good response score was higher in sclerotic lesions. Bone metastases may present as osteolytic (osteoclastic), sclerotic (osteoblastic), or mixed lesions, depending on the underlying mechanism of bone involvement. Sclerotic metastases are usually associated with prostate cancer and some types of breast cancer. Sclerotic bone metastases respond better to RT, especially for pain relief and to control local tumor growth, leading to further sclerosis or stabilization of the lesion [ 21 In our study, no significant correlation was found between SUVmax values on PET/CT and treatment-related pain response scores. However, SUVmax values of bone metastases in patients with poor pain response were higher than those with good response. Again, the poor pain response score was higher in patients with SUVmax values above 10. In the literature, the correlation between SUVmax and pain intensity is statistically significant, and higher SUVmax values indicate higher pain levels [ 22 23 For painful bone metastases, different RT fractionation schemes are used, each designed to provide effective analgesia, taking into account the patient’s overall health status and treatment goals [ 24 Biological markers such as TRPV1, bEP, NT, OXA, cytokines, and inflammatory mediators can be measured to provide objective information on pain levels and inflammatory response [ 25 26 Activation of TRPV1 leads to the development of metastatic bone pain, release of proinflammatory substances, and sensitization of nociceptive neurons, which may exacerbate bone metastasis-induced pain. The efficacy of RT on bone metastases may influence the overall pain experience in patients due to modulation of TRPV1 expression and activity. Other studies emphasize that TRPV1 antagonists may improve the efficacy of RT by altering pain signaling and immune responses [ 27 Acting as an endogenous analgesic, bEP plays a role in the regulation of pain perception in the body. RT may affect bEP levels by reducing tumor burden, and it is thought that administration of bEP during RT or increasing its levels in the body may help reduce pain perception and potentially complement conventional treatments such as RT [ 28 29 30 It is stated that NT plays a role in the development and progression of bone metastases, which promote tumor growth and angiogenesis, and thus may worsen the overall prognosis of patients with metastatic disease [ 10 31 OXA, a neuropeptide produced by the hypothalamus, plays an important role in regulating appetite, sleep, and arousal. The relationship between OXA and RT treatment in patients with bone metastases is a newly emerging research area. There is new evidence that OXA can regulate the tumor microenvironment and may potentially enhance the effectiveness of RT [ 32 There is a significant relationship between NLR and RT efficacy in patients with bone metastasis [ 33 34 35 The study’s key limitations include its failure to consider critical biochemical interactions that influence pain transmission and response modulation. Pain perception is complex, involving a blend of physiological processes, sensory input, emotions, and cognitive factors. Biochemical factors, such as neurotransmitters like substance P and neuropeptides like encephalins, play significant roles in pain signaling pathways and overall pain experiences, highlighting a gap in the study’s comprehensive understanding of pain mechanisms. Additionally, the small sample size and lack of a homogeneous patient group raise concerns about the generalization of the findings. Variability among participants regarding genetic backgrounds, comorbidities, and psychological factors can confound results. Future research should focus on integrating biochemical, physiological, and psychosocial perspectives, as a more extensive and diverse cohort could lead to improved insights into chronic pain mechanisms and potentially enhance treatment strategies. Understanding these complex interactions is essential for developing effective approaches to pain management. 5. Conclusions Monitoring, scoring, and quantifying pain are critical for effective pain management, and developing simplified pain rating scales can significantly enhance patient communication. Commonly used multi-step scales enable patients to express their pain levels in a comprehensible manner across all patient groups experiencing pain. However, in our study, our clinical observation was that patients with widespread disease had difficulty selecting from 0- to 10-point scales and were more willing to prefer a simpler, easier-to-understand pain response scale. Thus, the pain response rating scale we developed (poor, moderate, and good) simplified the expression of pain in three steps. The subjective pain scores expressed by patients can be combined with objective biochemical assessments, making it possible to monitor and intervene in cancer pain treatment. In our study, metastases of breast and prostate cancer, sclerotic metastases, oligometastases, and the absence of extra-bone organ metastases increased good response rates. Initially, a high pain score with high NLR levels was found to have a higher poor response. After treatment, Leu had significantly decreased in all patients regardless of pain response score. In patients with poor response, pre-treatment NT was high, while bED and TRPV1 were low. In patients with a good response, post-treatment NT and bEP decreased, while TRPV1 increased. Our study may contribute to improving treatment outcomes by combining RT with therapies that regulate biomarker activity, especially NT, bED, and TRPV1. Thus, changes in pain management strategies may occur through the use of the body’s own endogenous systems in combating bone metastases and alleviating pain. Nevertheless, we believe that a more comprehensive investigation of tumors, treatment, and biochemical interactions is necessary for the optimization of pain treatment in the future.
