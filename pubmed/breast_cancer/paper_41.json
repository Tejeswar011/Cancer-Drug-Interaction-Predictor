Additionally, this study aims to determine whether exposure to a rural working environment during medical training can positively influence their attitudes toward rural medical practice and enhance their self-assessed probability of pursuing careers in such settings. Materials and methods: The questionnaire includes basic demographic data, closed-ended questions using a 5-point Likert scale, and multiple-choice questions. It was piloted on a sample of 4 medical students to ensure clarity and reliability. After piloting, the questionnaire was distributed to all medical students enrolled at both medical faculties in Slovenia (University of Ljubljana and University of Maribor).1KA, an open-source application, was used to collect data. Quantitative data will be analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics to generate descriptive statistics. Qualitative data will be analysed to identify recurring themes and patterns.

Fictional personas, referred to as Persona 1 and Persona 2, will be introduced to different groups, and the patient journey of each persona will then be displayed. Each group will follow the patient journey of one of the two personas. In the first discussion session, participants will identify generic and country-specific components of the patient journeys and decide which appointments and activities can be done remotely or digitally, as well as how this can best be done. In the second discussion session, participants will identify conditions for implementation, potential barriers, and recommended strategies to mitigate them. The session will end with conclusions and closing remarks.
