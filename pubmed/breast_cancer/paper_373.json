Surface functionalization of CQDs directly affects the drug conjugation and release behaviour. In this study, the peanut shell carbon quantum dots (PS-CQDs) were synthesised through the hydrothermal method. The as-synthesised PS-CQDs had blue fluorescence and functional groups of hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amine. These surface group shows that the PS-CQDs have great water solubility. The free radical scavenging efficacy was also analysed and found to be 84.7%. With an average size of 2.1 ± 0.02 nm, the PS-CQDs were functionalized with a hydrazine group and then conjugated with doxorubicin. The doxorubicin conjugated sample DOX-PS-CQDs showed pH-sensitive release of the drug. The cumulative release percentage was 55.4% at pH 7.4 and 81.4% at pH 6.5, and the release profile exhibited sustained release within 24 h. The different pH enables the PS-CQDs based nanocarrier to release the drug at tumour sites efficiently. Further, in-vitro anticancer activity was studied using these PS-CQDs based nanocarriers against the MDA MB231 cell line, and the live/dead cell screening was carried out by AO/EB staining. Thus, the doxorubicin conjugated with PS-CQDs has exhibited promising properties as a drug carrier for cancer therapy.

Several methods have been implemented for the treatment of cancer, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy. Although such conventional treatment was promising, they have its drawbacks, such as in radiation therapy, the use of x-rays can also damage healthy cells and tissues. Whereas for chemotherapy, the drug would damage normal cells along with cancer cells. Due to a lack of specificity, this negatively affects human health. Another issue lies with the emergence of drug resistance by the cancer cells 1 2 Doxorubicin is a drug commonly used for the chemotherapy of cancer. It is utilized for the treatment of various cancers, including breast cancer, lymphomas, leukaemia, sarcomas, and ovarian cancers. It interferes with the DNA of the cancer cells through intercalation into the DNA base pairs, disrupting its normal structure. This hinders the replication and duplication process of the cancer cells, rendering them unable to repair their DNA, causing cell death 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 10 11 The carbon quantum dots (CQDs) have attracted much attention in recent years due to their favourable and tunable properties, such as biocompatibility, chemical inertness, photostability, refractive index, and fluorescence 1 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 21 8 In this study, carbon quantum dots were synthesised from peanut shells by hydrothermal method. Peanut shell was selected as a source for CQDs production due to its low cost, sustainability, and eco-friendliness. Furthermore, in this study, the surface of PS-CQDs has been modified to release the doxorubicin based on pH response. This is achieved by employing 4-hydrazinobenzoic acid (HBA) as a precursor to functionalize the hydrazine group on the surface of PS-CQDs. This enhances pH-dependent drug release after conjugating onto the functionalized surface of PS-CQDs. Doxorubicin was released much more quickly at an acidic pH than at a pH of 7.4. Since the cancer cells tends to be slightly acidic, this will ensure that the drug is released as targeted drug delivery. Further antioxidant activity was also evaluated for bare PS-CQDs and it showed significant free radical scavenging activity, proving an added benefit to the system. For targeted drug delivery, we employed the MDA-MB-231, which is a triple-negative breast cancer cell line. When ER expression is lacking, MDA-MB-231 cells are resistant to anti hormone-based therapies, including tamoxifen 22 23 Materials and methods Materials The peanuts were purchased in the local market, the shells were separated, washed, and dried at 60 °C for 48 h. The dried shells were ground into powder and sieved using a 100 mesh sieve and stored at room temperature. Glacial acetic acid (99%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), quinine sulphate, and NaCl were purchased from Sisco Research Laboratories (SRL). Sulphuric acid (98%), phosphate buffer saline (PBS), acridine orange (AO), ethidium bromide (EB), 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 4-hydrazinobenzoic acid (HBA), Doxorubicin, Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), and 3-(4,5‐dimethylthiazol‐2-yl)‐2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Synthesis of peanut shell derived carbon Dots The PS-CQDs are synthesised through the hydrothermal carbonization method 24 Characterization techniques UV-visible spectra were recorded using a spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer, UV/VIS, Lambda 650) for the range of 200 to 800 nm. The Infrared studies were taken using Fourier transform infrared microscopy (FT-IR) with a Bruker FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo iS50 SMARTITX). The Raman spectra were taken using Raman Spectroscopy with Horiba, XploRATM Plus, using a 532 nm laser for the range of 1000 cm -1 -1 Fluorescent stability analysis The fluorescent stability of the PS-CQDs was analysed by introducing various concentrations of NaCl. In the as-prepared PS-CQDs, different concentrations of NaCl (0.125 M, 0.25 M, 0.375 M, 0.5 M, and 0.625 M) were added, and the PL intensity was recorded for the excitation wavelength of 380 nm for all concentrations.

A schematic illustration depicting the functionalization of PS-CQDs and conjugation with doxorubicin is shown in Fig. S1 Drug release The drug release studies were carried out in PBS at pH 6.5 and 7.4. For this, 25 mg of DOX-PS-CQDs were added to 2.5 mL of PBS filled within the dialysis membrane, and this membrane was immersed in 22.5 mL of PBS solution. This setup was kept with continuous shaking. At defined intervals, 2 mL of PBS was collected and replaced with the same quantity of fresh PBS. The optical absorbance of the collected samples was recorded at 480 nm.

This is a simple assay based on the decolouration of DPPH when oxidized, which changes from purple to yellow. The colour change is the measurement of free radical scavenging done by the PS-CQDs. In a 50 µM concentration of DPPH solution, different concentration of PS-CQDs is added (100–500 µg/mL), and is made up to 3 mL. These were kept in the dark for 30 min, and then the effect of decolouration was measured using UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy. The optical absorption at 517 nm was measured, and the percentage of free radical scavenging activity was calculated using Eqs. 4 4 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:Free\\:Radicals\\:Scavenging\\:Activiy\\:\\left(\\%\\right)=\\frac{{A}_{Control}-\\:{A}_{Sample}}{{A}_{ Control}}\\:\\times\\:100$$\\end{document} Statistical analysis All experiments were performed in triplicate ( n t Results and Discussion Structural and morphological analysis The morphological characteristics of the PS-CQDs are analysed using HRTEM imaging.

Figure 3 * 3 3  Fig. 3 (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) It can be seen that the intensity of the emission spectra reaches a maximum for the excitation of 400 nm. An emission maximum of 470 nm was obtained for an excitation of 400 nm. For higher excitations above 400 nm, the intensity of the emission spectra began to drop. Figure 3 34 35 3 When there is a large Stoke shift, the overlap between the absorption and emission spectra can be avoided. The fluorescent quantum yield of the sample was calculated using the relative method and was found to be ~1.04%. This may be due to a very low percentage of nitrogen. From XPS analysis, it was noticed that 0.1% of the nitrogen content in the PS-CQDS. Higher nitrogen percentage contributes to higher quantum yield through electron entrapment on the surface of the PS-CQDs 36 37 Figure 3 5 5 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:{\\tau\\:}_{av}=\\frac{{\\tau\\:}_{1}{B}_{1}+{\\tau\\:}_{2}{B}_{2}+{\\tau\\:}_{3}{B}_{3}}{{B}_{1}\\times\\:{B}_{2}\\times\\:{B}_{3}}$$\\end{document} where τ av τ 1 τ 2 τ 3 1 2 3 3 13 36 38 5 39 The surface of the PS-CQDs is very important, and it plays a vital role in the process of functionalization and drug conjugation. Apart from studying the surface functional groups, the surface charge can also be analysed. The zeta potential was carried out to examine the surface charge of the PS-CQDs sample. Figure 3 27 28 27 40 The hydrodynamic radius of the PS-CQDs sample is measured using the DLS technique. Figure 3 41 Analysis of fluorescent stability The stability of the fluorescent emission of PS-CQDs is analysed by introducing different concentrations of NaCl, and the PL emission spectra were taken and compared with the blank. Fig. S2 shows the graph depicting the PL stability of PS-CQDs exposed to varying concentrations of NaCl (0.125–0.625 M). From this, it is obvious that the PL emission of PS-CQDs in even high salt concentrations shows very little change in PL emission. Hence has exhibited great stability. Antioxidant scavenging activity The free radical scavenging of the as-synthesised PS-CQDs was evaluated by DPPH assay shown in Fig. S3. Varying concentrations of PS-CQDs were introduced to the DPPH solution, and the scavenging was measured by UV-Visible spectroscopy. The percentage of free radical scavenging of PS-CQDs is calculated and found to have 59 ± 1.16% scavenging activity for 100 µg/mL of PS-CQDs. A high scavenging percentage of 84.7 ± 0.85% was obtained for PS-CQDs at a concentration of 500 µg/mL ( n 13 FT-IR spectrum of DOX-PS-CQDs The hydrazine group of the functionalized PS-CQDs is activated using EDC and NHS, after which it is conjugated with DOX and forms complexes. The percentage of drug loading capacity is calculated using the optical absorbance of the supernatant collected and recorded at 480 nm. The obtained drug loading percentage in this study (90.68%) is comparatively better than previous studies given in the literature 5 42 43 4  Fig. 4 (a) (b) (c) The peak at 1662 cm − 1 − 1 − 1 − 1 44 − 1 8 − 1 2 − 1 − 1 42 The conjugation of the drug is also confirmed using UV-Visible absorption spectra. Figure 4 In-vitro The doxorubicin conjugated sample (DOX-PS-CQDs) was now used to study the drug release profiles. Since the release is pH dependent due to doxorubicin bound through a hydrazine linkage, the drug release is studied at two different pH 7.4 and 6.5. Figure 4 8 42 8 45 Kinetic models for drug release profile The release profile depends on several parameters such as particle size distribution, physical properties of the material, drug concentration, and material stability. These parameters are utilized to obtain a mathematical model of the drug release. To further understand the pH dependant release of the drug, a comparison of the experimental drug release profiles (at pH 7.4 and 6.5) with standard kinetics models was performed. These models are used to gain a much clearer understanding of the release kinetics, which plays a significant role in the development of the desired drug delivery system 46 47 The zero-order kinetic model is represented by the mathematical Eq. 6 6 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:{Q}_{t}=k.t+{Q}_{0}$$\\end{document} The Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetic model is represented by the mathematical Eq. 7 7 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:{Q}_{t}=k.{t}^{n}$$\\end{document} The Weibull kinetic model is represented by the mathematical Eq. 8 8 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:\\text{ln}\\left[-\\text{ln}\\left(1-{Q}_{t}\\right)\\right]=\\text{ln}\\left(\\alpha\\:\\right)+\\beta\\:.\\text{l}\\text{n}\\left(t\\right)$$\\end{document} The Hill equation kinetic model is represented by the mathematical Eq. 9 9 \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$\\:{Q}_{t}=\\frac{{Q}_{max}.{t}^{n}}{{k}^{n}+{t}^{n}}$$\\end{document} where, Q t 0 0 max  Fig. 5 Comparison of experimental drug release profiles at pH 7.4 and 6.5 with (a) (b) (c) (d) The fitting curve of the in-vitro drug release profile for DOX-PS-CQDs samples in pH 7.4 and 6.5 are shown in Fig. 5 2 2 2 1 46 48  Table 1 Release kinetics of DOX-PS-CQDs sample. pH of the medium Correlation coefficient ( R 2 Zero order Korsmeyer-peppas Weibull Hill equation 7.4 0.9560 0.9636 0.9799 0.9909 6.5 0.9597 0.9753 0.9951 0.9964 The cumulative drug release in PBS medium of pH 7.4 and 6.5 is compared, where the release percentages are similar up to 3 h, after which a drastic difference is noticed. At the 3rd hour, the release percentage at pH 7.4 and 6.5 is 13.08% and 13.75%, respectively. But, at the 4th hour, the release percentage in acidic medium increases considerably. The percentage of drug release at 4th hour was 16.34% and 22.92% at pH 7.4 and 6.5, respectively. This trend continues with a significant increase in release percentage in acidic medium. The difference in final release percentage of the two was approximately 26%.

Figure 6 Conclusion In this work, simple green synthesis was employed for the preparation of PS-CQDs from biomass waste, providing a means for low-cost, sustainable, and eco-friendly synthesis. Its optical properties were studied using UV-vis and PL analysis, and PS-CQDs were determined to have blue fluorescence. The structural properties were studied using XRD, Raman spectroscopy and were found to be partially amorphous in nature. HRTEM analysis was carried out to analyse the size and shape of the PS-CQDs particles. It was found to be at an average size of ~ 2.1 nm. The PS-CQDs used as a nanocarrier for Doxorubicin drug delivery against MDA MB231 cell line. At pH 7.4 and 6.5, the cumulative release was found to be 55.4 and 81.4%, which proves the pH-sensitive release of doxorubicin.
