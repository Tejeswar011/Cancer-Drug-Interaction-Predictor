This manuscript highlights those discussions, offering not only a comprehensive resource for researchers and clinicians in the field but also a deeper understanding of the implementation of adoptive cellular therapies (ACTs) in the treatment regimen. Abstract Background: In September of 2024, the 2nd annual meeting of the Strategic Advances in Sarcoma Science (SASS) convened at the National Institutes of Health. This gathering of national sarcoma experts focused on preclinical studies, clinical trials, opportunities, challenges, and future directions in sarcoma biology and clinical care with a focus on immunotherapy. The Immunology in Sarcoma breakout group conducted a dedicated discussion focused on the current and future implementation of adoptive cellular therapies (ACTs) in sarcomas. The current manuscript summarizes these discussions and provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and clinicians. Results: Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) has shown encouraging results in sarcomas with afami-cel achieving durable responses in synovial sarcoma and early TCR-T trials against NY-ESO-1 and MAGE-A4 demonstrating meaningful response rates. Building on these outcomes will require discovering new targets, selecting optimal cell types, refining conditioning regimens, combining with alternative treatment strategies such as TKIs, and leveraging predictive biomarkers informed by a deeper understanding of the tumor microenvironment. Conclusions: Sarcomas are promising targets for adoptive cell therapy (ACT), as shown by afami-cel’s success in synovial sarcoma, but broader impact requires new target discovery, optimal cell selection, improved conditioning, combination treatments, deeper tumor microenvironment understanding, and predictive biomarkers to achieve more durable responses for more patients. sarcoma immunotherapy TCR chimeric antigen receptor adoptive cellular therapies (ACTs) NIH/NCI SPORE 1P50CA272170 This work was supported, in part, by NIH/NCI SPORE 1P50CA272170 (EER, JAF, SMP, NJL). pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access yes pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript no pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes 1. Introduction Sarcomas, broadly categorized as soft tissue and bone sarcomas, represent approximately one hundred distinct pathologic entities and arise from the connective tissues [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 Sarcomas present several biology-based treatment challenges [ 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 Figure 1 2. Results 2.1. Adoptive Cell Therapy Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) has revolutionized cancer treatment, eliciting durable remissions and even cures in some patients with advanced disease [ 31 32 33 34 + 35 36 37 34 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 44 44 45 Multiple challenges must be overcome to realize the full potential of ACT in the management of sarcoma. One critical objective is the identification of novel target antigens. The mesenchymal origin of sarcomas may make them particularly vulnerable to cellular therapies due to expression of antigens that are not expressed in most normal cells [ 48 43 49 50 31 32 33 47 31 32 33 51 52 53 54 55 51 52 56 57 58 2.2. Target Identification The underlying assumption in immune targeting of cancers using ACT with immune effector cells is that tumor cells aberrantly express proteins and carry passenger or driver mutations that exist in cancer cells but have little to no expression in normal healthy cells. These changes are thought to generate two classes of targetable antigens: tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), including tumor differentiation antigens (TDAs) that might be expressed in normal tissues but are significantly overexpressed in tumor tissue, and tumor-specific antigens (TSAs), which are expressed only in tumor tissue [ 35 As membrane-associated proteins; As part of a peptide-human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) complex after antigens undergo proteasomal cleavage and are loaded into HLA molecules for trafficking to and presentation on the cell surface. ACT therapies broadly make use of one of two mechanisms of antigen recognition: antibody-based approaches relying on high affinity binding between immune receptors and intact surface proteins or TCR-based approaches using either TCRs or TCR-mimics relying on a TCR recognition pattern of pHLA complexes [ 59 While some TAAs and TSAs are unique to a specific tumor cell type and acquired over time through passenger mutations, targeting these “private” or individualized antigens can be costly and cumbersome, leading to a therapeutic pipeline that is not easily translated into the clinic. Additionally, most sarcomas have few of these passenger mutations and an overall low mutational burden [ 19 60 61 62 63 64 65 59 65 66 While immunohistochemistry or next-generation sequencing (NGS) data can help identify candidate proteins, and in silico prediction algorithms such as NET-MHC can predict if epitopes derived from them can bind common HLA molecules, there is an increasing appreciation for the need to empirically verify the presence of tumor antigen pHLA on the surface of tumor cells using immunopeptidomics [ 64 67 68 69 Expression of HLA molecules by tumor cells; Proteasomal cleavage of the tumor protein such that an epitope capable of binding the HLA of interest is generated; and Adequate antigen-presenting machinery to load the cleaved epitope into HLA molecules and traffic pHLA to the cell surface [ 64 70 71 72 73 Understanding optimal targets cannot be divorced from immune effector receptor development and functional avidity, which is determined by both immune receptor affinity and antigen density. TCR affinity for antigens is relatively low by design, as TCRs are notoriously promiscuous and capable of recognizing multiple epitopes. TCR mimics, which are antibody-like binders, have nanomolar affinities for their cognate ligand. It is possible that such high-affinity interactions may impair downstream anti-tumor activity, as recent work by the Schietinger lab suggests that high signal strength interactions lead to effector cell dysfunction [ 74 75 76 77 Identifying shared or common tumor antigens derived from proteins essential for tumorigenesis. Validating target presentation using HLA immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry and consider performing these experiments invoking the immune proteasome. Performing rigorous studies of both antigen density on target tumor cells as well as receptor avidity for pHLA with careful consideration of immune effector product development (i.e., TCR vs. TCR-mimic receptor). 2.3. Key Issues Related to Cell Product Development The type of cell and its source dictate the utility and therapeutic efficacy. Cells can be stem or adult cells and autologous or allogeneic [ 78 79 80 80 81 In early solid tumor ACT trials, T cells were most frequently used—predominantly tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)—and later, engineered T cells such as TCR-T and CAR-T cells. While TIL therapy has been successful and is now FDA approved for use in melanoma [ 82 83 84 85 86 87 81 Engineered TCR-T cell therapy has garnered recent attention with the FDA approval of afami-cel in metastatic synovial sarcoma [ 88 35 89 81 80 89 90 91 91 Additional cell types, such as NK, NKT, and myeloid cells, have been explored as HLA-independent options and offer promise. NK cells accomplish direct and indirect tumor cell killing by the release of perforins/granzymes and through antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, which are independent of specific antigens and can link the adaptive and innate immune systems [ 81 92 93 94 95 46 46 96 + 97 97 98 2.4. Additional Opportunities in Cell Manufacturing CAR-T cell manufacturing involves an intricate process from the extraction of T cells to genetic modification and expansion. Finding ways to optimize and streamline CAR-T cell production could help to reduce costs and increase accessibility. Despite some of the individual differences between patients, there is some heterogeneity in the phenotypes of cells used for CAR-T. By using Artificial Intelligence (AI), some of the manufacturing can be streamlined and optimized for better efficiency. Through the creation of signaling motif libraries, thousands of different CAR co-stimulatory signaling domains can be analyzed to engineer the optimal combination for each CAR and tumor type [ 99 100 101 Since the first FDA approval of T cell-based therapy, the field of cellular immunotherapy has greatly expanded and now includes many more cell types and approaches. While two cellular therapies have recently been approved for solid tumor indications (one for synovial sarcoma) [ 82 88 Figure 2 2.5. Conditioning Regimens Conditioning chemotherapy regimens play an important role in delivering cell therapies. These regimens vary greatly across studies and institutions and are reviewed elsewhere [ 102 103 104 2.6. Timing of Cell Product Administration Tumor burden is perhaps the most broadly shared correlate with responsiveness to cell therapy. While there are limited data for sarcomas, cell therapy for solid tumors and hematological malignancies have supported a low-disease burden state as a positive predictor of response. Results from the GD2-CART01 cell therapy trial for neuroblastoma indicated that patients with high disease burden had no responses compared to 67% of low disease burden patients at 3 years [ 105 106 107 38 These findings support moving cell therapy upfront for high-risk sarcomas once a minimal residual disease state is attained. Some sarcomas, particularly among the pediatric and adolescent/young adult population, are highly responsive to chemotherapy and can undergo complete response but have a high relapse rate. It is conceivable that adoptive T cell therapy may be most effective at this stage of treatment. A tradeoff of this approach which needs to be considered is that the lack of evaluable disease sites makes interpreting clinical responses challenging. Comparisons to historical outcome data are challenging since treatments continue to evolve, and the general improvement in providing care for cancer patients can lead to an overestimation of the effectiveness of cell therapy. Considering the financial cost of cell therapy, having clear evaluable disease sites will continue to be important for testing new cell therapies. It also remains unclear, particularly for sarcomas, whether high tumor burden alters the functionality of infused T cells or if it simply reflects a more aggressive disease state. Correlative studies in future cell therapy trials may help distinguish efficacy from tumor burden, the T cell therapy phenotype, and sarcomas’ intrinsic properties. 2.7. Cell Therapy in Patients Requiring Other Targeted Therapy The use of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors routinely used for the treatment of GIST and many other sarcomas may also play a potential role in potentiating cellular therapy. In animal models, imatinib depleted CD4 + 108 109 + 110 2.8. Persistence and Expansion of Cell Therapies in Patients After Administration Adoptively transferred T cell persistence and expansion is of utmost importance to understand, as both factors are associated with treatment outcomes for sarcoma patients. In clinical trials of patients with synovial sarcoma treated with afami-cel, most patients exhibited a peak around the first week, but there was a considerable variation in persistence as measured by copies per µg of DNA after infusion [ 38 38 111 112 113 114 The analysis of peripheral CAR-T cells in adjacent sites, such as ascites or cerebrospinal fluid, has also been explored as part of biodistribution. Hass et al. reported 29 days of persistence in two of five patients, and DNA copies were detected in peritoneal fluid on day 14, with higher copies than in blood [ 115 105 Instead of tracking bulk numbers of CAR-T cells, some studies have assessed populations of different T cell subsets like effector or central memory in the infused product or circulation by assaying CD45RA, CD45RO, CCR7, and CD27 staining and relating their expansion to clinical benefit [ 112 116 117 + − 116 105 + − 111 2.9. Tumor Microenvironment The sarcoma TME is a complex, dynamic, and hostile “ecosystem” whose cellular and non-cellular components pose several barriers to CAR-T cell trafficking and effectiveness [ 118 119 120 121 To successfully traffic to the tumor, peripherally infused CAR-T cells must first traverse the tumor vasculature. This process requires the production of appropriate chemokines by the endothelial cells and tumor stroma, namely CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CCL5 [ 122 123 124 125 Even after successfully infiltrating the tumor, CAR-T cells must contend with potent immunosuppressive forces within the TME. The most well-described cellular barriers to CAR-T cells in the TME are immune cells, particularly immunosuppressive myeloid cells and regulatory T cells. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) comprise one type of immunosuppressive myeloid cell in the sarcoma TME [ 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 2.10. Biomarkers for CAR-T Therapies in Solid Tumors RECIST imaging is broadly used in sarcoma clinical trials, but many investigators feel it is inadequate, and developing improved measurements to evaluate CAR-T cell efficacy is another opportunity for translational research. The challenges are the lack of a consensus on time points, sample types, analytes, and technologies, all of which are vital for discovering biomarkers. However, the potential of new biomarkers offers hope and optimism for the future of CAR-T therapies. What we have learned from CAR-T therapy success in blood malignancies by tracking clinical response cannot be fully reproduced for solid tumors, considering their different biology. For example, in blood malignancies with durable responses and high levels of persistent cells in the blood, the peak of peripheral blood CAR-T cell expansion is around 7–14 days [ 132 133 Lower tumor burden defined by clinical and radiographic assessment positively impacts response prediction. In the clinical trial phase1/2 with GD2-CART01 for neuroblastoma, lower disease burden at infusion predicted response and survival compared to those with higher burden [ 105 111 38 105 111 134 135 136 The identification of blood-based biomarkers to predict the success of cellular therapy is another key goal for the field. For instance, Hassan et al. found in patients with mesothelin-expressing solid tumors that serum levels of soluble mesothelin-related peptides (SMRPs) and megakaryocytic potentiating factor (MPF) decreased with treatment and were significantly lower in patients with radiographical response [ 137 112 114 138 139 111 140 141 142 143 144 3. Conclusions In many ways, sarcomas are an ideal disease target for the development of ACT as demonstrated by the great success of afami-cel in synovial sarcoma patients. However, there is a great deal of work to be completed in order to improve ACT and bring its benefits to all sarcoma patients. The identification of novel targets is a critical issue as well as identification of the ideal cell types for use in therapy. Future efforts to make manufacturing more efficient and cost effective may help overcome the logistic barriers which remain significant for these therapies. Better conditioning and combination post-treatment therapies including TKIs may yet further improve ACT efficacy, and a deeper understanding of the TME may help us best design these strategies. Biomarkers may help us treat patients most appropriately. Despite considerable challenges, we are optimistic that ACT will improve and deliver deeper and durable responses to more sarcoma patients.
