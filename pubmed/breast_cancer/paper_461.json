While BI-RADS-MRI classification demonstrates high sensitivity, specificities vary. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of machine learning models utilizing radiomics features derived from synthetic MRI to distinguish benign from malignant breast masses. Methods Patients who underwent breast MRI, including a multi-dynamic multi-echo (MDME) sequence using 3.0 T MRI, and had histopathologically diagnosed enhanced breast mass lesions were retrospectively included. Clinical features, lesion shape features, texture features, and textural evaluation metrics were extracted. Machine learning models were trained and evaluated, and an ensemble model integrating BI-RADS and the machine learning model was also assessed. Results A total of 199 lesions (48 benign, 151 malignant) in 199 patients were included in the cross-validation dataset, while 43 lesions (15 benign, 28 malignant) in 40 new patients were included in the test dataset. For the test dataset, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic for BI-RADS were 100%, 33.3%, 76.7%, and 0.667, respectively. The logistic regression model yielded 64.3% sensitivity, 80.0% specificity, 69.8% accuracy, and an AUC of 0.707. The ensemble model achieved 82.1% sensitivity, 86.7% specificity, 83.7% accuracy, and an AUC of 0.883. The AUC of the ensemble model was significantly larger than that of both BI-RADS and the machine learning model. Conclusion The ensemble model integrating BI-RADS and machine learning improved lesion classification.

Previous studies have reported that these quantitative values aid in differentiating benign from malignant breast lesions [ 5 6 “SyMRI” (SyntheticMR, Linköping, Sweden) which is one of synthetic MRI techniques enable simultaneous acquisition of quantitative T1, T2, and proton density (PD) maps from a single sequence. In this application, images are acquired using a two-dimensional fast spin echo (2D FSE) multi-dynamic, multi-echo (MDME) sequence that collects eight complex-valued images per slice with four saturation delays and two echo times (Fig. 1 7 8 9 Radiomics is an advanced imaging analysis method that extracts numerous features, including morphology, histogram, and texture characteristics, from clinical images, enhancing diagnostic accuracy by identifying key imaging biomarkers [ 10 11 12 13 15 Hwang et al. evaluated the ability of a logistic regression model incorporating radiomics features derived from synthetic MRI to predict pathologic complete response to NAC in 181 participants with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Their findings suggested that quantitative maps obtained from synthetic MRI-based radiomics features, particularly when acquired at mid-treatment, may be useful for identifying early NAC responders in TNBC [ 16 The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of machine learning models incorporating radiomics features extracted from synthetic MRI images of the breast, both before and after contrast enhancement, to differentiate between benign and malignant breast mass lesions. Methods Clinical data This study was approved by the institutional review board of the author’s hospital. Patients who underwent contrast-enhanced breast MRI with a protocol including an MDME sequence on a 3.0 T MRI scanner (SIGNA Architect, GE HealthCare, Milwaukee, WI) between February 2018 and August 2022 were retrospectively included. A histopathological diagnosis obtained via biopsy or surgery was considered the gold standard for lesion classification as benign or malignant. The inclusion criteria consisted of patients who underwent breast MRI with pre- and post-contrast MDME sequences. Patients were excluded if (1) no breast lesion in breast MRI was identified, (2) only non-mass lesions were present, (3) the lesion was too small to be detected on quantitative value maps, (4) the histopathological diagnosis was inconclusive regarding malignancy, or (5) NAC had been administered before MRI. Patients were divided into training and test cohorts. The test cohort consisted of a temporally independent consecutive case series. In the training cohort, if multiple masses were present in a single patient, only the largest mass per patient was included. In the test cohort, if multiple masses were present in a single case, the largest mass per breast was included. MRI imaging protocols and quantitative image analysis Breast MRI was performed using a 3.0 T system (SIGNA Architect, GE HealthCare, Milwaukee, WI) with an eight-channel phased-array breast surface coil. All patients were scanned in the prone position. The imaging sequences included in this study are shown in Fig. 2 17 18  Fig. 1 Schematic overview of synthetic MRI. Complex-valued images were acquired using four saturation delays and two echo times. Post-processing was performed using the dedicated commercial application SyMRI NEURO to generate quantitative T1, T2, and proton density (PD) maps Fig. 2 The MRI protocol of this study. MDME; multi-dynamic multi-echo, DWI: diffusion-weighted imaging, DCE-MRI: dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI The DCE-MRI acquisitions were performed using a T1-weighted 3D fast spoiled gradient-recalled echo sequence with parallel volume imaging for breast assessment (Volume Imaged Breast Assessment [VIBRANT], GE HealthCare). The DCE-MRI sequence parameters were as follows: TR, 7.2 ms; TE, 2.4 ms; flip angle, 10°; FOV, 350 × 329 mm; number of slices, 224; slice thickness, 1.4 mm; and acquisition matrix, 350 × 256. Following an intravenous injection of a gadolinium-based contrast agent at a rate of 2 mL/s and a dose of 0.2 mmol/kg, six post-contrast dynamic scans were acquired. The first post-contrast sequence was acquired 60 s after contrast injection, with the subsequent five series acquired at 60-s intervals. Quantitative T1 and T2 relaxation time maps (Q-maps) were obtained from MDME sequence images. A T1/T2 ratio map was created by calculating the pixel-wise ratio of T1 and T2 values. As both T1 and T2 maps were generated from a single MDME pulse sequence, no misregistration occurred between them, enabling precise pixel-based ratio calculations. Lesion segmentation on synthetic MRI The local extent of lesion boundaries on synthetic MRI was unclear, making precise annotation challenging (Additional file 1 A board-certified radiologist identified the lesion on all datasets using the resliced DCE-MRI images and manually delineated the visible lesion boundary on all slices containing the lesion using 3D segmentation tools in Insight Toolkit-SNAP (ITK-SNAP) software [ 19 Image registration As the scans were performed at two different time points (before and after contrast injection), patient motion may have occurred. This motion resulted in misregistration between DCE-MRI and MDME images. To correct this misalignment, 3D co-registration was performed between the DCE-MRI and MDME image volumes (Additional file 2 20 Feature extraction and analysis The feature extraction process in this study is summarized in Fig. 3  Fig. 3 Summary of the feature extraction process. Clinical features, lesion shape features, and textural evaluation metrics were extracted from electronic medical records and MRI images Clinical features Clinical features included age, menopausal status, and presence or absence of symptoms, extracted from electronic medical records at the time of breast MRI. Lesion shape features Fourteen morphological shape features were extracted from the lesion boundary on DCE-MRI, as annotated by a radiologist. The boundary was smoothed and inflated using binary dilation with a 3 × 3 kernel mask.

A stratified five-fold cross-validation was performed on the training dataset. Due to class imbalance, where benign lesions were the minority class, the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach for Imbalanced Learning (ADASYN) algorithm [ 23 The final model performance was evaluated on the test dataset after training on the full training set. Additionally, feature importance was analyzed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values [ 24 BI-RADS-MRI Breast lesion categorization in the test cohort was performed using the BI-RADS-MRI lexicon from BI-RADS 5th. Two radiologists independently evaluated contrast-enhanced MR images, and in cases of disagreement, a final category was determined by consensus. For the BI-RADS-MRI assessment, category 3 masses were defined as benign, and category 4 or 5 masses were defined as malignant. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were calculated using histopathological diagnosis as the gold standard. Ensemble algorithm An ensemble algorithm integrating BI-RADS-MRI and the trained machine learning model was applied. Category 3 lesions remained benign, and category 5 lesions remained malignant, while category 4 lesions were reclassified by the machine learning model. Performance metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC, were calculated based on histopathological diagnosis as the reference standard. Statistical analysis The mean Dice coefficient with and without inflation was compared using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. BI-RADS-MRI category agreement between two radiologists was assessed using the weighted Cohen’s Kappa coefficient. The AUCs of BI-RADS-MRI, the machine learning model, and the ensemble method were compared using the DeLong test with Bonferroni correction (three comparisons). A significance level of p Computer environment Machine learning was conducted on Ubuntu 20.04 Long-Term Support using an Intel Xeon Silver 4108 CPU (8 cores, 1.80 GHz) and an NVIDIA Quadro Ray Tracing Texel eXtreme (RTX) 5000 Graphics Processing Unit. Results Dataset split A total of 471 patients who underwent breast MRI with pre- and post-contrast MDME sequences were included. Patients were excluded based on the following criteria: 44 patients in whom no enhanced lesion in breast MRI was detected, 92 patients with non-mass lesions, 12 patients with small lesions, 33 patients with unclear benign or malignant status in histopathological diagnosis, and 51 patients who received NAC before MRI. After excluding 232 patients, the final dataset comprised 199 lesions (48 benign, 151 malignant) from 199 patients for cross-validation and 43 lesions (15 benign, 28 malignant) from 40 patients for testing. Subtype details are provided in Additional files 3 4 Inter-annotator agreement The mean Dice coefficients for the two radiologists were 0.845 ± 0.086 (95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.813–0.878) with inflation and 0.783 ± 0.116 (95% CI, 0.740–0.827) without inflation. Dice scores with inflation were significantly higher than those without inflation ( p BI-RADS-MRI The weighted Cohen’s Kappa coefficient for BI-RADS category agreement between the two radiologists was 0.853 (95% CI, 0.796–0.911), indicating strong interobserver agreement. In the final BI-RADS assessment categories, the cross-validation dataset contained 17 lesions in category 3 (17 benign), 119 in category 4 (30 benign, 89 malignant), and 63 in category 5 (1 benign, 62 malignant). For the cross-validation dataset, BI-RADS achieved sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC value of 100% (95% CI, 97.6–100.0), 35.4% (95% CI, 22.2–50.5), 84.4% (95% CI,78.6–89.2), and 0.677 (95% CI, 0.609–0.745), respectively. Accuracy by category was 100% for category 3, 74.8% (95% CI, 66.0–82.3) for category 4, and 98.4% (95% CI, 91.5–100.0) for category 5. The test dataset contained 5 lesions in category 3 (5 benign), 29 in category 4 (10 benign, 19 malignant), and 9 in category 5 (9 malignant). For the test dataset, BI-RADS achieved sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC value of 100% (95% CI, 87.6–100.0), 33.3% (95% CI, 11.8–61.6), 76.7% (95% CI, 61.4–88.2), and 0.667 (95% CI, 0.543–0.790), respectively. Accuracy was 100% for categories 3 and 5, and 65.5% (95% CI, 45.7–82.0) for category 4. Machine learning models The average diagnostic performance of each machine learning model on the stratified five-fold cross-validation dataset is shown in Table 2 On the test dataset, LR achieved sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC value of 64.3% (95% CI, 44.1–81.4), 80.0% (95% CI, 51.9–95.7), 69.8% (95% CI, 53.9–82.8), and 0.707 (95% CI, 0.535–0.879), respectively. On the subset of BI-RADS category 3 (all benign), LR achieved accuracy of 80.0% (95% CI, 28.4–99.5). On the subset of BI-RADS category 4, LR achieved sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC value of 73.7% (95% CI, 48.8–90.9), 80.0% (95% CI, 44.4–97.5), 75.9% (95% CI, 56.6–89.7), and 0.695 (95% CI, 0.477–0.912), respectively. On the subset of BI-RADS category 5 (all malignant), LR achieved accuracy of 44.4% (95% CI, 13.7–78.8).

The ensemble algorithm outperformed individual models, achieving a significantly higher AUC than those of both BI-RADS and the machine learning model. MRI scan protocols acquire images in multiple independent sequences and planes. T1- and T2-weighted images are visually assessed for signal intensity, but signal intensities from relative images cannot be directly compared across examinations or patients due to variations in acquisition parameters and scanner settings. Moreover, image contrast in these sequences is influenced not only by tissue relaxation times but also by radio frequency field variations, coil sensitivity, proton density, and other factors [ 25 26 Quantitative MRI values, such as T1 and T2, have emerged as promising tools for lesion characterization. Previous studies suggest these values aid in differentiating benign from malignant breast lesions [ 5 6 T1/T2 mapping has been investigated for differentiating benign from malignant lesions in various organs, including the breast [ 27 28 p 29 27 Previous studies indicate that visual support from additional images (e.g., post-contrast T1-weighted images) is necessary for radiomics feature extraction, as lesion contours are often unclear in quantitative value maps [ 16 BI-RADS-MRI categorization is widely used for assessing benign and malignant breast masses in clinical settings [ 2 3 2 30 31 32 BI-RADS-MRI categorization demonstrates high sensitivity but variable specificity for breast cancer [ 4 4 Previous research suggests that incorporating manually measured quantitative values from synthetic MRI alongside DCE-MRI evaluation improves diagnostic performance for BI-RADS-MRI category 4 lesions [ 33 The ensemble algorithm combining BI-RADS-MRI and machine learning with radiomics features from weighted images achieves high diagnostic performance by reclassifying BI-RADS-MRI category 4 lesions [ 34 35 34 35 In this study, we reduced the number of features using the VIF and the Boruta algorithm. Among the retained features, those identified as important in the LR model included menopausal status, minor axis length, age, and select TEMs. The finding that age is a key feature aligns with statistical data indicating that breast cancer incidence varies by age [ 1 This study has some limitations. First, it is a single-institution, single-vendor observational study. Previous research in head MRI demonstrated high reproducibility of quantitative values using synthetic MRI across different MRI vendors [ 36 37 Conclusions We evaluated machine learning models utilizing radiomics features from synthetic MRI-derived quantitative value maps for differentiating benign and malignant breast masses. Our findings suggest that diagnostic performance improves when an ensemble algorithm integrating BI-RADS-MRI and machine learning is applied.
