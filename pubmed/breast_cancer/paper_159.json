Introduction With the rapid progress of modern medicine, discovering a cure for cancer is a common aspiration for all humankind. Although surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy (RT), targeted therapy, and immunotherapy are widely used clinical treatments for cancer, their limitations including side effects and poor prognosis remain unavoidable. Surgery has limited efficacy against metastatic tumors and often causes severe surgical trauma. 1–3 4–6 7,8 9–14 Among these therapeutic approaches, gas therapy has rapidly become a cutting-edge hotspot in cancer treatment due to the unique tissue penetration and multi-target action mechanisms associated with gas molecules. 15–17 2 2 2 2 18–21 2 2 O 2 2 2 19,22 23–26 2 27–29 For cancer treatment, improving drug delivery is one of the most important and effective ways to enhance efficacy and safety. Advanced drug delivery systems can precisely deliver drugs to the interior of tumor tissues by strengthening the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect or through active targeting techniques and control their release behavior. 30–32 17,33–35 in situ 17,36 + 2 2 16,37 38 39–45 In this review, we systematically summarize the anti-tumor capacities of O 2 2 Fig. 1 Fig. 1 Schematic illustration of gas-mediated cancer therapy, including the gas types, representative materials, methods of gas generation and mechanism of action. 2. O 2 Like food and water, O 2 2 versus 46 2 2 46,47 47–49 Hypoxia is a major obstacle for most O 2 49 2 2 2.1 Using carriers for O 2 The most direct way to increase the O 2 2 2 2 2 50,51 Among different kinds of O 2 2 Fig. 2A 51 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 52 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 Fig. 2 O 2 51 2 2 53 2 54 Recently, other highly fluorinated compounds or nanostructures have also been reported to carry O 2 Fig. 2B 53 2 2 Fig. 2C 54 2 2 3 8 2 55 2 56 57 2 2.2 Intracellular H 2 2 2 Exogenous O 2 2 2 2 2 H 2 2 58–60 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3+ 2 As one of the non-invasive treatment methods, PDT has been applied clinically for treating localized tumors and other diseases because of the controllable temporal and spatial light irradiation and relatively mild side effects.

CO-mediated cancer therapy CO, a colorless and odorless carbon–oxygen compound, is gaseous at room temperature. Endogenous CO in humans is mainly produced by heme oxygenase (HO) metabolism and can bind with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (COHb). 80 81 2 2 82 26,82–85 For cancer therapy, the effects of CO can be summarized as follows. Firstly, high concentrations of CO mainly act on the electron transport chain and inhibit the function of cytochrome c oxidase. Redundant electrons escape and directly react with O 2 82,86,87 88 82 89,90 91 To completely leverage the anti-cancer effect of CO, the foremost challenge is achieving precise delivery. Direct inhalation of CO gas is simple and fast, but it cannot guarantee the metrological controllability and targeted selectivity. Therefore, controllable CO donors and CO delivery nanoplatforms have always been the focus of research. In 2002, Motterlini et al. 5 2 10 3 2 2 92 93,94 in situ 95,96 3.1 Transition metal-carbonyl complexes as CO donors Most metal-based CO donors are transition metal-carbonyl complexes, composed of transition metal centers and carbonyl ligands. Under stimulations, such as ROS, pH, heat and light, these CORMs will undergo ligand dissociation to release CO.

Ye's group designed a nano-sonosensitizer (AIBA@FeCuS–FeCO) with ultrasound-activated CO release and cell ferroptosis capacities for the ablation of deep gastric tumors. 103 3 12 3 12 2 2 Fig. 5C 104 2 2 2 2 5 105 5 2+ via 3 12 Fig. 5D 106 2+ Moreover, the application of rhenium (Re) carbonyl complexes in cancer inhibition has been developed for some time. Zhang's group reported a cyanine-linked Re carbonyl complex (Re-Cy) as the CO donor with enhanced sonosensitivity for SDT and CO-mediated gas therapy. 107 108 3.2 Metal-free CO donors and nanosystems Although plenty of transition metal-based CORMs have been established and helped people to understand the mechanism of CO-involved gas therapy, the biological incompatibility, metabolic pathway and potential hazards of metal-based CORMs restrict their application. The development of metal-free CO donors and delivery systems may provide us with new perspectives. 3-Hydroflavone (3-HF), a candidate for CORMs, can precisely and controllably release CO under light irradiation. More importantly, the decomposition products (such as 2-(benzoyloxy)benzoic acid) and other derivatives of 3-HF exhibit low toxicity. On this basis, Xu's group combined HepG2 cell and red blood cell membranes to synthesize biomimetic nanocarriers of DOX and 3-HF. 109 In recent years, Ji's group focused on developing metal-free CORMs. In 2022, their group designed a new type of metal-free CO donor (FL3) and devised a H 2 2 Fig. 6A 110 2 2 2 2 − − 111 In vitro in vivo Fig. 6B 112 2 2 Fig. 6 Metal-free CO donors and CO 2 110 112 113 2 116 117 Unlike traditional organic or inorganic small molecule gas donors, microbubbles can directly load gases inside and release them under ultrasound pressure. Inspired by this method, Zhang's group synthesized ultrasound-triggered microbubbles (TARC-CO) as carriers of CO ( Fig. 6C 113 3 8 3 In vitro in vivo 3.3 Converting CO 2 Despite the fast development in metal-based or metal-free CORMs, researchers have to face the risk of unwanted CO leakage and potential toxicity due to hemoglobin binding.

NO-mediated cancer therapy NO is an important gaseous signaling molecule that plays a significant role in the nervous system, cardio-cerebrovascular system, and immune system. 25,120–123 l l 120,122,124 More and more research indicated that NO is a “double-edged sword” in NO-mediated gas therapies. 125,126 There are mainly five aspects to explain the toxicity of high levels of NO in cancer cells: (1) damaging the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum; (2) reacting with ROS and being converted to more toxic RNS ( e.g. − 125–127 To accomplish NO-mediated cancer therapy, many strategies are based on targeted NO delivery. Various NO donors have been designed and applied in NO-mediated cancer therapy using nanocarriers. These strategies can be classified into two categories: those activated by endogenous stimuli and those activated by exogenous stimuli. 4.1 NO delivery strategies based on endogenous stimuli Endogenous stimuli, including pH, GSH, ROS, enzymes and other substances which can stimulate NO production in tumor cells, have been widely applied in NO delivery strategies. As the natural substrate of NO, l l 2 2 l 128 2 2 2 2 l l 129 l 2 2 l 2 2 2 2 Fig. 7A 130 l 2 2 2 2 l l l 131 b 2 2 2 2 2 − 2 − − Fig. 7 Endogenous stimuli-triggered NO delivery strategies.

For instance, Zhang's group constructed poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) wrapped hollow Fe 3 4 l LP 3 4 Fig. 7D 136 LP 3 4 l 3 4 + + l 2 + 137 2 4 138 in vitro in vivo 4.2 NO delivery strategies based on exogenous stimuli In addition to the endogenous stimulation methods mentioned above, exogenous stimulation methods also contributed to the delivery of NO, such as light, ultrasound, X-rays and heat. Some NO release strategies based on exogenous light irradiation have been established. For example, Zhang's group chose a NO-conjugated cationic lipid (DPNO(Zn)) as an NO donor and Ce6 as a photosensitizer to form lipid nanoparticles (CNOs). 139 1 2 3 4 l 140 2 2 via l 141 − Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have become a novel light source in phototherapy. Zhang's group reported an implantable NO-release device based on a wirelessly powered LED (wLED) and a NO donor S 142 Fig. 8A 143 In vitro in vivo Fig. 8 Exogenous stimuli-triggered NO delivery strategies.

Reproduced with permission from ref. 143 146 148 3 149 150 Some researchers are aiming to take advantage of heat in cellular NO delivery, and photothermal conversion is an ideal approach to achieve this. Based on this foundation, SNO conjugated Mn-porphyrin NMOFs were constructed by Yin's group for combined magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, NO-mediated gas therapy and PTT. 144 145 Fig. 8B 146 Besides, ultrasound-irradiated NO generation has been employed in NO-mediated cancer therapy. Some strategies are based on ROS generated under ultrasound irradiation and the subsequent release of NO caused by ROS. For example, Lin's group reported a synergistic sonodynamic/gas therapy nanovaccine based on l 147 1 2 1 2 l 1 2 Fig. 8C 148 −  N N sec N N Fig. 8D 149 Fig. 8E 150 3+ 3 4 151 As a star molecule, NO has provided us with countless promising ideas for gas-mediated cancer treatment. In the past several decades, research on its mode of intracellular production and mechanism of action has been extensive. However, there are still many problems to be solved before clinical trials, including a more comprehensive understanding of NO's double-edged nature, easier and less toxic synthesis of NO donors and prevention of premature NO leakage. 5.

Conclusions and perspectives Significant advances and innovative breakthroughs have been made in gas-mediated anti-tumor therapy. Various therapeutic strategies based on O 2 2 137,168–185 First, a more comprehensive and deeper understanding of the anti-tumor effects of therapeutic gases is essential. Current research on the mechanisms of gas-based cancer therapy remains insufficient, especially for H 2 2 2 etc. 2 − 186–189 Second, precise control of gas dosage remains challenging, and real-time monitoring methods are critically lacking. The therapeutic effect of gases on tumor progression is highly concentration-dependent. However, it is difficult to monitor the kinetics of gas release in vivo Third, improving targeting specificity remains critical. On the one hand, distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells is a key factor to be considered in the design of gas donors. Despite their favorable diffusion properties, gas molecules still exhibit significant off-target distribution. Therefore, more comprehensive, multi-level targeting systems need to be designed. A promising approach involves combining tumor-targeting ligands with endogenous and exogenous stimulus-responsive groups. On the other hand, more effective targeting strategies could be developed by focusing on the primary sites of gas activity. For example, since CO is more inclined to inhibit mitochondrial respiration, dual-targeting strategies that integrate cancer cell and mitochondrial targeting groups may enable precise gas delivery to key subcellular regions, thereby enhancing therapeutic outcomes. Fourth, simplifying system design and the biosafety of nanomaterials are also critical considerations. While multifunctional gas delivery systems can provide enhanced capabilities, complex designs may increase the risk of unpredictable toxicity. To solve this problem, the design of nanomaterials should be reasonably simplified, and the use of materials with unclear biocompatibility should also be minimized. In addition, the stability of gas delivery nanosystems is an indispensable factor. For instance, liposomes with excellent biocompatibilities have been extensively used in drug delivery, but their instability often leads to premature drug leakage during blood circulation. Therefore, new nanocarriers with simplified synthesis and better biocompatibility are expected to be discovered. Besides, more rigorous preclinical evaluation is necessary, including tests of stability, biodistribution, and metabolism. Finally, the combination of gas therapy and other therapies should be further diversified. To date, the most popular combination mode is gas therapy and phototherapy. In these cases, light serves both as a therapeutic modality and a trigger for gas release. These combinations typically exhibit enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared to single treatments. However, integrations of gas therapy with SDT, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and gene silencing therapy are relatively rare. Besides, the development of nanoplatforms capable of delivering multiple therapeutic gases simultaneously is still in its early stage. The synergistic effects among therapeutic gases are highly promising. These areas represent important avenues for future investigation.
