Kazi—both from Lund University.  Image: ©joy/Stock.adobe.com Summary Hereditary cancers remind us that genetics is never just about science; it is about people, families, and futures. What begins as a discovery in the laboratory can change how a parent makes decisions about screening, how a clinician guides treatment, or how a community thinks about prevention. Today, advances in gene therapy, RNA-based medicine, biomarkers, and precision tools are expanding what is possible, but their true value lies in how they improve lives. At Hereditas Hereditas and the responsibility of awareness Hereditary cancers are where science meets lived experience. For more than thirty years, since the discovery of BRCA1/2, genetics has given us new ways to identify risk, intervene early, and ultimately save lives. But progress in the laboratory is not enough. It must be connected to the people who need it most, families living with hereditary risk, clinicians guiding prevention, and communities who may not yet be aware of the role their genes play in health. At Hereditas 1 Genetics at the heart of modern oncology Genetics is cancer care, since DNA testing is central to how we prevent, diagnose, and treat malignancies [ 2 3 4 Hereditas Examples from Hereditas: turning discovery into possibility Our recent publications illustrate what this looks like in practice. We have seen cancer therapy shift from blunt chemotherapy toward personalized strategies, while new studies describe how targeted drugs, immunotherapies, mRNA vaccines, and AI-guided omics are emerging to overcome resistance and tailor treatment to the individual [ 5 6 Hereditas 7 8 9 Beyond the lab: broadening access and anticipating risks Our responsibility does not end with the new therapies. Awareness also includes thinking about access, safety, and resistance. In gastric cancer, often diagnosed late, researchers have identified circulating lncRNAs such as PANDAR as promising biomarkers. This could support low-cost screening in community hospitals, where advanced imaging is unavailable [ 10 Hereditas 11 12 13 14 15 Why awareness matters When we look across these contributions, a clear pattern emerges.
