See: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/ Abstract Question The rising prevalence of mental health conditions and a global treatment gap demand new solutions that address symptoms and foster psychological well-being. Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) and ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) are emerging mobile health approaches, providing real-time, personalised support. However, the effectiveness of current JITAIs/EMIs and the longevity of effects remain uncertain. Study selection and analysis Studies investigating the effectiveness of JITAIs/EMIs for depression, anxiety and indicators of psychological well-being, published between 2018 and May 2025, were eligible. Following the standards for reporting (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses; PRISMA) and quality assessment (Risk of Bias; RoB), a total of K=23 studies and N=2563 individuals (71.7% female) were included. Findings JITAIs/EMIs showed a small between-group effect (g=0.15, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.26, p=0.003). Nine studies reported follow-up effects (mean follow-up time M=3.06 months, SD=2.21) with significant results at 1 and 3–6 months. Interventions shorter than 6 weeks yielded greater longevity of effects (g=0.71, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.24, p=0.008). Funnel plots and sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness of findings. Risk of bias was moderate to high for intervention adherence and missing outcome data. Conclusions Currently existing JITAIs and EMIs slightly improve mental health, particularly mental illness, with long-term effects up to 6 months. A clear definition of JITAIs and decision rules, research on long-term effects and careful selection of control conditions are needed.

Even short intervention periods of less than 6 weeks increase the longevity of the effects. JITAIs/EMIs are probably more effective in symptom reduction than in increasing positive PWB. Control group selection (eg, waitlist vs alternative intervention comparator) significantly influences effect sizes, urging adherence to frameworks like the Pragmatic Model for Comparator Selection or Purpose-Guided Trial Design to standardise definitions and reduce trial heterogeneity. HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY Decision rules for interventions were systematically coded in this review. Future systematic reviews should build on this to clarify which types of support influence the effectiveness of interventions. The findings support the further development of JITAIs/EMIs, suggesting that these technologies could complement therapeutic measures in the treatment of mental health conditions. JITAI/EMI components for improving PWB should be explored and refined. Background Currently, half the world’s population is projected to experience at least one mental disorder by the age of 75, 1 2 flourishing 3 4 5 6 7 Yet, diverse terminology and frameworks are employed across the various disciplines involved in mHealth research. Frameworks such as ‘Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention’ 8 9 8 6 8 9 8 Although prior reviews have examined JITAIs/EMIs or have employed broad definitions of smartphone-based interventions, 10 6 11 12 12 Our review advances prior meta-analyses by (1) coding interventions as JITAIs or EMIs, (2) modelling duration-dependent outcome decay to quantify intervention longevity and (3) systematically comparing effects by control group type—each representing a novel contribution to the digital mental health literature. Following the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, outcome) framework for research questions in systematic reviews, 13 RQ1 (effectiveness at post-intervention): In adults with or at risk for mental health concerns [P], what is the effectiveness of JITAIs and EMIs [I] compared with various control conditions [C] in improving mental illness symptoms and psychological well-being [O]? RQ2 (longevity and duration-dependent effects): Among adults [P] receiving JITAI/EMI [I], what is the longevity and duration-dependent effect of these interventions on mental illness and psychological well-being outcomes [O] at various follow-up time points? RQ3 (differential effects on outcomes): Among adults [P] receiving JITAI/EMI [I], do these interventions differentially affect mental illness symptoms versus psychological well-being [O]? Study selection and analysis Search strategy and selection criteria This systematic review and meta-analysis is registered with the Open Science Framework 14 15 online supplemental table 1 online supplemental appendix 3 In line with the PICO framework, 13 6 8 Coding and data collection Data extraction followed a structured protocol, collecting information on (1) study characteristics (first author, publication year and design); (2) sample characteristics (clinical characteristics, age, gender, total sample size (N), type of control condition, and sample sizes at post-intervention in both the intervention and control groups); (3) outcome characteristics (primary/ secondary outcome, selected mental health outcome and outcome measure); and (4) intervention characteristics (intervention technique, training type (JITAI or EMI; with or without treatment as usual (TAU)), decision rule, intervention period, and time point of a follow-up measurement if present). We extracted pre-post and intervention-control measures for the meta-analysis. For each study, we included one outcome to avoid double-counting participants. 16 online supplemental table 2 Quality assessment The Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for Randomised Trials (RoB 2) 17 17 Data analysis The standardised mean difference, defined as the adjusted Hedges’ g, was used as an estimate of the effect size. 18 18 19 2 2 2 2 20 Patient and public involvement Patients and members of the public were not directly involved in the planning, conduct or analysis stages of this systematic review and meta-analysis. Findings The search identified a total of 989 publications, which were downloaded and entered into a literature management program (Zotero, V.6.0.37). If the full text was not accessible, only the abstract was initially saved. Of the total 989 publications, 44 duplicates were removed, and the number of studies was reduced to 100 by reviewing titles and abstracts. In the last step of study selection, full texts have been screened of the remaining 100 publications, whereby a further 77 studies were excluded due to the exclusion criteria outlined in the PRISMA flow chart ( figure 1 online supplemental appendix 5 Figure 1 PRISMA flow diagram for study inclusion Note: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses flow diagram of study selection and inclusion.

The judgement ‘L’=low risk of bias indicates minimal risk; ‘S’=some concerns for bias indicates potential but non-severe weaknesses; and ‘H’=high risk of bias indicates serious methodological flaws likely to bias results. A study was rated ‘low risk’ if it was well designed and conducted, with no or minimal evidence of bias. ‘Some concerns’ indicate potential but not serious weaknesses in one or more domains. ‘High risk’ was assigned when serious methodological flaws were present that could materially bias results. These include major deviations from research standards such as lack of randomisation or unconcealed allocation. * D1: Bias arising from the randomisation process. † D2: Bias due to deviations from intended interventions. ‡ D3: Bias due to missing outcome data. § D4: Bias in measurement of the outcome. ¶ D5: Bias in selection of the reported result.

Conclusions and clinical implications This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the short-term and long-term effectiveness of JITAIs and EMIs for improving mental health and PWB across 23 studies (2018–May 2025). Findings show small benefits compared with control conditions (g=0.15), supporting their potential as accessible mental health tools. The effects varied by control group, with significant effects only for comparisons to alternative interventions (g=0.16), emphasising the need for careful selection of control conditions to ensure robust conclusions and mitigate placebo effects. 4 11 43 44 45 10 12 4 12 table 2 Table 2 GRADE certainty of the evidence summary Outcomes Anticipated absolute effects * Number of participants(studies) Certainty of the evidence (GRADE) Comments Difference Effect of JITAIs/EMIs on mental health SMD 0.15 higher 2045 (22 RCTs) ⨁⨁◯◯Low * † App-based JITAIs/EMIs probably improve mental health slightly.

There was heterogeneity in outcome measurement, a range of different scales were used across the studies to measure different dimensions of psychological well-being. EMIs, ecological momentary interventions; JITAIs, just-in-time adaptive interventions; RCT, randomised controlled trial. To advance understanding of digital mental health interventions, we adopted a holistic approach, targeting both mental illness and PWB—an approach previously employed by only one other meta-analysis. 12 8 et al. 46 JITAIs and EMIs are scalable tools for mental health, with sustained benefits emerging from interventions lasting up to 6 weeks, particularly for anxiety and depression. However, modest differential effects on PWB versus mental illness outcomes—and variability in control group responses—suggest underexplored mechanisms as implied by similar meta-analyses. 4 11 47 48 49 11 50 Supplementary material 10.1136/bmjment-2025-301641 online supplemental file 1 Acknowledgements The reviewers would like to thank all the authors that replied to our email requests regarding data and for answering our questions.
