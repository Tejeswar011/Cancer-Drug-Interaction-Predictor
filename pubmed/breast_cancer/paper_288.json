Here we demonstrate the use of recently developed recombinant affinity reagents, namely nanoyeast-scFv, in combination with alternating current electrohydrodynamic (ac-EHD)-induced shear forces, to enhance capture performance during protein biomarker analysis. The use of ac-EHD significantly improves fluid transport across the capture domain, resulting in enhanced sensor-target interaction and simultaneous displacement of nonspecific molecules from the electrode surface. We demonstrate this simple proof-of-concept approach for the capture and detection of Entamoeba histolytica n n Graphical Abstract  pmc-status-qastatus 0 pmc-status-live yes pmc-status-embargo no pmc-status-released yes pmc-prop-open-access no pmc-prop-olf no pmc-prop-manuscript yes pmc-prop-legally-suppressed no pmc-prop-has-pdf yes pmc-prop-has-supplement no pmc-prop-pdf-only no pmc-prop-suppress-copyright no pmc-prop-is-real-version no pmc-prop-is-scanned-article no pmc-prop-preprint no pmc-prop-in-epmc yes ",
